Not those gypsies you imagine seated comfortably , surrounded by their charms , scarves , incense , and whatnot , in dark little caravans . Nope , we had a psychic convention recently , where the Suncoast Casino hosts the seers who share their prophesies , generally once a year . <p> I 've just won a court case by default , long story I do n't intend reliving , but that does n't spell victory yet . The crook ran away to Australia because he 's married to an Australian woman . He did n't attending the court hearing . Anyway back at home , he was born South African , the court has issued a judgement against his name .

He must come back home to do that . Only after we get paid damages and costs , will I take that webpage down . That should make him come to his senses . But I need proof of that judgement to add on the website . I have n't done any research yet , perhaps I can pay the courts for a copy . As of right now my lawyer is submitting damages . Stupid man , since he was served by the sheriff of the court , interest at 10.5% is still compounding , that 's two and a half years and counting . <p> I had to begin with that part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychics .

On the other hand , psychic Irma , sometimes she hits the nail on the head . <p> When I first met Irma , known as ' Madam I ' , she asked what she was looking at , she saw me in wide open plains , flat lands , where she saw several 4x4 vehicles and I was in one . She was spot on about that , I had just paid to visit the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya . I 'd wondered if any of them would pick up on my trip . The rest of what she saw I ca n't recall .

I 'm not expecting any large sum of money so I 'm hoping it refers to this crooks settlement , because he has the funds to reimburse me . Well , time will tell . She also said she sees me visiting a European country , around Holland , or Holland itself . She said that I must just keep doing what I 'm doing , because that 's how a spirituality adept gent is gon na find me . He will pay for the flight and expenses . I told her that I 'm doing nothing these days , to which she motioned as if she was typing on a keyboard .

In closing , I have a casino card but seldom gamble , this time round I won and walked away with my winnings , which is most unusual . <p> Sometimes when you flip a coin it comes up heads too . They key to successful psychics is to keep it nebulous without getting specific and throw enough of them out there , that one of the bunch is likely to be interpreted to come through . The duped do n't focus on all the ones that did n't come true , but are convinced by the one that seemed to come true . <p> Yes Lady , he deserves Karma to bite his ass , he wrote the software of my program and then changed the code when he realised he could n't milk me for more money , with a website , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided before he changed the code and then afterwards .

I do n't miss Jabba the Hut or the night walks that became so frequent my mother had to guard me so I did n't take a hike without my pants .

Yes , I did that ........ did n't you ? <p> I had a terrible nightmare in the hospital . I was recovering from abdominal surgery and the dream was probably due to a combination of lingering anesthesia and the morphine pump . <p> In the dream , I was in a circular room . There were French doors all around . They were open and the white linen curtains were gently blowing in the breeze . The room was filled with red roses and their smell was almost overpowering .

Then , his eyes turned the color of the blood-red roses and he bit off the index finger of my left hand at the knuckle . <p> I woke up , soaked to the skin and bouncing like a red rubber ball on the bed . <p> Great blog Mister ! I imagined your naked hiney for a second ! When I was small I lovedt to take off all my clothes and run through the cornfield . Someone would invariably see me when I made that turn near the road and call the parents . Then it was butt tanning time .

@@37128431 @6128431/ <p> In December 2015 , nine months before the end of his presidency , Barrack Obama signed the Paris Accord . The United States did not . In order to ratify it as a treaty 2/3 of the Senate had to approve it . Obama told us it was not a treaty , but an executive agreement between himself and other nations . The Paris agreement was an agreement only with the Obama Administration , and an unratfied treaty in which case it had no effect . The Constitution 's separation of powers prevents the President from binding the country unilaterally . Our system does not divide authority into spheres controlled exclusively by the Senate , House and President . It requires combinations of offices to work together . <p> Obama 's counterparts in Paris knew he lacked the support to bind our country . In fact , they watered down the wording of the agreement to support Obama 's agreement that it does not require ratification . Examples : they changed the word " shall " to " should " in many places in order to avoid calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would bind the United States and the promise of an outgoing president . Any claims that Trump or the United States " is going back on its words " is disingenuous . Only Obama gave his word and the other parties in Paris helped design the agreement to throw our Constitution out the window . Obama ignored his constitutional duty to submit treaties to the Senate . In fact , a statement from the Obama White House said it all when the White House signaled it would bypass the Senate no matter what by saying " I think it 's hard to take seriously from some members of Congress who deny the fact that climate change exists , that they should have some opportunity to render judgement about a climate change agreement . " <p> Under the agreement Obama signed , the UN would have called the shots on what we did within our own borders to protect the climate . They would have also had the power to punish us through embargoes and trade agreements . Under Obama 's agreement , China , the world 's major polluters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not . India is hinging it 's participation on billions of dollars of foreign aid . <p> The agreement was less about the climate and more about other countries gaining financial advantage over the United States . This was a United Nations program that gave foreign leaders in Europe and Asia more say with respect to the United States economy then we do . It would have handicapped the United States economy - it was a deal that would have punished the United States , while imposing no obligations on the world 's leading polluters . China would be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants , but we can not , according to the agreement . India would be allowed to double it 's coal production by 2020 , but we have to get rid of ours . Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants , but we can not . <p> Obama 's requirements in the Paris Accord would cost the United States economy nearly $3 trillion . By 2040 our economy would lose 6.5 million industrial sector jobs including 31 million manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now supplies one-third of our electric power . It imposed unrealistic targets on the United States for reducing our carbon emissions , while giving countries like China a free pass . China , and many other nations , would actually be allowed to INCREASE emissions until 2030 . <p> Obama committed $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund - which is about 30 percent of the initial funding - WITHOUT being authorized by Congress . We are $20 trillion in debt , US taxpayers should not be paying to subsidize other countries energy needs . <p> The United States is already a Clean Energy and Oil &amp; Gas Energy Leader . We can reduce our emissions and continue to produce American energy without the Paris Accord . America has already reduced it carbon-dioxide emissions dramatically . The United States is the leader in oil and gas production . <p> For anyone that thought the Paris Accord was all about clean rivers and air , it is not and never was . <p> ExxonMobil does n't want President Trump to abandon the global climate agreement reached in Paris.America 's biggest oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an " effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change " and the U.S. should remain a party to it . <p> Exxon ( XOM ) said the country is " well positioned to compete " under the terms of the Paris deal , which was reached in late 2015 with the goal of slowing global warming . President Obama hailed the agreement as " the moment that we finally decided to save our planet . " <p> The Exxon letter was sent to the White House on March 22 , just days before Trump took a massive swipe at environmental regulations implemented under Obama . The administration had asked Exxon for its views on the Paris accord . Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to undo the Clean Power Plan , which aimed to slash carbon emissions by coal plans and other power utilities . Before taking office , Trump called climate change a " hoax " and blasted the Paris COP21 agreement as a " bad deal " for the U.S. However , after winning the election Trump told The New York Times he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he believes clean air and " crystal clear water " are important . <p> Related : Trump move wo n't bring back coal or mining jobs <p> Exxon has a complex and controversial history with climate change . The energy giant is being investigated for allegedly misleading the public and shareholders about what it knew about the dangers of climate change . But in 2007 Exxon admitted publicly that climate change poses risks and said it 's responsible to begin working on ways to reduce emissions . Exxon has also been a consistent public supporter of the Paris agreement . " We welcomed the Paris Agreement when it was announced in December 2015 , and again when it came into force in November 2016 . We have reiterated our support on several occasions , " Peter Trelenberg , Exxon 's environmental policy and planning manager , wrote to the White House . <p> Last month Exxon CEO Darren Woods , who replaced Rex Tillerson when he left to become Trump 's secretary of state , wrote a blog post saying the company is " encouraged " that the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address rising emissions . <p> Exxon noted in its letter to the White House that unlike the Kyoto Agreement , the Paris deal is the first major international accord to feature pledges from developed nations like the U.S. and developing ones like China . Exxon pointed out that China is the world 's leading greenhouse gas emitted and India is likely to pass the U.S. as No. 2 before mid-century . <p> Even though Trump is a climate change skeptic , his secretary of state and leading emissary on climate issues , does not appear to be one . During his confirmation hearing in January , Tillerson said he came to the conclusion years ago that " the risk of climate change does exist and the consequences could be serious enough that action should be taken . " But Tillerson ducked allegations that Exxon misled the public on climate change . He refused to answer repeated questions during the hearing about whether the company ignored internal research going back to the 1970s on the impact of burning fossil fuels . Earlier this month it emerged that Tillerson allegedly used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate change while serving as CEO of Exxon . <p> California has signed a cooperation agreement with China on clean energy technology , emissions trading and air pollution reduction in an effort to bridge the gap left by President Donald Trump 's decision to pull the US from the Paris climate accord last week . Under the pact , signed at an environmental tech summit in Beijing on Tuesday , California and China will work to develop and commercialize expertise on carbon capture and storage , clean energy and information technology to rein in pollution . " The challenges are big but so too is the commitment - the commitment of Jiangsu Province with California and China with the people of America . We 're going to get it done . Nothing will stop us , " said Governor Brown in a statement . " Green is not only gold , green is our future - China , California and America and the other countries of the world all working for the prosperity of the people . " <p> Obama was the perfect candidate for the no-fascist left ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their strategy is akin to the Trojan Horse approach . They put forward radical anti-American candidates dressed in the right skin color ( black ) or possessing the right genitalia ( female ) and then dare anyone to oppose them . Anyone who dares object to their dismantling of America is then attacked with relentless ridicule and harassment about racism and sexism . Any views that do n't comport with their anti-American agenda are summarily dismissed , shouted down , intimidated into silence or just plain met with violence . <p> How is this any different than what happened in Germany in the 1930s as Hitler rose to power or the ascent to power of Stalin and Lenin in the Soviet Union ? Both of these events started out exactly the same way , with the suppression and intimidation of any views that did n't comport with the official state view of the party in power . And it eventually led to some of the worst totalitarian states the world has ever known . <p> B. Hussein Obama is a radical Islamic terrorist . But unlike the overt Islamic terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islamic terrorist organizations all over the planet , he was a far greater threat to civilization because he was disguised as an American and he was in a position of power that allowed him to advance the interests of Islamic radicalism far beyond what all the other terrorists combined could have ever achieved . And so he did . <p> Had Hillary Clinton been elected , she would have finished the global destruction that Obama so capably began and the Islamic radicalization of the planet including the United States . <p> So as you do , I literally kiss the ground daily knowing that America is no longer in the clutches of these two civilization ending terrorists . I view the last election as proof that there really is a God in heaven . <p> Having said that , we are now engaged in a political civil war , if not a global world war .

Because of tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry , energy is relatively cheap versus the rest of the world and we have had little financial incentive nor the stomach for making improvements in efficiency , etc . <p> Even as the price of solar and other renewables has dropped to rates competitive to fossil fuels , we have not made the commitment to use them . Why ? Because the fossil fuel industry still holds enormous sway over the decisions made by the federal government . If you do n't think former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson 's fingerprints are n't all over Trump 's announcement , you 're kidding yourself . <p> Furthermore , Trump went out of his way to malign India in his speech .

The Courts , the leftist judges , the DOJ , the state department , our intelligence community ...... all the rats that are still in place will take time to rout out . And at every turn we see the obstruction from the democrats and the rats themselves further infecting this administration . Make no mistake , it 's the 2nd Civil War . <p> And here comes Bernie Sanders . Today 's announcement is that he will try to splinter the Democratic Party by building his own party . Now that is great news for the Party of No ...... it is now the Parties of Maybe !

Just wanted to not have quite so much " experience " showing on the roof - LOL . <p> To a woman , they all responded with how they felt that grey hair on a man is " distinguished " and that they found it attractive .

Some women can get by with grey hair also .. depends on the facial features and how their hair is styled . <p> I have been letting my hair grow more grey ... simply because I want to see how it will look now that it 's longer and still curly but not as much . One day I may decide to color it again . . who knows .. I do not place my value as a person on what color my hair is , so if I color it , it will be because I want another change <p> Spirit ..

@@37128452 @6128452/ <p> I truly believe black men are the best in bed . Listen ladies , I am a black man and I do n't think it has anything to do with his " thang " . We all know the myth of how very well endowed black men are . However , not every black man is " hung " , so let 's dispel that myth right now . What I am trying to say is , we have a unique way of transmitting information to the female gender . From the way we talk , walk , and move . When we come into an establishment we have a supreme sense of confidence ! You women may not always say it , but you like a man who can take control . Someone who is not afraid to say what 's on his mind . A man that can communicate with you , and keep your mental passages open . At the same time he can please you physically . <p> Let 's face it , we just have more verbal tactics than men of other races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level as we can . I am not just saying from a bias position , I actually have first hand experience . I once had sex with a white woman in college who had never had sex with a black man before . She was from a very small town in some " hick " place in Montana . Because she had never been exposed to black people , when she got to college and got a taste of the black culture , she literally lost her mind . When we had sex I made her climax over 30 times . I asked her what was the difference between a black man and a white man in bed ? <p> She told me that I had a very unique rhythmic motion . Just like I was dancing inside of her . She also said that black men are extremely confident and not afraid to approach a woman . This was an ultimate turn-on for her . I guess to sum it all up , ONCE YOU GO BLACK YOU NEVER GO BACK ! ! ! ! <p> When you grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being " best " in bed except maybe for your wife . Then , we 'll have to talk about where your wife has been ! However , it 's always good to see yourself as good . Just be careful of that woman who comes along and chops that ego down to earth . <p> It 's not a black or white thing . Some of us men know how to make a woman feel sensual &amp; erotic . It 's all about the passion and the hot desires , the soft touches &amp; kisses and the caressing of two bodies close together . The long periods of foreplay and the long hot wet french kisses . Sharing the passion &amp; hot desires for each other is what works . <p> oh by the way ....

Which can simply be defended by this blog of yours . <p> Are you bragging or complaining for you sure have one hell of an EGO problem . You do know whant an EGO is . <p> Study your history and you will find where the myth of black men in bed comes from . <p> During slavery black women and men were both bought by rich plantation owners . The men for the field work and women to take care of the men ; however , there were certain women bought for the pure sexual pleasure of the white men.The proof of this is all the different shades of color found in the black race and the black colleges.Not to be out done was the woman of the house of the plantation. she bought men and women to run the house . Again there were exceptions , some men were purchased by the size if their dicks ( let 's say it like it is ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many toys--a small salamie maybe.So while the man was out in the slave quarters raping 10 to 16 year old black women , the woman of the house was having adult parties with her selected purchased black men . Of course they got horney and just had to have some . <p> The problem here was when she was knocked up or caught--it was rape and of course the black slave was hanged or shot . <p> They said a white man would screw anything if some one held it 's head , so if cross breading between man and animal was possible we would see cows with men bodies or heads--the smae for pigs <p> But to think that to go black you never go back is a myth--it is just poor degenerate white women ( usually fat and ugly ) that can not find a degenerate Red Neck . <p> So , get a grip on it . <p> For you white people who hate blacks and do n't know why--well this was the reason--white women and their adult parties . <p> It 's not about sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone and lie to them as well as you . What it 's about for every quality woman I ever knew was feelings . And you 'll never understand that . Also , bigots come in all colors . <p> Well do n't really think its a black thing either , Latin men are very good in bed , and so are white men , I find its about the chemistry , and ones own passion , some men are very passionate about love making and strive to please the other partner at all cost , and when 2 people click the sex is great . <p> Gim me some of that pu .. y girl ..... i know you got it with you ..... ... that 's got to be the funnyest thing ive read on here in awhile ..... i wonder if that line works on women ? ...... .... cookie <p> MissionImpossible139 <p> Sep 2 @ 11:55PM <p> Dude I can make a woman climax without even touching her <p> Hey , I can make a woman climax while I 'm under my bus , with a wrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinley sittin on a pick axe talkin to me on my cell phone , asking for Pizza with Canadian bacon and extra cheese to be delivered on the back of a live moose and next to her is her mother who is putting on bright red lipstick getting ready to push the grand kids over the cliff . It 's really not that hard . You just need a little more experience . <p> Whatever happened to DO N'T BELIEVE THE HYPE .

Not sure if that can be done now or if you have to wait until the child is born.You also should talk with the father &amp; advise him to tell his wife , because if you go to establish paternity , it will get out in public.If you keep it quiet about who the dad is , start thinking about how you will soley support the child . <p> I do n't know if your state has " alienation of affection " laws , but I know some that have been won.I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slept with him.IF the wife finds out-which , no doubt she will , it may be possible for her to sue you . <p> I believe you have to wait until the child is born , they can do dna testing immediately .

Maybe for once ? You could put your now unborn child 's needs ahead of your own . <p> Everyone makes mistakes , but if you where dating a married man for over a year I kind of think you knew what you where doing &amp; it would n't fall into the mistake category . Unfortunately the child is the one who will pay the most at this point . <p> The laws are different in every state , so you should really speak to an attorney who would know the laws there . In some states his wife could actually take legal action against you since you knew he was married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states automatically give both parents joint custody of the child &amp; they do DNA testing at the childs birth to prove paternity . While the child is in the custody of the father you can not stop him from taking the child near his wife ( remember she still is his wife &amp; he is living with her ) he is allowed to do whatever he wants to with the child as long as it 's not endangering the child &amp; you ca n't stop him . I hate to scare you , but the father also has the right to reguest that the courts give him primary physically custody of the child ( perhaps on the grounds that he could provide a better home for the child-he is married &amp; his wife understands about the child &amp; is willing to accept it , he has a home , steady employment , etc . ) . These are all things you should have thought about BEFORE you slept with a married man , especially if you where having unprotected sex . At this point the best advice i could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion .... Obtain an attorney now ! ! ! Something to consider and of course your attorney shall discuss this with you , if the married man you 've been seeing has the ways as well as the means and the DNA provides conclusive evidence that he is in fact the father , a child custody case maybe in the offing . <p> An example ; Some women that are " in the system " never relinquish the name of the actual father . They may lead DHS or Child Support Recovery and courts in directions where in fact DNA is requested as well as required via court orders per an attempt to establish paternity . This may include men that she has slept with but also men that she is sure is NOT the father . When the DNA test is returned as non conclusive the subject is off the hook per child support . <p> Why would a few women do this that are on state assistance ? To insure they have a " meal ticket . " If the biological father is not located then a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some know and understand where and when paternity is established and in the event the father is gainfully employed , fully responsible and a good citizen that he may desire to obtain an attorney and file a child custody action . <p> We have handle cases on both sides such as these through out the years .

@@37128471 @6128471/ <p> Been a busy , snowy , and COLD week or two up here . And yes , for anyone wondering , I 'm more than ready for Spring to get here ! ! ! ! It 's been a deadly 24 hours on the roads here in Michigan because of the weather . On the local news they have reported 3 accidents this morning because roads were ice covered , and one was a fatal crash on Southbound I-75 when a truck spun off the expressway and hit a tree . Here is a picture of that crash : <p> The " shine " seen on the roads is ice . The speed limit on that stretch of I-75 is 70 mph , but from what I understand , most were driving at 45 mph this morning ... and even that proved to be too fast . And roads have been like this off and on almost daily for the past couple of weeks .

This one is Gorgon ( yes , that is the correct spelling ) and it will slide about 75 miles into the gulf before it stops <p> I 'll be the first to admit that I HATE driving in any sort of snow or ice . I 'll do most anything to avoid it . Occasionally we will get a little snow in my area and it is usually a disaster ( I do n't live in the mountains where they get quite a bit more snow ) .

The worst of them was our 2nd baseman who had no hits in 3 games and made 6 errors in the field . We had no extra guys as 10 of the teammates were not there for various reasons .

@@37128479 @6128479/ <p> I am a nice , caring , open-minded single white male who wants a long term relationship that would eventually lead to marriage . I am not interested in one night stands . I prefer women who are bisexual or bi-curious , but it is n't a requirement . However , if you are totally straight and plan to remain that way forever no matter what without exceptions , then we probably would not be a good match . Also it does not necessarily mean I want 3-somes ( some women write me and complain they do n't want a guy who wants 3-somes , but I can live without 3-somes , so no worries there . However if a woman wanted me to be open to 3-somes , I might be open to that idea ) , one woman is all I really need . I work out on a regular basis . Some of the things I like are : cuddle with a special someone on the couch watching movies ( fantasy and sci-fi are my favorite ) or t.v. , Horses , big dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently playing Runes of Magic , Perfect world ) , work out , websurfing , reading ( mostly fantasy novels such as novels by J.R.R. Tolkein ) , going for walks , fantasy roleplaying games ( such as Ars Magica ) , biking . Those are the basics . I 've always been the shy type , but the more I get to know you , the more I open up and the less shy I am . I 've also been dealing with social anxiety and depression , but hope to overcome it someday ( I tried different prescription drugs and the side effects were real bad and they did n't seem to help much anyway ) . It has been really tough for me here since I moved away from virginia ( where I lived all my life ) to Kentucky .

Update : I am married now , so just looking for good friends <p> I 'm open to suggestions and pretty flexible on this , but if a woman wants me to decide , that 's fine too . P.S. I do have a picture that I can send by e-mail . Why did n't I post it here ? Because if family or relatives saw my picture on here and realized this was my ad , and then saw the part where I said I like bi women ( they are very religious ) , they would get upset about it and it could ruin my relationship with them and I would like to stay on good terms with them if possible . Also I need to say that I am the type of guy who cares more about what a woman is like on thinside and how she treats me rather than caring about her looks . P.P.S.

Also , a woman who 's not looking for a robin williams clone and who wo n't dump me if I ca n't make them laugh all the time .

@@37128485 @6128485/ <p> Ever take you children for immunizations and watch the nurse , use a syringe to draw out of a larger vial , the amount needed ? Ever wonder why , in a doctors office that no one worries about the vial becoming contaminated ? Because of the preservative , Thimerosal , it does n't . Any germs , bacteria or viruses , exposed to the thimerosal preservative dies . And your children may , too . Thimerosal is the preservative used by vaccine manufacturers , and banned in every country , except our own ! Eli Lilly and Company in the late 1920s and early 1930s began using it as the preservative against studies results . Thimerosal , 49.6 percent mercury by weight , is metabolized or degraded into ethylmercury and thiosalicylate . Mercury , or more precisely , ethylmercury , is the principle agent that kills contaminants . The Department of Defense classifies mercury as a hazardous material that could cause death if swallowed , inhaled or absorbed through the skin . Studies indicate that mercury tends to accumulate in the brains of primates and other animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been linked to cardiovascular disease , autism , seizures , mental retardation , hyperactivity , dyslexia and many other nervous system conditions . That 's why the FDA rigorously limits exposure to mercury in foods and drugs . Some common sources of mercury include dental amalgam fillings , various vaccines and certain fish contaminated by polluted ocean waters . <p> Eli Lilly and Co. not liking the results of the FDA study , hired an independent company to do a new study . In 1930 , the company hired it 's own doctors to perform thimerosal experiments in Indianapolis City Hospital , on meningitis patients during a break out there . Findings from that study , still quoted in the company 's brochures as recently as 1990 stated that " thimerosal of a very low order of toxicity .... for man . " Andrew Waters , who is involved in a lawsuit against Eli Lilly , claims that most critical studies on the toxicity of thimerosal were suppressed by the company until now . <p> Since 1999 , the number of immunizations rose to 12 to 15 per child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thimerosal . One 1999 study revealed that some infants , due to a genetic or developmental factor , lack the ability to eliminate mercury . Trace amounts of mercury in these infants , when accumulated over several vaccines , could pose a severe health risk . Some vaccines , such as vaccines for hepatitis B , contained as much as 12.5 micrograms of mercury per dose . That 's more than 100 times the EPA 's upper limit standard when administered to infants . <p> Statistical evidence links thimerosal with nervous system disordersIn June 2000 , federal officials and industry representatives were assembled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss the disturbing evidence . According to Tom Verstraeten , an epidemiologist who had analyzed the data on the CDC 's database , thimerosal appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism and other neurological disorders . Verstraeten told those at the meeting that a number of earlier studies indicate a link between thimerosal and speech delays , attention-deficit disorder , hyperactivity and autism . <p> FYI : Though a direct link has been made between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been imposed from the CBC or EPA for any immunizations to removed or replaced , even though , the lot numbers , dates and distribution is known . These can be replaced for FREE , no charge to the doctors offices or agencies ! The manufactorer when asked if they are still shipped aboard to countries that have not banned them yet , Yes they are still being used , though banned in most major countries . Why ? Cost . The companys will deal with those countrys as new regulations are made in them .

You can adjust the temp and they come with a remote . <p> I do n't know the make or model but the cat rescue just got some heaters that will automatically turn off if knocked over . They had heat lamps , but apparently these little heaters are much better at keeping the cats warm . <p> Most space heaters are rated at 1,500 watts which is the limit for a 15 amp circuit breaker . Typical circuits - lighting and receptical are protected by a 15 amp or 20 amp breaker . The circuit breaker is designer to protect the wire insulation ( plastic or rubber material ) around the electrical carrying conductor from heating up and melting , which could either end up causing a fire or short circuit . It is important for you to know that only qualified people should service the electrical panel ( breaker box ) or fuse box . If a larger breaker or fuse value happens to substituted and used in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch fire by defeating protective features before they trigger safety.Regarding all electric heaters : Space , baseboard , central heating , etc .... A special calculation or service factor must be included when sizing the wiring and circuit breaker or fuse . A 1.5 x multiplication factor " must " be added to all circuit used for 3 of more continuous hours . <p> So let 's look at an example of a " Space " portable heater in use .... The Name Plate on heater indicates the following LONG ... VAC ( or 110VAC ) depending on the source from your utility transformer.1,500 W <p> Ohm 's law for electrical calculations ..... Power/ Voltage = Amperage <p> 1,500 Watts / 120 Volts = 12.5 amps <p> 0r <p> 1,500 Watts / 110 Volts = 13.63 Amps <p> Since heaters are assumed by the National Electric Code ( NEC ) to be used 3 or more hours continuously we must apply the 1.5 X factor to the Amps.

Depends on what type of specific antibodies you 're speaking of and how your immune system responds to them . <p> Apparently , though ( and this is just what i 'm interepreting from what I 've read and I 'm definitely no medical professional so this is just how I grasp the subject , with my limited knowledge of the subject ) , what happens to cause the familiar reaction we get from contact with poison ivy is not from the poison ( urishiol ) itself ; it 's from the antigen ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. ) .. the immune system kicks in and destroys that " invader " antigen and , subsequently , the cells as well . <p> So , if you have a very strong autoimmune system , you 'll get a much worse reaction because it 's going into overdrive and destroying even healthy tissue . That 's what causes the rash , the itching , the blisters , the swelling , etc . <p> And so that 's why they say people with HIV/AIDS do n't typically react to PI , because their autoimmune system is so weak that it does n't fight the antigen at all , because there 's no need to . <p> That 's the premise behind every allergy , I think . It is n't the substance that causes us to have the reaction ; it 's our bodies and our levels of histamine and the way our immune system reacts to it . <p> I know that 's not a very succinct way of explaining it and reduces it to its simplest terms .. but .. well , anyway , i think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poison oak are complicated by myths , conflicting reports and ongoing controversies among authorities . Sensitization depends on the chance meeting of a special effector T-cell ( with correct receptor site ) and the poison oak allergen--a painful biochemical rendezvous.You may not have effector T-cells with the special receptor for urushiol--or perhaps your relatively few effector T-cells with precise poison oak receptor may never encounter the urushiol allergen . The allergen may be absorbed and degraded before the T-cells find it . If the truth is known , most people will probably experience some degree of dermatitis if a sufficient quantity of urushiol is thoroughly rubbed into their skin . You may even be sensitized by a white blood cell transfusion from a sensitized person . Immunity to poison oak with age , exposure and homeopathic remedies may involve suppressor T-cells which inhibit or block the action and reproduction of other T-cells . Circulating IgG immunoglobulin antibodies that block the T-cell receptor for urushiol may also be involved ( Stampf et al , 1990 ) . <p> Since the HIV virus attacks helper T-cells , persons afflicted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-cell ) immunity .

I said that according to articles I 've read , the worse you react to poison ivy shows that you have a strong your immune system . That 's not the same thing as saying your immune system is weak if you do n't break out from poison ivy . <p> That 's why people with HIV AIDS rarely ( according to the article ) react to the poison ivy , because it 's the body 's immune system 's fighting the invading antigen that causes the rash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are some excerpts that help to explain it a bit further . I think it 's pretty interesting . I wish they 'd find a way to keep people from reacting to it , because I love being outdoors and in the woods , etc. , but I 'm taking a huge risk , even with exercising caution . <p> " UrushiolUrushiol is a mixture of catchol derivatives . The major catechol on poison ivy leaves is pentadecylcatechol . If urushiol is washed off the skin within an hour or so , the reaction can be largely prevented . However , if left on the skin , some diffuses through the skin , where it is metabolized to quinone derivatives . These form covalent complexes with skin proteins such as keratin . These complexes appear foreign to the immune system , which therefore attacks them . " <p> " Poison ivy ( oak and sumac ) leaves contain a sap with a mixture of chemicals called urushiol . When people get urushiol on their skin , it causes an allergic contact dermatitis . This is a T cell-mediated immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body 's immune system recognizes as foreign , and attacks , the complex of urushiol-derivatives with skin proteins . The irony is that urushiol , in the absence of the immune attack , would be harmless . " <p> " Delayed HypersensitivityAllergic inflammations , also called hypersensitivities , are caused by three underlying mechanisms . The one which is responsible for the reaction to poison ivy is called delayed hypersensitivity . <p> Delayed hypersensitivity does not start to be noticeable until several hours to a full day after exposure to the antigen . It may last for over a week . T lymphocytes recognize the foreign substances , usually after the antigen is eaten , degraded , and presented ( in pieces ) by so-called antigen-presenting cells such as Langerhans cells in the skin , or macrophages . Urushiol metabolites are presented by this and other mechanisms . The T lymphocytes pour out inflammatory signal substances called cytokines . These call in armies of white blood cells called monocytes , which become macrophages . The macrophages become activated by the cytokines and attack everything in the vicinity , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good example is the skin reaction to injected tuberculosis antigen . In fact , when tuberculosis bacteria infect the lung , it is the delayed hypersensitivity against them which destroys the lung . Although delayed hypersensitivity is responsible for the reaction to poison ivy , here , for comparison , is a brief introduction to the other two mechansims of hypersensitivity . Immediate hypersensitivity occurs within minutes of exposure to the foreign substance , also called the antigen . Hay fever or allergic rhinitis is an example . Some people also have immediate hypersensitivity to bee stings , and this can be life threatening if not treated immediately . Immediate hypersensitivity occurs when the body produces a special kind of antibodies , called immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) , to the antigen . Mast cells and basophils bind the IgE on their surfaces . When antigen binds to ( and cross-links ) the IgE , these cells pour out vasoactive amines , such as histamine . It is these vasoactive amines which cause the inflammation . Antihistamines are usually an effective treatment for localized reactions . <p> Complement-dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antigen ( more slowly than immediate hypersensitivity , but faster than delayed hypersensitivity ) . It usually starts when the most common kind of antibody , immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) , reacts with the antigen . This triggers a complement reaction . ( Complement is a series of blood proteins which aid in defense against microorganisms . ) This in turn brings in white blood cells ( especially neutrophils ) which attack everything , and can cause severe tissue damage . An example of this kind of reaction is serum sickness , which occurs after a foreign antiserum or other protein is injected . Other examples are a reaction to a large injection of penicillin ( penicillin depot ) or to inhaling plant dusts over a long period of time ( " Farmer 's lung " ) . Complement-dependent inflammations require a relatively large amount of antigen ( milligrams ) . In contrast , immediate and delayed responses can be severe even with tiny amounts of antigen ( micrograms ) . "

My biggest thing was not pushing him into a rage - as awful as it was to have this man all over me - I had to stop myself from burst out laughing . So I survived and let him do whatever he needed to get off - thankfully he was done in less than 5 minutes . And with him getting what he needed , it was easy to get him out my house . <p> When he texted me the next day ... all he got was a message to stay away from me , that I never want to see him again .

Actually dated two fellas who could not believe that I did n't want sex with them -- no woman had ever turned them down . The worst was a black fella - I had a headache within 15 minutes trying to understand what he was saying .

His wife left him while they were having their dream home custom built . <p> The guys who are taller , muscular and handsome ( pretty boys ) are a bit full of themselves and just expect a gal to jump them . <p> Not everyone is perfect and the world is full of jerks as you point out .

We get to view a snippet of someone else 's experience through their eyes in an image . <p> But I wonder , what if we could photograph an image of the emotions we feel towards others ? I 'm not talking about the look on our faces , but more the actual emotion and why certain people evoke intense feelings . <p> What I find fascinating is our opinions and how invested in them we become . What are opinions ? Beliefs based on experiences which colours how we view the world . This is why I find politics so inane and the fighting here about as intelligent as inanimate objects .

They both were survivors of the Holocaust , but lived lives filled with love from then onward . <p> Lilly grew up on a middle class farm in rural Hungary . At age 16 , she and her family were imprisoned by Nazi soldiers for extermination . Within days , she , her sister and cousin were lined up at a rail station in Budapest with thousands of other young Jewish women . Heindrich Himmler and Adolf Eichman , happened to be presiding over this particular debarkation . Dozens of German SS thugs pointed their machine guns at young women as orders were being shouted out in German , a language that very few understood .

Like a miracle , near the end of the war , they were part of a small group of surviving teenage girls transferred to a factory in Germany making munitions . Virtually , everyone else in Auschwitz either were murdered or died of disease . The owner of the factory was not a Nazi and treated the girls well . They all survived .

All of Harry 's friends were overjoyed that they were going to build roads instead of dying on some frigid Russian battlefield . Harry smelled a rat ! At the first possible chance , he escaped a road detail and joined the partisans . All of his friends were executed by the Nazi 's a few days later . At the end of the war , the partisans jubilantly welcomed the Russian soldiers as saviors . However , within days , Jewish partisans were separated from Gentile partisans .

My grandma Lily died before I was born . She past away when my mother was pregnant with my sister , Rivka . <p> I want to thank whoever posted this wonderful story about my grandparents.I will be sharing it with family members .

@@37128497 @6128497/ <p> One of the best kept secrets of the modern age is that President Kennedy , a Democrat , usually remembered by historical revisionists as a " liberal " was actually one of the most fiscally conservative presidents ever to hold the office . In fact , he was so conservative , that he was actually the father of the distinctly conservative economic doctrine that later came to be known as " supply side economics " or less flateringly " trickle down economics . " <p> But wait ! Was n't Ronald Reagan the father of supply side economics ? Was n't it Reagan , who is widely recognized by both liberals and conservatives as the iconic conservative of the modern age , who first came up with supply side economics as the best method of stimulating a sick economy . It was indeed Reagan who institutionalized supply side economics and branded it as part of his central theme . But no , it was in fact JFK , who first clearly understood the power of this policy to create widespread prosperity for all Americans and used it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as conservative as it gets . He believed that lower taxes , less debt , less government spending and more money staying in the hands of private citizens and private enterprise is the way to create more jobs and economic prosperity for the most people in America . The record is crystal clear . He clearly said so many times in both interviews and speeches such as the ones in the videos I posted below . JFK was a staunch economic conservative . <p> It 's ironic ( and perhaps a bit humorous and pathetic ) that so many liberals refer to President Kennedy as back up for their liberal economic views . They point to the great prosperity of the mid and late 1960s and credit it to Kennedy 's liberal economic policies . And of course , we are bombarded with propaganda from the main stream media that perpetuates this half truth and historical revisionism in the minds of all who are ignorant of the facts . <p> The half that is true is that there was a surge in prosperity for virtually all Americans because of Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie is that it was liberal economic policy that created that surge . In fact it was Kennedy 's supply side massive tax cut -- the largest single tax cut in the post World War II era -- the quintessentially CONSERVATIVE fiscal policy -- that created that prosperity . From an era of sluggish growth , flagging prosperity and high unemployment , JFK forged a nation of meteoric growth , unprecedented prosperity and a booming job market -- all as a result of his CONSERVATIVE doctrine of supply side economics . His was the OPPOSITE of liberal high tax , big government spending economics . <p> JFK 's economic beliefs were the polar opposite of today 's liberal fiscal doctrine . There is no doubt he would be sickened by Obama 's high tax , big government spending , massive national debt policies . And there is no doubt that JFK 's policies worked a whole lot better too . As did those of Reagan and G.W. Bush who both followed in Kennedy 's conservative footsteps to institute supply side tax cuts of their own . <p> On this occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisionism , it is important to reacquaint ourselves with the truth about his legacy . <p> These are some of the most interesting videos I have seen in some time . After watching them , it should remove any doubt you may have that JFK was , in every detail , a strong believer in conservative supply side economic doctrine . He was the father of Reaganomics . <p> Tax Cuts and National IncomeContrasting the size of the tax cuts with national income shows that the Kennedy tax cut , representing 1.9 percent of income , was the single largest first-year tax-cut of the post-WW II era . The Reagan tax cuts represented 1.4 percent of income while none of the Bush tax cut even breaks 1 percent of income . The Kennedy tax cuts would only have been surpassed in size by combining all three Bush tax cuts into a single package . <p> Tax Cuts and Budget ResourcesComparing the size of these tax cuts with the federal budget shows that the Kennedy 's tax cuts represented 8.8 percent of the budget . In 1981 , Reagan 's tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush 's tax cuts are smaller than Reagan 's " EGTRRA ( 3.8 percent ) , JCWA ( 2.5 percent ) and the 2003 Tax Cut ( 1.8 percent ) . When the Bush tax cuts are combined ( 8.1 percent ) , they would be larger than Reagan 's tax cut , yet smaller than Kennedy 's tax cut . 
@@37128498 @6128498/ <p> I just chuckled as I read the results of ranking for a triple event archery shoot.I am running in first place in the women 's category .... okay , there is only two of us in that category and the other is a 20 something young gal . <p> Now the background was a few years when I was working away from the city in a small town , one of my co-workers and his family are involved in archery . Yes , they do it for hunting as well . They shoot compound bows -- that 's those smaller ones that have pulleys , sights and all sorts of things to add onto it . <p> I remember first learning , standing in a gym with the archery 's club compound and sheesh , I used to get smacked on my foreman after releasing the arrow . It was brutual because my hands and arms were n't that strong back then . I had repetitive strain injury from decades of working on the computer . <p> To say it was humbling to look down at this cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " it 's okay , with practice you 'll get it " . And there was days that my foreman was bruised nearly from wrist to inside of my elbow . I learned to wear thick pullover on my arms . Years later , I finally gave in and bought myself a double layer leather forearm protector . I shoot better and do n't get whacked as much , but it does still hurt . The irony is when I shot a bulleye 's is when I got smacked -- really hard because I locked my left hard straight for stabilising which is a no - no . Suppose to have a slight bend , so that do n't get smacked . <p> When I moved back to the city , I bought myself a recurve bow , that 's the tall one ... at least 5 feet tall . Mine is made of fiberglass and metal , one piece . The hard part of a recurve is that I have to take the string off and on , each time I used it . There is a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other end this piece of rubber that goes on the bow . Bend over with the bow until it hits the floor , then step on the cord with both feet about 1-2 feet apart and then pull up on the bow , flexing it to bend downwards to slide the string off one notched edge . It takes a bit of strength . So this part makes it much tougher than a compound bow . <p> The reason I went to recurve - barebones ( no sights , no stablizer ) is so that I could compete where it is mostly about my ability as an archer rather than trying to compete with someone who spends $3,000 on a compound versus $100+ for my recurve bow . <p> It takes 25 hours of practice to learn on a recurve what takes 1 hour on a compound because of the sighting . <p> I have a very long way to go to get better , especially when my hands hurt . Oh well , I will put on my braces at night and I 'll get better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pulling weeds that has my hands flare up . Pushing weights in the gym .. no problem . And absolutely forget sewing for more than 5 minutes .... holding something that tiny between my fingers ..... ca n't do that anymore . <p> Okay , back to archery ..... So a couple of weekends ago , I went to my first archery competition . Because I knew that my hands were an issue , I did n't even use the warm up targets for shooting . Would n't make a difference for the wind in the 3D shoot because the practice targets were in the open and the rounds were in the bush . Those rather disgusting that canker worms are out and we were having to pick them off ourselves . <p> Worst part was I had to be like a bear and well you know what in the woods .... .... I think that was only the 2nd time in my life ...... <p> Well I guess it was worth it , otherwise I would have forfeit . All I know , I will always carry toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until finished shooting 4 more targets . <p> Yesterday , I dropped into the archery place and got my string checked for tightness because totally lost my shoot for last 6 targets . Will see what happens this weekend because it the strings stretches too much .... then I will get a different type of string on it .... <p> So I do n't just try different things ..... I actually choose the hardest version .... <p> just a bit of mind wandering there ... <p> Oh yeah , got some arrows done with custom fletching ( looks like feathers on the end ) Neon Yellow and Pink ..... so that when shooting outside and overshoot target that can find in the grass .... <p> The young gal had brown fletching and she lost two of her arrows ... at $20 per arrow , that gets expensive . <p> My bow is strictly for target and 3D shooting - the draw weight is only 34 lbs . In the past when I lived in the country , I raised my own meat .... beef , chickens , turkeys ..... they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I lived on , the deer were never hunted - I used pay a farmer to bring me a huge alfalfa round bale in the fall for the deer to eat through the winter . <p> And it was always great to see the doe with her little one or twins eating grass outside my kitchen window in the mornings . <p> so just one of many things that I 've been doing to cross off things on my bucket list ... <p> taken so many lessons <p> belly dancing vocal drumming boxing flying archery <p> I do so love shooting archery ...... I 'll be doing this for the years to come <p> The weight training in the gym over the last two years has given me better upper body strength to draw the bow more fully . <p> Though once in a while ... I do scamper over the amusement place during the day and have the whole track to myself on a high speed go-kart race track .... <p> I only know that archery can kill you if you do n't know what you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . I did think of belly dancing but have n't got that far and drumming would be a great idea . I 'd like to learn to play the piano but methinks I 'm too old . Maybe in my next life . 
@@37128499 @6128499/ <p> Okay , my best friend and roommate has recently started dating my ex boyfriend ... I 've tried to be cool with it , but it 's really bugging me . He knows it bothers me , and has said he was " trying to be considerate of my feelings " but I do n't really think calling her and talking to her and asking what she 's wearing and telling her " oh i missed you so much , your always on my mind " when I 'm sitting 2 feet away is really considering my feelings . I 'm REALLY trying to be cool with it , and I do n't want to say anything to Nicole because she seems to like him , but is n't there like some " female code " that dating your best friend AND roommates ex goes against or something ? She 's never had a boyfriend , and she seems to like him , and so I do n't want to be the one to ruin something potentially good for her , but I do n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be with him , and I want both of them to be happy , but it really bothers me to hear him talk about how he missed her and how beautiful she is , and how he thinks about her all the time , especially considering like 2 weeks before they met he was telling me about how he missed me and wanted to get back together with me .. I duno what to do about myself ... Should I say something to them ? Just deal with it ? What the heck . I know you 're probably going to say I 'm being jealous , and I do n't know why I 'm jealous . I do n't like him , and I REALLY do want her to be happy , I just , it really bugs me and I do n't know why . What the heck do I do ? <p> i had a girlfriend do that to me shortly after high school , and it hurt . It strained our friendship horribly . On one hand , you could sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad.On the other , he 's your ex , so you do n't have much control over it . <p> I do n't think your being jealous you just have not let yourself heal as of yet ..... I myself and my friends do believe in the Ladies rule out of respect . .. Never Ever Date ..... someone I have dated ... ... it 's out of courtesy ........ and then makes you wonder ..... if there was something going on behind the scenes all along we just never do it .. ..... and if you are feeling ok and do n't have feelings for him and want them to both be happy then ......... maybe you just need to sit down as you never got to say some last words to clear the air between the 2 of you ....... the final word . .... but if he was saying those things to you just 2 wks ago maybe he is trying to get at you ...... alittle bit ...... out of respect if he cared enough about you he would not do that ......... just my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let it all out how you are feeling an I think you will find truths and then be able to let it go ....... if it 's getting to you .. it means you still care and I would too as it 's only been 2 wks ago ....... I hope that you can resolve the issue ... <p> Do n't think you are just being jealous . If you are best friends , she should consider your feelings and tone it down around you . I am not saying she should quit seeing him if she really likes him but should ask him to not be so rude when it comes to you . If she does n't see that this bothers you , she must not be paying attention . You can see it in someone 's face pretty quickly . Maybe just bring it to her attention that all though you want nothing more than to see her happy , it does bother you when he flaunts it in front of you . <p> Adrifter <p> Oct 10 @ 7:26PM <p> you 'll be alright .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life <p> Mellajenn <p> Oct 10 @ 8:26PM <p> I think everyone on the comments pretty much covered it , I just ca n't believe a " best friend " would do that ... an x boyfriend .. ya , but not a best friend ... sorry ! And even if you feel like you do n't  want him anymore. , i think it is perfectly normal to feel jealous and even hurt ... cut yourself some slack , neither of them are thinking about your feelings , that is for sure ! <p> Thanks for the comments guys , they really make me feel better about feeling so crappy about it . It does n't really bother me that they 're " together " what bothers me is the " oh i miss you too 's " and such . I do n't know . I guess it 's just not something that I 've ever heard from her , and I think being " intimate " like that is something that should be done between two people , not between three , know what I mean ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite some time , so I 'm completely over him , and I do n't know why it bothers me . I think part of it is that they 're closer in a couple days than we ever were , and they met through me , which is really " hindering " my acceptance , because I feel like I did this , it 's my fault that they 're together . I do n't know . I do n't really want to talk to them , I do n't want them to feel a strain , and I do n't want them to feel like I want them to break up , because if they make eachother happy , then fine . The " intimate " parts of it are just what bother me , and I do n't know why ... I duno ... <p> So here 's what happened . I decided to talk to him first . I mentioned it to him , and he FREAKS out ! Tells me how he 's sick of me , and how I 'm complaining , and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been him and I for a while and blah blah blah . So I close my computer , and go downstairs , to call my friend Mariah so I can just vent . It realllly ticked me off that he said that he 's sick of me complaining . He 's the one that said that if anything bothered me that I need to talk to them about it , so I did ! I TRIED ! And he freaked out . So Nicole comes down , and they both have blown it out of proportion now and are all " If you want me to break up with him/her I will , just tell me " which is NOT what I said at ALL ! All I said was that it bothers me when they 're all " oh I miss you " etc etc etc because I feel that 's something that needs to be shared between two people , not three , two of which are ex 's . So me and Nicole talked , and she thinks we 're good again , but we 're not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to say anything else . I already made her cry once tonight . It really bothers me that a guy is coming between us . I 'm sincerely going to try to not be bothered by it , but , I duno . I think I have reason , and rights to be ... but whatever . I do n't know where else to go with it except to blame myself and deal with it on my own because I obviously ca n't tell either of them about it . Argh ! I 'm really just in a crappy mood now . Oh well .

@@37128521 @6128521/ <p> After considerable study of an article about them in Playboy , and lengthy , though at times blurry , perusal of the pictures on the front of a condom vending machine in my favorite tavern , I decided to build the world 's ultimate French Tickler . <p> Being a starving student at the time , I had a very limited manufacturing capability , but undaunted , I proceeded to work to accomplish my goal . I was the proud possessor of a few cheap standard condoms , and though they were of considerable age , they had , sadly , not seen service . I figured I could dress them up a bit to make French delights . <p> I unrolled one onto a long thin glass bottle , the kind Alka Seltzers were sold in at the time . I had lots of those bottles , leftovers from self medication on Saturday and Sunday mornings , recovering from some rather formidable beer drinking sprees , that same beer probably being the reason the condoms were , alas , unused . But I digress . <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimbered a tube of a new , little known wonder substance , silicone rubber . It was a tube of aquarium cement I seem to recall , designed to stand up even to deep emersion . I knew that was important . If you just touched the tip of the tube to the condom and pulled it away quickly , it left a nice little rubber whisker , attached at the base , and tapering to a fine point at the end of its quarter inch length . Perfecto ! I decorated three condoms with multiple rows of little whiskers , and let them dry . It was difficult to roll them back up , but hey , it was a labor of love , and I did what I had to . I put them by my bed , to await deployment . Never did it occur to me that the original fine layer of powder on the condoms should have been removed . I was too enthralled with other , more amorous contemplations . <p> I had a friend Andrea , who was occasionally a lover . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought I would surprise her with the extraordinary stimulation of my new creations . We always used something to stave off unwanted parenthood , so she was completely unaware of my arming my middle leg with the home brew French tickler . She responded wildly , and we had a rather vigorous and lengthy frolic , although it surprised me that toward the end , she grew inured to the tickler 's stimulating effect . The evening passed very well , indeed . <p> Later , after I took her back to her dorm , I retired , weary with love 's labors . As I got into bed , I noticed some silicone whiskers in the sheets . Aha ! They fell off toward the end ! That is why her responses had mellowed . I changed sheets , and enjoyed , in sweet dreams , a reprise of our evening 's lovemaking . <p> All went well until several days later , when Andrea called , very much agitated .

Last year around this time I received an email from someone 3 provinces away , and we immediately clicked . Within a short time we met and soon after- were speaking of plans to live together . Unfortunately our plans fell through and we lost contact . This Christmas I received a card from him and almost instantaneously we began speaking to each other and igniting our spark that had yet to burn out but was slowly flickering to it 's end . We met again to see if our passion for each other was still as intense as it once was . It was n't ... it was more than that . It was indescribable . I know this will be the man to take my hand in marriage , and if not for this site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your help MD , if not for you this amazing , handsome , wonderful man might not have found his way into my heart !

On Nov. 1 , 2004 , I received a message from ' onewildride ' and decided to respond .

Boy , was I wrong ! I have been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly , they did not seem to draw people looking for something long term . I had only been on this site a few weeks when I got a comment posted on one of my photos that drew my attention . Little did I know that he would turn out to be the love of my life . I responded with an email to thank the kind cowboy from Oklahoma and that 's where I thought i would end ( since we live in different states ) . Instead , that 's where it all began ! We would email on the site for hours each night . After a couple weeks , we switched over to IM , then moved to the phone . We now talk to each other via IM and telephone every day , sometimes several times a day . We just ca n't get enough of each other . I was so blown away by this man that I even proposed to him ! I am planning on re-locating to Oklahoma from South Caroline later this year . I have found the man I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can not thank you enough !

We are true soulmates and are getting married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping to make our dreams come true . Iain <p> December 2006 I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how happy your website has finally helped me become . I suffer from major depression and could not find a motivator to help me fight it seriously . In the winter of ' 04/ ' 05 someone took a moment to respond to my profile even though he had reservations about my bisexual listing . After months of chatting online and over the phone , we finally got together to have our first date in late May of ' 05 . We moved in together in fall of ' 05 . With David 's help , I 've managed to suffer through finding meds that work for me and I see a therapist on a regular basis . He 's helped me so much to finally love myself and be happy enough to feel comfortable enough to finally accept his proposal . I tried so many of the free dating sites and even though I 've found a few new friends , I 've found the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lows and in the highs .

We exchanged emails over the following few weeks , and then , finally , the fateful first date . We still look back on that night as the night that changed both of our lives for the better . Now , we are in the midst of planning our wedding in May . We have both truly found our proverbial soulmates . Thank you , thank you , thank you Matchdoctor !

We started talking on the phone about a day later and we talk for hours . At the time I was living in North Carolina ( being in the Marine Corp , it 's hard meeting someone that is very compatible ) and she was in NY , so we talked practically every night for about 4-5 hours each night . She was , and has been since then on my mind all the time . We had so much in common , we did n't live that far away from each other so when I went back home on leave , I commuted 3 hours to go see her every weekend . Upon meeting her in person for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had met my soul mate . We are currently making plans for her to come move down with me in Arizona . Thank you very much !

Thank you Matchdoctor ! mollie197 <p> July 2006 I came to your site nearly 19 months ago and to be honest I did n't expect to find my true love on a " free " site , but what the heck , it was worth a try . I did specify that I did n't want to meet women who were n't born in Canada and they should also be from Quebec where I live . I did receive a few letters from women in other countries and replied to them that sorry , they did n't meet my requirements . Then a letter arrived from a lady from Nova Scotia , Canada , where I am originally from . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to MSN Messenger and since this lady was n't working at the time she decided after many letters that she would come to meet me in Montreal . We 've been together since her arrival nearly 19 months ago . In August , we will marry . We are both 57 years of age so for anyone who does n't think that they can meet their true love on Match Doctor , keep on trying , if it has n't happened for you yet . There is someone out there just waiting to meet you , I know and my wife to be as well . It happened for us.mysticalman4u <p> June 2006 Hello Matchdoctor .

We clicked right away , and found ourselves writing every day ... sometimes several times a day ! ( We used online translators to help communicate because she did n't know English , and I did n't know Russian . ) Finally after 6 months , I flew out to see her . It was pure magic ! It was as though we had always been together ! Coming back to America without her was the hardest thing I had ever done , but after 9 grueling months through immigration , she finally came home to me . We were married on February 25 , 2006 .

This Jan. the 22nd we will marry in a small country church with my children serving and my grandchildren . I am happy that I had this avenue of meeting my guy . I hope all the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 2006 Thanks to your site I met my match ! - We have only been together for 3 weeks , but neither of us have ever been happier. - We only live 4 miles from each other , and have been spending a lot of time together. - He is great with my kids , and they are crazy about him. - Also , it helps that he treats me like a queen ! - Like I said it 's only been 3 weeks , but after the holidays we are moving in together. - Thought it was crazy to try an internet personals site , but I tell you what. - If I never would have done it , I would n't have met Nupaman. - Now we both have a happy life together to look forward to ! - We just wanted to say thank you Matchdoctor.com ! Angellrizzen <p> January 2006 I would like to thank you for your excellent site . My nickname was mouse140172 , and I heard about you through word of mouth from my friend . I started using your service where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For sure that if it was not your site I would had never met my wife since we are from very far away countries but still we managed to build up a relationship , met several times in person and eventually got married a couple of months ago . Thank you again.Chris <p> January 2006 We would like to thank Matchdoctor for the wonderful site . We met in August and although we were both out of each others usual age range we decided ' what the heck ' and arranged a meeting . Right off the bat , we both knew had met someone special . Now as we approach Christmas we are in a terrific relationship , both kids are happy , and our families are meeting . It 's been a long time since we were this happy . We never though we would meet someone ' normal ' on a date site ( there are certainly some strange cookies out there , and a lot of lonely Russian 's looking formarriage ) . The search was worth while . We are looking forward to moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out there : Love will happen in the most unlikely places and at the strangest of times ! .. Dad22 says " Wearing pants to a first date is a good thing " .. Tequilababy agrees and also adds that " Teeth are a good thing to have in your head on a first date " . Seriously , a note to the men out there ... do NOT ask for a rub and tug on the first couple of dates ( T 's initial experience with Internet dating ) women will definitely not call you back no matter how funny you think you are . Be respectful and honest everyone , you may not have anything to lose but you have the world to gain.Dad22 <p> December 2005 I just wanted to let you know what you have done for me. - I have been using your site for about a month or so , and while on here I met several kind people that I considered dating. - I had my doubts from day one that a dating site could possibly find my one true love. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw a man named Matt. - He was pretty close to me so I decided to send him a wink. - The next day I logged on and noticed that I had received an email from him. - I opened that email and since then we have been closer than ever. - It was definitely love at first sight. - We are closer than ever and I just want to express my great gratitude to Match Doctor for helping me to find the love of my life. - I could n't have possibly done it without you.Jessica <p> December 2005 I have found my " once in a lifetime love " on this site . Her name is scorpiogirl36 . After fruitless searches on other sites I tried this one as a last ditch effort to find the love of my life . After several e-mails back and forth we decided to talk on the phone for the first time on Oct 29th. - Little did I know that this one conversation would change my life and feelings forever . I knew I had found someone very special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of my life with . I am incredibly in love with her . She is everything I have ever wanted in a partner . I know she is the one for me and I am going to marry her ! I can not think of spending another day without her as my partner , my wife and my best friend . I was very lucky in finding her on this site ! Finding the love of a lifetime is not only possible , it is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life ! I wish all of you the special love that I have found in scorpiogirl36 . Never give up ! yourmissinglink228 <p> December 2005 I have met the man of my dreams and it is all thanks to Matchdoctor.com . We met back in April of 2004 after talking online for a few months. - - I knew the moment i met him , he was the one ! ! ! After 1 year of dating and falling head over heals in love , he popped the question and we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiest day of my life , and i owe it all to you ! Melissa <p> December 2005 I just wanted to thank Matchdoctor . Back in March 2003 I started to email with someone from your site and we met in person in August 2003 for the first time . Well , long story short , we got married on St. Patrick 's Day of this year ! We never would have met had it not been for this site and how easy it was to access it . Neither of us ever expected that we would find someone from a dating site , but we did ! Dreo <p> November 2005 I met the woman of my dreams on Matchdoctor and things have never been better.We have been together since September and the relationship is going very well . We originally started talking on here in 2003 but never had the opportunity to get together until Sept. of this year . We are happy and do n't see that changing for a long time.Medic01 <p> November 2005 Tocools and I met because of MD message boards . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to see if he 'd join us , since he lived there at the time . The rest is history . That was 3 years ago and we have n't killed each other yet . But then , we have n't finished putting the new kitchen cupboards in , so that may change today ! I have to say that meeting my true love was not the only success from here . Most of my best friends I know because of the MD message boards . We started with a small get together of a few of the girls from here . We hit it off and that led to a larger gathering of people from all over the states in Reno . We had a ball . I still keep in touch with most of those original gatherers . We 've missed the message boards ! ! It 's great that they are back . : ) Lacey <p> November 2005 After a long time , seemed to be forever , looking for that special right one , I came to the internet as a last ditch effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real eye opener for those of us that are honest , down to earth , not pretensive sorts . I wound up meeting so many liars and people that pretended to be someone other than what they were , what ever that was is still a mystery to me . And of course there have been the obligatory theives . It is enough to crush those with high and unending hopes . Jumping from site to site hoping to find someone that was at least honest proved to be a fruitless search . Well there were the occasionl exceptions to the apparent rule . When I was really disgusted and ready to give up finally and for all time , praying to God and wondering what was going to happen , she came out of nowhere . I can not explain it . I only know that I have found the one for me . She dropped from the Matchdoctor sky and landed in my hard drive . We seem to be a perfect match , not perfect people mind you , just a perfect match . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep checking to make sure that it is real and not just a dream . Thank you Match Doctor for all you hard work . Also I appreciate the forums that you have instituted for us too . For those of you that are having a hard time I say do n't give up . You never know when or where she or he will come along . I spent 30 years looking and being alone . But it has all come to an abrupt and joyful halt . The future looks as bright as the rising sun . sealacamp <p> November 2005 Though I have not been on here as long as most I see . I have put a lot of good thoughts and feelings into this site and through it I have met a lot of depth filled people in my life . In fact , looking around my room of my " inner circle " of friends I think of all of them are on this site . In fact , I have met more people on this site then all the other sites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All around this site just helps you know people and for that I am grateful . Xavier0777 <p> November 2005 Well , I first came onto this site by advice of a friend of mine . I had just busted up with my fiance after I found out she was screwing my best man . My friend figured that I would at least have some laughs in here . So I joined and started going into chat on a regular basis . Met tons of wonderful people , but none of them really caught my full attention . Then one day I started chatting with a gal names ' melts ' . I was talking to her for about 3 weeks , and then the convos changed . I did n't figure it would be to two different people . The first one I was talking to was the original , melt 's friend , that took over her profile for awhile , while she was taking a break from it after meeting someone from here and having her heart broken . But we continued talking for weeks after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It became a time when we could n't be seperated for 2 mins without thinking about the other or without speaking to each other . To tell ya how bad it was , we would stay on the phone till we fell asleep , and they died on us . I loved her so very much , that after a few months , I asked her to marry me . She said yes , then came the fateful day that she felt so bad that she had lied to me about being the other gal . I fought hard to keep her , because i loved her , not the other . The other was fun to talk to , but she was the one that i could n't live without . She was the one that i went to sleep with every night , and the one that I would wake up to and call right away to tell her good morning before I went to work . Hours and hours of talking and convincing her , and it paid off . Christmas came around an we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so excited and nervous , cause I could n't believe that I was actually doing this . But as soon as I got off the bus and saw her , I knew that there was no one else for me , but her . i spent a month there with her , took my whole vacation just to spend with her and my soon to be step son , and had the most wonderful time of my life . Just being with her , and him . I did n't want it to end . On April 29,2004 , I married her in front of her friends and promised to love her till i am no longer on this earth and even after . To this day there is nothing that she has to worry about , cause i love her with all my heart , body , and soul more and more everyday . No matter what is said , no matter what is done , I know she is there behind me , making me a better person , and pushing me to be the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more everyday ! DEVILUKNOW <p> November 2005 Back in 2001 , I had just went through a bad break up . I was done with men ! ! I was gon na die an old lady with 500 cats in my upstairs apartment ! The internet was my social life I chatted and flirted plenty .. but when any guy started making noises like he really wanted to meet me , I would find a new place ( chat room ) to hand out in . I stumbled in MatchDoctor just looking at profiles . I did get quite a bit of " male " . In October of that year .. I stumbled across DrDemento 's profile an thought it was hilarious ! I really wanted to send him a messsage but was n't the kind of girl to make the first move . On January 1st 2002 , I ran across it again . By then he had changed his profile and had the 2000 Years Ago poem ( check out the poem thread ) . One of the questions in the Q/A part was " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ... coffee .. ask me why ! So I did . His answer was ... Why waste time and money on a big date with someone you have never met .. only to realise in the first 30 minutes that that it ai n't  workin ! ! ( ok .. not his exact words We emailed back and forth for hours and both clearly stated that we werent looking for anything more than someone to go dancing with . So after HIM giving ME his phone # .. I would n't give him mine for fear that he was psycotic .. or married ... and talking for 2 hours on the phone that night , I agreeed to meet him for lunch and gave him my phone # That lunch on Jan 23 2002 lasted an hour and 45 minutes ! We both were very cautious .. for the first few months . Yes we were friends first .. and as the old saying goes .. ' Be careful what you wish for you might get it ! ' Not a day goes by that I do n't thank MatchDoctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for almost 4 years now ... married August 18th 2003 . And every moment we are together just gets better and better ! sassee1111 <p> November 2005 The last thing I expected was to find the woman of my dreams on here . Oh , sure , why else does anyone ever come to a dating site ? But the little Katt I found turned out to be the one my heart has longed for ever since I first became aware of the wonderful differences between boys and girls . It was n't immediate , and we were n't evern sure that we were looking for one another , but our friendship grew as we saw one another on the message boards . Even when the boards disappeared , we found our way to other places , and always stayed in touch . At long last , we looked seriously at one another , and found that our heart 's deepest longings were satisfied with one another . I fell for her like a skydiver with a faulty chute ! I 'm so glad we found each other , Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your website. - Once we met , - it was like we had known each other forever ! Now , we are getting married August 26th , 2006 . I was skeptical of dating services at first , but I would recommend your site to anybody ! SpankBoogie1969 <p> October 2005 My husband and I tied the knot on 8/24/05. - We first met thru messaging at your website. - We both were very picky people , looking for someone who met very specific mutual automotive interests . - Our first " hello " was to each other was in March and 7 months later we 're as happy as clams ! - It was a dream come true so , thank you for all you do ! - I just wanted to let you know there was one more success story out there.Cadville <p> October 2005 Firstly I would like to thank Matchdoctor for the marvelous site . I have been a member here for quite some time now , I thought that I would never find a match . I have been talking and writing to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been getting on fine , and well , we were treating each other as pen pals . We decided to meet , with nothing more in mind than just having a friendly chat and a much needed night out . We met this weekend , and did nothing but laugh from the first moment we laid eyes on each other , it was as if we had known each other for all of our lives . This has ended up as a match made in heaven , we are so alike , so much in love , plus the best of mates . This is all down to Matchdoctor , thank-you to everyone for chatting to me over the months , and all of your support and friendly advice . Please do not give up hope , there is a match for everyone somewhere , sometimes it may take a bit of time but please do not give up hope . God bless everyone who has chatted to Shewy over the last few months , I do hope that you find as much happiness as I have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this site , and we experienced love at first sight ! She is wonderful , and we are now living together ! We agreed that we would take ourselves off this site - mission accomplished - but thanks ! I recommend your site to anyone - it 's the BEST way to meet someone , online or not ! jon <p> September 2005 In- 2003 , I heard about your site and I decided to give it a try , it was very convenient because- of the- free email . I received a very good response , among these , I received a message from fred6 , we started chatting , talking on the telephone , writing letters ... nothing was enough ... until he could visit me in Mexico City in February 2004 , right when he walked through the gates of the airport to meet me , he kneeled down and took out a diamond ring ! It 's been now a year since I moved here and 9 months since we got married , and it all was thanks to you . I guess I can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks ! joygirl4u <p> September 2005 I would like to tell you that I met my new husband thru your site , we have been married for 4 weeks , and are very happy . When I first signed up I was very skeptical , but it really works . Thank You.bestfriend881 <p> September 2005 I just wanted to thank you for having such a wonderful website ! - I met my wonderful husband here and am happier than I ever thought I could be ! - We met June 11 , 2004 and were married December 13 , 2004. - Everything is wonderful. - Again , we both thank you.PhoenixRising180 <p> August 2005 It is true about finding love on the Internet . When I met Honeywine in real life it was like a dream come true . She is everything I could ever hoped for and all I want . We will be getting married soon and we are happier now than we have ever been in our lives . Thank you Matchdoctor.Highflyer <p> August 2005 In March of 2003 I met my soulmate on here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this year and are so very much in love . Thank you . Batman943 <p> August 2005 I put my profile online for the heck of it . I was very skeptical about online relationships or even finding a decent person . Well , 7 days ago I found him . Yeah , it has been one week but I have spent more time talking to him in those 7 days than I have spent talking in a relationship that lasted 4 years . There are no words to describe it . This skeptic is now a believer . I will keep you posted on the future.funcomesinred <p> July 2005 I 've been single off-and-on for about 6 years . I like Matchdoctor because you can email and reply to anyone for free . It is a nice looking site . And , the biggest compliment is the people that chose to join this site . You have a very large , larger than most , number of nice , healthy , genuine and pleasing looking people . The men are actually educated , working , smart .... have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can control something like this , especially on a free site , so , it is wonderfully unusual that your site possesses this . <p> I 've looked at other free sites but they consist of just the opposite . Desert rats , retirees from confinement ..... hahaha , at least that is the way they look . Also , I have a singles group in Southern California with over 400 members and I 've recommended your site to them , plus ! ! ! I also teach an on-line dating class and your site is one of my #1 recommendations ! Zezee <p> July 2005 I want to thank you for having such a wonderful site . I have been on a lot of other sites and nothing had worked . I was at the end of my rope thinking I would never find someone who would ever want to be with me . It 's especially hard to find someone when indeed you are bisexual and looking for another female but I thought " Why not give this site a shot " . Not long after I signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I started talking to this one girl in Indiana ( I 'm from Illinois by the way ) . It started with a wink from her and I e-mailed her and we started chattingFrom the 1st time we started talking I felt a special connection to her but was scared to say anything about it until maybe a week or 2 afterwards I finally got the guts to tell her how I feel just to find out she felt the same way . After awhile of chatting that day I finally had the nerve to ask her out and we 've been happy ever since . Now I ca n't wait until I can finally meet her and have our relationship continue to grow and who knows ... maybe someday we 'll move in together and never worry about the next time we 'll get to chat again . All this time before I met her I thought I was destined to be alone and now I could n't be happier ! If it was n't for your site I would never had met her . So I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend this site to anyone looking for their special someone because who knows - they just might find him/her ! IgnoredDreams <p> June 2005 I am so grateful to you guys ! I have been through 2 messy divorces and had pretty much given up on finding " the one " . While chatting to various people through your site I met the love of my life ! We were married on August 11 , 2003 and have 2 beautiful boys together ! I ca n't thank you enough ! vrycurious <p> June 2005 I just wanted to send you one more great testimonial . I had gone to other sites , but never wanted to feel that I HAD to spend money and make others rich off of my peril . So , I found Matchdoctor.com , posted an ad , and after a few psychos , met a lovely woman . That was in Nov. 2003 . In Nov. 2004 , we were engaged , and on July 4th , 2005 we got married . We were married in Las Vegas , and ca n't be happier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free service . Thank you ! Mr.62Buick <p> June 2005 It is true - you can find true love on the internet ! - I met beatfarmer66 back on March 6th , 2004 . I had sent him a message showing interest . On March 11,2004 , we decided to meet up at a public location after chatting with each other every night since his response. - Our first public meeting was like sky rockets . We hit it off and have been together ever since . On May 5th of this year , he brought me back to the exact location where we met in person and pulled out a diamond ring and asked me to marry him . I said " YES " . We are getting married , October 29th of this year in Duluth , GA .

I have used other sites only to be disappointed and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect match . We are both at an age were it 's next to impossible to really meet anyone with a future in mind . But , your site has proven me wrong . I had send a small note to a fellow from Texas and we started communicating . Following that we met and clicked right off the start . We are now planning our future together and I could n't be happier . I have looked my whole life for such a man and found him here . Thank you so much for your terrific site and wishing everyone else the best of luck . " MyImmortal <p> April 2005 " Found the love of my life on your site or actually , he found me , to be more specific . A friend told him about Matchdoctor.com , after he had unsuccessfully gone through several other sites , incuding paid ones , not finding who he was certain existed ( me ! ) . I am a very busy female executive , had a posting on your site in the hopes it could help me get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out and meet generally . Of all the postings he viewed , amazingly enough he found mine . We are both mature adults ( he 's 56 , I 'm 41 ) and have had enough life experience to be certain in our hearts now that we were meant to be together , neither of us having met someone so like each other before . And to think , for the past 30 years we 've lived within less than 15 miles of one another , for one period of time less than 4 miles apart , for years ! I had to pass within about 4 blocks of his home for more than 15 years to get to work every day . Yet without Matchdoctor.com , we realize we would never have met . My life is now complete , and I am infused with gratitude and appreciation beyond my capability to adequately express . He and I both thank you from the very depths of our souls .

I have a US postal worker in my family and she just started having to pay ss taxes , but she will draw from Civil Service when she retires . <p> While technically the article is false , since they actually do pay SSN starting in 1983 ... it brings up a good point ... and made me wonder why I do n't fight against it more <p> 1 . The first recipient received 22.54 in 1940 ...

Guess where their salary comes from in the first place , from our taxes . So it is still our tax money to begin with that pays for all this , including the benefits . <p> The main point of this blog is the huge benefits congress receives from their own retirement plan paid for by us . <p> teddybearr48 <p> Oct 10 @ 11:28AM <p> Good point about congress raiding the ss money . For years they have been spending ss funds on other things and leaving an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay it back ... more taxes and/or reduced benefits . If congress had invested the ss money or just kept it in an interest bearing account , there would be lots of money left . <p> This is incorrect . In the mid-1980 's , Congress passed legislation changing the old pension system for Congressional employees to reflect recent changes to federal employee pensions . CRS was replaced with FERS and new employees were required to make the switch . Older federal and Congressional workers who had vested in the CRS could change , but were not compelled to do so . So , for the next decade or so we will see two tiers of retirees from the federal system until all employees will be FERS retirees . <p> Having local government employees participate in Social Security also happened recently . Local and state police departments had their own pension systems that did not require SS deductions , as did other state government employees , etc . Over the years the law has been amended to add these groups into Social Security . <p> Eastham , while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from another system fund than you and I will draw from . They will get much more in their retirement check than we the regular people who will draw from SS will get . <p> My family member who works for the US Postal Services is tickled pink because she will draw from another system and not from the regular SS fund , but she is mad that that she has to pay into SS and will never get to draw from both . She wants both the SS check and her other check from the other system that she does not have to pay into to draw . 
@@37128533 @6128533/ <p> Editor 's Note : Following is the text of a Jan. 2 , 1998 , affidavit from the woman known as " Jane Doe No. 5 . " The Paula Jones legal team in a March 28 filing reported an unsubstantiated hearsay claim that , 20 years ago , Clinton had invited Jane Doe No. 5 to a hotel room and forced her to have sex . This affidavit , in which the woman denies the claim , was released by the Clinton legal team in its March 30 filing ( see the Post story ) . <p> 1 . My name is Jane Doe #5 . I am 55 years old and have been married since 1981 . I have one child , age 28 . I currently reside in Arkansas . <p> 2 . In November of 1997 , two private investigators retained by Paula Corbin Jones approached me at my residence . I declined to speak with them , but provided the name of my family attorney . I subsequently was served with a subpoena seeking the production of documents and purporting to require my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbin Jones and President William Jefferson Clinton ( Civil Action No . LR-C-94-290 ) . I have never met Ms. Jones , nor do I have any information regarding the allegations that she has advanced against President Clinton . In this regard , I have no knowledge or information regarding the events she has alleged occurred on May 8 , 1991 at the Excelsior Hotel or , for that matter , any knowledge or information regarding any interaction between herself and Mr. Clinton . <p> 3 . I met President Clinton more than twenty years ago through family friends . Our introduction was not arranged or facilitated , in any way , by the Arkansas State Police . I have never been an Arkansas state employee or a federal employee . I have never discussed with Mr. Clinton the possibility of state or federal employment nor has he offered me any such position . I have had no further relations with him for the past ( 15 ) years . <p> 4 . During the 1992 Presidential campaign there were unfounded rumors and stories circulated that Mr. Clinton had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newspaper and tabloid reporters hounded me and my family , seeking corroboration of these tales . I repeatedly denied the allegations and requested that my family 's privacy be respected . These allegations are untrue and I had hoped that they would no longer haunt me , or cause further disruption to my family . <p> 5 . I do not possess any information that could possibly be relevant to the allegations advanced by Paula Corbin Jones or which could lead to admissible evidence in her case . Specifically , I do not have any information to offer regarding a nonconsensual or unwelcome sexual advance by Mr. Clinton , any discussion offer or provision of state or federal employment or advancement in exchange for sexual conduct , or any use of state troopers to procure women for sex . Requiring my testimony at a deposition in this matter would cause unwarranted attorney 's fees and costs , disruption to my life and constitute an invasion of my right to privacy . For these reasons , I have asked my attorney to advise Ms. Jones 's counsel that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her counsel with this sworn affidavit . <p> ... And to slam Bill 's wife Hillary so she does n't get elected for the Presidency , which does n't have anything to due with her what so ever . <p> Snipet from the article ... <p> Broaddrick 's credibility will undoubtedly be questioned because there are no police or medical records from the 1978 incident she says took place in a Little Rock hotel . Broaddrick was known as " Jane Doe No. 5 " when she was subpoenaed in the Paula Jones lawsuit and filed an affidavit denying that such an assault took place . She later recanted with FBI agents working for independent counsel Kenneth Starr , saying she did not want to be drawn into the Jones case . Starr 's office found her account inconclusive . <p> Her first husband was Gary Hickey and he remembered no such injury when she returned from Little Rock , nor such a ' rape ' story . later , Juanita Hickey filed divorce papers against her husband claiming he had hit her in the mouth . <p> She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters . They both hated Bill Clinton because he commuted the death sentence of the man who murdered their father . <p> In 1997 , Broaddrick signed an affidavit and gave a deposition in the Jones case , denying twice under oath that Clinton raped her . If Clinton did rape her , 20 years later , why would she still not tell the truth ? <p> Within one year of the alleged rape , Broaddrick attended a fund-raiser for Clinton and accepted appointment by him to a state advisory board . Why did she still want to support a man who raped her ?

Here 's this teenage girl with the same DNA as you and all I can do is think of how much she looked like you when you were 18 . And that just about makes me cry . And then it turns out Vicky 's really into the whole an*l thing , that gets me to thinking about how many times I pressured you about trying it and how that probably fuelled some of the bitterness between us . But do you see how even then , when I 'm thrusting inside your baby sister 's cinnamon ring , all I can do is think of you ? It 's true , Connie . In your heart you must know it . Do n't you think we could start over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh ? I think we can . If you feel the same please , please , please let me know .

@@37128549 @6128549/ <p> I seriously have no idea what works these days . Who pays ? Mr X the Englishman who I used to fancy till I found out he has this habit of inviting me for drinks and dinner at a popular gastropub on Fridays just looks the other way when the bill arrives . He goes there earlier to make sure we have seats at the bar because his job as editor of a fancy magazine means he can leave as and when he likes when he has social plans . <p> So I think nothing of it for a few weeks as I can afford to pay for my meals thank you very much but it makes me wonder why he never offers to at least offer to pay the bill.Usually by the time I arrive he would have ordered his own food or bar snacks and paid for it so by the time I order my meal , a fresh bill arrives because he deliberately never keeps the tab running . <p> So you say he regards me as a friend and owes no obligation to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also tells me he is a tightwad though he makes twice as much as I do . <p> Sometimes it really is the gesture that counts . <p> So I introduce him to a lovely girlfriend who he tells me he fancies terribly . She works as a trainer in a private hospital and I do n't have to tell you she does not need a man to pay her way . So anyway after meeting her he arranges for all of us to meet at the same pub and when she arrives , he offers to get her a glass of wine . And guess what ? He continues speaking to her and conveniently forgets to ask the bar tender to get her a drink . Did he forget ? Was he so caught up in the conversation it slipped his mind ? Well he ordered his beer and " forgot " her wine . <p> My friend then proceeds to order her own drink , gulps it and walks out . <p> As far as I am concerned , he does not deserve her . If she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well look elsewhere . <p> Am I ranting ? No . My message is .. I have no idea what works anymore but it sure goes a long way for simple chivalry however old fashioned it may seem to get the girl . <p> After reading some of the comments- especially those who express amazement that women here reject men who do not pay for a night out .. be it drinks or dinner . <p> Remember I was specific in saying women like us can afford such meals . All I am saying is it is the GESTURE . If you like a woman and ask her out , it is just chivalry to OFFER to pay . <p> No one likes free loaders , where ever you are from . It is just etiquette .

If the person I go out with keeps ordering drinks to the point of being ridiculous , then I have a problem . 3 or 4 beers or mixed drinks , is fine , 8 or 9 is n't . As for a date type thing , or being introduced , then the man should pay . I see it as more of a courtesy than a burden , but that 's just me . <p> I 'm glad your friend walked away . There is being frugal and then there is being down right cheap , or stingy as you put it . <p> But on the other hand he may have to write twice as many alimony checks eachmonth as you do ! ! <p> Detach <p> Feb 25 @ 12:57PM <p> I got lucky .

Like .. is this " Dutch Treat " which is common on most of the dating sites . Gals like to meet a guy over dinnerand its no uncommon for the guy to ask .. or announce ..

After we 've gotten something going , I think dutch treat should kick in perhaps , but initially ? I 'm old fashioned . I was raised that a man is a man and thus he does the initial asking out and taking care of the costs . Perhaps I 'll do the asking and pay the tab the next time and we 'll kind of go back and forth like that , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the drinks and popcorn ( which often costs more than the price of the freaking movie ! ) <p> What I would n't tolerate is a cheapskate that has no inclination to behave like a gentleman . This guy you were talking about in the blog was a jerk . <p> I 'm a male ( straight ) , and as a male , when you appreciate the company of another guy friend its quite usual to pay for his dinner or to buy him a couple of beers ( ask any guy ) ( also depending on who has more money at the time ) , but when I ask my mates to come for dinner with my girlfriend , I usually pay the whole table ( that would be at least 2 other guys dinner ) . <p> And I do n't  know how many guy friends you have , or if you understand the dynamics of the relationship between men ( straight ) , but we are quite frequently paying each other stuffs ! ! <p> so why not do it with a woman you fancy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and you want to keep it that way ) to show her you are on HER side ? <p> I can see nowdays some men may not want to do that , because they resent the woman or want to punish her in some way , but I think a friendship should have everything clear , just look inside yourself ... are you perhaps attempting to change this man in order to get your own approval ? <p> Its not worth it ! ! JUST STOP HANGING OUT WITH HIM ! ! ! <p> its possible that he is even a women hater , because that behaviour is NOT NORMAL ( between friends ) , be aware , follow your heart ! ! <p> STOP BEGGING HIM GIRL ! ! ! that man , or any other , for that matter , will never change ! ! and even though it might feel personal , trust me , its not about you .

@@37128563 @6128563/ <p> Since birth , I have suffered from what is known as an " atlas subluxation " . This condition is a misalignment of the top bone in the spine , known as the atlas , that hold up the entire weight of the head , determines the alignment of the spine and encases the brain stem . The atlas subluxation often goes undetected by most general practitioners , and people , like myself , can suffer for years before discovering something is wrong and seeking treatment . Some seek mainstream chiropractic treatment , and when it does n't help , they decide to live with the pain . Living with the pain is probably the worst choice a person who suffers from this condition can make , as a misalignment of the atlas puts not only that particular bone and the head out of alignment , but the entire spine as well . An untreated atlas subluxation can also lead to spinal rupture , herniated and ruptured discs , and permanent nerve damage . <p> As far back as I can remember , I have dealt with severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head tilt , and the constant feeling that my entire body and face were asymmetrical . As much as my therapist denied it and chalked it up to my body dysmorphic disorder , I knew that I was right , and that I was suffering from some sort of disability , but it took me years to figure out exactly what I was suffering from . <p> A few months ago , out of curiosity , I typed " head tilt , crooked jaw " into Google and the first thing that came up was " atlas subluxation " . Having worked for a chiropractor three years prior , I had heard of a subluxation , but had never done extensive research into it . <p> After reading over the symptoms , I knew almost right away that I was suffering from this condition , and I promptly went to my chiropractor to have it diagnosed .

The pain sometimes became so severe that I could do nothing but lay down and attempt to relax my back so I could feel at least a bit of relief . <p> Today , I got my new lease on life . I went to see Dr. Marla , an atlas orthogonal specialist , who took some x-rays of my neck to analyze the damage and adjusted my head and atlas . What we found was disturbing : my neck had reversed and was curving the opposite way that it should ( a normal neck curves like a backwards " C " , and mind was curving like a forward " C " ) . This abnormal curvature of the neck caused my vertebrae to pinch the cartilage between the bones of the spine , and if I had waited any longer to have it adjusted I could have suffered severe damage . <p> After getting the adjustment , which was almost laughably simple , I immediately felt straighter and felt less pressure on my neck and shoulders . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impediment and I could sit up straight .

@@37128568 @6128568/ <p> . People who suffer from GERD , heartburn , and generally reflux should be aware that some doctors link antacids or PPI 's ( protein pump inhibitors ) to dangerous health problems . <p> It seems that some 50% of older people ( over 50 .... not that I feel old ... ) who suffer of reflux and therefore irritation of their esophagus actually have too little stomach acid . But the acidity of the stomach is necessary and useful to a bunch of other things than just digesting regular food . <p> Stomach acidity is the first line of defense against fungi , viruses and bacteria , including H-pylori , which has been linked to ulcers . Low stomach acid - from acid-suppressive drugs - can even lead to pneumonia and other respiratory infections . <p> Stomach acid is also necessary for the absorption of some vitamins and minerals , including magnesium . The body 's uptake of magnesium is reduced when stomach acid is blocked with antacids or PPIs ( protein pump inhibitors ) . A magnesium deficiency can cause sudden death from heart arrhythmias <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are risky buisness , causing abdominal pain , constipation and diarrhea , dry mouth , flatulence , headache and nausea . Over the long haul , these drugs upset the body 's natural pH balance and the production of parathyroid , a hormone involved in bone remodeling . No wonder research links PPI 's to osteoporosis and related hip fractures . <p> Sufficient stomach acid is also needed for zinc absorption ( remember how important zinc is to a healthy prostate ! ) perhaps helping to explain why Americans are so low in this mineral . For those who do not know this : zinc is crucial to healing tissue , including in the esophagus or in the stomach . <p> After reading this information , I researched the topic a bit further . There are a number of articles in the same tone as the one from which I got the above information.But there was also an article citing the FDA , saying Prilosec and Nexium are safe drugs and all accusations of such terrible side effects as I mentioned here are not true . <p> So there you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to eat yet another bottle of Tums , or rather change your diet in general , as well as your approach for healing your GERD . There are indeed natural ways of attacking reflux that do not produce any of the dangers cited above . I 'm working on these natural solutions for myself right now.But that 's me .... You figure out what 's good for you.I just wanted to make you aware .... <p> The active ingredient in Tums is calcium carbonate , which raises blood calcium levels . <p> Excess calcium can cause kidney problems including kidney stones and other problems . <p> Nothing you ingest is without risk , NOTHING . <p> Even water , taken in excess can harm your health and even be fatal . <p> And just because something is " natural , " does not mean it ca n't also be harmful or even fatal . Arsenic and cyanide come to mind .

Good luck in your attempt to cure yours ! <p> I 'm so glad to hear that you could heal your ulcer and do n't need to continue taking these medicines anymore .

@@37128569 @6128569/ <p> Apparently minky did n't agree with my comments on her blog and ca n't tolerate any other views so she blocked me before I could respond to a rebuttal . So I am posting this to give my response . If she wants to comment on that she is free to do so on this blog as I do n't fear allowing her views to be seen by others as she does mine . <p> It applies to the Islamist sympathizer named Kathy Griffin who apparently identifies with Islamic terrorist enemies of the United States and of civilization who cut off the heads of innocent people simply because they are Christians , Jews , Gays , adulterous women , or a whole host of other types they deem to be infidels . <p> Two kinds of people are cheering what Griffin did : Islamic terrorists , and American liberals . What does that tell you ? <p> Griffin 's message was loud and clear . In her twisted liberal , America hating mind , she sides with the enemies of the United States . That hatred is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted that what she did would be so appealing to other like minded liberals that it would give her career a giant boost . To see an image of her holding the severed head of the President of the United States -- as if it was severed by these Islamic barbarians who she apparently admires so much that she mimics their atrocities -- would be so irresistibly appealing to her like minded liberal followers that it would put her lackluster , talentless career on a rocket to stardom . <p> And in some respects she is correct . Just look at how many liberals are so sick that they are willing to overlook this despicable act of anti-Americanism . <p> But fortunately it has rightly raised the mighty ire of those who will not tolerate that kind of disrespectful treatment of our beloved country and they are pushing back . <p> You have the right to free speech . But so do we . And you do n't have the right to be free of the consequences of that speech . I hope this vicious hateful America hating loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't go unheeded by other America haters who are contemplating the same kind of evil act . <p> Trump is a woman hater , he has shown that in the press many times . Anyone who defends his actions , in turn agrees . They simply are not a friend of mine . I never speak out politically . But this time I had to voice my opinion . His own wife can not bear to touch him in public . I stand by what i believe , if a man had posted the same severed head photo , the reaction would not have been so dramatic . <p> And if Kathy Griffin had posted a picture with the severed head of Hillary Clinton , you would personally invite her to speak at the RNC convention . <p> Absolutely not . Conservatives do n't share the same affection for political violence that liberals do or side with Islamic terrorists . It 's liberals who revere this kind of atrocity including riots and physical intimidation of free speech . Conservatives abhor it , liberals/fascists applaud it . <p> Trump is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press many times . Anyone who defends his actions , in turn agrees . They simply are not a friend of mine . I never speak out politically . But this time I had to voice my opinion . His own wife can not bear to touch him in public . I stand by what i believe , if a man had posted the same severed head photo , the reaction would not have been so dramatic . <p> As I suspected . No denial that you blocked me simply because you do n't like my view . Thanks for confirming it . It helps us understand a liberal 's mentality . <p> Nice try , DR , but I 'm not buying it . You guys all clapped your hands when Ted Nugent visited the White House despite his threatening to kill Obama on more than one occasion as well as his comments about decapitating Democrats during his endorsement of Mitt Romney . <p> I never clapped my hands or had any comment on those things one way or another because I never heard about them , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving your interpretation of what Nugent said . That is automatically suspect to me . <p> There is no interpretation of content or context necessary in the Griffin Case . One image makes it all crystal clear . <p> Limbaugh brought it to my attention : Libs are never happy . NEVER ! You would think they would have produced at least ONE national speaker to tout their rather awesome accomplishments . First , they own Washington &amp; NY politics outright . They have California on Lock-UP , and Hollywood is their personal play thing . When a ' Republican " gets the presidency examples are IKE , Nixon &amp; Bush they dislike their liberal policies ... eYe would articulate--but they will not believe me anyway. ) ) now then , they have the NY Times , the Chicago Tribune / L A Times , Rolling Stone and um , Rock n Roll ..... still , they are unhappy with all that . Even the Super Bowl and the NFL halftime shows abound with Liberal ' Arts ' . Every Junior College , all NC2A colleges---and basically every nook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karl Marx .... MOST of all , the agnostic , ruthless Fractional Reserve Banker , is a bona fide Liberal &amp; the entire Catholic Church is infested with liberalism ...... So have thyself a par-Tay dear Libs , and look at the G 'd damn scoreboard once in awhile . <p> How tiresome the left has become . Trumps a nazi , Trumps a woman hater , Trumps in the Mafia , and on and on and on . These declarative statements by the left are taken as gospel by those so inclined to adopt whatever mantra democrats provide as fodder . The sad thing is this : <p> I stand by what i believe <p> But do they really ? Or are they so easily led ? If so why should we take them seriously ? Well , we do n't . Their narratives are childish , their intentions are to inflame not inform . They are simply people with nothing to contribute to any discourse . And we 're stuck with their inane comments . So much for the comedy of Mork-less Mindy . <p> Angel1964 <p> Jun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severed head was discussing . It sent a message ... Yes we have freedom of speech ... But the message can be perceived as threatening . That is not considered free speech . <p> Again .... I ca n't justify this just because I do n't like Trump . It 's just wrong ! <p> I am in mo way excusing Trump 's actions ... I simply ca n't excuse Kathy 's actions as well . <p> Ask yourself this . No matter how much you might despise the president , would you EVER dare do something like that ? Something so violent and physically aggressive ? <p> Aside from the fact that I would never do it for other reasons , like that it 's an immoral and despicable thing to do , I would never do it for another reason that seems obvious to me . I would be afraid to because I know it could be construed as a threat . <p> It is an aggressive assault on the President of the United States . What person in their right mind would do such a thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like the guy on the plane that yells " I HAVE A BOMB ! " and then sues the airline when the security guy body slams him . <p> Angel1964 <p> Jun 5 @ 8:20PM <p> I would n't do that ever ... Not just because it could be considered a threat ... But because it 's just a sick thing to do ! <p> When I do something without thinking ... I should expect back lash . This goes for everyone ... I 'm including Trump . <p> With every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . We have to be held accountable for our actions . <p> That is n't right or left as in sides .... It 's right or wrong as in mortals . <p> If she did it " without thinking , " -- such as when someone makes an offhanded comment -- then it could possibly be excused as a mistake . But she spent hours doing it at least with great deliberation and consciousness of what she was doing , and even made a video to turn her doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , that 's a premeditated threat . It 's inexcusable . <p> I did n't get much bent out of shape with Kathy Griffin 's so-called prank . ( We saw plenty of things like that with Obama ) . But when she said she would also target Barron Trump , that made me angry . Any grown-up who is in the public eye knows they may be the butt of many jokes . But in my eyes , it is totally wrong to include the children of those people . <p> " Obama 's presidency was marked by BURNING effigies hanging from nooses all across the country . I do n't recall a huge uproar about that ? ? " Exactly , but Obama is a classy guy who knows that Americans have freedom of speech . I for one would not want that changed . I do n't agree with many things said by politicians , or whoever , but will always defend their right as Americans to say what think . If that makes me a " Liberal " then I am proud , that is what this country was built on .

@@37128572 @6128572/ <p> I was just recently diagnosed with genital herpes . I 'm still having a hard time with this , because right at the time when it looked like we would start getting intimate , my gf ( she is now my ex ) told me that she has her blood work done 2 times a year , and that she 's clean , and she even asked about my past , and did n't want " to catch any std 's " , etc . So stupid me decides it 's OK not to use a condom with her . She was very Christian-oriented , she even teaches a bible study class at her church . So I trusted her . <p> All went well for about 4 months ( we dated about 6 ) , and then as I started having symptoms , she said she had something to tell me . She said she had herpes , and that she got it 2 years ago , but she did n't know who gave it to her . Funny when we first started dating , she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we met , and that she dated her last bf 3 years . <p> She said her doctor told her that as long as she did n't have sex during an outbreak , that she would not infect anyone . But I have a hard time believing her . So I broke up with her . I totally lost my trust and respect for her . And the way she handled it , just boggles my mind . <p> She was going to tell me if we ever got married . She said that is something that should only be discussed between husband and wife . <p> As soon as I started feeling some symptoms , she said , go ahead and get tested , and let me know how the results are . And that she wanted to be alone for the weekend . Maybe she felt guilty . Or she does n't want to deal with it , and she 's running away from her responsibilities . <p> A couple of days later ( before my test results ) she leaves me a message , " hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be friends with you , let 's just keep enjoying our lives , what we like to do ( ie. dance ) blah blah blah " <p> I do n't want to put all the blame on her , because I should have used a condom , or went in to have some blood work done with her .

@@37128574 @6128574/ <p> Ok . At what point does a healthy self image turn to unbridled vanity ? Without a certain , healthy , amount of confidence and self respect , life is a series of seemingly unsurmountable hurdles . A huge fear fest designed to destroy the weak and reward the strong . So you take a sober , realistic , look at your weaknesses and strengths and proceed with optimism and maybe even a hint of false bravado , and you grab the bull by the horns . Maybe you get sorta good at it . You win a few . The bull wins a few . Your cautious steps turn to swagger . After a bit of time you think , " I can handle this , I know how to roll with the punches " " I 'm from , no body 's gon na f%#k with me " . Because of the strength of your personality , people are attracted to you . All the while , inwardly loathing your self-aggrandizing , over-inflated , shameless self-promoting , ass . They are the same folks who outwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , dude " . One day you wake up and look in the mirror and see a person who has learned to live with himself , but that no one else can live with , or even near . In the movie " The Firm " , Al Pacino ( the Devil ) says " Vanity ! My favorite sin ! " Indeed , massaging someones vanity muscle will in fact win you favor , almost every time . So , my question to you is this . Do Confidence and Ability breed Vanity as a side product of Self Assertion ? Or are we vain simply because we ca n't stop looking into the collective mirrors of our self-centered Western Universe . The mirror that lies and tells us " You 're the fairest one of all " . When in fact a real mirror reveals a spiritual Sea Hag , twisted by self absorbsion and greed . Self Love ? Vanity ? Where 's the line , and how do you walk it ?

I believe strongly in a person being able to enjoy their interself as much as their outerself . Once a person has accomplished this type of self love , vanity will have no chance . <p> As Wandaful said , respect and honor are key , and introspection is essential . <p> If we do not love ourselves , we will not feel worthy of being loved by others .

Many people mistakenly believe they will wake up one day and be perfect . Never gon na happen ...

@@37128575 @6128575/ <p> I would like to make up some excuse as to why I listen to Dr Laura .... and because of my job as an outside sales person I do get more time in the car than a lot of other people ... so listening to Dr Laura is easy for me to do between sales meetings and all that .... <p> But I am curious if anyone else listens to her show ..... cuz if we all listened and did what she said , none of us with kids would be on this site .... <p> Dr Laura goes on and on about how dating takes away time from the kids and that when you date or re-marry and have small children , you are scarring them for life . Now I know that some of us have insane exes ... heck , mine was once hospitalized for it .... but still .... our relationships have ended and our kids are " visitors " now . <p> In my case I have full on 50/50 custody .... but let 's say that not a lot of men have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it ........ dating and all the crap that goes along with it is toughest on the kids . Here they are ... they have lost one parent already ... one full time parent that is ... and now they have to deal with their moms or dads new girlfriend/boyfriend . What if that relationship fails ? How many single moms out there have had a boyfriend who your kids really liked ... and then had that relationship end ? Sure ... it hurts us .... but if the kids have bonded to the new love in your life ... and than that person is gone ... how do they feel ? Do they feel like they have done something wrong ? <p> My parents were divorced when I was about 11 or so . My dad has had 3 wives since then ... not a lot compared to some people , but a pretty high number . His first new wife ... wife number 2 if you are keeping score ... hated me with a passion . To this day I am not sure why ... except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not sure . As an adult thinking back on her and her actions ... they just seem petty and small minded on her part ... but I digress . <p> And in this case , when my dad finally kicked her to the curb that was a cause for much celebrated around the Bucko household , lemme tell you . <p> I dated a woman a couple of years ago who had twin daughters . They were about 10 at that time I think . Their dad lives in Vegas and we were all in Idaho . They really liked me , as I did them . I did n't spoil them ... which all you men know is the fasted way to get a kid to like you ... but rather I just spent time with them . <p> In the end ... when their mother and I stopped seeing each other ... I wondered how the girls would take our break up more than I worried how the mother would take it ... since she was sort of the cause of us not seeing each other anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the original topic .......... Dr Laura says that if you have small kids you CAN NOT date till they are 18 at least ... out of the house and on their own is the best . <p> Could YOU do that ? Would you sacrifice the next however long that would be ? Would you say " no dating " for the next 13 years ? <p> Imagine that you are a father who has classic visitation .... two weekends a month . What are you going to do for the rest of the month ? And since women usually have the kids more .... its almost easier for men to protect their kids from bonding to their girlfriends than it is the other way around . Men , would you baby sit your kids so you could see them more , if it meant that you knew your ex was going out to party ? <p> These are the thoughts running through my head today . And now ... if you are still reading ... maybe they are running through yours ! Please ... please ... comment ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought each of them was " the one . " Obviously neither was . For me , that was enough ; I did n't date anymore until my son was off to college ( years later ) . That 's what felt right to me. peace <p> I believe it is selfish and inappropriate to date with children . When a child is brought into the world until they are away it is a balanced life about them . Bringing people in and out of their lives is n't the best way . I will not date until they are more or less gone . It is n't about me , it 's what is best for them . This is not a popular position . There are all kinds of rationalizations and justifications to get around it . What 's best for the child ? Am I willing to do that ? Those are the questions . A man marrying a woman with young female children has a better than 30% chance of being accused of inappropriateness(sp) . Adults will say my children need a father/mother .

I respected their decision and respected them more as a Father . <p> Why not be able to date when the kids are with Mom , or Dad and just be able to have a social life ?

" LAURA ! This woman is the worst kind of human being there is- a hypocrite ! She acts all holier-than-thou , yet she 's the one that let an old boyfriend take nude pictures of her , which ended up on the internet ... also , her doctorate is NOT in psychiatry , psychology , or anything else resembling what she does on the radio . Look , kids are more savvy than she makes them out to be ; my kids 1 ) were glad when my ex and I split , and 2 ) wanted us both to find someone to be with , ' cause they love us both and WANT US TO BE HAPPY ! As a parent , the one thing you have to do is find someone that will love and accept your kids-do n't do what your dad did and waste precious time with someone that has jealousy issues . Kids adjust ! And as for the radio ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better choices than that shrew of a fake doctor ... <p> I have n't listened to Dr. Laura for a few years , but I used to listen a lot . I thought she had some good points , but the underlying message I heard was , " Once you have kids you must give up all your dreams , hopes and ambitions . The only thing you are now is a parent , nothing else . " Maybe that is n't really what her message is , but it is what I hear . <p> It would be a good message in a fairy tale world where we are all independently wealthy with full frontal lobotomies---no jobs no dreams no desires . If I follow all her advice I will be dead before I am 40 . Would that be good for my kids ? <p> Sure you have to consider your children in everything you do , but also you have to remember who is the adult and you have to look out for the best interests of the entire family . <p> The ' dating ' would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids ' lives is where the problem arises ... <p> I agree with Dr. Laura that the custodial parent should n't date until the youngest is 18 .

There must be a serious reason why her kids are n't with her . <p> I did not date till this year My sons are 16 and 18 . I have been single 13 years ... Read my blogs and see how they turned out . It was worth it not to date for me . <p> chakrasoul <p> Oct 28 @ 10:33PM <p> When I lived up north I would listen to Dr. Laura .

I date . Not very often unfortunately . And I tell my daughter that I will be out on a date . BUt I do not bring these dates home , I do not involve my daughter with them , and YES becasue I do have a young one at home , they will stay at arms length with her until I feel something specialis going on between us to involve the children . There have been a few times that things were progressing well and we thought it best to have our kids meet . But here is the tactful way to do this without anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve kids in a " date " , we spend the entire time with no hugging , kissing , grabbing , or touching .

It also shows respect for the children in keeping what they do n't need to be seeing between two adults that are n't married . <p> Will I have beensingle for the last 9 years and most of the time I would say 99% I have been single and the few times I did date I did not bring them home I kept that part of my life what there was of it LOL private ..

Congratulations by the way , on your local happiness ! <p> Full figured once ( in the 40s and 50s ) meant someone with a Jane Russel lbody ... larger than a size 14 and a heavy bossom to match .

The Democrats just switched from overt racism to a subversive strategy of getting blacks as dependent as possible on government to secure their votes . At the same time , they began a cynical smear campaign to label anyone who opposes their devious strategy as greedy racists . <p> Following the epic civil rights struggles of the 1960s , the South began a major demographic shift from Democratic to Republican dominance .

That 's quite a feat ! <p> The dam republicans are doing every thing they can to get the minority votes and that includes trying to give the democrat party a bad name . <p> How ever , racism and bigotry is not strictly a party problem . It is a personal problem produced by hand me down teaching . However , the most sick people are a member of the republican party just by their doctrine . The trittle down syndrome .

Eisenhower pushed through the Civil Rights Act of 1957 . One of Eisenhower 's primary political opponents on civil rights prior to 1957 was none other than Lyndon Johnson , then the Democratic Senate Majority Leader . LBJ had voted the straight segregationist line until he changed his position and supported the 1957 Act . <p> Fact : President Truman , a Democrat , integrated the U.S. military . In 1947 , Truman established a President 's Committee on Civil Rights . By January of the following year , internal White House memoranda state President Truman was exploring the possibility of the desegregation of the armed forces by executive order . Following the inclusion of a liberal civil rights plank in the 1948 Democratic Convention platform , Truman did issue an executive order desegregating the military , Order 8802 . It was a process and full integration did not occur until the start of the Korean War in 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order played a role in his exceedingly narrow victory over Dewey . There was a third candidate , Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond . He won several states in the South and precipitated the departure of many supporters of segregation from the Democratic to the Republican Party , culminating in Richard Nixon 's Southern Strategy . <p> As to Johnson 's role , he was able to use his powers as whip in the Senate to help ensure the passage of the 1957 civil rights bill . Certainly , the bill passed was weaker than the one introduced , but without Johnson 's support even the weaker bill would never have made it to the Senate floor . <p> That said , Johnson , especially during his tenure in the House , did not support civil rights legislation -- no one from the South did . But as Robert Caro , LBJ 's famed biographer , wrote in a blog for the Library of Congress in 2013 : <p> The reason it 's questioned is that for no less than 20 years in Congress , from 1937 to 1957 , Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only voted with the South on civil rights , but he was a southern strategist , but in 1957 , he changes and pushes through the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction . He always had this true , deep compassion to help poor people and particularly poor people of color , but even stronger than the compassion was his ambition . But when the two aligned , when compassion and ambition finally are pointing in the same direction , then Lyndon Johnson becomes a force for racial justice , unequalled certainly since Lincoln . <p> I suppose one could argue that where LBJ started is less important than where he ended as the driving force behind the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , one of the gemstones of his presidency . <p> Fact : The 14th Amendment , giving full citizenship to freed slaves , passed in 1868 with 94% Republican support and 0% Democrat support in congress . The 15th Amendment , giving freed slaves the right to vote , passed in 1870 with 100% Republican support and 0% Democrat support in congress . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1867 , not 1868 . It was ratified by the states in 1868 . <p> At the time of the adoption of the Reconstruction Amendment by the Congress , many southern states had not been fully reinstated in the Congress . Most members states of the Confederacy were not reinstated until 1868 , so arguing that Democrats were more racist because they supported the adoption of the amendments in lesser numbers is a false equivalent . <p> Furthermore , during Reconstruction there were very few Democrats seated in the Senate . Of the 11 who voted against ratification of the 14th Amendment , included Republicans like James Rood Doolittle who voted against both the 14th and 15th Amendments . <p> And in closing , a goodly number of Republicans in both the House and Senate abstained from voting for either the 14th or 15th Amendments . In the case of the 15th , some abstained because they believed women -- suffragettes had been very active abolitionists , see Elizabeth Cady Stanton -- deserved the right to vote as well . <p> The Democrats have always been a racist party since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black slavery in America that literally fought tooth and nail to prevent slavery from ending . They are that party of Jim Crow . They are the party that founded the KKK . They are the party that opposed citizenship , voting rights and civil rights for blacks for hundreds of years and right up into the mid 20th century . <p> And no , they did n't suddenly have some kind of epiphany and give up their racist agenda 50 years ago . All they did is take it underground . It 's the new racism . As George W. Bush so rightly called it is the " tyranny of low expectations . " <p> No you do n't see Democrats performing public lynchings of blacks anymore . Instead what they are doing is political lynchings . Using the hand of their evil government henchmen to make sure that blacks stay perpetually in chains on a government plantation run by them . <p> Today 's Democrat party is the most racist organization in the history of politics . Far more racist still then they have even been before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What a lot of people do n't get is that this guy is n't black . Look at the way he presents himself ... his suit , the way he talks , and his intelligence and success . At least , that is what the left will tell you . They will label him has a phony , as a house negro or an Uncle Tom . They will do anything in their power to keep the black stereotype of poor violent gang-banger thugs alive . They push this stereotype into the minds of your children through media and music to make them believe that it is all you will ever be , and to be any different is wrong . The Democrats use the same tactic to get your votes , by implanting the idea that anything different is against your own interests . This is basically mental slavery . Free yourselves . Think for yourselves . Become the successful person you want to be by first changing your mindset .

@@37128587 @6128587/ <p> I love this stuff ! It is different than chicken and sausage gumbo , and I do n't usually mix the two although I know just about any combination will work as long as it has roux and okra in it ! <p> Been a good while since I made this , mainly cause by the time I got all the shellfish for it , it 's quite the investment , usually around $100 for a good pot . <p> I got my own seat of the pants recipe , but posted this thread to see if anyone else would like to contribute theirs . <p> First before you start the roux , make a fish stock with any kind of fish you like , fish heads , crabs , strain the mixture and set aside . There are a few stock recipes that will work , some use just fish and salt and water , some add carrots , celery , parsley and other flavorings , it 's really up to you , but you can not make good gumbo without some kind of stock . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I start off with the roux , equal parts flour and oil but this time I 'm using pure lard , 1/2 cup of each . Of course use a well seasoned cast iron skillet and over medium high heat , brown the roux stirring constantly until it reaches a dark brown color and take it off the heat . <p> Transfer as much of the roux that you want to use into a 12 or 16 qt stockpot with a thick bottom . <p> Chop or slice celery , green onions , bell pepper ( known in the bayou state as " the trinity " ) and add them to the roux . Soften them slightly and add the fish stock , okra salt , pepper , 2-3 bay leaves , gumbo file , creole seasoning , mace , and any other spices or seasonings you like . I 'm using 1lb of frozen okra for this batch , but even canned okra will work . <p> Bring to a slow boil and add some of the fish from the making of the stock , add 1lb peeled raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shells if you want , crawfish tails and let mixture simmer for 5 minutes or until seafood gets cooked until just done , this wo n't take long , and turn the heat OFF . <p> Use this time to season to taste , adjust the amount of gumbo file at this time , then before serving , stir in 1lb of backfin or lump crabmeat , barely fold this into the gumbo , and serve over rice . <p> I have to admit .... I 've never seen some of the seafood that you have used in gumbo ( mussels and scallops ) .... nice job . Whatever is fresh in your area , I suppose would be fine . Generally , we use shrimp , oysters , and crabs in Louisiana Seafood Gumbo . Getting gulf shrimp ( there is definitely a difference ) or blue crabs might be a little difficult for you .... and expensive . There are a few places that will ship fresh Louisiana seafood to you in dry ice . I think Louisiana Seafood Exchange is one . You can do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only suggestions that I would make are : <p> Layered seasoning : Add salt , pepper , and/or creole seasoning to the trinity as you cook it down in the roux . You can add some garlic too .... just not too soon , as it will burn and taste nasty . <p> Stock : Sounds good .... the only thing I would add is a good yellow onion , garlic , and maybe some black peppercorns . <p> Gumbo File : One last suggestion ..... wait until just before served to add a little file to the serving . Do n't cook it in . Some good french bread is a must . The closest thing for you would probably be a French Baguette . Our French Bread in New Orleans is unique . I think it 's a combination of the old ovens , the humidity , and being below sea level . <p> Man ... you 're making me want to blow a few calories today and get me some Chicken Andouille Gumbo .... my favorite . <p> Thanks for the tip on the trinity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , roux cooks hot enough to burn anything you put in there so you can literally fry your trinity in roux if you are not careful and add a quart or so of stock as the roux starts to come to heat . <p> I thought about adding to the stock but since some of it was reserved and frozen for making she-crab soup , I held it to just 6 medium croaker in 8qts of water , with salt . I would have preferred peeler crabs for making gumbo stock , but hey ya got ta do what ya got ta do sometimes in the absence of what you would like to have , work with what you DO have . <p> Mussels in addition to making dishes look really appealing with their shells open , have a succulent meat that is very close to crawfish in flavor ! They both have a very slight muddy or chalky flavor to them , only the mussels taste more like a cross between canned smoked oysters and crawfish . <p> Scallops have a very deep water kinda shellfish taste that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste like any other shellfish and they have a strong fishy/shellfish flavor which lends them perfectly to gumbo or etouffe . <p> Man what 's up with this spellcheck ? ? ?

After all , the predominantly Jewish country of Israel -- albeit extremely tiny , the only predominantly Jewish country in the world -- is the only place in the world with a significant Muslim population ( about 20% of Israel 's population are Muslims ) where Muslims can live their lives with dignity in freedom and democracy , free of the Islamic tyranny they would be subject to if they lived in virtually any one of the many predominantly Muslim countries of the world -- most of them fascist dictatorships . <p> With the exception of the United States , Israel -- the only predominantly Jewish country in the world -- is the most secure , tolerant , free , economic and opportunity laden place in the world that Muslims can live ( this includes people of all religions by the way ) . In spite of decades of ceaseless barbaric attacks targeting innocent Israelis by Muslims , not only can Muslims become citizens in Israel , but they become citizens with every one of the same privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can and do hold any political office , and have every privilege that every other Israeli citizen enjoys . They have full equality with every other citizen under Israeli law and are treated as welcomed members of Israeli society . <p> And this is n't just theoretical . Twenty percent of Israels population is Muslim . And Muslims living in Israel have some of the highest average household income of any Muslims in the world . <p> If Muslims loved Israel -- a place where they have more prosperity and freedom then any of the Muslim countries of the world -- and if they loved Jews , it would be easy to understand why . <p> But what is impossible to understand is why liberal Jews seem to go out of their way to embrace Islam . Even including Hitler , there is no person or group of people in the world who have been more evil to Jews in the history of mankind than Muslims . You hear the often repeated myth that Jews kicked Muslims out of Palestine and that 's why Muslims hate Jews so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation called Palestine in the history of the world by the way .. so even that is a myth ) . <p> It kind of reminds me of the liberal myth that Muslims hate Americans so much because we started wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . Muslims in these countries declared war on us , not the other way around . We did n't start those wars . What we did is that we finally began to defend ourselves in a war in Afghanistan at the end of 2001 and Iraq in 2003 after several hundred years of being attacked and terrorized by Muslims in those regions and mostly just absorbing it . Both of these US defensive operations began AFTER and AS A RESULT OF the most deadly mass murder on American soil in history committed by Muslim terrorists on 9/11/2001 . <p> So anyway , you often hear this myth that Jews stole land from Muslims and that 's what gives them an excuse to attack them . Right . Add it to the long list of other excuses Muslims have for genocide and mass murder and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like free speech , they do n't like women being able to drive , to vote , to be seen in public without a man , to show their faces in public .

These are a few of the various excuses Muslim terrorists seem to have to commit mass genocide and murder like savage animals .

The rest of the world is new to the party , but better late then never . <p> But there is something missing here , that you NEVER hear about .

Of the millions of Jews who lived in Muslims countries of the Middle East a few hundred years ago , virtually NONE live there today . They were all murdered or driven out . And not only are they not permitted to live there , or become citizens ( not that they would want to live in these barbaric dictatorships ) , but in some of these Muslim countries , they are not even allowed to enter the country . <p> Note that not all Jews are liberals . There is a steep divide in the Jewish community today between liberals and conservatives . You can find dedicated ideologues on both sides of that equation in the Jewish community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are so few Jews -- only about 2% of the US population and only about 14 million total in the entire world -- they constitute some of the most vocal and effective voices not only for liberal points of view , but for conservative points of view too . <p> In any event , in light of the treatment Jews have received from Muslims over millennia of persecution and terrorization it seems astounding to me that ANY Jew could embrace Islam . It is at least the equivalent of embracing Hitler , but for many reasons even worse . It could n't be any more obvious that Muslims HATE Jews ( and Christians , and Buddhists , and Hindus and ... fill in the blanks ) .

I had my oldest son with my first exhusband and my other two boys from my second exhusband . I get along with both of the dads .

Sometimes people just ca n't click as a couple , but can be great friends . Nothing wrong with that ! <p> I applaud your efforts to remain friends for the sake of the child and if anyone you are dating can not see the importance of that then they are probably not going to be a very good influence on you or your child . It makes me sick to see parents drag their children into their own issues . Worse yet , and happens too often , is the parents use the child as a weapon . It takes two strong people to put aside their own emotions for the sake of a child . And it is the children who should be priority , period . Again I commend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . If the man you are dating is right , he will understand and encourage this and that will also become part of your bond with eachother . <p> With all that ...

Other ancient texts relay a similar tale of our beginnings , but also add reincarnation and claim that the two parts of our souls now subconsciously gravitate toward each other throughout every incarnation here on earth . <p> Once I studied these aspects of our soul I set about to try to identify which of the people in my life might be my soul mate , and how would I know it because I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close to . It took some analysis to decide just which ones made me feel " alive " when I am with them , but I narrowed it down to two ; my best female friend ( not romantic ) and a male acquaintance who I would really like to get to know a lot better ( borderline romantic ) . Some day we probably will hook-up , but he 's firmly entrenched in another town keeping up with his 93 year old dad there . Likewise my career is here and I keep up with my 84 year old mother , and we compare notes on them ... just one of the many similarities between us . <p> Another part of my study included Astrology , which claims certain aspects in chart comparisons are strong indicator of a soul mate connection , and guess what ? ? ? the charts of both my female friend and male friend meet the soul mate criteria with me . No one else in my life even comes close , not even my mother . <p> A thorough study of astrology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birth of those you study , and the software or the know-how to cast and compare charts . Fortunately I was able to achieve all of the above to make a complete study of it . And while it has been a fascinating study , in the end I only came away more confused ... trying to figure out which of the two is truly my soul mate , or can we have more than one ? <p> Anyway , that is where my interest in this " study of the soul " hit a dead end I gave it up lol . <p> Belle <p> Edited on 2/2/2007 1:39 AM <p> Feb 2 , 2007 @ 1:41 AM <p> What does the term ' Soul Mate ' mean to you and have you ever had one ? <p> sweet5red <p> Posts : 13,120 <p> to me soulmate is the one that can finish your thoughts and your sentences .. he or she knows what you are thinkin and your hearts desire .. they touch you to your very soul .. and they can be gone just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet mine but i know he s out there .. but i 'm waiting and lookin ..

@@37128612 @6128612/ <p> Ah , the internet , such a great place to make and lose ' friends ' in the blink of an eye , or more to the point , the stroke of a key . Most of us choose friends based on similar values and commonalities . Maybe I should clarify that with ' seemingly ' - as many times those things that were in common , changed , or perhaps were not really what was ' thought ' , assumed or presumed in the first place . <p> In real and virtual life , I have friends from all walks of life . Some are extremely religious , while I 'm not , and others have political views very different from my own . With my religious friends , with some of them , we discuss religion and spirituality and some of them , our views are so different , we leave the subject completely alone . The same goes for my friends that are interested in politics . We 'll discuss some topics , but for the most part , not at all . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they say , I have my own opinions and will not be swayed by bullying . <p> In fact , if someone thinks they can bully me into agreeing with them , that 's a surefire way for me to end the friendship - real or virtual . That is not going to happen , and if they ca n't respect that I do n't agree with them , and leave the subject alone , then they are n't worth having in my life . I may not respect their belief or opinion , but I respect their right to have it . <p> And no , I do n't need to gather people around me to take my ' side ' in order to make someone else ' wrong ' . If we do n't agree , we do n't agree and it 's not something that needs to be ' either you agree and are my friend , or you do n't and you 're not ' . No , it 's simply a difference of opinion . It does n't need to end a friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a different one . <p> Making it an either/or situation , in my opinion , is childish and shows a real lack of maturity on both the one trying to force others to choose sides , and those that choose to do so . <p> Was the friendship ever that strong or important in the first place ? Probably not . To me , it is extremely evident that when someone shows they 've chosen a side , that they 've lost any right or privilege to anything personal in my life . I have no time or interest for childish manipulation or games of ' who do you like best ? ' . <p> As disappointing as it is , I have to accept that the friendship was a learning experience - for me to learn who to trust and respect , and not to dispense these two values to just anyone that decides to wander into my life . It 's also a lesson that not all my friends are going to like each other , and that 's okay . As long as they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't really care . They 'll just have to get along when we 're all together , or decline being in each other 's company . If they ca n't be civil to each other , then ignore each other . If they ca n't do that , then they need to decline the invitation . If they 're going to create drama , then they 'll be off my ' friends ' list pronto . <p> It 's also a learning and growing experience in how to handle friends that do n't get along . Learning how to simply ignore attempts to sabotage , belittle and undermine the other friend and tell them in no uncertain terms that I do n't want to hear it . Period . If the ' friend ' is truly as bad as the other person says , then they 'll show their true colours soon enough , and at that point I 'll make a decision . But it 's not up to anyone else to make that decision for me , and I resent manipulative attempts . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I ' unfriend ' a person , it will be done quietly , without fuss . No revenge or vengeful attacks , no publicity , no drama . Just a simple click of the button . That 's it . You 'll probably never even realize it until months later . You make it clear that you 've chosen sides and do n't have the integrity to be able to be friends with both people , then you 'll be quietly dismissed as being inconsequential . <p> And that 's the beauty , the ugliness and impermanence of the internet . Relationships are n't ' real ' , and few people are really invested in anyone else . Relationships , if you can call them that , are superficial for many people - only lasting as long as total agreement lasts , or as long as they 've chosen your ' side ' . <p> Fortunately , there are some people that are true friends , that do n't choose ' sides ' , that are not so immature or insecure that they require people to agree with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be manipulated by other 's efforts to make them choose sides . And no , no one can ' make ' another person choose a side . If one chooses sides , the key word is choose . It 's a choice one makes on their own . If a friend chooses to believe the worst of another friend , based on what a disgruntled person says , then they are n't much of a friend and are n't worth having anyway . <p> I pity those that need to manipulate people into taking sides , along with those that are manipulated . What an unsatisfactory life they must lead . It 's akin to having to ' buy ' one 's friends , although not in a monetary sense , certainly in the sense of ' buying ' their trust . <p> I 've learned over the years that true mature friends , build each other up . They encourage each other to be the best they can be , and they ' share ' friends , as in , there 's no competition as to who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just remember that when you choose a ' side ' - you 've made a choice and do n't expect the person you 've sided against to open their arms or their friendship if or when you find out you 've chosen wrongly and for the wrong reasons . <p> The beauty of someone choosing sides , is they prove who they are , their immaturity , their insecurity , their disloyalty and their lack of integrity . It defines them - not you . <p> Second off this is a nice thought provoking blog but I 'm all thunk out for the day . So I will reread this when my brain is fresher and respond appropriately but I think great minds think alike . <p> I do know that I loathe someone wanting me to take sides . <p> hpylady <p> Aug 18 @ 5:00PM <p> Now that 's a blog <p> I have visions of the old west and someone choosing the other side .. they would n't make it to the other side , they 'd get shot in the back . That 's why if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards with my gun drawn . <p> I will stay out of fights between those who are my friends . As much as I would love to step in to play peacemaker , there are times where I can see it is n't going to help . And I totally respect those who do not draw me into it . I do n't mind when friends vent , that 's fine . I do n't respond well to being told I HAVE to choose one over the other . Thankfully , that has n't happened in a long time . Last time I had a situation like that , I was hanging out on yahoo message boards . And that was 13-14 years ago . <p> Friends come and go in our lives . I 've made great friends online who I know the chances of actually meeting face to face is almost impossible , but I still value their friendships as much as I value my in life friends I hang out with at home . <p> ( yeah I know ... just because I do n't agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't comprehend what you are saying here ... in the rest of your blog ... ) and choose to comment ..

Relationships , if you can call them that , are superficial for many people - only lasting as long as total agreement lasts , or as long as they 've chosen your ' side ' . <p> you did say many ... and maybe so ... but I would hope that as people grow and hopefully get to be smarter and more wise .. they will see that the internet is real ... just different than face to face ... and this concept of " anything goes " .. just because it is online will fade away .. <p> perspective you ask ? ? <p> google " taylor chapman dunkin donuts " first .. read all about her ... and think about how you all would react ... online ..

It was also important that a person taking Lithium had enough sodium in their diets because Lithium is excreted primarily by the kidney ; adequate renal function and adequate salt and fluid intake are essential in order to avoid lithium accumulation and intoxication . Thus , a decision to initiate lithium therapy should be preceded by a thorough clinical examination and evaluation of each patient , including laboratory determinations , ECG , and a very careful assessment of renal function . When sodium intake is lowered , lithium excretion is reduced . Diminished intake or excessive loss of salt and fluids , as a result of vomiting , diarrhea , perspiration or use of diuretics will also increase lithium retention .

I only see the relationship heading south . <p> If your children see you unhappy when he is around , they ca n't make any change to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in relief when he is not there while the kids are , something is all wrong . If your not ready to end it just yet due to evaluation of everything going on , try setting up a meet with him in a small local restaurant for breakfast or lunch when the kids are with dad . Be prepared ahead of time on what you want to cover and your feeling . Maybe it will get resolved on issues , or maybe you will make a final decision . That way you wo n't have no regrets or blame yourself for anything because you did everything you possibly could do to salvage the relationship and still continue to be an awsome mom .

" <p> While researching the Buddhist information , I came across this article and thought it absofrikkenlutely wonderful ... thought I would share ... <p> In Buddhist teachings , greed , hatred , and delusion are known , for good reason , as the three poisons , the three unwholesome roots , and the three fires . These metaphors suggest how dangerous afflictive thoughts and emotions can be if they are not understood and transformed . Greed refers to our selfishness , misplaced desire , attachment , and grasping for happiness and satisfaction outside of ourselves . Hatred refers to our anger , our aversion and repulsion toward unpleasant people , circumstances , and even toward our own uncomfortable feelings . Delusion refers to our dullness , bewilderment , and misperception ; our wrong views of reality . The poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion are a byproduct of ignorance " ignorance of our true nature , the awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance , these poisonous states of mind then motivate nonvirtuous and unskillful thoughts , speech , and actions , which cause all manner of suffering and unhappiness for ourselves and others . <p> Greed , hatred , and delusion are deeply embedded in the conditioning of our personalities . Our behavior is habitually influenced and tainted by these three poisons , these unwholesome roots buried deep into our mind . Burning within us as lust , craving , anger , resentment , and misunderstanding , these poisons lay to waste hearts , lives , hopes , and civilizations , driving us blind and thirsty through the seemingly endless round of birth and death ( samsara ) . The Buddha describes these defilements as bonds , fetters , hindrances , and knots ; the actual root cause of unwholesome karma and the entire spectrum of human suffering . <p> Although this teaching may appear negative or unpleasant , indeed , a wise understanding of the three poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion is ultimately positive and empowering . With this sublime understanding we can clearly see and feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our lives . And with this clarity and insight , we can make the choice to eliminate those factors ! The teaching of The Four Noble Truths clearly explains that when we embrace and understand the exact causes of our suffering and dissatisfaction , we can then take the necessary steps to extinguish those causes and liberate ourselves . This is certainly positive and empowering . In addition , it is important for us to realize that the Dharma teachings regarding defilement and purification are not just rigid , restrictive , or authoritarian theories regarding morality , but are real and solid facts essential to our correct understanding of reality and eventual awakening . <p> GreedOur greed is a burning desire , an unquenchable thirst ( tanha ) , craving , and lust ; we want the objects of our desire to provide us with lasting satisfaction so we feel fulfilled , whole , and complete . The poison of greed creates an inner hunger so that we always seem to be striving towards an unattainable goal . We mistakenly believe our happiness is dependent upon that goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction . Then once again , our greed and desire will arise , looking outside of ourselves for the next thing that will hopefully bring satisfaction . Influenced by greed , we are never content . Another common face of our greed shows up as a lack of generosity and compassion toward others . Greed can manifest itself in even more compulsive and destructive ways as well . We always seem to want more , we want bigger and better , we want to fulfill our insatiable inner hunger and thirst ( craving ) . This type of greed affects our personal lives , our professional lives , and the domain of international business and politics . Global conflict and warfare , as well as the destruction of our precious environment are obvious symptoms of our corporate and political greed . Our greed , craving , and thirst affects each of us on a personal and global level . Our greed is an endless and pernicious cycle that only brings suffering and unhappiness in its wake . <p> HatredThe symptoms of hatred can show up as anger , hostility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering upon another person . With aversion , we habitually resist , deny , and avoid unpleasant feelings , circumstances , and people we do not like . We want everything to be pleasant , comfortable , and satisfying all the time . This behavior simply reinforces our perception of duality and separation . Hatred or anger thrusts us into a vicious cycle of always finding conflict and enemies everywhere around us . When there is conflict or perceived enemies around us , our mind is neurotic , never calm , we are endlessly occupied with strategies of self-protection or revenge . We can also create conflict within ourselves when we have an aversion to our own uncomfortable feelings . With hatred and aversion , we deny , resist , and push away our own inner feelings of fear , hurt , loneliness , and so forth , treating these feelings like an internal enemy . With the poison of hatred , we create conflict and enemies in the world around us and within our own being . <p> DelusionDelusion is our wrong understanding or wrong views of reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; our inability to understand the nature of things exactly as they are , free of perceptual distortions . Influenced by delusion , we are not in harmony with ourselves , others , or with life ; we are not living in accordance with Dharma . Affected by the poison of delusion , which arises from ignorance of our true nature , we do not understand the interdependent and impermanent nature of life . Thus , we are constantly looking outside of ourselves for happiness , satisfaction , and solutions to our problems . <p> This outward searching creates even more frustration , anger , and delusion . Because of our delusion , we also do not understand the virtuous , life-affirming actions that create happiness , nor do we understand the nonvirtuous , negative , and unwholesome actions that create suffering . Again , our delusion binds us to a vicious cycle where there does not appear to be any way out . <p> The Antidotes <p> In addition to meditation practice , there are also the antidotes or alternatives to the three poisons . For every defilement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereby we eliminate unwholesome mental attitudes and replace them with virtuous , wholesome attitudes which benefit ourselves and others . Therefore , the entire aim of spiritual practice is to gradually subdue the poisons of greed , hatred , and delusion by cultivating the alternative mental factors that are directly opposed to them . These antidotes are called the three wholesome roots : non-greed , non-hatred , and non-delusion . <p> To antidote and overcome greed , we learn to cultivate selflessness , generosity , detachment , and contentment . If we are experiencing greed , strong desire , or attachment and we want to let it go , we can contemplate the impermanence or the disadvantages of the objects of our desire . We can practice giving away those things we would most like to hold onto . We can also practice acts of selfless service and charity , offering care and assistance to others in any way we can , free of all desire for recognition or compensation . In truth , there is no objection to enjoying and sharing the beauty , pleasures , and objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment only arise when we mistakenly believe and act as if the source of our happiness is outside of ourselves . <p> To antidote and overcome hatred , we learn to cultivate loving-kindness , compassion , patience , and forgiveness . When we react to unpleasant feelings , circumstances , or people , with hatred , anger , or aversion , we can use these sublime antidotes to counteract the poisons . Here we learn to openly embrace the entire spectrum of our experiences without hatred or aversion . Just as we practice meeting unpleasant experiences in the outer world with patience , kindness , forgiveness , and compassion , we must also practice meeting our own unpleasant feelings in the same way . Our feelings of loneliness , hurt , doubt , fear , insecurity , inadequacy , depression , and so forth , all require our openness and loving-kindness . Our challenge in spiritual practice is to soften our habitual defenses , open our heart , and let go of hatred , aversion , and denial . In this way , we can meet and embrace ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassion and wisdom . <p> To antidote and overcome delusion , we cultivate wisdom , insight , and right understanding . Learning to experience reality exactly as it is , without the distortions of our self-centered desires , fears , and expectations , we free ourselves from delusion . Deeply sensing and acting in harmony with the interdependent , impermanent , and ever-changing nature of this world " realizing that all living beings are inseparably related and that lasting happiness does not come from anything external " we free ourselves from delusion . As we develop a clear understanding of karma , knowing the positive , wholesome actions that bring happiness and the negative , unwholesome actions that bring suffering , we cultivate the wisdom , insight , and right understanding that free us from delusion . <p> As you spoke of something hitting you upside the head and speaking " duh " to you , I relate .

Not that you yourself ca n't do anything . You always have the option to leave . One thing I have never understood is ( and I know several people who have been in this situation ) when someone marries someone they were actually cheating with at the start of a relationship , why are they so surprised when their mate continues cheating on them ? 
@@37128635 @6128635/ <p> Twice in the past month and a half , I 've detected a slight burning smell coming from my computer . I 've removed the sliding panel to make sure there was nothing overheating ( at least to the eye ) and that the fan was moving freely . I try and keep it as dust-free as possible . It 's completely open on all sides for circulation . To be honest , I 'm afraid of a fire.Does anyone have an idea what might be causing this problem ?

It was only the fan but I made Dell send me a new one anyway . <p> Now that I have learned a few things about computers I would recommend that you have one build or build one yourself . You can make a better computer than you can buy for less money than it would cost for a comparable unit . The one I am using now would cost me around 3000 from Dell or Gateway but I only spent 2000 on parts .

A computer is a electronic machine capable of solving problems by processing or manipulating information according to instructions that have been given to it . <p> When we say processing or manipulating , we mean that information is changed in some way . If we have typed in a list of employees into the computer , and we want to alphabetize the list , the act of placing the names in alphabetical sequence is considered as processing . <p> Electronically all computers work pretty much the same way . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate only on the Microcomputers in this tutorial ( commonly known as " Personal Computers " ) . <p> Minicomputers . Mid-size computers , non-portable types . Common minicomputers are DEC Vax/750 models . They often appear as mainframes . They are gradually disappearing from the marketplace . <p> Mainframe Computers . These are large computers , often occupying a large room . They are generally used by banks , universities , and some government functions such as IRS , etc . They lost sales during the 1980-1991 era , but were predicted to regain some leverage in 1993 and 1994 . They may continue to lose ground with the advent of some smaller computers such as the Zenith Z-Server , DEC AlphaServer , and other multi-CPU products housed in small cabinets . <p> Supercomputers . The most powerful computers . They are very fast , and have extremely high storage capacity , probably in the terra byte range . Used in research , weather forecasting , modeling or simulations , etc. 
@@37128636 @6128636/ <p> This is one of those stories where one action leads to another . My vision is darn awful . Over the past year the optic nerve in my right eye died . My left eye thankfully is doing what eyes are suppose to do . So I take my good eye to finally get a new pair of glasses . I am lured into lens crafters by a insanely great opportunity .

Then I recalled that my best friend who has no wrinkles on her face gave me a tube of Retin A. After a massive search I locate the sucker and proceed to apply it to those evil wrinkles . Within minutes I felt the burn . I may have applied too much . Today I look like I have a sunburn , so I guess peeling comes next . My friend told me today was that I only needed to use a pea size amount . I think I went for a artichoke amount . In six weeks I am suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . My suggestion to anyone reading this is . Do not look at yourself in the mirror if you get new glasses , no matter how much you want to . <p> Update .. When I returned to work on August 1st a bunch of coworkers said I looked relaxed and refreshed . One said my face looked " Dewey " . I still see the wrinkles , but I feel the fine lines have been reduced . I am going to keep slathering on the Retin A. One less fine line is a good thing .

@@37128650 @6128650/ <p> How do you feel about holding hands ? Do you like it ? Or does it depend on the person you 're holding hands with ? Granted , most people do n't hold the hand of a person they do n't truly care about , unless , perhaps , they 've been together for a long time , and it has become more habit than anything . <p> I like hand holding , myself , with someone special . But it has to be someone special , and it has to be a firm but gentle hand holding . Not so tight that you feel like you 're going to be dragged off to the nearest cave . Nor so loose that you may as well be holding a dead fish . Ugh . Intertwining fingers is really nice . Again , firm but gentle . <p> Hopefully , they do n't have clammy palms . That 's not exactly appealing , although if in a new relationship , hand-holding for the first time may have a clammy feel if one or the other party is nervous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Holding the hand of a child has to be the best . Some of my fondest memories are holding my daughter 's hand while walking along the beach as she chattered up a storm . Slipping her hand out of mine to run and investigate or inspect something , then running back to show me , once again slipping that small hand into mine , conveying so much trust and love . <p> One particular memory is when I had to appear in court to fight a speeding ticket . I went with my young pre-school daughter , who would have been about four at the time . The officer presented his testimony , saying that I 'd passed on a double yellow line and was speeding at well over the speed limit . He lied . Fortunately , I drove that route every day twice a day , and knew exactly where I 'd passed and what it looked like . <p> I 'd told my daughter to sit in the pews as I got up to stand before the judge . I refuted the cop 's testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , and that the broken/solid line began and at which point I passed . I advised the judge that I 'd passed as I 'd followed the car ahead of me from 160th Street to 200th and he slowed down to under the speed limit when we could n't pass , then sped up when we could . <p> I told the judge I would still be driving to my destination if I 'd had to follow him further and that the rules of the road say when you pass , pass quickly . Which I did . As I spoke to the judge , my daughter , sitting behind where I was standing , quietly walked up and slipped her hand in to mine . The judge tried to suppress a smile as she did this , and as I said I 'd still be driving if I had to continue to follow the idiot . <p> I got off with a light fine , and the judge said it seemed like I knew the area where I 'd passed . In other words , yeah , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they nicked me with a lighter fine . I 've never heard of anyone passing at the speed limit . <p> Those are the days . The days of innocence and trust all rolled into one tiny little hand as it firmly grasps yours . Pretty much the same as any hand holding , adult to adult . Not too tight that it hurts , but not too loose that you feel they 'll slip away . A contact that says , I love you and I trust you - to lead sometimes , to protect when needed , but mostly to just feel the connection of companionship , love and caring . <p> Is n't that what touch is all about ? An indication of caring ? Is a hug more intimate than holding hands ? I do n't think so , and it 's more acceptable in our society to hug a person , than it is hold their hand , particularly when they 're the same gender . Perhaps because a hug is brief ( usually ) and can indicate caring without commitment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really enjoy holding hands with a loved one . I do believe it 's in our nature to want to be touched . At least , in most people 's nature .

When I first started reading my memories rushed back to when my children were little then your writing captured it all . Touche ! <p> My Mom always holds my hand , even still especially when we travel in the car .

We took from the white man what was good , tried to reject what was n't and learnt to look to tomorrow instead of always looking back . <p> The Israelis need to enforce and stop deal making and get on with their manifest destiny .

Look it up . <p> Israel was born out of Nathan Rothschild 's greed and the self hatred and guilt of white Europeans after the two world wars , particularly the British .

Jews have had a continuous presence there for thousands of years . 2 . It was lawfully granted to them by a legally sanctioned international body . 3 . They legally purchased it . 4 . They invested enormous amounts of their own resources and turned a wasteland that no one cared about and countries like Egypt were glad to get rid of , into a heavenly oasis in the dessert filled with freedom , human rights , the only democracy in the regiou and enormously disproportional contributions to the rest of the world in the areas of medicine , science , health , technology and a number of other fields that have improved the lives of every human being on the planet . <p> This tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims by the way has contributed more good to mankind for its size than any other nation in history with the possible exception of the United States . <p> And by the way , unlike the Muslim countries that surround Israel , who murdered or expelled the millions of Jews who lived there for thousands of years ( that no one ever talks about ) , Muslims living in Israel have a better life than Muslims living anywhere else in the Middle East including full citizenship rights such as voting and holding political office . And they have higher average incomes than Muslims in any other country in the Middle East . They have 100% of the same rights as Jewish Israeli citizens have . Why ?

Ceylon tea is a particularly prized form of black tea from Sri Lanka . <p> Anyway , as far as the kidney stone thingy goes , tea contains high concentrations of oxalate , one of the key chemicals that lead to the formation of kidney stones . But remember , the most common cause of kidney stones is the failure to drink enough fluids ( like WATER ) . To quench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative than water , <p> People concerned about developing kidney stones should cut back on eating foods that also contain high concentrations of oxalates such as spinach , chocolate , rhubarb and nuts . They should ease up on salt , eat meat sparingly and drink several glasses a water a day . <p> I have heard urban legends that state that antacid tablets and iced tea will give you kidney stones . Well , the tea will of course , but do n't avoid foods high in calcium because of this myth . Calcium reduces the amount of oxalate the body absorbs and in turn , foods with high amounts of oxalate reduce the absorption of calcium . <p> shyflygemini <p> Dec 29 @ 6:12PM <p> Thanks for your comments everyone .

@@37128678 @6128678/ <p> Depression Makes You Stupid ! ! I recently read an excellent book about the brain called " Mind Wide Open , " in which a man undergoes battery after battery of tests to determine brain function and thereby improve himself . <p> There is evidence to prove that when one is sad , activity in the frontal lobe is vastly reduced , hindering thinking and creativity . Yes , the book came out and said it : " Sadness ( depression ) can make you stupid . " <p> It is one of the most interesting books I have ever read . <p> Why is one depressed ? One reason is the amygdala , a section of the brain that records traumatic events , and can pull them up to help with fight or flight response . For example , the author lives in New York . For example , if you have ever been bitten by a rattlesnake , the amygdala will record all that happened in exacting detail . Anytime you hear a similar rattle , the amygdala will say to the memory : " Pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " The amygdala then helps you switch to fight or flight response by showing it to you . You see , the memory was recorded for two purposes . One , it is often brought up to remind you to not get in that situation again . Two , if you are in that situation , you can react . <p> Freud stated that we mostly seek pleasure . But while visiting wounded World War I veterans in a hospital , he became puzzled as to why their minds almost automatically went to their most traumatic experiences of the conflict . The above reason is why . <p> Since our brains are hard-wired to record stressful and fearful experiences in the most detail possible , the memory record of a good experience is usually recorded in far less detail . <p> When you consider the fact that depression reduces cotrex function , it is easy to conclude that one should try not to think about bad experiences , except to add " good " things to them . That is why the mental health professional 's office is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a non-threatening environment , thereby adding some " pleasant " details to the memory . Even then , one should think about their bad experiences as little as possible , and relive the best memories over and over . As the bad memories have more detail , this is often hard to do . <p> I will use myself as an example of what I should do . Not what I have been doing , but what I should do and intend to do after reading this book . One of my best memories is receiving the first author 's copy of my novel . I eagerly tore it out of that UPS box . I sat in a chair with the television and stereo off thinking " Did I really do this ? After three years of writing and four years of trying to find a publisher , has it finally paid off ? Am I dreaming ? " <p> Another good memory was when I took on a crooked judge . It is too long to explain here , but a crooked judge took advantage of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost two years , i received a call that the TN state government was going to take him to trial . Now THAT is a great memory that I should live over and over and over , according to this book . But it has an associated bad memory : he was found guilty , but the court did not do too much too him . When the reporter called to tell me the news , I had a fit ! All that work for not much ! But ... due to bad publicity , he lost the next election , taking only 25% of the vote . So there is a good memory I can associate with the bad to lower the sad feeling . <p> Also , depression is bad for your physical health-- most , if not all , know this . So waht can you do to reverse that ? <p> The book recommends , among other things ... tickling ! Yes , you read that right ! The book tells us that we are at often at our best when there is humor around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides attending comedy shows or watching a funny movie , tickling is a great way to induce laughter . He tells us that chimps , with whom we share 99% of our genes , love tickling . When humor is present , a brain chemical called oxytocin is working hard . This chemical is also heavily involved with love and nurturing . Oxytocin , not oxycontin , lol ! <p> Let me use myself as an example . I once moved into an area where some of my step family do not have the best reputations , and I was stereotyped , presumed to be like them . I was n't exactly well liked there . I became sad , depressed . And I did n't think clearly . But I met two brothers , Tony and Carlton , who helped me out a lot , and hung with me despite what others thought . And my thinking cleared and improved . <p> One very interesting thought : The police can arrest you for illegal recreational drugs , drugs that have almost exact counterparts in your brain ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Brain mapping machines can be used to show the abundance and location of " pleasure " or " love " chemicals in your brain . They are usually shown in red . Brains of alcoholics show little red , and cocaine addicts ' brains usually show no red at all ! ! <p> The writer , Steven Johnson , goes to various experimental clinics that show neurofeedback and which parts of the brain are working and how well they are doing . Using such machines can help you train your brain to operate on certain waves and produce needed chemicals . No , this is still expermental , but the author thinks that these machines MAY someday reduce the need for drugs such as SSRIs ( Prozac , Paxil , Zoloft , etc ) that increase helpful chemicals such as seratonin . He worked with at least two machines that help with attention span ! <p> The brain has sections which he calls modules , which can work together or not work together . You may see something in a certain part of your brain , but the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another part . There are many , many parts ( modules ) that have specific jobs . <p> So , if you know much about Freud , you know that not long ago , he was considered wrong on most things ; now with some of above evidence , the pendulum is swinging back . Freud was right on many aspects . No , everything is not related to sex-- on that part Freud was way off . Sex plays only a small part of brain function . Freud 's terms for the parts of the mind , i 'd , ego , superego are oversimplified , but in some ways essentially correct . He realized that the mind is divided into sometimes conflicting and sometimes cooperating parts , but he had no idea how many , many there are ! Let me use my own simile here . Freud 's idea is the Model T with not many parts , not to be compared with the modern auto 's many , many parts . His basic idea was correct . <p> In summation , this is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great reviews on amazon.com . The only bad reviews were by those who are already experts on brains , saying the book has little or nothing new in it . But it was not written for them .

Now if I was severly depressed I would not be able to act on this , however , one with suicidal ideations becomes more likely to act on those thoughts as they are coming out of a depression .

To achieve this , he bored an eye-hole near the cork-hole on about the same level as the bung-hole .

The eye-hole , which you might term , the peep-hole , enabled him to see his ear-hole through his arsehole , but preventing him from tapping the barrel , because in putting his foot through his armhole , he caught his bollocks in the bung-hole .

Unless you count children anyway . Most of my male friends are well over 6ft . <p> Well ... As a petitie woman , I have a height limit for the men I date because I do n't want to look shorter than I already am . In addition , it makes it very hard to conversate while walking because I 'm way down here and the guy is way up there . I also think that it just looks very strange too see couples with major height differences . But I think the main prob is that people who differ in sizes generally do n't go after their opposites . For me , I would never approach a guy that was like super tall and big because I would just assume that he 'd only be interested in women who were big and tall like him .

@@37128722 @6128722/ <p> A friend asked me the other night what I really wanted in a man . One would think after around forty years of being a single woman , either I should have a pretty good idea , or ... maybe I do n't really want a man ... <p> The timing of the question was interesting to me as I had been talking with another friend about the very subject just the week prior . ( She is newly engaged and wanting everyone to share her present bliss . ) I had asked her if it was wrong to want it all . <p> I have some pretty non-conforming ideas on religion and politics and loving and caring for one 's self and life and living in general . Is it too much to ask for someone who shares my views ? There are some things that matter less to me than others , but there are a great many things on which I have rather strong opinions -- things that run a bit contrary to the norm . Have I adopted these positions as a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any potential mate ? <p> The odd thing is that in my past , rather than letting similar interests and goals guide me in the men who get my attention , I go for the men who play out the same flaws most evident in my primary care-givers : Control and abandonment . I think on some level they are elements I exhibit as a part of the love I learned , but generally I see them only in the men I desire . The problem with the two elements are that they work against one another . The control can feel like love until it becomes too great and then I must abandon . Or the abandonment can create in me so great a need to give and receive love that I must seek to control . The result is always the same -- loss .... <p> Running that pattern over and over for so many years has made me skeptical of finding love -- of attracting someone who is not in the same play . I want to quit doing the same things over and over again expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little different direction -- cover a bit different territory , but there will be more space for that angle . <p> New results can not mean that I do not want a man . That is the result I have had so far all my life . I want a man who makes me want to be a better woman . It made for a good movie line because there is truth to it , I think . A loving relationship should be symbiotic -- where the total is greater than the sum of the parts . So , I want a man who I can also inspire to be a better man . That does n't mean I am looking for a man whom I could love with these few changes , or one who would love me with a few changes , but rather that we can bring out the best in one another -- from the well-spring that already resides in each of us . <p> Long ago in my NLP courses , I learned a definition of deserving . Deserving is the ability to distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very best me . I want a man I truly deserve . Distinguishing and appreciating me requires a great deal more than looking at my photos -- though that can be a place to start . Distinguishing and appreciating you will take some time . <p> Interesting Lacy because I was having a conversation from another angle of something similar ... does the web raise our expectations , and consequently our sense of ' nah ' . In not knowing exactly what will fit , and having so many choices , none feel right because they are all too minimally real people in a profile or even in emails , chats or phonecalls . Too minimal . So we filter ... but the more we do , the more comfortable we grow with saying ... ' nah . ' <p> We meet ... but in the back of our heads ... we remember the few other profiles that seemed really fascinating ... but we hesitated ... because the closer the fit , the more we fear the rejection . So we wait until we get the proverbial balls to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we ' settled ' for our partners ... tired and afraid of the process , eager to be who we were expected to be ... and certain that the ones we were really attracted to ... would never be attracted to us ... so we settled on what was near and in front of us ... <p> remember ... the more we desire an object , the more we fear it , because failure to obtain only proves and reinforces what we feared about ourselves for so long ... we 're not as lovable , deserving , as we want others to believe we think we are ? <p> I do n't worry any longer about whether I deserve . I just focus on having sex again before I am 60 . I think with a little over 5 years to go ... I can do this ! <p> Peas ! <p> Blondino <p> Jan 22 @ 1:38PM <p> knowing there are open minded and compassionate people in your country <p> What a wonderful blog , containing many thoughts about things that almost every person that 's alone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you concern over what you want . You want what you want . If it were as simple as just compromising , you and millions of others would 've done that long ago .

We are blessed . Hugs Michael <p> Ya know wanting someone to make you the best person you can and visa versus is a good thing I think even if whilst waiting on that person may mean you get lonely at times ..... spent many a year in a relationship where I was lonely because he was not the right person .... not good ...... I would rather be lonely and in hope than lonely without hope <p> awesome blog there is never a happy medium , i know from expreience my ex husband an abuser , my ex boyfriend cared only about his needs wants , so i have dicided to be alone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much not sure how long that imight be but i have the time <p> " I want a man who makes me want to be a better woman . ... So , I want a man who I can also inspire to be a better man . ... that we can bring out the best in one another -- from the well-spring that already resides in each of us . " <p> Was trying to say the same thing in my profile , but you said it much better . That would be the best thing a relationship could ever have , IMHO ... <p> Having come here a second time it is very interesting to find that I had read this blog before and left a comment . The second time back through this blog has made me truly realize that this blog could easily have come from my own hand . I am pondering all of those questions myself lately . Just the other day I was really asking that whole question about is it wrong to want it all ? My answer is always no . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death but I do believe that it 's not a mistake to want that which sets your heart on fire with love , grace and beauty , and I as I was saying to somebody the other day , I think that 's the challenge for some of us . To not abandon those beliefs . Simply because to abandon those beliefs would be to abandon our very self . Maybe it may seem far fetched and pie in the sky to some people but I 've pushed the limits of this world quite a bit over the past ten years or so and I know from experience that human beings are capable of so much more and yet are programmed to settle for so much less . To conform to agreed upon standards and beliefs that keep society one big conformist blob . Do n't get me wrong , I think for some people , the conformist blob is their dream and their goal , but that is n't me and it 's never going to be . Hugs Michael .

Sadly the brilliant man I was married to had a disconnect in his brain at the Organizational Skill junction . <p> I might not like it but I could compromise with a hoarder that kept their collection organized . However .. <p> I could NEVER deal with something like the unorganized hoarder again . Looking back over my 64 years I think that besides experiencing grief as traumatic , living with the extreme hoarder was next in line as being the most traumatic or having an the harshest impact on my life . I lived in fear of fire . <p> I bring this up because my dear ex , the good man I walked away from because he denied help for hoarding and said it was in my head .

However after we started home my son said Mom you could n't see inside the window nor could you see in the window because Junk was from floor to ceiling and it looked bad . <p> There is such a difference between a collector , a hoarder that is organized and the extreme hoarder lacking organizational skills .

@@37128748 @6128748/ <p> " Gelatin is a colorless or slightly yellow , transparent protein made by boiling animal hide , bones , and connective tissues ( i.e. , gristle ) . Manufacturers most commonly boil cow parts to make gelatin but any animal will do . " <p> Hmmm .. interesting .... after suggesting a google search myself I decided to take my own advice and I came up with the following : <p> Jell-O consists of four basic ingredients : <p> gelatin water sugar or artificial sweetener and artificial flavors food coloring The gelatin in Jell-O is what let 's you transform it into all sorts of different shapes . What exactly is gelatin ? Gelatin is just a processed version of a structural protein called collagen that is found in many animals , including humans . Collagen actually makes up almost a third of all the protein in the human body . It is a big , fibrous molecule that makes skin , bones , and tendons both strong and somewhat elastic . As you get older , your body makes less collagen , and individual collagen fibers become crosslinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints ( from less flexible tendons ) or wrinkles ( from loss of skin elasticity ) . The gelatin you eat in Jell-O comes from the collagen in cow or pig bones , hooves , and connective tissues . To make gelatin , manufacturers grind up these various parts and pre-treat them with either a strong acid or a strong base to break down cellular structures and release proteins like collagen . After pre-treatment , the resulting mixture is boiled . During this process , the large collagen protein ends up being partially broken down , and the resulting product is called gelatin . The gelatin is easily extracted because it forms a layer on the surface of the boiling mixture . Gelatin is a common ingredient in foods because it is so versatile . It can be used as a gelling agent ( as in Jell-O ) , as a thickener , an emulsifier , and a stabilizer . You 'll find it in a variety of foods , from yogurt to chewing gum . Here is a list of some other foods that commonly contain gelatin : gummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soups , sauces and gravies canned ham and chicken corned beef sausage Gelatin is even used to make the coating for pills that makes them easier to swallow . It 's also in cosmetics , lozenges , and ointments . When you buy a box of Jell-O ( or another brand of gelatin ) at the grocery store , you get a small packet of powdered gelatin with artificial flavorings and colors . At room temperature , the gelatin protein is in the form of a triple helix . This is a fairly ordered structure not unlike that of DNA . With DNA , two chains of nucleotides are twisted together in a spiral pattern . ( To learn more about DNA , see How Cells Work ) . In the gelatin protein , there are three separate chains of amino acids ( polypeptide chains ) have lined up and twisted around each other , and the helix is held together by weak bonds that form between the amino acids that end up on the inside of the coiled structure . <p> The above was found on http : **40;306;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following : <p> Popular belief has it that gelatin comes from horses ' and cows ' hooves .

This was allowed because the nurse offered to pay the mother 's hospital bill and the delivery . The nurse then took the vial of blood back to the cult and they had a ritual with it , placing a curse on this baby . When the baby became a teenager , the nurse blindfolded her and took her to the meeting place and they forced this young girl to become a member . She later became the " bride of satan .

When I was a kid , my parents divorced . It was unheard of in those days and I was embarrassed as to how to tell my friends . I was also confused because my parents NEVER fought in front of us kids . So why were they divorcing ? They just got along better not being married . They remained friends until the day my dad died in 1996 . My mother and dad both went out of their way to never say bad things about each other in front of us kids and actually to others as well . They kept the respect they had both earned as being either father or mother of their children . <p> The vows still read " ... for better or for worse ... " but for some reason the moment something happens the initial threat is " I 'M GETTING A DIVORCE ! " Or " I 'm leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their partners and from day 1 follwing the wedding they are insistent on changing the other person . If what the other person does bothers them so much then why did they marry them ? A ring and vows are not going to change anything . Oh the only change it DOES bring about is the partner is entitled to 50% of your assets . And you totally screw up your kids with your insistent and childish behaviors putting the child(ren) inbetween the mayhem . <p> A certain amount of change is inevitable . When you spend enough time around someone you are bound to pick up some of their nuances . Good or bad . And with age comes a mellowing and ease in which we handle things thrown our way . You have to also learn to agree to disagree . But for some reason partners feel the urge to argue when a person does n't agree in the relationship . <p> The other thing I have noticed is that infidelity is running running strong , even with all the STDs out there . If the person does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some that may not , but the larger percentage leans towards cheating . <p> There is also a strong showing of spousal abuse ( mental , emotional &amp; physical ) against both parties , even the men . <p> Children are looking to us as the example givers when it comes to formulating relationships both personal and business . When we degrade our partners , it 's low even when the kids are not around . Most people degrade someone else when they have little to no self-esteem , or because they themselves witnessed this at home as well growing up . But when the kids are around we psychologically scar them like in most PTSD situations . <p> Maybe that 's why I think people need to live together to see if those cutesy things your partner does will be cute 6 months down the road . Bringing up things the person has done 5 years ago is out of bounds . There is a statute of limitations as to how long you can bring up issues . Once it 's been discussed , let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you have to get a divorce , try to remain civil especially when there are children involved . The couple still remains mommy and daddy to those kids . And they love you both , like it or not . Do n't use visitation as a weapon to get the other person to behave . First of all the other person is not a child or even a dog . They do n't have to behave . Secondly you 're punishing the children . Watch what you say around the kids and around other family members . Do n't expect the other side 's family to side with you . They should n't even be involved . The situation is between you two and no one else . The world does NOT need to hear your business . The world has its own problems . <p> There are so many reasons our divorce rate is so high right now . It just ca n't be singled out to one reason . But people expecting EVERYTHING in life to be easy is a huge one . Vows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also think that lack of good communication is one of the biggest . It creates extreme frustration and tension between two people . There are many forms of communication between two people and all of them need to be strong . An example would be : two people are talking ....... one does n't agree/gets bored with the conversation/is just tired of listening ....... then just up and walks away from the conversation without another word . This seems to happen more and more often amongst couples . What is communicated is : " I am in control here " ....... " You bore me . " .......... " You are n't worth my time . " ........... " I only want to listen if I like the conversation . " ......... " I only want to spend time with you if it is easy . " , laziness and disrespect . Over time , as this scenario is repeated , great tension builds and the marriage begins to rock . <p> Although I am not " looking " for anyone I would like to eventually find someone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let things happen naturally . I think that is the beginning of where a marriage fails . Instead of just ' living ' and letting things flow with someone they meet through everyday life and conversations , they get it in their head that they " have to have someone " , pick someone , move too fast and just plain go into it without the right attitude . <p> Although I am comfortable with being single and would not be sad or feel unfulfilled if I stayed that way , I truly would like to eventually find Mr. Right For Me and have the loving , give/take marriage that I do still see quite a few people have . The divorce rate is high , but not all end in divorce . <p> I belong to a square dance club here in our town . I have been a member for around 6 years or so . Our club is made up of mostly couples with a few singles thrown in . Occasionally a single will get married . It amazes me that in all the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one ( except me ) has gotten divorced , not that I can recall . I am not sure that I count because I was starting into the divorce process when I joined the club . This club has been around for decades and the divorce rate is probably below 5% , I would guess . This absolutely amazes me ! Everyone has strong communication skills , spends lots of fun time together , supports each other , and actively work together to help the community . Although , statistically , overall the divorce rate is high , there are still groups of people with virtually no divorce rate and those are the ones we should be watching to see what works . <p> It 's not that I would n't like to get married and have children , it 's just far too late to think about settling down and starting a family now . <p> For starters , I could n't possibly support a family , certainly not on what Disability provides , and by the time the children were old enough to have any fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ... I 'd be too old and decrepit to have such fun anyway ... heck , I 'm already too far gone ! <p> Then there 's the fact that I 'm much too old , stubborn and set in my ways to allow my whole life to be turned upside-down for the sake of some woman <p> Nope ... some of us just are n't meant for marriage , and that 's an absolute fact if ever there was one . <p> Just my .02 's worth , sincerely , " Mac " <p> HandyItalian <p> Dec 29 @ 2:53PM <p> Its all True ! !

It IS a package deal , and anyone that would view a child as any kind of intrusion on your time together is not someone you want to be dating anyway .

Popo <p> Pride stems from the ego.Vanity , egotism , and pride " they all hide a subtle unhappiness , a cleverly disguised animosity . All hatred is self-hatred " and this lies hidden underneath their actions .

It is awareness . Simply watch your state of mind when you are angry or full of pride . This is not expression of anger , nor it is repression . It transcends both . Simply be aware and you will not even need to consciously let go of these feelings " they will drop away of their own accord.As anger and pride are caused by the ego , so also the ego is caused by unawareness.We will not make progress by dealing with the symptoms " we have to tackle the root cause . And the root cause of the ego , of anger and pride and all our sufferings is lack of awareness.Mental stability and control is the need of the hour in times of " anger " to let tolerance imply its way through.Each individual has a different belief but do n't let it be an ego trip . The prejudice eye is blind , the heart full of conclusions is dead and let there be feelings but not hatred .

The AP says they must first " decide whether the superhero and Oz glasses are ' children 's products ' and thus subject to strict lead limits ; if the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission staffers conclude the glasses to fall outside that definition , the lead levels would be legal . " <p> Is there any doubt ? Warner Brothers claims its primary buyers are adult collectors , so perhaps they just need a disclaimer : Contains 16% lead ; kids drink responsibly . <p> China is not happy with what is going on with bad products going out of their country , and have as much declared a war against the companies that do so . Remember this is not the US , and it 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intentionally producing dangerous products , you are beheaded . If you remember about the melamine tainted baby formula , every officer in every company that was involved in that lost their heads ! Here is an article that discusses what is going on , and what they are trying to do about it.Made In China <p> The biggest problem China has with the glasses , is that it will kill the customer base for the product . <p> Now understand , you and I are not the customer base . We do not buy our glasses and such from China , , , we buy them at McDonalds . McDonalds buys them from China . <p> It all comes back to the liability . Since the manufactuerer is in China , they are protected from product liability suits from citizens in the US . The glasses could have uranium and jagged edges , , , and they still could not get sued . However , the entity that was the importer of the glasses , , , is on the hook as the first domestic supplier . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are going to be responsible for the legal costs , recall costs , and the damages . If they purchased them from a domestic supplier - ( McDonalds is very good about this ) , , , then McD 's in only going to have to bear the cost of their legal defense , as they transfer the liability for damages to the supplier , and have probably contractually transferred the recall costs . <p> BOTTOM LINE FOR CONSUMERS ---- <p> WHY DID YOU NEED THAT CRAP ANYWAY ? The chance of injesting lead from the outside decal is REMOTE at best . Even if you mouth the thing all day , , , the chance of seeing any increase in your blood lead level is near zero . Now , if you manage to sand off the decal from about 50 or so glasses , , , and breath in the dust , , , now we are talking . Lead is most readily absorbed into the blood stream via inhalation , than ingestion . <p> For years , kids have eaten paint chips which contain lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , was tied more to the " DUST " in the house from opening and closing the windows with lead paint , walking and grinding up the chips of lead paint , and the worse possible thing ---- exhaust gas from residential vacume cleaners . <p> So many homes , were identified with lead paint . The kids had no detectable blood lead levels , , , , until the parents tried to remove the paint themselves or remodal the home . <p> LEAD - scarey word , , , but learn the real hazards so you can protect yourself . <p> OH , , and if your local playground gets sand from a municipality or buys it cheap off the back of the truck , , , have it tested for lead . Hundreds of cases of increased blood lead levels have been traced to tainted sand on playgrounds , , , where the sand was purchased cut rate from a contractor who used it sand blast an old water tower or bridge . With all the recent bridge work , , , it 's out there . 
@@37128762 @6128762/ <p> My sons dad has been dating a lady since february of this year and she seems nice and all . When I met her I introduced myself and shook her hand.I was pleasant and polite . I got a letter from her yesterday and in it she said my son has been calling her mommy and that herself and my sons dad have not corrected him . He is 4 and may not understand all this stuff . She asked me in the letter if I am o.k. with it and if I am not to let her know and she will understand and that her and my sons daddy will then have my son stop and explain to him that she is not the mommy . <p> Uhm .. no I am not o.k. with it , I am his mommy and no one will ever take that away from me or replace me . I am wondering why since february he has been doing this and she waits until now to inform me of it and ask me if I am o.k. with it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him stop doing it and I m a little bothered by the fact that he is calling her mommy but what am I to do now ? I am all cool with my sons daddy moving on with his life as I am doing with my life and I understand that someday this lady may be his stepmom but I am the birth mother and I raised him for the most part on my own . He loves me and calls me mommy also . I am also wondering if this is messing him up or confusing him . I do n't want my son to be messed up psychologically . My two moms ? I know my sons daddy was always kind of prickish with my boyfriends and he would get possesive and controlling of my son around my boyfriends and would keep making sure it was pointed out that HE is the daddy . I never acted the way he is and let someone else say they are my sons daddy but now he is doing same thing to me that he would flip about . something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another woman mama before he called his own one . This would have rocked me . Tawns is such a good mom in her own good mom kind of way . She was hurt yet bounced back with . Its ok , that just means he loves this other person , as much almost as much as he love his mom . Not really mastering comunications and lables , its easy for a child to call something what its not , yet mean smaething almost like it . <p> So i guessIm saying that be happy there 's another person in this childs life he views with the love he feels from his own mother .

The person with daddy must be mommy . If it bothers you , then have them make a different title for her or just call her by her name . It is usually a matter of simplicity not that you are being replaced . I would take as she is a nice lady and it is easy . BUT if it were me , i 'd have a little fit . Not a big fit , just a little one . Ask her how she would feel if her children called you mommy . That may change things . <p> That 's what can happen in divorces ...... and that 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...... too many people coming in and out of the parents lives and the kids getting confused . People its ok to be alone and raise your kids ... try it ... the strength you find inside yourself will only make you a better person .. <p> Dec 16 , 2007 @ 7:50 PM <p> My son calls another woman mommy = <p> Jankia <p> Posts : 14,851 <p> Well said painter I was the same way while there mother has been married twice since our divorce.My three step-daughters would ocasionally call me dad but I corrected them because I 'm only Jon to them , not there father.There step-mother should also correct your son regardless of his age.How can you teach honesty and truth if that is n't done ? <p> I do n't have kids , but here 's my 2 cents anyways ..... Mom and Dad decide to split , for whatever reason ....... His life has been torn apart , and will never ........... NEVER be the same again .... So he is forced to " deal " with the situation the best way he can ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that the most thing here ? I may be wrong , god knows it 's not the first of last time , but if he did n't like her , for whatever reason ..... He would not feel comfortable calling her that .. <p> So what if he has two mommy 's , I 'm very sure some 4 year old somewhere wishes he had one woman to love him enough to call her mommy .... <p> These things work themselves out ...... let him deal with it the only way he can figure out by himself . <p> Many times I feel sad I never had a child , but reading things like this , and being a day or two away from Christmas , I am very thankful I never married the wrong woman and/or had a child with them .. The last thing a child needs is to hear his parents arguing , or giving guilt trips about who gets the child for the holidays . <p> It is not the name they call you , it is the love in their heart that truly matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have both parents do whatever they can to do what is best for the child .... For you are not only shaping the mind of this child , but also his heart ... and his soul ... He has nothing what so ever to rely on to try to understand such an adult problem , and we are robbing the children of the world of their childhood , by trying ..... or expecting them too ... <p> You show him love , and he shows it back ... Is n't that enough ? Cause it should be . <p> You always make good sense , Blu.But here 's the only thing that would sit in my mind ... Was the new wife introduced as " Mary , for example " or " your new Mommy " ? If , over time , a small child just started calling another woman mommy , that would be their feelings . But if the " title " was put on them by an ex , that would not be right . JMHO <p> And yes , kids unfortunately have to hear too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if parents stayed together ! ) It 's more HOW you argue . <p> I dated a woman many years ago , her daughter was 7 , the little girl adored me . Not as her moms boyfriend , but just me being me . When marriage was discussed the mother told her daughter she would have 2 dads ..... Freaked the poor girl out , and our relationship was never the same ... What mom did was absolutely wrong .. ( We can call that clue number 1 as to why I never married her . ) So , I do understand your point Loreli ..... I took the only info provided , <p> My sons dad has been dating a lady since february of this year <p> she said my son has been calling her mommy <p> I assumed a young boy was trying make things as normal as possible . But I do understand the outside influences . I also took into consideration this has been going on for 10-11 months . So , it was not showing any adverse effects on the actual mother/son relationship ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details that are not there . I personally feel more sympathy for the child , than the mother who got her feelings hurt . I 'm just being honest , and I apologize if these words cause any additional hurt . This is JMHO , well maybe not so humble . <p> I see this child spending the rest of his life without his parents being together , he will grow out of the mommy stage in a handful of years . As he grows up he will have more life experiences to help him put the facts straight , for now , if it brings him any comfort , and makes his life feel a little more normal .... Just let it go . For his sake ........ It appears by bringing this up , it could force him to decide who he loves more .... One of those things you just feel , not anything a 4 year old should have to decide . It would not only the change feelings of the adults involved , but how they treat him after his answer , at that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 7 year old little girl got married at 27 a few years ago .... I was invited to the wedding ..... After not seeing this little girl for 20 years , she was able to look past her mothers crap , and remembered our friendship .. So , kids figure things out .... It 's just the parents crap/issues that makes it take longer than it should .... Dancing with her and talking about her jumping rope in my kitchen and me taking the training wheels off her bike , meant much more to her than what name she was supposed to call me 20 years ago . <p> Kids do n't  understand the impact of what they are calling the adult figures in their lives ..... All they want is to feel safe ...... My ex got remarried 8 years ago ..... and my first thought was .... what if they call her mom , what if they like her more ...... it was scary .. but , I knew that I loved them with all my heart and just wanted them happy ... and if they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. all I could do was love them and things would turn out as they should . I knew it was my ego that would of been bruised , and I needed to get past that ... . My sons have a good relationship with their stepmom .... its a friendly one , but they did n't  see her or their dad much .... so the calling her mom never did happen . <p> my son calls me momma-quila and my mom momma-nana because we are both raising him and he hears me call her mom and nana kids name others by what they hear them being called ... as long as he knows you are his mommie why does it matter what he labels anybody else as all the rest will come and go but you are that childs world the only way for him to know is to test the waters keep it in mind and do n't let your feathers get ruffled to much <p> i can relate .. i have been div from kids dad for 7 yrs now.i have a 10 and 7 yr old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do not , they get into trouble.it really upsets me .. my kids has one mommy which is me and has one daddy witch the wife is married too.how dare her makwe my kids call her momma.i told my kids to call her april.i am gon na have a long talk to the father and tell him that his wife is n't welcome at my house and have a long talk with him .. kids hates going to dad 's cause of her and their 1/2 brother who is 9 mo younger than my son . <p> Being in a relationship with a man with kids can be hard .. I know I had odd feelings when me and Mac started dating .. I felt like I was intruding on a family .. albeit a divorced one ... . I was stepping into a role of the Alpha female in the family .. now being a single mom for most of my kids lives being the Alpha female was already there ... heck so was being the alpha male haha .. but to enter anothers family circle and assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started dating one of his boys asked if they would have to call me mom .. I was floored .. I never expected that for sure .. and he was watching my reaction when he told me .. yes I was taken aback .. and my feelings were mixed .. did I want them to call me that ? ? In one way yeah .. because I have come to love them ... but in another no because to me that would take away from their birth mom .. Even tho he has raised them by himself for going on 9 years now ... she IS their mother ... I feel there can be a variety of names we call those we love .. it still niggles at my upbringing to call his mom by her first name or his dad by his first name ... I was raised until you are married they are still Mrs and Mr. then after you can call them Mom and Dad or something similar ... As I was growing up I had a few other women in my life that we like mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom or Mommy so the other women I would call Ma .. Another thing that can make a big difference is how much TIME this other woman invests in the child ... AND how she treats the child .. ( and the same for if it was a man ) I know some mothers who have basically bailed on the kids .. ( dads too ) not taking any time to visit with them or help raise them and that still expect to be considered their mommy and or daddy .. and when the stepmom or dad is doing all the things the mother or father should be doing they get upset about it ... ( now I 'm talking about those who HAVE the ability to do the things a mom/dad should do but do n't  ) to me those women/men should be grateful that SOMEONE has stepped in to take care of their children and not be petty about what the kids call them .. and if it bothers them ... to step up and earn back the name that is what a child gives to someone who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being FORCED to call a step parent by Mommy or Daddy that in itself is wrong .. a similar name can be used . not the one that the birth parents should be called ... this of course as always is JMHO ...

It 'll stir up bitterness in your heart , which in turn will defile you and others around you ( Hebrews 12:14 , 15 ) .

@@37128786 @6128786/ <p> I have tried to find some unbiased articles on The 12th Imam , which some also refer to as The 13th Imam .

They ca n't compromise their standards and ca n't manage the suspension of disbelief necessary for feigned cheerfulness .

Having chores from a young age taught me the rewards of a hard days work.And those rewards were food to eat and a roof over my head ...........

( Sidebar - best A-10 Pilot is a marine with no family .

I used to get angry and mad when people who did not make the " R " sound into another sylible would laugh at me , or worse , smile at the other people on their team and chuckle when I would talk .

They have to use letters ! BBW stands for multiple things , big beautiful woman , big black woman , black beautiful woman , many things , so why use " letters " to try to get your point across ? I 'm sorry , but things like this bother me . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really know , but I really do not like BBW , and I certainly do n't like being called it ! I realize this email is from some spammer , but I 've had men in the US email me and say I 'm a BBW .... <p> Fact is the term BBw did not come from a man it came from a woman that was in denial being over-weight you know Fat . So in order to be policicaly correct the tern BBW was born . I think we should like who we are and just speak out the truth . That is very hard since palying in fantasy is so much easier role to play . <p> You have every right to be offended by being labeled as such , and you should n't feel obligated to apologize for feeling the way you do . I mean think about it , would men like to be labeled as a BDH ( bald dicc head ) or LDA ( little dicc azzhole ) ? I 'm sure they would n't . <p> If its said to you/towards you/in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive ... regardless if others do n't  feel that way or cant relate . <p> You are a beautiful , intelligent , sensitive woman . Stand by that realization and do n't  budge for anything or anybody . <p> I never said that a man coined the phrase , I simply said that men use it , and it bothers me . Perhaps it was a woman who coined the phrase because she was in denial , but I , am not in denial and I do not apprichate it . I do like who I am , and I do speak the truth . As I said in my original post , I am *big* I am beautiful , and I 'm certainly a woman , but I do not apprichiate being called a BBW . It just comes off as insulting to me . And I agree 110% with you LGQ , it 's almost as if being a BBW is something men have to *be into* to enjoy us , insted of just liking us for who we are , despite our size . <p> Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) I know people do n't think that BBW means beautiful blonde woman , however , in an effort to prevent getting mad every time I see the term , from this point out , I 'm going to think of it as " beautiful blonde woman " : ) hehe . <p> If you find " Big Beautiful Woman " insulting , what would you like to be called instead ? What do you think is a better " label " ? At least offer up something else , because like it or not , everyone has a label . <p> What 's wrong with the words ? Is Beautiful is insulting ? No . Is Woman is insulting ? No , you 're taking issue with the word Big apparently . Well , I 'm big and I 'm not ashamed of it .

If I called you a window licker , I am pretty sure you would be insulted by that , even though you do n't even know what it means . It just SOUNDS insulting .

He did what he had to do without excuses . Period . There are other stories in the bible that show the same strength to stand up on your own 2 feet and move forward , rather than be left in the dust waiting for help . <p> An even closer example is with me .

Or are we making them dependant on the handouts ? Just because we build better ant hills for them , does it make their lives any better ? What happens when everything is done over there ? The rebuilding and clean up . Will they be a stronger people ? Will they suddenly decide to take control of their government and run those who are corrupt out ? Will their lives miraculousy change for the better without effort ? Or just ants that will be stepped on again the next time ? christians say , god helps those who helps themselves .

So here is the quote that I 've seen : <p> When asked how he would react if Ivanka , a former teen model , posed for Playboy , Trump replied , " It would be really disappointing " not really " but it would depend on what 's inside the magazine .

I just find it creepy that a father would notice their child being attractive in that way , where they would even think of dating their offspring ... yuk ! ! ! <p> Yes , I know , Clinton was a womanizer , yes , I voted for him twice , and yes , if he could run for a third term , I 'd vote for him again .

In these day with politics , party affiliation is becoming more of a symbol rather than an ideal . <p> Our federal , state and local election processes , are the most useless pile of dumpster garbage ever set forth in or country !

I guess it depends on how one feels about politics in general ; that this quagmire of endless political comments ( mine included ) is n't even necessary nor constructive if our federal , state and local election processes , were based on merit ( qualifications as I 've said ) and integrity , rather than who has the most money and makes the most hollow promises and caters toward the special interests the most .

In fact , I dare say that those that are n't , are into control trips , not unlike many of our politicians these days ! <p> If a capitalistic society is selfish , then please explain to me the separatism between the distinct classes of elitism and the ' non-private ' , poorer life style citizens of a socialist and communist society ; whereby , IMO , the ' elite ' are also selfish , and extremely more so , I might add !

Like that one with Kate and 8 kids or the Duggars , or even Toddlers and Tiaras , cause those shows exploit kids . Ever see an episode of Toddlers and Tiaras ?

I see it all as overreacting . That show and that car do not promote racism , racism was around long before that show , and obviously with the day 's events , it 's still around . If we are going to rely on tv shows to " teach " , we are a lazy nation .

@@37128840 @6128840/ <p> I thought of this and made it myself . It 's an original . It 's the actual results of the election . <p> The really interesting part of it is looking at the results by county instead of state . It really highlights the landslide that Trump had . Take a look at New York , for example . Almost every county went for Trump . Yet Clinton won the state because the only votes that count are from the tiny part of New York that is New York City . <p> I am an avid Trump supporter . Before he decided to run and was still trying to make up his mind , myself and many other people , including people I know who NEVER vote but if they did they might lean liberal was for Trump . He had publicly announced what some of his policies would be and for us it was past time to correct the direction of our nation . I remember he announced about two weeks before I retired and I was jubilant . That is the only way I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage some here but more often than not I have other places I frequent to get it out of my system . I really kept up with this election , more so than other elections I 've lived through and although I knew that most mainstream media was liberal I did not realize the extent of the corruption of media which defines themselves as " news and journalists " when they are entirely in the bag for the Democrat Party . I will call out ABC , CBS , NBC , MSNBC , CNN , HLN , which is connected to CNN , and there is more but I ca n't think of them now . They told downright lies about Trump to people who believed that they were listening to an honest media . They would take soundbites and run them constantly creating scenarios that were not true around them . Yes , Trump as a person who is not a politician and does n't speak like a politician had to work on how he phrased the ideas he was trying to get across but as he has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are open minded enough to seek other venues to test the veracity of what you hear and if you patently believe every word any form of media spouts you have been sorely snookered . I call out FOX news on their bias too but they have a mixed bias whereby some of their news people are liberal and some are conservative so you get a little of both sides . It has really been a lesson to me to see how many people only watch liberal , left leaning news networks and it is obvious because of what they post on the various websites I visit . The contribution of the emails released by Wikileaks to help level the field can not be overstated . <p> I watched many , many of Trump 's rallies online . Not only would he have crowds of tens of thousands attending , with lines blocks long sometimes standing in rain , and heat , and cold for hours , and bearing the assaults of paid and trained agitators put there from the other side , but the number of people watching on line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , were tremendous . When Trump started running his own live stream on Facebook numbers of 200,000 and up who were simultaneously viewing just his live stream , out of the many others that were running , were normal . I give a shout out to Right Side Broadcasting that started with nothing but a Facebook page and a vision , but patched together a couple of cameramen and an old television camera , which they were later able to upgrade , and they attended and put a camera at every Trump rally , live streaming on You Tube , taking care to show the crowds . <p> It is obvious that you ca n't get the truth from just watching and reading traditional media . The Internet played a huge role in allowing people of similar beliefs to congregate together and push alternative news sources , which after testing the information forthcoming , many were able to she 'd light on the lies of main stream media giving the reader or listener enough ammunition to learn the truth for themselves . <p> One additional thought I want to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately owned media , no person , whether celebrity , news , or other media personality should have a hand in Presidential debates .

Ruled by Mars , the hot , red , active planet , the Aries man is known as the " warrior . " Fearless and brave , active and entrepreneurial , he is eager for new experiences . Your man is never ever boring ! Your ChallengeTo get his attention away from his constant business wheelings and dealings , and to cater to his substantial physical needs . <p> How To Handle HimIf this is your first date with an Aries , choose something daring to do . Aries , the lover of risk and adventure , is apt to enjoy activities with you that could include hang gliding , bungee jumping or car racing . The Aries man 's credo is he 'll try anything once .

He is apt to be aggressive and spontaneous , and this is one man who likes to take the lead . At the same time , the Aries man is highly protective of his lover , being quite willing to fight ( literally or figuratively ) for her , and this is a big part of his appeal . Be gentle with this ego , though . If you 're not " in the mood " he might take the slightest rejection quite hard . <p> Aries likes a challenge , so you could tease him a bit when he starts getting bossy , keeping what he wants out of reach until the end of the pursuit . If trying to win an argument , the smart partner of an Aries man will subtly convince him that her ideas are really his ideas . Some Aries men have a roving eye , which is not an attractive quality , so to keep him playing in his own back yard , keep your body sleek , your lingerie sexy ( a few skimpy pieces in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the lights low ( candlelight is perfect--Aries rules fire ) . Most of all , keep him guessing because he loves the thrill of the chase . <p> Things To Do , Gifts To BuyWant to surprise him ? Cook him a spicy dinner , perhaps something Tex Mex--or--just tease him by putting a jalapeno pepper in your mouth and dare him to bite it gently ( a la 9 1/2 Weeks ) . Then alternate sweet flavors with spicy ( Aries rules spicy flavors ) . That 's a way to get his attention ! <p> In terms of gifts , the Aries man likes an experience rather than something tangible . You might buy tickets to a boxing match or an exciting basketball game where he can get all worked up and scream his lungs out--all the better to get his lusty self in bed later that evening . <p> The Pisces temperament is gentle , romantic , caring , compassionate , and spiritual . Pisces rules the subconscious mind , and so it follows that her dreams are vivid and meaningful , even prophetic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor , Sharon Stone and Cindy Crawford are all dazzling Pisces , and each in their own way reflects the reserved and unpretentious Pisces nature .

Soft and ultra-feminine , she will put your needs ahead of hers . <p> Your Challenge <p> Her feelings are very sensitive and easily hurt , so be careful how you address her . In any relationship , she likes to proceed gradually , perhaps at a slower pace than you would like . But rush her and your little fish will disappear into the depths of the sea . <p> How To Handle Her <p> She 's mystical and poetic and she needs a regular outlet for her creative expressions . Her sign rules all non-verbal communication--symbols , gesture , dance , art , and poetry--and the Pisces woman is highly intuitive . She trusts her feelings and she reads body language perfectly , so do n't try to say one thing and mean another--she will catch on quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refresh herself , so allow her time for that . <p> She 's caring and sensitive to her man , but can easily be so self-effacing that she forgets her own needs . Her urge to relieve suffering in others is as strong as the life force and it is the single most important element of her nature to understand . Some people will sometimes take advantage of her good nature . Her man should help her by reminding her that it 's OK to say no to favors others ask of her . At times the world can have a wearing-down effect on her self-confidence , which sometimes needs rebuilding in even the strongest Pisces women . When Pisces is hurt , she will build her own version of the world to protect herself , preferring to live in a world of dreams until she feels she is ready for re-entry into reality .

Instead , give her a book of romantic poetry , like that of Edna St. Vincent Millay or a beautiful black &amp; white photograph of a couple kissing . Or give her music , perhaps something soothing and spiritual , such as Enya , Orion or Monks singing Gregorian chant . <p> Buy her clothing in one of her favorite shades of violet , blue or sea green . She loves lace , angora sweaters , and prefers flowing , soft chiffon-type fabrics over sharp tailoring . Silk is favored over crisp cotton . Sparkling jewels look especially beautiful on her , so consider surprising her with diamonds , amethysts or aquamarine stones . In choosing a restaurant , pick a dark , private , romantic place filled with flowers . She loves to dance ( Pisces rules the feet ) so take her to a club with a great band . She also loves the movies , for her ruler , Neptune , rules film and she can easily lose herself in the story . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening or a poetry reading . Finally , surprise her a deluxe shower head for her bathroom ( Pisces is a water sign ) , promising her that the two of you will play under it soon . <p> Sex to Pisces is spiritual . She simply can not sleep with a man she is n't in love with . She 's worth waiting for--her natural sense of rhythm and grace in body movement makes her a fabulous lover . This does not preclude her from having fun with her lover--that is a certainty--but she will need a full commitment of love from you before surrendering . <p> No other sign loves costume and fantasy as much as Pisces does , so when you get to know her well , suggest you both go shopping together for an outfit to wear in the bedroom--a French maid ? Cleopatra ? Elvira , Mistress of the Dark ? Her rich imagination needs fantasy , so you will be on the right track .

Part of the reason her man has fallen in love with her is the fact that she 's not a clinging vine . Quite the contrary , she matches wits with her man , has a wide circle of her own friends , and prefers to stand on her own two feet . Many Aquarius women are leaders in their field .

Aquarius women tend to wear streamlined , futuristic clothing and some Aquarius women do n't mind if they shock a bit . Her taste in jewelry is unique and individual , even New Age , so you could do well by getting her a special crystal .

( To get an Aquarius alone is a feat unto itself . ) <p> Never inhibited in bed , Aquarius brings a sense of fun and playfulness to her lovemaking . She may suggest a video to watch beforehand , since Aquarius are so electronically-oriented , or if you know her very well , she might consent to making your private video together , with her ground rules .

Choose a room where she can hear other guests but where the two of you can temporarily disappear for some privacy , maybe a closet or pantry . Do n't worry about her reaction to suggesting a quickie--if she knows you well , this is one lady who will be delighted ! <p> Your Sagittarius guy has a strong intellect , penetrating thought process and continual curiosity about the world around him . Your man is ready for a deep discussion on ethics , morality , politics , philosophy , or religion , so go ahead one night and tackle The Meaning Of Life . Unlike Gemini , who focuses on details of the here and now , Sagittarius looks at the entire sweep of collected knowledge and tries to make sense out of the big picture . His most attractive qualities are his faith and optimism , and his customary cheer will endear him to you . This sign also has major wanderlust , so pack your glacier glasses and bug spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the most exotic locales . Finally , this is the sign of the ultimate jock .

If he sounds like a handful , it 's because he is , but such an interesting handful ! <p> Your Challenge <p> Your Sagittarius man likes the bachelor life more than most signs , so getting him to commit may take some doing .

If he needs to spend what you believe to be inordinate amounts of time at the gym , do n't hassle him-- humor him instead . ( You wo n't be able to win this one anyway ) . Enjoy his beautiful shoulders and abs and glutes and tell him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great because they always tell the truth , but sometimes hearing unvarnished truth can be rough on the rest of us . They have no sense of diplomacy , so if you ask their opinion , be ready to hear it ! In love , Sag needs lots of sex and sports but he has an equal need for an intellectual partner . He will want his woman to stay up to date on political issues and trends and he will enjoy lively and even heated debates . If he needs regular nights out with the boys , say " fine . " Nothing spoils a relationship faster for a Sag than a sense of claustrophobia . <p> Things To Do , Gifts To Buy <p> Equipment for his favorite sport or new workout clothing would be good , and if you are feeling generous , a membership to a health club would be ideal ( that would be a subtle acknowledgment of his manly physical prowess ) . This sign adores animals too , so you could surprise him with that pet Dalmatian puppy he wants . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When taking him to dinner read the reviews and find an unusual restaurant such as one that serves Vietnamese , Japanese , Turkish , or Thai cuisine . Afterwards , continue the international theme by going to a foreign flick . Often guys from this sign are good with languages and at the very least enjoy a good debate , so chose a movie with a substantial plot ( no , The Bodyguard wo n't quite cut it . ) This sign loves sports , as participant rather than a spectator . Suggest you go swimming , play tennis or do any sport where you can keep up your end fairly well . His ego is not fragile , this guy does n't want you to let him win for he enjoys and admires strong women . So give him a real workout on the courts and you 'll both win ! <p> The more things you do in the great outdoors , the better , for he likes to be in expansive space . You know where this is all leading in terms of your seduction--your Sagittarius lover would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could be a problem if you are moved to do this in winter and live in a freezing region of the country . Since Sag is the sign of the centaur , chances are he likes horseback riding , so how about seducing him in the barn on top of an old-fashioned hay stack ? Start by telling him how perfect his riding " seat " is and how you could n't get your eyes off him . Since Sagittarius is the sign ruling the thighs , gently stroking him there will drive him wild with desire . If the weather is warmer , seduce him out in the wide open spaces , in a private , lush and green setting , under the full moon and stars . Can you think of anything more romantic ? <p> The Taurus woman sounds like a pain in the neck . I would n't want to date me based on that assessment . <p> hmmm ... <p> Finally , the influence of Venus gives the Taurus woman a rounded silhouette , perfect " material " for a WonderBra . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of this type of bra in various pretty colors , then talk her into giving you a fashion s how . Since the media keeps telling women who have curves ( as most Taurus women do ) that they are less-than-ideal , you 'll need to counteract that notion . Keep reassuring her that you adore her real-woman curves and that the waif look was never one that turned you on . <p> Well I AM the perfect candidate for the Wonder bra , but you 'd better NOT mention anything against the " waif " look turning you off ! <p> Jan 26 , 2007 @ 6:00 AM <p> Romantic horoscopes <p> DoorWatcher <p> Posts : 6,123 <p> The Virgo Woman ( This is you too , Painter ) <p> the female Virgo loathes making love in a hovel ( Who does n't ? ? ) <p> Tattered jeans and polo shirts are not her style .

He is a joy to live with as long as you understand the Virgo man 's obsessive need to be productive on a daily basis . He is practical , patient and is able to handle detail , and the amount of details he handles would drive others up the wall . The Virgo 's talent is knowing how to make dreams ( their own and those of others ) a reality . Your Challenge <p> Virgos are worriers , so your first step will be to calm him down when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a hard time detaching from his everyday schedule . But you must , for they are incredibly passionate lovers once his total attention has been turned to you . <p> How to Handle Him <p> He 's productivity oriented , so " goofing off " might be a foreign idea and too scary for him at the onset . Since Virgo is wonderful at fixing things--his sharp mind hungers for things to take apart and figure out--so ask him to help you out . Tell him that you are hopeless with home repairs and he has got to come over and take a look at your air conditioner . His small motor skills are the finest in the zodiac , so many Virgos like to putter around the house , looking for little projects . Puttering takes their minds off more stressful issues . <p> Remind him how turned-on you were when you saw him wearing worn jeans and a plaid lumberjack shirt , jump-starting his car . Tell him you fantasize about him walking around your apartment measuring walls for shelving , just wearing his tool belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you will have a hot , passionate lover ready to ravish you and no more leaky faucets . ) Cruise around Home Depot , just to get him in the mood . Then , one afternoon when he is putting in a new set of florescent lights over your kitchen counter , pounce on him and tell him you are getting hot watching him screw those huge bulbs in . Make love to him right then and there . <p> To thank him for all his home improvement , you might want to take him to dinner . When choosing the restaurant , remember that a Virgo 's digestive system is delicate . Most Virgos dislike overly rich food and try to eat balanced healthful meals . Many are vegetarians . <p> Another point to consider is that Virgo has a strong need to be highly organized . So when seducing the Virgo man , be sure you have a neat bedroom and put unnecessary clutter out of sight . ( Seeing junk around will make him edgy . ) In bed , the Virgo man is like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his need to communicate is strong . Talking during lovemaking will heighten his pleasure and add to his passion for you . <p> Things To Do , Gifts To Buy Many Virgos are talented writers . Their reserved nature makes them express in writing what they would have difficulty saying in person . Happily , you may be the lucky recipient of one of the wonderful love letters only a Virgo could write . Drop hints that you would like to receive something written especially for you . A perfect gift for him would be a beautiful fountain pen or engraved stationary . He would also adore a P.D.A. or electronic organizer , a laptop computer , new software , or even a dust buster for his car . You could also buy him a deluxe tool kit ( do n't forget those metric socket wrenches too ) and let matters take their own course <p> Jan 26 , 2007 @ 6:57 AM <p> Romantic horoscopes <p> DoorWatcher <p> Posts : 6,123 <p> Wow ... that sounds more like me . Maybe I 'm got an extra chromosome or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and inner strength , and is able to overcome most any obstacle in life . She comes across as self-confident and self-possessed and men are drawn to her for that reason . There is a mysterious quality about the Scorpio woman , because she is intensely private , discrete and secretive . Soon she will learn everything about you , but later you will realize that she has n't given you many details about herself--that 's Scorpio 's natural reticence . <p> Finally , the operative word to best understand your Scorpio lover is " passion . " One Scorpio once said to me that passion was the single most important ingredient in life , that is , to be passionate about one 's loved ones , one 's career , one 's lifestyle , for without passion , what kind of life would we have in the end ? Well said ! <p> Your Challenge <p> Your Scorpio beauty is attracted to power , so if you have it , you are ahead of the game . Your other challenge will be that this lady has a mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tame her , forget it . <p> How To Handle Her <p> Her highly intuitive nature makes her a mind reader extraordinaire , so do n't try to hide anything from her . If you are trying to impress her with power you do n't have , her Pluto-ruled nature will sense it like a homing device . ( Certainly you do n't want to activate her seek and destroy mechanism . ) In love and friendship , she is true-blue loyal and will expect the same from you . If you show her the slightest reason to distrust you , however , she will never forgive you . On the other hand , treat her well and she will reward you for the rest of your life . Home and family are regarded as sacred , and Scorpio will defend and support her man to the ends of the earth . Like Leo women , Scorpio women are into control , and with her magnetic , femme fatale powers , she will soon have the upper hand . After all , who could resist her famous Scorpion gaze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gifts To Buy <p> If you take your Scorpio beloved out for dinner , make it a private little dark rendezvous , overlooking water if possible or better yet , as a guest on a private yacht ( preferably yours ) . The Scorpion woman will always be understated with her powerful sexuality--she does n't need to flaunt it , it exudes naturally . In her dress , she is very careful about her accessories , buying only the finest shoes and handbags , and if she needs one , an elegant leather brief case . She knows these accessories punctuate her entire look and impart a feeling of true elegance . Get her quality things made out of leather ( down , boy , not those things ) . If treating her to perfume , get her a modern oriental or something of musk and subtly sexual . <p> While the Scorpio woman is always a lady in public , she loves being her man 's fantasy woman in the bedroom . Buy her some new lingerie in of her most flattering tones : maroon , eggplant or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so buy her a demi-cup push up bra , tiny , sheer g-string bikini and elegant garter belt , complete with a pair of black seamed stockings . She may also be amused and aroused by a lavishly illustrated photography book by Helmut Newton or Doris Kloster . If you get lucky , she may want to experiment a little by lap dancing for you and you alone . <p> This sign rules detective work , so plan a mystery for her . She has a rich imagination and this should work whether you 've known her a month or a decade . Tell her to meet you in the most elegant hotel bar in town . When you spot her , stand at the other end of the bar and have the waiter send over a glass of champagne and a note from you . By now the suggestive nature of your behavior will have the staff murmuring and staring and it will begin to turn her on tremendously . After the second or third drink , send her the key to your room in a small envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock it with roses and . ) When she 's pocketed the key , have her meet you by the elevator . Ride up alone , pushing her against the back wall of the elevator and tell her in great detail what you have planned . Show her the silk ribbons you 've tucked into your breast pocket--Scorpio is intrigued by bondage . Although she will try her hardest not to show it , she will be aching for you to begin . She wo n't forget this mystery , and neither will you ! <p> This man 's vivid imagination and sensitivity ( matched in intensity only by fellow water sign Cancer ) will endear him to you quickly . Pisces ' greatest strength is their creativity . Neptune makes them brilliant at expressing themselves in symbols and gestures . They therefore they make outstanding film makers , photographers , and dancers.Their empathetic nature will make you fall in love with him quickly , for it is possible you 've never met a man who knows the inner you so well . <p> Your Challenge <p> Pisces sometimes loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creative field . He needs a regular outlet to express his powerful emotions and insights on the world , so you will have to learn to be supportive of his efforts . At times he can be hard to pin down , but this is usually due to his not yet having made up his mind about an issue . Being a dual sign like Gemini , he likes to look at both sides of every situation before taking a stand . <p> How To Handle Him <p> When trying to persuade a Pisces man of anything , do not use facts or logic ; appeal to his emotions and intuition . If you press any point too hard or become demanding , he will swim in the other direction . He is gentle to others and expects to be treated in kind . He hates ruts and constricting routines , so a free-form schedule in life is more to his liking . <p> Another important fact to remember is that Pisces will give freely of himself whenever he can , but if he feels he has been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point , it is hard to win back his trust . The Pisces man needs to be appreciated . <p> This man is not materialistic or money-oriented--do n't bug him to ask for a raise or question why he does n't make more money . He realizes that possessions and money are only earth-bound , temporal things that do n't matter much in the grand scheme . He is too spiritual to be concerned with such mundane matters . A deeply philosophical sign , money does not motivate him as much as self-expression and creativity do . ( Money does have a way of finding a way to Pisces , nevertheless , so do n't think this is a sign doomed to poverty ! ) <p> Since Pisces reads body language better than any other sign , do n't be surprised if he just seems to know much more about you than you 've ever told him . Of course , verbal communication is important too , but keep it delicate and poetic . When delivering criticism to him be diplomatic rather than direct . Pisces men never like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gifts To Buy <p> An ideal evening to a Pisces man would be to have dinner in an exotic Indian or Asian restaurant , and have a double espresso afterwards in a tiny , dark patisserie , debating a particular moral or ethical issue until the sun comes up . Or take him to the movies--he ca n't seem to see enough of them . <p> Since Pisces rules the feet , why not delight your man by surprising him with some special peppermint foot cream and a relaxing foot massage ? Their feet are the first area of their body to show signs of stress . Now , the Pisces man 's first instinct is to pay attention to you first , so he will have to get used you lavishing attention of him . Be sure to tell him just looking at his body is a wonderful turn-on for you ; Not a problem ! the Pisces man has less vanity than most signs and may be surprised to hear you say this ! Although he may not appear to need it , if you bolster his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover for you ! <p> A lush tropical island resort would be the perfect locale to seduce your Pisces beloved because he will feel refreshed and uninhibited near bodies of water . On the appointed day , tell him you 've packed a picnic lunch and drive him out to the prettiest waterfall you can find on the island ( do your research first ) . Bring along your Polaroid camera ( Pisces rules photography ) to capture some of the fun . Wearing only a thin T-shirt and string bikini bottom , ( Oh Puleeeze ! LOL ) dare him to follow as you run under the falls . Let yourself become totally drenched , hair and all . Do all this quickly to capture the element of surprise and allow him a moment or two to stare at you in your clingy , now see-though T and skimpy bottom , laughing and beckoning him to join you . Do you honestly not know how this scene ends ? <p> Love an Aries woman ? She 's modern all the way , full of spunk and drive . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading up a division in her company , for Aries is the sign that rules entrepreneurial ventures . She is a woman of strength , has well-formed and intelligent opinions , and part of her charm is that she is so thoroughly independent and self-reliant . Aries is a fire sign and therefore quite imaginative , born to lead rather than to follow . <p> Your Challenge <p> To keep up with her , you 've got to think of some original things to do together--the " same old , same old " will never rate with her . <p> How To Handle Her <p> In bed , the Aries woman will often enjoy initiating the lovemaking , much to your delight . Allow her that pleasure and enjoy the fireworks . Sexually , she will be creative and even humorous , and her sense of adventure will lead her to try many things . <p> Things To Do , Gifts To Buy <p> Take her to an amusement park and try out the fastest , scariest rides together--she 'll be all the more passionate later . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character--it could have a hint of spice or be a new , modern blend . ( One thing is certain , your grandmother 's sweet rose or lily of the valley just is n't her style ) . Another idea would be to give her a gift certificate for a new hairstyle by a famous hairdresser she 's read about in her favorite fashion magazine . A fine imported hairbrush would be a good gift idea too . Aries rules the head , and a bad hair day is no joke for our girl . Having her hair just right gives her increased self confidence , and by giving her a chic new look , she 's apt to be delighted . Be prepared for her open demonstrations of her love for you ! If you would rather choose something for her that is a bit more sexy , get her a short satin wrap robe with matching demi-bra and tiny thong panties , in her favorite color , bright red . <p> An Aries girl loves uniforms , so let her see you in your Navy dress whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have an " Officer and an Gentleman " uniform around , any other uniform will do . Do you have a friend who is a UPS or FedEx delivery man ? You are in luck--borrow his uniform and pretend to be a delivery man . This will really ring her bell ! Take note all " suits " : every Aries woman looks forward to those sexy , well-muscled UPS guys , even when they 're dumping more work for them to do on the counter ! Your working-class stud attire could be a fantasy-come-true . <p> If you want to be late for work and get the bathroom all steamy , try this : when you 're shaving one morning , stand at the sink completely nude , with the water running , and your face all lathered up with shaving cream . As you shave , be completely oblivious to her staring at you and just talk naturally with her about everyday matters--the more mundane the better . For example , ask , " Shall I pick up the Dijon mustard after I get the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for her reaction . Aries rules sharp instruments , so watching you wield your razor in such a masterful fashion will send her temperature rising--and could be start the start of a wonderful day for you ! <p> A Leo woman is easy to spot . She 's the one lighting up the room in her spectacular designer outfit--Leo women love to make an entrance . Her taste is superb and unfailing . Like chic French women ( France is ruled by Leo ) , a lioness would rather have one dazzling outfit than 20 cheap ones . She has a deep and abiding need for respect from others and will work hard to being noticed and remembered . She is naturally extravagant--do n't even try to tell her she spends too much on clothes ( or on her kids either , who she loves to pamper ) . Yet she is warm , spontaneous and creative too , and you are sure to have fun with this vivacious lioness . Your Challenge <p> In a nutshell , your challenge will be to afford this jewel of a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for second best ( which she translates as second rate ) . She will be demanding , so be prepared to lavish lots of attention on her instead of being preoccupied with your spreadsheets or waxing your car . If you are serious about her , bite the bullet and get some personal help . You will need to maximize your efficiency at home and the office to devote time to your lioness--at least until you win her heart . <p> How To Handle Her <p> In all probability she will be handling you , not the other way around ! Leo women have a way of being in control , even if they let you think that is not the case . She 's subtle , but strong . She resists any kind of confinement , so do n't try to box her in . Throughout courtship , the Leo woman loves to tease her man , often playing cat-and-mouse games until you " catch " her . When wed , she will do anything in her power to keep things lively and fun , and will build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . The Leo woman loves to have her lover run his fingers through her mane . She will rarely go to bed without a touch of makeup , even if it 's just a hint of blush or scented body creme . To increase her passion , whisper to her , " You are the most beautiful woman in the world ! " . . . and mean it . <p> Things To Do , Gifts To Buy <p> This is one lady you are going to have to woo with gifts . She expects them , wants them , and enjoys them , so you might as well cave in and buy them for her . She looks stunning and regal in purple , so choose something in that color , whether it be a lace teddy , bra and panty set or drop-dead , killer nightie . She will also sparkle in gold--try getting her a classy knit sweater shot through with golden threads that shimmer in the evening light , then take her to a four star restaurant for dinner so she can wear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ornate wooden architecture and antique furniture . Make sure to reserve a room with a roaring fireplace . Or send her two dozen long-stemmed roses ( do n't even THINK of trying to get away with one dozen ) , a generous box of imported bittersweet chocolates or a bottle of fine champagne for you both to drink later . Buy her tickets to the opera in New York or Rome ( orchestra seats , of course . ) If buying her a ring or other jewelry , know that she adores sapphires , the gem ruling her sign . Start saving now ! It 's true , loving a Leo can be a second career in itself . But she 'll adore you for your generosity and will insure you both will have a hell of a lot of fun .

Remember when Demi Moore had to decide whether to take the cool million and bed Robert Redford or stay loyal to Woody Harrelson and give up their dream house ? Near the end of the film there is a scene where she and Woody make love on a bed of hundred dollar ( or higher ) bills . In your own private remake , you are the millionaire , but you do n't have to share her with anyone . For fun , strew her bed with lots of crisp , new crumpled dollar bills ( if it 's ones , not fifties or hundreds , who cares ? ) . Leo women have fertile imaginations and a fabulous sense of drama . She 'll adore your little make-believe and beg you to think of more ! <p> The Gemini woman is full of enthusiasm .

Gemini is an ace communicator too , particularly adept at sharing her emotions and thoughts . ( Take away her dial tone and it is like taking away oxygen . ) She does n't go for a man who crowds her or who limits her space . Gemini is symbolized by the twins flying through the air , and to set limits on a Gemini is like trapping a lovely bird in a small cage . <p> Your ChallengeThis is a busy woman with endless lists of things to accomplish .

( Gemini rules the printed words , thus , she is happy in book shops . ) Or , if she has a new laptop , offer to help her set up her system folder . ( She has the brains to do it , but prefers to do things like that + deux for the company . ) Suggest you go window shopping for a new fax machine one night after work , so that she can choose the best one when she 's ready . Convince her to let you assess the various local cellular phone carriers to choose the best deal for her , then meet to discuss your findings .

Or choose a fine , established restaurant that looks like a club , with wood paneling and a low-key , moneyed ambiance . Eating chicken and peas does n't bother him--he is used to it from all the industry dinners he regularly attends . <p> Since he wants a Grace Kelly-type rich girl , beg , borrow or rent a luxurious mink coat ( he has no qualms about you wearing fur like Aquarius does ) .

Sometimes this could be exhausting for you , so keep the vitamins handy . <p> Places To Go , Things To Buy Her <p> If you 'd like to get her a fragrance , choose one of the fresh new uni-sex fragrance , for she wo n't wear anything too conventionally flowery or sweet . She is apt to be a runner or do some equally strenuous sport--can you imagine a marathon runner fussing with Arpege ? Not quite . <p> She likes her look sporty , preferring pants to skirts and sportswear to anything more formal . Sag generally likes comfortable shoes , the heels not too high .

Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman she manages to keep her enviable figure because of all the exercise she gets .

What would she most likely wear to bed ? A cool , thin , tight white cotton tank top which outlines her breasts , worn with tiny cotton string panties--or nothing at all . She likes men 's wear , so you might catch her putting on your button-down shirt with not much else on but a smile . ( Remember how fetching Annette Bening looked in the seduction scene from American President ? ) . She will do more for your shirt than you could ever imagine . <p> She will be impressed if you treat your body like a temple too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lounge around in tight bicycle shorts to heat things up . Look at her innocently and say you took a part time job as a messenger and need to wear them for practicality and comfort .

Toss her into a snow drift . The aim here is to get her pulse rate up then convince her she wo n't need her morning run with you around . 
@@37128846 @6128846/ <p> One of my ignorant neighbours left a bag of garbage ( mostly food waste ) behind the house , in clear violation of the city 's health and sanitation bylaws ; you 're not allowed to leave bagged garbage outside any earlier than 5:00 PM the evening before collection , for the blindingly-obvious reason that it attracts vermin ( like raccoons and skunks , which is precisely why we have garbage cans , after all ! ) . <p> Almost inevitably , it did just that , with the rather predictable result that my dog got himself a snootfull of nasty , nastty skunk juice last night . <p> My poor , sweet , slightly-idiotic , mildly-neurotic and very well-loved and well-cared-for ( and completelyspoiled-rotten ) Taz , who 'd never been tied up before in his life , had to spend the whole night tied up outside , just so he would n't render my apartment uninhabitable with the evil , awful stench of skunk juice . <p> First thing this morning , just as I was preparing to take a shower , get dressed and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pharmacy , of course ) a concerned neighbour rang my doorbell . The whole time I 've lived here , none of my dogs had ever spent a night outside before , so when she saw Taz out in the back yard all alone , she was worried that something bad had happened to me , and that I might be sick or hurt . <p> She was relieved to discover I was okay , and when I told her why Taz was tied up outside , she very kindly and graciously offered to go and pick up the necessaries for the skunk-off recipe . This was an especially great kindness because the recent extremely damp , wet weather has not been paricularly kind to me , and I 've been in terrible pain and almost completely unable to walk for the last couple of days . <p> The following " skunk-off " recipe works like a charm , and is much more effective than any of the commercially-available de-skunking shampoos they sell at pet stores , or the old " tomato juice bath . " I had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective as this recipe , which works by literally chemically neutralising the volatile oils that give skunk spray its particularly nasty stench . <p> Mix the ingredients in a bucket . Wet the dog/cat/etc thoroughly with water , then vigorously rub the mixture all over , making sure to get right through the hair to the skin , and especially taking care not to get any in their eyes ! ! ! Repeat until the compound is all gone , or until they 've been thoroughly scrubbed all over , then rinse thoroughly with clean water until all the compound is gone . <p> You ca n't keep this stuff around in a ready-mixed form because it gives off gas over time , and when stored in a sealed container , this can lead to somewhat " explosive " results . Instead , keep a supply of the separate ingredients on hand , especially if you live in a skunk-rich environment . <p> Taz is now all happily curled up on his pet bed in front of the couch as I type this , and I can barely smell any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff works . There were a couple of areas of his face I could n't apply the mixture to , just so I would n't get any in his eyes , so we 'll just have to live with the faintest of " whiffs " until it wears off naturally in a few days . <p> So there you have it ... the very best " de-skunker " ever ! <p> Just my .02 's worth , sincerely , " Mac " <p> PS Needless to say , my idiot neighbour will be footing the bill for the de-skunking supplies , not to mention paying a fine for violating the very sensible sanitation bylaw ! <p> Oh , and by the way , this was Taz 's first brush with the nasty vermin , but you can be sure that he 'll listen the next time I yell ; <p> " Taz , no !

@@37128854 @6128854/ <p> Throughout our lives we 've been taught that males are the dominant species . Years ago Males were the ones who worked and provided for the family . Males were allowed to vote.Which changed with Susan B. Anthony who broke the law by voting and wanted the same treatment as a man . If you think about it we 're one of the only species like that . Let 's see for example the lioness does the hunting . After mating the female spider eats the male . The male seahorse carries the babies . Some say the males have dominated over the females since the caveman days but is that really true ? How would we know we werent there . We did n't  see how they interacted . Are males really the dominant species ? ( this is not a male/female bashing post .. just honest opinions and thoughts please ) . <p> Well , humans are the dominant species , but within that I do n't think either gender dominates entirely . The people ( either gender ) that I know who are most dominant at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . And I think either gender can change roles as needed , depending on the context . <p> I think we 're different from most other species in that we possess self-awareness . We can look at who we are and actually choose ( to a degree , obviously not entirely ) who we will become . <p> Unfortunately , there is still a lot to overcome before both sexes are truly equal . Most of it seems to exist in the small minds of simple people , including the ones running our country . I think that it 's really simple , we both have traits and strengths that are needed not only to perpetuate the species but to carry on relationships and survive . We are different from the animals in that we have evolved to have socities in which we create and invent and think . I think that animals have the capacity to think as well , just not in the same way as we humans do , ( at least not yet but who knows how THEY will evolve someday ) .. but anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal .. just different strengths . <p> I do n't think dominance can be defined by gender . I have known women that knew more about sports , cars , home repairs , made more money than some men . On the flip side , I have known men who were better cooks , better parent , better housekeepers than some women . I have known women that were physically stronger , and men that cried easier than some women . ( which is ok ) I think with women 's lib , two parent working families , or divorce we have become equals . I do n't think it was just because the women stood up and said hey , I 'm as good as you . It has evolved to the point in our economy that people had to change and become EQUAL . Dominance is when one person allows another to dominate . <p> I agree , nice post ! I do not really think it is about dominance anymore . It has been said behind every good man there is a good woman . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your side , you can be your best at anything . <p> Some say the males have dominated over the females since the caveman days but is that really true ? <p> Alas , but this was true , mainly through the strength issue . In the human species , the male was the stronger of the two , thus , through evolution , it continued . As we have evolved to modern times , strength has become a less important criteria in more civilized societies ( civilized being a debatable term ) . <p> Dominance in certain areas does still exist for both male and female , as well as in the various races . Intelligence is not one of these areas . <p> Alas , but this was true , mainly through the strength issue . In the human species , the male was the stronger of the two , thus , through evolution , it continued . As we have evolved to modern times , strength has become a less important criteria in more civilized societies ( civilized being a debatable term ) . <p> Well said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Historically , women have been dominated by men because of their strength and therefore considered to be the " dominant , stronger sex " . Because of the fear of physical harm women were submissive . This is still common in many third world countries but as you mentioned , less so in civilized world . <p> As far as equality in education women have now surpassed men in college acceptance and GPA . <p> There is one issue that is still going on however and that is the myth that women are less violent than men.To be equally fair to the men .. Women too can be just as violent otherwise there would n't be so many in our prison systems today .. mens activism is currently trying to bring this into light .. because both women and men are equal also when it comes to violence .

@@37128871 @6128871/ <p> What do you all think about dating someone with a felony ? ( non violent ) And if a person has a felony , when would be a good time to tell others ? Would you yourself date someone with a felony ? Do you think non violent felons deserve love too ? <p> I do n't automatically consider a past felony convication a sign that a person is irredeemable . It partly depends on what felony they committed , I suppose , and of course I have my personal prejudices . As far as a " good time to tell others , " if it 's not important that they know , why should the information be volunteered ? I might date someone who had been convicted of a felony , depending on what felony they were convicted of . I ca n't make any blanket statement other than to say that I try not to hold a person 's past against them to an undue extent . I 'm more interested in how they behave now , within reason . Having said all that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by a minority of people . <p> ( ( sigh ) ) I 'm always in the minority with my opinions . Welcome to the club Night ! I do agree with you though . If it was not a serious crime , and is in the past , they have paid for it and have not repeated , what 's the problem ? Their behavior and character now is what matters . And it is no one else 's business unless the person convicted of the crime decides to tell someone . <p> Jun 1 , 2008 @ 12:42 AM <p> Dating felons <p> sweet5red <p> Posts : 13,120 <p> .................... <p> Edited on 6/1/2008 2:05 AM <p> Jun 1 , 2008 @ 1:24 AM <p> Dating felons <p> nah12 <p> Posts : 3,779 <p> well i think one should tell and i would not want to date or become involved with a felon ... main reason is felony offense usually involves one of the following , larceny , rape , homicide , forgery , counterfeiting , robbery , treason and etc .... they also involve someone doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll pass .... <p> It depends . No one is safe from becoming a felon - for violating traffic laws , or for insider trading , for example . Would you turn down Martha Stewart ? Or Vynona Rider ? ( for those who forgot - she was convicted for shoplifting ) Or proverbal Paris Hilton ? I seriously doubt it <p> Actually , Cap , I would turn down any of those three ! But , in my state , in my youth , mere possession of marijuana was a felony . Was someone my age picked up at a party rousting back in ' 76 with a joint ? I hardly think that makes her a terrible person . Did her old man walk out on her and a new baby and she wrote over $200 worth of hot checks to survive for a couple of months ? That would have been a felony in many states . What if you met someone , you really liked them , you got along , and at some point , they said , " Look . There 's something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was at a party and got really , really drunk . And I drove home . And on the way , I hit a car and the other driver died . I was convicted of negligent homicide and did 6 years . I used the time while I was in to get my marketing degree , and I have n't had a drink since . But I thought you should know . " <p> Like I said , it depends to me on what felony was committed , the likelihood that they are pursuing a life of crime now , etc. , etc . I 'm not going to say that someone having been convicted of a felony in the past automatically rules them out as a partner for me . How many people are today sitting in jail wrongly convicted of felonies ? We hear about death penalty cases being overturned , rape convictions overturned on DNA evidence . What if the person I 'm interested in was convicted of a crime when the technology did n't exist that would have cleared them , but I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did their time and have never committed a crime since ? As far as telling someone , I would want to know if someone I was going to be personally involved with had been convicted of a felony . That was n't what I meant when I said " Why volunteer the information ? " My adult step-sons , for instance , do n't need to be introduced to her as " This is my friend , X. We 're thinking about getting married . By the way , she did time . " If I invite my uncle Ralph to the wedding , I do n't need to have it printed on the invitations . It would be a matter for my significant other and I to discuss and agree upon who to tell when . If she was uncomfortable with them not knowing but possibly finding out , and would feel better getting it out in the open , fine . If not , then that would probably be fine with me too . As I say , I ca n't make a blanket statement about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual I was dealing with . And that 's my advice to Buni . If you and your significant other can live with the past , it 's your decision . I would n't necessarily kick someone to the curb just because they made a mistake somewhere along the line . <p> Edited on 6/1/2008 6:37 AM <p> Jun 1 , 2008 @ 7:24 AM <p> Dating felons <p> jazzy73703 <p> Posts : 65 <p> My second husband had been to prison twice for burglary of a building .

I 've met some really good people this way , and have also been served some humble pie . <p> I have a " live and let live " nature about me , but even if I found the " right man " in every other way , and depending on the crime committed , I would still hesitate to date him .

@@37128881 @6128881/ <p> Somebody with a fast mouth and a slow brain needs a bit of education me thinks .. <p> Yes .. Switzerland does have a small navy of sorts . Why ? <p> Quick geography lesson .. Switzerland is ' not ' wholly land locked when its borders include Lake Lec de Geneva into France , Lake Constance into Germany and River de Garda into Italy . So three waterways form part of international frontiers , and their navies consist of a few patrol craft . Switzerland also has a major Rhine commercial fleet ( you can see the Swiss flag flying all the way to the Netherlands ) , which military patrol craft in event of war . <p> However , both the navy and air force are actually branches of the army ( like the infantry and artillery ) . <p> And possibly because other countries have Navys that have air craft carriers that can launch an attack from a long distance . And to be able to mobilize troops via sea . We can learn a lot from the Swiss . If we took their foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being blown up in our own country , have a great deal larger per capita income because all of our tax dollars would n't be going to Israel to supply them with weapons and fight wars for them in the middle east . <p> Idiots ? That was probably the most ignorant and uneducated statement you could have made . Switzerland has hardly any natural resources yet they are very wealthy , and the reason they are wealthy is because they tap into their intellectual resources and found out a way to be productive to the world , all without making any enemies with anyone . They are a prime example of what all nations should strive to be . Grow up you dork <p> Why do some people take my blogs seriously ? . I even wrote a blog saying " do n't  take my blogs seriously " .

They continue , to this day , not giving any of the money that was deposited by Holocaust victims . Is that grown up enough for you ? . <p> I think of things that , on the surface , seem really silly and I ask the question , why ? . Its meant as a joke , and it is not meant to show how poorly educated I am , because I was actually , pretty well educated.It does show how some people have no sense of humour , or that they do n't  know when someone is joking . <p> Being landlocked , Switzerland does not have a navy , but it does maintain a fleet of military patrol boats , numbering 10 in 2006 .

Sinai around 1300 BC . The estimate for the time the Bible covers is from creation until now . The date of creation is not really known .

If the thermocouple is bad , it does n't matter what you do , it wo n't light . <p> I 'm gon na have my handyman guy check it out because I 'm thinking it 's not as simple as I 'd like it to be ! <p> &lt; Would be your handyman if I lived in town <p> I agree with Nightowl 's suggestion . Your handyman should use one of these leak detectors . It makes variable intensity whiney pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas leak . <p> If it makes no sound a something different than what is expected at the dispersion point then you 'll have the answer on whether or not it is gas related . <p> Thermocouples need to be checked with an electrical continuity/ ohms tester . <p> Pressing the ignitor button is like flicking a lighter , you will get a spark each time you press down , ( or flick ) . You can press it down a few times with no worries . <p> Kinda like a gas grill ..... The main thing is ........ How long you keep the pilot pressed down ....... The longer you keep the pilot pressed , the more gas is released . If you have too much gas , there is a chance for a flare up , very similar to lighting a gas grill ..... <p> Too much gas , can be dangerous . But , usually you will smell gas when it becomes dangerous . <p> I have had my pilot go out during heavy winds or downdrafts ... <p> How old is your water heater ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put very much money in it . Unless you have a water softener , then it will last quite a bit longer . Besides , if it is older then that , the energy saving models will give you a slight tax break , and save you money every single day you use it . <p> One other thing ..... if you not sure if you have spark when pushing the ignitor , grab a flash light , turn off the lights , and push the ignitor , you should see a spark through the lens ..... And also , after it is fixed , ask the handy man to show you how to light it yourself ... Then you will always know if it ever goes out again ... <p> You should also peek through the hole while it is lit , so you know what it looks like .... <p> No *spark* at all ( story of my life ! ) and it 's approximately 4 yrs old .

Two days now and no hot water ? <p> Oh my ... <p> ... Like several here , I would imagine the Thermocouple is bad , or not making contact at the gas valve end . <p> ... If you hold down the button long enough , a couple of minutes , you should smell gas . <p> ... Sometimes , removing the end of the thermocouple from the gas valve itself ( small wrench ) and lightly sanding the contact will allow for continuity that is often enough interrupted from corrosion . <p> New thermocouple looks like ... where the ' bullet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when lit , the heat transfers through the thermocouple back to the gas valve and tells the valve it can turn the main gas valve on when the temperature switch calls for heat . <p> ... Often enough , the striker is not working and that could be from a bad ground , but I usually get weary of screwing around with them , or a match and removing the inspection cover to the pilot and burner , use a propane torch that lights the pilot and heats the thermocouple at the same time , eliminating the need to hold the pilot button down until the pilot light itself heats the thermocouple . <p> ... I know it is all working then . <p> ... But , if the striker to light the pilot is not working , you will still be able to smell gas after a minute or two at the inspection plate ( manifold door ) and removal of the plate , will allow you to light it manually when holding the pilot button down and give it a minute or two to warm the thermocouple before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It seems that when a guy gets beat up in a relationship with high maintenance women that he might decide to look for a plain and average looking woman who would be more down to earth . Like Diamondrain says , Never make a pretty woman your wife . There might be some wisdom to that . <p> Yeah ! !

You 're a super intelligent girl and I say that with much respect . <p> The guy that wrote " Never make a pretty woman your wife " just wanted her for himself ! <p> For the record , I see far more 4 guys with 9 girls than 9 guys with 4 girls . I would hope a 9 ( male or female ) would see just how silly it is to base whether you date somebody on external appearances . <p> Of course , usually the 4 has some class and this guy sounds like he needs a refresher course in basic hygiene . <p> And , eventually every 9 is knocked down a few levels by age . Well , not every 9 .. Raquel Welch has held up extraordinarily well . <p> I would even go so far as to say that any male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 9 girlfriend .. woman are n't as concerned by looks as men are .

She is more likely to be swayed by bad grooming or a bad attitude or a lack of self-confidence . <p> Women do n't dress like they do for guys .. they do it to impress other girls and most guys do n't understand that .

That 's because to a man , appearance matters more than almost everything else . They do n't think that way and they still consider women being the same species as men are ( which is why they are constantly misunderstanding women ) . <p> Fortunately , there is something that matters to a man more than appearance and most women are capable of using that to get men under control . <p> Something else that comes into play is that not all women who are 9s are natural nines . Its very common for women to get cosmetic surgery and implants these days and women are very good at making themselves look good .. with clothing and makeup - that is what a woman does to play the game . <p> What do men do ? drink beer and wear the same jeans and t-shirt for a week . hmm .. does n't sound quite fair to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while researching deep in the dusty stacks of a centuries old library . <p> It seems that many eons ago there was a great war and when the smoke cleared all of the males native to this planet were dead and no woman was pregnant .

It is funny how a lot of woman just spend it on whatever they want to . I have a daughter in another state , and all her mom did was just get a more expensive car with that money . And now they claim that they have changed it ofr the better now . My ex wife has to pay me support for two kids . Under the new law , even though she has a roomate , ( her soon to be hubby ) , His money means nothing now . She gets at least half her bills paid by someone else and she does not have to pay more . Give me a break . Years ago all of us guys would have had to pay way more because of that . <p> I wanted to tell RAVEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a few like her . My xwife wanted me to literally pay her more money in order to avoid going to court . I moved in with my boyfriend after 2 yrs of dating and only with her verbal consent . 8 months later she says Im violating the court order not to have an overnight guest therefore needs the kids every weekend and more money to take care of them . Given the fact that I ca n't get married in Arkansas , not that I would want to get the legal system anymore involved than necessary , I live with my partner but we have seperate bedrooms and NEVER sleep together when my 2 daughters are there . They love being with us and beg me to try to get full custody . The step-dad is emotionally abusive and has also left a bruise on my younger daughter . We live in a crazy society where the woman can meet a guy , marry and move the a-hole in with your kids and its fine , but a gay man has to beg the x for permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even agreed to letting the kids stay every weekend for the past 8 months . NOW , since she changed her work schedule , she demands to have to kids more or hold me in contempt unless I agree to pay her another 2 or 3 hundred a month . Otherwise , she wants my partner to sleep elsewhere when I have the kids .. NOW THAT IS A CONTROLLING X WIFE ! The kids would be devasted if that happened , , or worse if I 'm thrown in jail ... the kids will hate her even more than they do already and unless I pay her off .. my kids suffer !

First of all , it 's not fatal , nor does it lead to any other sort of disease , as HPV ( genital warts ) does - no effect on men , but is the root cause of cerrvical cancer in women .

The blinds were drawn , making the room feel like twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , " she instructed , pointing to the straight-back chair . She sat down in the rocking chair and lit a candle on a small table under the lamp . <p> " Now , tell me , " she said , " what is it you have come to ask ? " <p> Before I could speak , my throat filled with tears . I felt as if I were a small child desperately trying to stay above water in a pool . I started to gasp . <p> " Do not worry , my dear , " she said in a mossy-soft voice . " You are safe here . " <p> Her voice was a sort of balm . I swallowed several times as if flushing away years of unspoken fears . <p> " Now , tell me , " she said again , " tell me why you 're here . " <p> " I want to know if " " I began , but I could n't finish the sentence . Finally , I blurted out : " I want to know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life . It 's okay if I 'm not . It 's really okay . I have so much in my life . My family . My friends . My artists . My galleries . I just want to know . I want to stop worrying about it " thinking about it all the time . " <p> " Let us see , " she said , and she closed her eyes . <p> We both sat in stillness for a matter of minutes , then she cocked her head toward the ceiling , and her voice became high-pitched and singsong . " Well , my dear , the real question is : What is it that you truly want for your life ? " <p> I began to feel the tears forming again . " I want to share my life , " I said . " I 've always wanted to share my life . But it seems that I am destined to be with the wrong person . It always ends in disaster . I do n't know . Maybe I am not supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charlene 's lilting voice filled the room , " the spirits say that you should have exactly what you want . They say that of course you should share your life if that is what you want . " <p> I took a deep breath . I could feel the tension leaving my body . " Really ? " <p> " Yes , of course , " she said , and as if she were repeating instructions from the spirits , she said , <p> " Here is what you must do . You must go home and write down 100 qualities you would like this person with whom you will share your life to have . " <p> I felt almost giddy . " A hundred ? Would n't I be lucky if I got 10 ? " <p> " Oh no , my dear , " she said . " You must describe the person down to the color of the socks ! " <p> I wanted to laugh . Color of the socks ? <p> " You will make your list , and then you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing is making clear for yourself exactly the person who will be right for you , an <p> and then you will be directing the request into the universe to send that person to you . Do you understand ? " <p> I nodded . But I did n't understand at all . The idea that somewhere in the universe was a person just right for me " someone who would respond to all the things that were important to me and with whom I could share my life " seemed impossible . Yet in spite of the painful experiences of the past , I had always lived my life as if all things were possible . Why would n't I try making the list ? <p> At home I climbed into my four-poster bed with a yellow legal pad . I was amazed by how easy it was to write the list . I began with the definitive idea that he must be " at peace with himself . " Then I listed everything , from good family relationships to intelligence and a sense of humor , to sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sailing , dancing , fishing , and on and on " down to dark gray socks . <p> Satisfied that I had done my part , I put the list in the back of my closet . <p> After about 15 minutes of waiting for Aubrey 's answer , he walked into my room with the list in his hand . He had tears in his soft blue eyes . We looked at each other for several seconds before he spoke . <p> " I missed two , " he said , holding up the list . Then , smiling , he added , " There are many things you have on this list that are true about me that you could not possibly know . " <p> I wanted to laugh out loud . Instead I jumped up and threw my arms around him . I felt jubilant . Whatever doubts I harbored that he might have missed many more than two , I knew that the point was that he thought he missed only two . I had given my list to the universe and the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I were married in February of the following year , the beginning of a gloriously happy and trusting time in my life . Of the two qualities on the list he thought he missed " " loves to dance " and " loves to sail " " neither was important . His interests in gardening and architecture , previously unknown to me , led us to build a house and garden in Maine that surpassed either of our dreams . Some of the more intangible qualities on the list provided even greater surprises . We shared 11 wonderful years before he died of lung cancer , many more joyful years than I had ever imagined possible . What happened was beyond all reason . I can only marvel at the mysterious and beneficent universe that brought us together .

Too , instead of less choosy , we get more choosy-after all , someone has to be very special to make a person willing to give up the remote , cook for someone else , etc. when one is used to living alone .

I hope you find the one who is meant for you ! Phyllis <p> Question , first , why you want a mate after the age when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone even close to your age . <p> My limited experience ( of 1 ) tells me I need to offer my mate the very least environment to which she ( and her ready-made family ) are already accustomed . <p> Having been unceremoniously dumped by a lady who had recently divorced a Colonel in the Red Army , with 2 children just successfully completing University ( and me on a UK State pension who failed my 11 plus at the age of 13 .. ) well , need I elaborate ? <p> It 's easy to find someone after age 60 , but so very often , women want a man younger than themselves , and men want a woman younger than themselves . It 's a real quandry . A challenge for sure . <p> I tried dating a woman near my age just once , and that was a real disaster , wrinkled upper lip from smoking , hoarse voice , hard of hearing , and real cranky with her 94 year old mother and complained a lot about the men she had dated . Other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a nice body at 5 ' 8 " and 130 pounds , and was sort of cute too . We call each other now and then , and do get along very well because when we see each other , it 's for a very short while . <p> She is a nice person , but a bit too worn out and angry to be a good mate for someone . She is unhappy , lives a fairly wealthy lifestyle , and that seems to be her problem , maybe a little disenchanted with how the world had treated her in her past , and wants to be materialistically " pampered again " ( her words ) .... I feel sorry for her . Incidentally , in America , 83% of divorces are instigated by women , not by men . <p> There are more 44-48 year old single women in America than any other age bracket , with 46 being the magic number . I 'm not sure exactly why this is the case , but there is a big dropoff for women around age 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of them divorce at around age 42 . Could it be that the kids are grown up , and it 's time to play , or maybe that the old man is n't interested in them enough any more ? I do n't know the answer . A lady friend told me what she thought and knew , but I ca n't and wo n't repeat what she said on here . <p> It 's easy to find a mate after age 60 , but it will likely not be what we really want . At this age we have to compromise . I see women who want a man to have a 6 figure income , and at age 60 , it ai n't gon na hoppen Baby , especially when there are 30-50 year olds who want the same 6 figure guy .

They also like us to have all our teeth , even if they do n't . They like confident , dignified-looking men , men who present an air of aristocracy when they walk into a room . I 'm not an expert , but I do know what women tell me , and I have many lady friends who confide in me . <p> Yeah , I 'm with you on that one .

I would never want the US to tip off the enemy that way . <p> But with all Israel does , more than any other country has ever done , it still is n't enough for some people . Why ?

My late parent 's house is only 3 miles from the beach so every day they would go there . <p> I 'll never forget the day when my son-in-law and I were sitting on the beach and watched the shadows of 2 sharks leisurely swimming along , one behind the other , just beyond where people were swimming . The swimmers had no idea what was going on just behind them . Lifeguards never yelled a warning to clear the water which to this day makes me wonder , why not ? Maybe they thought it would be safer for the swimmers to not draw the sharks attention with them panicking and thrashing around trying to get out of the water and hope that the sharks were just passing thru which apparently was all they were doing . <p> When my mom was still alive , we would go to the Texas coast at least once a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she died .

And since the break up my ex wo n't let me see the little girl anymore ( who i still call my daughter ) . It just rips me apart not being able to see her , that plus I 'm sure she 's confused ... she 's two and a half years old and she 's seen me pretty much everyday for the past two years and now she has n't seen me for more than a month .

A lot of guys would have bailed on the child once the woman made the decision to end the relationship . <p> Also , maybe start a " treasure box " for her , the child .

@@37128941 @6128941/ <p> That was Donald Trump 's boast when he opened his new hotel in Washington , DC . Apparently , not paying your contractors counts as being under budget . <p> According to separate reports in Bloomberg News and the Washington Post , three contractors have filed mechanic 's liens against the hotel . All in a days work for Trump , who despite his appeal to working class Americans , has a long history of stiffing his workers and contractors . <p> Magnolia Plumbing worked on the Trump hotel for more than two years on its plumbing , mechanical , HVAC , sewer , and water systems . Trump owes $2.98 million to the family-owned firm . Magnolia , who had received payment for early work , is worried that if Trump is forced to liquidate his assets into a blind trust he will never be paid . <p> A Maryland electrical company , AES Electrical , has also placed a lien in the amount of $2.075 million . A third construction company responsible for installing crown moldings and other decorative finishes has filed a much smaller lien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets . If the liens go unanswered , the three contractors may then sue for compensation . That has not always worked well for others as Trump 's lawyers have routinely told unpaid workers and subcontractors they have the deep pockets to wait them out . <p> Even before Trump became the nominee , this project was fraught with controversy . Competing hotel chains challenged Trump 's bid , claiming that Trump would be unable to generate sufficient income to pay his lease . Since he received the nomination , ethics watchdogs have called on Trump to sell his lease as the leasing agreement prohibits elected officials from receiving financial benefit from the hotel . <p> Others have complained that Trump has also violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution in continuing to operate this hotel . Trump Enterprises has aggressively courted visiting foreign dignitaries to stay in his hotel . Here is a comprehensive article on the Emoluments Clause from The Economist . <p> Just like showing his taxes , Trump has no intentions of cutting his ties with the ' family business ' ! ! <p> The inauguration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ! ! <p> Winglets <p> Jan 6 @ 9:53AM <p> Oh boy , I see some tough times ahead .

On top of all that the taxpayer must find money to pay for the wall , as Mexico will not . Trump could start a trade war with China , causing all kinds of trouble for the US ..... but hey , he 's the man for the job according to rethuglicans . <p> Never forget the US loss is another country 's gain .

QUOTE <p> Not happening . Another Hail Mary . Your kool-aid is getting warm . <p> A joint session of Congress votes today to ratify the votes and they will ratify it . And even if they looked at the brief they would find that , regards holding two offices and ineligibility , there are no constitutional qualifications set in selecting an elector and no federal guidelines either . End of story . Your research is biased and incomplete . <p> This comment wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winglets <p> Jan 6 @ 11:28AM <p> as long as YOU win sonny , that 's all you want . screw the country ... it 's all about thumping the chest . <p> BTW , nowhere in my comment did I entertain that the Congress will reject the vote of the Electoral College today , although if they did object to the votes of certain electors , it would not be without precedent . The following is from the Office of the Congressional Historian : <p> Since 1887 , 3 U.S.C. 15 sets the method for objections to electoral votes . During the Joint Session , Members of Congress may object to individual electoral votes or to state returns as a whole . An objection must be declared in writing and signed by at least one Representative and one Senator . In the case of an objection , the Joint Session recesses and each chamber considers the objection separately in a session which can not last more than two hours with each Member speaking for no more than five minutes . After each house votes on whether or not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers disclose their decisions . If they agree to the objection , the votes in question are not counted . If either chamber does not agree with the objection , the votes are counted . <p> Therefore , any one Member of Congress can raise an objection to these 50 electors and if they did ( and I 'm not saying anyone will ) they would throw a real monkey wrench into the process as Mr. Trump would have fewer than the necessary 270 Electoral College votes . <p> Here is a link to the pertinent section of the US Code . The joint session is required to begin at 1:00 . We shall know then if any one member of the House or Senate objects to the vote of any particular Elector . <p> In his bid for American protectionism , he 's alienating a LOT of countries and companies that have plants in America already and employ hundreds , if not thousands , of Americans . <p> I see he attacked Toyota the other day , demanding they open another plant in the US for their Corollas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plant that is being built in Mexico is to take the place of the Canadian plant that currently builds Toyotas . Not that I 'm a fan of Canadian jobs going south , to the US or to Mexico , but the facts are , the plant in Mexico has NOTHING to do with the US . <p> Has trump stopped manufacturing his stuff in China yet ? How come no one asks HIM these questions and demands that he adhere to the policies of the position ? <p> Other countries are going to get fed up with him attacking them and damaging their stock prices and going to go elsewhere ( Canada welcomes you ! ) taking all their jobs with them . The US will no longer be seen as a viable location to manufacture anything , and what little jobs are there now , will be removed . Who gets hurt ? Yup , the little guy trump vowed to be champion for despite having a history of screwing them out of their rightfully earned payment . <p> As for the wall - Mexico 's president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paying for the wall . <p> In September , current Mexican president Enrique Pe+a Nieto wrote on Twitter : " I repeat what I told you personally Mr Trump : Mexico will never pay for a wall . " <p> From what I have gathered from trump and how he 's going to make Mexico pay for the wall is all based on NAFTA and the credit that the US holds . trump stated during his campaign that the US held a large credit with Mexico . I believe he will insist Mexico ' balance ' the credit , thus making Mexico pay for the wall . <p> Why no one else was paying attention to this statement is beyond me , but I believe if trump forces any issues with regards to Mexico , he 's going to find himself the very reason for a lot of lost jobs and even less manufacturing . And what happened to his backtracking on the wall right after he was elected ? <p> trump has proven himself to be so unstable and incapable of sticking to any one coherent thought or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a really bad joke worldwide . <p> there are no constitutional qualifications set in selecting an elector and no federal guidelines either . End of story . Your research is biased and incomplete . <p> Your research is biased and incomplete , sir . It is not federal guidelines that are at issue as Electors represent the states and are subject to state law . <p> Prior to the meeting of the Electoral College , there was a great deal of discussion about " faithless " or Hamilton Electors who might violate the binding requirements of the laws of their state ( 29 states have such a binding requirement ) and vote for an alternate candidate . <p> These same state laws have other requirements as well . Some require that Electors must be residents of the Congressional districts they represent . Apparently , 16 Trump Electors violated this legal requirement . Other states bar dual office holding . No elected or appointed official is allowed to serve as an Elector . 34 Electors , including Florida AG Bondi , violated their state 's law prohibiting dual office holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , objections were heard during the Joint Session . In 1877 , concerns were raised about seating a president who won the Electoral College , but lost the popular vote . Rutherford Hayes won the election despite losing the popular vote by a wide margin . Hmmm , that sounds familiar . <p> In 2005 , the Joint Session debated for more than 2 hours whether or not to accept the Electoral College votes from the State of Ohio . <p> The process provides for one House member , seconded by a Senator , to raise an objection to one or all of the electors in question . Will the objectors carry the day ? That is anyone 's guess , however , I do believe that this will prove to be a long and interesting debate ... one for the history books . <p> Winglets <p> Jan 6 @ 12:18PM <p> These same state laws have other requirements as well . Some require that Electors must be residents of the Congressional districts they represent . Apparently , 16 Trump Electors violated this legal requirement . Other states bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to serve as an Elector . 34 Electors , including Florida AG Bondi , violated their state 's law prohibiting dual office holding . <p> So what happens now , can they kick him to the curb before he walks into the White House ? That 's what I 'm waiting for . <p> Should the ballots of these Electors be successfully challenged and invalidated , Mr. Trump would not have the necessary 270 Electoral College votes . When that happens , it falls to the House to decide our next president . They would then chose between the top three Electoral College vote getters -- Trump , Clinton and Colin Powell . <p> Do I think Trump will prevail , probably . But as I said earlier , I believe this election will be one for the history books . <p> Winglets <p> Jan 6 @ 12:33PM <p> And will the US$ remain the reserve currency under this uncertainty ? Countries around the world will have to make a plan to survive Trump , even if that means they must take a knock financially for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in U.S. dollars , making the dollar the reserve currency for the globe . Even before concerns were raised about Donald Trump 's commitment to the " full faith and credit " of US debt instruments , the supremacy of the US dollar took a few hits . <p> In early 2016 , Japan ( the world 's third largest economy ) and China ( the world 's second ) struck a trade deal in which they agreed to promote the use of their own currencies rather than the US dollar . The BRICs -- Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa -- signed two pacts doing just about the same . <p> That is not to say that should Mr. Trump throw international markets into a global recession , these pacts would safeguard the economies in question . Just look at the turmoil one little country , Greece , caused European and global markets . <p> My comment was confined solely to the briefing to be filed with the Joint session and its premise that electors were ineligible due to dual offices held or residency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as an elector . The Founders left that for states to determine . A simplification , is it possible that all " is " were n't dotted and " ts " crossed in states filing election results ? It 's possible , but again , there is no federal standard for those reports to challenge . Rather , the delusional left would like to get Congress itself to declare the Electoral College vote invalid . That will not happen . And BTW , if Congress were to consider eligibility of Republican electors they would have to consider the Democrats as well but no one wants to open a can of worms on how representatives are elected.While your ancillary information was accurate it was n't germane to my point I made . In 10 minutes we 'll find that their time , while billable , was wasted . <p> Winglets <p> Jan 6 @ 12:58PM <p> In early 2016 , Japan ( the world 's third largest economy ) and China ( the world 's second ) struck a trade deal in which they agreed to promote the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRICs -- Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa -- signed two pacts doing just about the same . <p> I thought that was dead in the water , bar China and India which are doing well , the rest of the nations within that group have had economic woes of their own to contend with , South Africa included which is just hovering above junk status , the only reason the ratings agencies are patient with us is because it 's a new democracy .... they are waiting for government to reform the parastatals and to get rid of corruption . We live in hope . <p> I approve of the ratings agencies , pity they were n't around in the 60 's , it would have saved many African countries . Anyway , why my concern , Trump could threaten democracy and I do n't wish to live under China rule , under any form . <p> is it possible that all " is " were n't dotted and " ts " crossed in states filing election results ? It 's possible , but again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge <p> We are electing a president , not making a chopped salad . <p> You are incorrect that there are no federal qualifications for Electors . Article II , Section 1 , Clause 2 of the Constitution provides that Electors may not be federal office holders . Amendments to the Constitution have also affected the Electoral College , most importantly 12 , 14 , and 23 . The passage of the 15th and 19th Amendments granted not only former slaves and women the right to vote , but to serve as electors . Chapter 1 , Title 3 of the lays out additional requirements as well as providing for states to enact laws concerning the selection of electors , etc . <p> And the states have done so . Not only have states passed statutes binding electors to the popular vote in that state , but they have also passed residency requirements and prohibitions against dual office holding . It is the violation of these statutory requirements that has raised red flags . <p> Well , they 've finished . As I expected , Trump 's election was certified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots of a number of states . <p> Winglets <p> Jan 6 @ 1:57PM <p> Well it 's going to be a bumpy ride and with Trumpty Dumbty attacking US listed companies , one can only wonder what he has up his sleeve for those abroad . It will make other nations think about how they can survive Trump for the next 4 years . I think America might be surprised , but one thing I can tell you is financial institutions do n't like uncertainty . So change is coming , for sure . <p> Getting back to the blog .... it is in keeping with Trump 's long history of stiffing employees , contractors , investors and suppliers.Why anyone would rationalize his pathetic behavior is beyond me.He is THE WORST US presidential candidate and president-elect in my lifetime .
