@@90847652 @6347652/ <h> NBA Mock Draft 2017 <p> I waited a little later than usual to finalize this 2017 NBA Mock Draft mainly due to all the uncertainty as to which team would be picking first overall . Now that we know that the 76ers traded up to get their guy Markelle Fultz , it will be interesting to see how the rest of the first round unfolds . Ball is no lock to go No. 2 to the Lakers , so that domino may set the tone for the rest of the draft once it falls . I predict a lot of trades this year and a lot of teams acquiring draft picks knowing that they will be a few years out from competing with the Warriors and whatever team LeBron ends up on . Without further ado <h> 1 . Philadelphia 76ers Markelle Fultz , PG , Washington <p> Fultz was long considered the front-runner to be the first pick in the draft , but in somewhat of a surprising twist , the Celtics trade the pick so that the young 76ers can get their point guard of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fultz , Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid have enough talent to make an impact in the East , and will form a scary potential Big 3 for years to come . <h> 2 . L.A. Lakers Lonzo Ball , PG , UCLA <p> There have been numerous reports saying that the Lakers are unimpressed with Ball 's workouts , and his outspoken father is another factor you have to consider when taking a prospect this high . There is a real possibility that these recent factors have scared team brass and they may elect to pass on Ball in favor of De'Aaron Fox or Josh Jackson . My gut says that they stick with Ball . There is no way that Magic Johnson , himself an oversized point guard with unbelievable court vision and extraordinary passing ability , will pass on Lonzo . He might not be the next Magic , but he will bring Showtime basketball back to the Lakers. <h> 3 . Boston Celtics Josh Jackson , SF/PF , Kansas <p> The Celtics make the smart move and pick up more assets to use for an off season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celtics were too deep in the backcourt to take another point guard like Fultz or Fox , so they will get another versatile forward who can play defense in Kansas ' Josh Jackson . <h> 4 . Phoenix Suns DeAaron Fox , PG , Kentucky <p> Fox is talented enough to be the best point guard in this draft , which just goes to show how deep this class is at the point guard position . It is no secret that the Suns love guards from Kentucky , and Fox may be one of the best when it is all said and done . He is extremely fast and athletic like John Wall , and had the defensive tenacity and competitiveness to shut down Lonzo Ball in their March Madness matchup . LaVar if you 're reading this , you 've been warned . <h> 5 . Sacramento Kings Jayson Tatum , SF , Duke <p> The Kings have been known throughout the draft process to be coveting De'Aaron Fox , so there is a chance they move up from this pick by packaging it with their 10th overall pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play out , I see the Kings front office playing it safe and drafting Tatum out of Duke . With the departure of Rudy Gay , the Kings will lean on Tatum who can score smoothly in the post and from the perimeter , and has all the tools to blossom into a future All-Star if the Kings can avoid messing up his development . <h> 6 . Orlando Magic Dennis Smith , PG , N.C. State <p> The Magic already have Elfrid Payton at the point guard position , but the rest of their guards are very underwhelming to say the least . Smith will bring athleticism , scoring and electricity to the team as he is one of the most explosive guards to come out of the ACC in the last couple years . The team will find a way to put Payton and Smith on the floor together to form a young and dynamic nucleus with Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier. <h> 7 . Minnesota Timberwolves Jonathan Isaac , SF/PF , Florida State <p> Isaac has too much upside for the T-Wolves to pass on him here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his outside shooting ability to pair with KAT in the interior . Isaac has the potential to be a poor man 's Kevin Durant due to his long and lanky frame and high basketball IQ . If the T-Wolves keep drafting impact players at this rate , they could be contending in the West much sooner than expected . <h> 8 . New York Knicks Malik Monk , SG , Kentucky <p> All reports coming out of New York are that they are committed to running the triangle offense this season , something Phil Jackson is extremely adamant about implementing due to it 's focus on ball movement and spacing . Monk 's game is very well-suited for the triangle as he can space the floor with his shooting ability and has a knack for moving without the ball and getting open . I predict that Monk will become a fan favorite in the Big Apple as something of a John Starks 2.0 Spike Lee would be proud . <h> 9 . Dallas Mavericks Lauri Markkanen , PF , Arizona <p> The simple reason for this pick is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Cuban needs to begin planning for the post-Dirk era which starts here . Markkanen may not end up having the Hall of Fame career that Nowitzki has enjoyed , but you can easily plug him into their current system without missing a beat . The two are both 7-footers with elite outside shooting ability and Markkanen will develop much quicker under Dirk 's watch . <h> 10 . Sacramento Kings Zach Collins , C , Gonzaga <p> The Kings always seem to mess up their lottery picks somehow , and this pick will surely receive its fair share of criticism since the team already has their share of young bigs on their roster . Something tells me that Vlade Divac and owner Vivek will fall in love with his ability to stretch the floor and add more size and versatility to their front court . <h> 11 . Charlotte Hornets Bam Adebayo , C , Kentucky <p> Adebayo can run the floor with ease and finishes lob dunks a la JaVale McGee did in the Warriors championship run . Combine that with a competitiveness and willingness to mix it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man pedigree , Bam will be an impact player early on . <h> 12 . Detroit Pistons Donovan Mitchell , SG , Louisville <p> Mitchell is an undersized but explosive shooting guard who is not afraid to go through contact to get a basket . His high-motor and amazing dunking ability will serve him well in the Motor City . <h> 13 . Denver Nuggets John Collins , PF , Wake Forest <p> Collins put together a tremendous freshman campaign in Wake Forest which showcased his ability to score the ball from inside but also featured an improved outside shot . He is an interior presence that the defense will have to account for . I see him as a Tristan Thompson type player with a better offensive skillset. <h> 14 . Miami Heat Frank Ntilikina , PG , France <p> He may be the best prospect out of Europe by far . Ntiilikina possesses cat-quick reflexes and a high basketball IQ which will allow him to earn minutes right away in the NBA . He has natural feel for the game and combined with his excellent size for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected for Utah 's Dante Exum a couple years ago . <h> 15 . Portland Trail Blazers Justin Patton , C , Creighton <p> Patton is the type of big man who beats the other ones down the floor with ease . He is very fluid and finishes well around the basket . Patton could be used as insurance in case the Blazers lose Meyers Leonard or Festus Ezeli this year . <h> 16 . Chicago Bulls Jarrett Allen , C , Texas <p> Allen reminds me a lot of DeAndre Jordan but with less athleticism . That is no knock on Allen as he is still one of the better big man prospects coming to the NBA this season . If he can put more weight on his frame there is a chance he can earn minutes sooner than expected . <h> 17 . Milwaukee Bucks Harry Giles , SF , Duke <p> Giles was pegged as a superstar in high school , but ACL injuries have derailed his once can't-miss career . He wanted to prove he could play against high-level ACC competition this year and got better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one team to ignore the red flags , it would be the Bucks , who are known to roll the dice on players with upside . Giles also has that Duke connection with Jabari Parker already in place to ease his transition to the league . <h> 18 . Indiana Pacers T.J. Leaf , PF , UCLA <p> Leaf looks like a classic Hoosier forward , so I would n't be surprised if they decide to go with the skilled Bruin from sunny California . His game is n't flashy , but he is a dependable scorer as a stretch four and can rebound effectively . <h> 19 . Atlanta Hawks Justin Jackson , SF , North Carolina <p> Jackson has a proven knack for hitting clutch outside shots and running the floor with the best of them . His experience playing under Roy Williams and winning a National Championship last season will only help him early in his career . <h> 20 . Portland Trail Blazers DJ Wilson , PF , Michigan <p> Wilson is a great leak out player and gets lots of his baskets beating his defender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays with a lot of passion and dunks the ball with aggression at least once a game . He is entering the NBA after his junior season so his ceiling may not be as high as some of the other prospects NBA teams could draft here . <h> 21 . Oklahoma City Thunder Terrance Ferguson , SG , Australia <p> Ferguson is the shooter with athleticism to match what Russell Westbrook needs beside him . He is still raw at only 19 years of age , but Ferguson can blossom into a star with the help of Mr. Triple Double . <h> 22 . Brooklyn Nets Kyle Kuzma , PF , Utah <p> He projects as a stretch four with above average skills for the position . Kuza was the key player for his Utah team and showed the ability to score from a variety of ways which led to him being a 1st Team All-Pac 12 player this season . <h> 23 . Toronto Raptors Ivan Rabb , PF , California <p> Rabb could turn out to be a lite-version of former Raptor superstar Chris Bosh . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handle their own in the post . If Rabb adds some more strength to his lanky frame , he may be able to develop into an All-Star caliber player like Bosh. <h> 24 . Utah Jazz Luke Kennard , SG/SF , Duke <p> Kennard has been the best shooter in college basketball for the past two seasons , but showed an all-around game this year that will translate to the next level . If the Jazz lose Gordon Hayward to the Celtics , they could elect to tab Kennard to fill in his place for the time being . <h> 25 . Orlando Magic Isaiah Hartenstein , PF , Germany <p> Hartenstein is a young European player who the Magic can develop overseas and bring him on the team when he is ready . Once he adds strength and plays against elite European competition , Hartenstein will be a beast when he returns stateside. <h> 26 . Portland Trail Blazers Jordan Bell , SF , Oregon <p> Bell has the Nike and Oregon connection working for him , plus his stellar career as the Ducks best player the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brooklyn Nets Josh Hart , SG , Villanova <p> Nova is known for their tough East Coast guards , and Hart will bring the same swagger to the Nets backcourt . He can score from multiple sets and never backs down to his competition . If Jeremy Lin departs , look for Hart to fill in the void . <h> 28 . L.A. Lakers Ike Anigbogu , PF , UCLA <p> The Lakers , presuming they select Ball with their first pick , will want him to come in to the organization with someone he is familiar with . That player could easily be Anigbogu , who was a frequent recipient of many of Balls no look passes and lobs at UCLA. <h> 29 . San Antonio Spurs Nigel Williams-Goss , PG , Gonzaga <p> Williams-Goss was the motor and heart of a Gonzaga team that was ranked No. 1 for most of the season . Tony Parker ca n't play forever , and Patty Mills may look to greener pastures , so it would n't surprise me one bit if Pop goes with a steady and dependable playmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PG , Duke <p> Frank Jackson probably made a mistake by coming out after his average freshman year , but he will soon show that he will make a name for himself in this league . Jackson is an explosive athlete with a similar game to Derrick Rose , but only time will tell if he can match up with the best of today 's elite NBA point guards .

On Thursday , the Bulls agreed to send Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Zach LaVine , Kris Dunn and the No. 7 pick in the draft , which would end up being Lauri Markkanen out of Arizona . <p> The trade reunites Butler with his former Bulls head coach , Tom Thibodeau , who was in charge of the team until 2014 , before taking the head coach/president position with the Timberwolves . <p> Minnesota also received the 16th pick in the draft , with which they selected Justin Patton . <p> As a lifetime Bulls fan , I 'm okay with losing Jimmy , but not for the price .

@@90847656 @6347656/ <h> 2016 Fantasy Football Rookie Dynasty Sleepers <p> Predicting rookie success is like predicting when Kanye West is going create an awkward situation . Its going to happen when and where you least expect it , yet somehow all the time . We do what we can in the fantasy world to recognize situations where rookies are drafted to a team as either a perfect fit or a myriad of question marks , especially in dynasty leagues where rookies can make or break the future of your team . In this article I will be diving into some high and low profile rookie prospects , and one interesting super sleeper who is so asleep he s got jet lag literally . Make sure to check out my Rookie Rankings and the Fantasy Couch Draft Kit to properly prepare for draft day . <h> Dynasty/Keeper Rookie Sleepers <h> Sterling Shepard , NYG WR <p> Sterling Shepard is a name on a lot of many mouths . He has tremendous upside in an offense centered around the ultra talented Mr. Beckham . Ben MacAdoo , the new Giants head coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team up for success offensively and sterling Shepard seems to be a part of that plan . He s an ace route runner with a seemingly unbeatable " whip " route ( which is when a receiver fakes the slant or inside route , then plants his foot , reverses direction , and runs towards the sideline ) along with an ace reception ratio with only 8 drops to 253 receptions . Also , did I mention he plays across from OBJ ? With the Giants using a lot of three receiver looks behind Ben MacAdoos high powered offense , Sterling Shepard is one of those rookies poised to succeed with natural leadership that could have him seeing the field a lot in 2016 . Now the only question is , will Eli Manning play consistently or fall back into the turnover-prone Eli we are all used to . <h> Tajae Sharpe , Ten WR <p> Down in Tennessee its a bit hot outside and it might be from the wide receiver competition happening . That 's right you can check your pulse and pinch yourself all you like but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up in Nashville . Tajae Sharpe was drafted in the fifth round because he came from a small school , is n't the fastest guy , nor strongest , yet he sits at the top of the Titans depth chart as the starting WR2 across from Rishard Matthews . That means he s ahead of guys like Kendall Wright , Justin Hunter , and giant human Dorial Green-Beckham . What got him there ? Superior route running skills with crisp , clean breaks out of routes with experience under a former NFL coach and capable of a vast route tree . <p> Despite being 62 ? , he s sub-200 lbs , which means he wont be breaking tackles or catching too many balls under pressure and in traffic . Regardless , he still finds a way to get open and secure the catch . Great PPR sleeper as he led the nation in receptions per game with 9.3 . PPR players , I do n't  know about you , but I sure would love the idea of getting at least 10 points a game . <h> Devontae Booker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded backfield and it got a bit more crowded in the draft . Devontae Booker is a natural three-down back with good size and great strength that makes him a reliable short yardage back as well . Quick enough on his feet to make people miss and run fluidly through gaps and downfield . Patience and the ability to find the crease , follow blocks , and creating running lanes will ensure he stays on the field as much as possible . Soft hands give him added value in the passing game . <p> C.J. Anderson is the clear-cut starter for now , but has to prove himself this year to keep his role . Beat writers and fantasy experts already project Booker as the No. 2 RB , ahead of Ronnie Hillman . While there is a mild ball security issue with Booker , there 's a lot of upside to this rookie who could eventually be the workhorse in Denvers offense with the question marks surrounding the other backs in Colorado . <h> DeAndre Washington , Oak RB <p> In Oakland the winds of change are in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Raiders have some star pieces they 're placing on their board , and they just keep adding more . DeAndre Washington was n't a highly touted name coming into the draft but his athleticism is nothing to sleep on . A runner similar to Giovanni Bernard , Washington has good hands and the elusiveness to make people miss with exceptional run-after-the-catch ability . Unfortunately like Bernard , Washington is undersized , including his hands , which could lead to turnovers and losing snaps to shoddy pass protection ; this can be improved overtime though . The Raiders may have a deadly one-two punch with the shifty Washignton complimenting Latavius Murray . Murrays efficiency might improve if he shares some of the backfield duties with the rookie . <h> Moritz Boehringer , Min WR <p> I 'm not sure what 's going to be more difficult of an adjustment , Boehringer adjusting to NFL speed and play , or fantasy fans trying to pronounce his name . His name is Moritz Boehringer or Moritz B+hringer Say it with me ladies and gentlemen , and roll those Rs hard : " Myo-Reetz Bo-Reen-Gyar " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na try so hard . This man is a physical specimen . If it was n't his 64 ? , 225 frame , or his skill at tracking passes and reeling them in with his long arms and soft hands , or his abnormal quickness through his routes , it would be his ridiculous 4.43 40-yard dash time . For a man of his size , if he was a collegiate product coming into the draft , he would have been a consensus Top 10 NFL draft pick . <p> This guy is really raw though . Coming from the German Football League , playing for the legendary Schw+bisch Hall Unicorns , he was has never faced a man of Patrick Petersons talent . Despite being so raw , he will still be able to outplay most 3rd or 4th corners . Hell have to master the art of separation and hand skills against more athletic press defensive backs . The Vikings secondary is very talented and should groom him well on the ways of the NFL . <p> Every NFL rookie has the task of learning their teams playbook as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like personality and intelligence of fantasy rookies are very relevant . The more mentally prepared an NFL rookie is , the more likely they are to step up and deliver on game day . Time will tell if any of these guys pan out as reliable fantasy options but for right now , these fantasy football rookie sleepers should be on your radar in dynasty and keeper leagues .

@@90847675 @6347675/ <h> Fantasy Baseball The Closer Carousel <p> We see it happen every year . Certain closers come and go whether it be because of an injury or a collapse in performance , while some clubs even go with a closer by committee ' . Getting the ball in the ninth inning with your team holding a close lead is one of the more pressure-packed scenarios in sports and the job can have lots of turnover . <p> With saves being a mainstay in category leagues , fantasy owners need to be equipped with multiple closers and sometime there are n't enough quality arms to go around . And go around is what the carousel does sometimes . <h> Cincinnati Reds <p> We witnessed a gruesome injury when Aroldis Chapman was drilled in the face with a line drive off the bat of Kansas City 's Salvador Perez in spring training . The Cuban Missle ' is making his way back from surgery that repaired fractures in his nose and left eye and is in the middle of a rehab assignment . The flamethrower is expected back sometime this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they should be . <p> Jonathan Broxton has five saves in eight scoreless frames in Chapman 's absence after coming off the disabled list himself with an elbow injury . J.J. Hoover started the season as the club 's closer , but quickly surrendered his post within two weeks . <h> Los Angeles Angels <p> Ernesto Frieri was seemingly out of the closer 's job in Anaheim after blowing two saves and allowing five home runs in his first ten appearances . Manager Mike Scioscia turned to Joe Smith and the veteran has converted all three saves opportunities so far . <p> Even with Smith 's strong showing , reports have surfaced that Frieri could replace him soon after not allowing a hit in five consecutive appearances , including a save on Monday night . Smith was slated to save the game Monday , but got sick in the bullpen and Frieri stepped in . Scioscia reportedly prefers using Frieri in the ninth inning and having Smith to move around ' depending on certain matchups and scenarios . <p> Fantasy owners should monitor the situation very closely because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . <h> Oakland Athletics <p> Jim Johnson looks to have earned back the lead in the late-inning role with eight consecutive , scoreless outings in which he is 3-0 with a hold . The hard-throwing righty was traded to Oakland from Baltimore this past winter and he got off to a rocky start with five earned runs in his first two games . <p> Since then , right-hander Luke Gregerson and southpaw Sean Doolittle have closed out games . The fact remains that Johnson is being paid $10 million this year after leading the American League in saves the past two seasons with 50 and 51 , respectively . He is more than capable of being a top-tier fantasy closer again and owners should take notice if he is still available by chance . <h> Pittsburgh Pirates <p> The Bucs lost Jason Grilli to a strained oblique injury less than two weeks ago and Mark Melancon has recorded a save and a win in four scoreless appearances since taking over . Grilli is eligible to return from the disabled list on May 6th , but there has been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners should rely on Melancon for the foreseeable future and trust that he will be an above average option . He has a 1.38 earned run average in 85 innings combined between this season and last . <h> Chicago Cubs <p> With two saves just last week , Hector Rondon looking like the top option in the Cubs ' bullpen . Jose Veras was signed in the offseason to do the job , but he faltered early on with two blown saves and a 15.88 ERA in five appearances . Then it looked like Pedro Strop was going to be the guy ' and he was n't the answer as it seems he is better suited for less pressured filled situations . <p> Rondon took the defeat on Sunday after giving up a two-run single to Yadier Molina in the top of the ninth inning . The Venezuelan had only allowed one other earned run in just over 12 innings pitched before the mishap . Skipper Rick Renteria should roll with Rondon going forward and that means that fantasy owners should too . <h> Toronto Blue Jays <p> Casey Janssen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good news is that he will go out on a rehab assignment this week . The bad news has been the recent struggles of Sergio Santos , who has been officially removed in favor of a closer by committee until Janssen returns from the disabled list . The committee will be made up of Aaron Loup , Brett Cecil and Steve Delabar . <p> Fantasy owners will only want to try their luck with one of those guys if they are desperate enough and in that case , take a chance on Delabar . Janssen should be back within two weeks and expect him to be an above average option going forward . <h> New York Mets <p> This bullpen is a mess right now and Kyle Farnsworth is holding onto his job only because there is n't a better option . The 38-year-old righty blew a save on Saturday and took a loss for the second time in the last three outings . <p> The Metropolitans lost Bobby Parnell to season-ending , Tommy John surgery after only appearing in the Opening Day game against the Washington Nationals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pitching well until he allowed a combined four homeruns over three straight outings to relinquish the gig . <p> Fantasy owners should try to stay away from every Mets ' reliever right now , if at all possible . It is only a matter of time before Farnsworth pitches himself out of the job and someone like Daisuke Matsuzaka gets a shot . <h> Houston Astros <p> Four different Houston relievers have recorded a save thus far with Anthony Bass and Chad Qualls currently sharing the responsibility . Neither pitcher is worth owning in most leagues because both have been inconsistent and do n't provide much value outside of the occasional save . <p> Josh Fields was the guy to own out of spring training , but he was replaced recently after taking three straight losses with a total of nine earned runs over those appearances . The Astros do n't win many games as it is and this closer by committee situation is too ugly at this point .

@@90847701 @6347701/ <h> How to play fantasy baseball <h> How to play fantasy baseball A guide for beginners <p> You may have friends or co-workers that are really into fantasy baseball but maybe you have no idea how to play . You could be a lifelong baseball fan that has never dabbled with the game because of the 162-game baseball season that has 10 times as many games as football and about twice as many games as basketball . Or you may be intimidated by the perceived unlimited statistics or saber-metrics when it comes to baseball lingo and the confusing acronyms a casual fan hears every so often such as WAR , OPS , WHIP or BABIP . Sure , those acronyms do n't  seem too pleasant when making the transition from the gridiron or hardwood to the baseball diamond ; however , its easier to digest once you set the foundation . Fortunately for you , your friends at Fantasy Couch will be with you from this point on as your friends , co-workers and fellow managers will cry " beginners luck " on your way to wins against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does fantasy baseball work ? <p> For starters , fantasy baseball is simply the culmination of players you draft to represent your team and the combination of those statistics in comparison to your opposition . While some leagues are American League ( AL ) or National League ( NL ) only , in most instances every player in the Major Leagues is available to be drafted . This includes injured players . So , be sure to have a cheat sheet ( list of baseball players you want to draft ) so you do n't  draft a bunch of bandaged zombies that will butcher your chances of starting strong out of the gate . That is certainly not how to play fantasy baseball . <p> You can play with a group of people you know , where one person is designated to be the commissioner . The commissioner or " commish " is responsible for collecting league fees , organizing the draft process , creating all the league settings and rules while making sure everyone plays fair and has fun . This is not a job you want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't  know enough people who play fantasy baseball , then you can join a public league on a site like ESPN or Yahoo and start drafting right away . <p> Leagues are normally comprised of 10-12 teams , but there are leagues getting ready for spring training with as many as 20-30 teams . Those who are beginning to get a feel for fantasy baseball would want to stay around 10-12 teams as it would be a good way to gauge yourself among the competition , in and outside your league . Most articles you read regarding rankings and mock drafts will have 10-12 teams and much of the info you need for your draft will be based off of that . We highly recommend using our fantasy baseball resources to prepare for your draft . <h> Know your league format <p> Before we get into the draft , I 'm going to touch on something that has a direct effect on how you choose to draft . In most instances you 'll have the choice between a fantasy points leagues , or something called categorical scoring leagues . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a certain amount of points . In the same way a reception ( 1 point ) for 25 yards ( 2.5 points ) and a touchdown ( 6 points ) would equal 9.5 points for a receiver , a single ( 1 point ) that drove in two RBIs ( 2 points ) would equal three points for a batter . The latter is a categorical league that would consist of a set number of stats for pitching and batting . The key here is having a greater number of these specific stats than your opponent over the course of a calendar week . The team with the majority of these stats won would be the winner for that matchup with either a single victory for the week or by using each week 's category total towards the overall standings . For example , if you win seven out of the 10 categories , you win that contest 7-3 and it puts the importance on winning every possible category over the course of a season . There are also head-to-head formats , where you face a different opponent each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the entire season . We recommend head-to-head , categorical formats . <h> The fantasy baseball draft <p> Draft day is hands-down the biggest day for fantasy baseball ! You can choose to draft online ( this works better with buddies who live far away or with strangers ) or offline , in-person which is so much fun . You can see a photograph of our live draft below : <p> In order to equip yourself with the best possible team , you 'll need to consider the best coarse of action for each format . If you 're in a categorical league , draft with those specific stats in mind . In most cases you 'll want batters that are consistent ( AVG &gt; .280 ) but still have the power numbers that will fuel you when it comes to RBIs , runs and homers . On the mound , you 'll want 20-win pitchers with an ERA under 3.00 and 200-plus strikeouts to show for it , while utilizing a handful of relief pitchers that will earn your team saves . <p> In points leagues , which normally includes detractor statistics like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers will want to get a feel for the league by utilizing the history of past seasons and asking for last years end of season rankings . Given the greater number of statistics used in this format , these kinds of leagues account for more of the in-game action and are a better indication of how each team or player is doing . Implementing this kind of " cheat sheet " before the draft will allow you to get a feel for the league before you even get started and allow you to see where the best value was in fantasy last year at every position . By no means am I saying to draft from that list , it is simply a taste of how your league scores and knowing that makes all the difference . <p> To give yourself a bit of perspective ahead of draft day , it would be wise to do a handful of mock drafts prior to your draft with the same format and number of teams . After a few mocks you should be able to have some form of strategy regarding who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions that wont leave you picking a backup catcher in the fifteenth round . <h> In-season <p> Once your team is drafted , its time to face the competition . Over the course of the season the stats will be accumulated over the course of a week ( Monday-Sunday ) and converted into points for you . The team with the most points scored or categories won will take the week . Depending on your playoff platform , the fantasy postseason will start in August or September as MLB playoff games are n't  used for fantasy leagues . <p> The draft is an important element of your future success in the season because you as a team owner will have to fill your teams needs while trying to get the maximum value with each selection . You 'll end up deal with injuries , inconsistent performances , suspensions , rainouts and other curveballs the fantasy baseball gods will send your way . To handle these things properly you 'll need to make good use of your DL spot ( this is where you put players unable to play if your league allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss extended periods of time . Unlike actual MLB team owners/managers , those in the fantasy realm are n't  forced to hold onto players we do n't  want . Good teams make use of the waiver wire by seeing which bats or arms are hot to add them while dropping a lesser producing player . The waiver wire is a pool of players who are not designated to any team , and are free to be picked up once the waiver period is cleared . This period varies from league to league with the order normally based on the league standings with the best team last and the worst team first in line . <p> The only other way to alter your team would be via trade . Being on constant lookout for possible deals would be wise of each owner , but its important to make the best possible trade for your team . It is rare to get a fair and honest offer from another owner , so do n't accept a deal until you have countered it a few times in most cases . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are weak in a particular area and/or they have a surplus . Take advantage of that opportunity and look to improve your team where its needed most . Just be sure to make sure you do n't  hinder your team in the process and we can help with that . <p> If you can avoid lengthy injuries to top players and make good use of the waiver wire by paying close attention to who 's hot and who 's not , you could find yourself in your first postseason this fall and soon may be teaching a class on how to play fantasy baseball to your fellow league managers . <p> If I have left any questions unanswered feel free to ask me on Twitter @ThisJustM or ask the Fantasy Couch team @FantasyCouch .

Big Cuz and his new frontcourt teammate Anthony Davis are the two best centers in the league , hands down . AD at least played point guard growing up , but it 's Cousins who is averaging 5 dimes per game . <h> LOSERS <h> Deron Williams <p> From a real-life perspective , D. Will now has a real chance to compete for a ring for the first time in his career . But from a fantasy point of view , he went from having a solid bounce-back campaign , averaging 13 pts and 7 dimes , to being a backup PG . He s no longer worth rostering in most leagues . <h> Paul Millsap <p> Virtually everything is down across the board from last year , and the rumors that Atlanta might move him could have given Millsap a new look and fresh environment to try and bring out the last of his peak play . <h> Ersan Ilyasova <p> He was having a pretty good year until the 6ers moved him to Atlanta , understandably so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilya was averaging almost 15 pts , 6 boards , 2 threes and decent percents . <h> Players off the wire to own down the stretch <p> These guys might be available in your league , or could be had in a smaller trade .

Most project he wo n't reach the lofty expectations of last year 's stats , but I think he can . <h> Frank Kaminsky PF/C Cha <p> I know Cody Zeller just returned , but I do n't see how Charlotte can keep Kaminsky out of the lineup with the way he s been playing recently .

Reggie Jackson was openly on the block , so maybe Smith can give the Pistons front office a reason to believe they do n't need to net a starting PG in a trade , in return for Jackson . <h> Tip : scheduling for the playoffs <p> Maximizing your schedulethe amount of games played is huge . Traditionally , you have 8 slots for starters , so having as many out of the weekdays as possible with 8 players is big . <p> In most leagues , the finals run March 27th " April 2nd . Minnesota , Denver and Portland play only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BUT in the week of the finals , both MIN and POR play on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday where there are limited games .

@@90847852 @6347852/ <h> Fantasy Baseball Waivers April 14 , 2017 <p> Hope you 're reading this early because a lot of these players will be swooped up by the end of this weekend . <h> Waiver Adds <h> Kendall Graveman Oak SP <p> Athletics ace Kendall Graveman is off to a fantastic 2-0 start . The crafty righty has been digging graves for opposing hitters lately , as he held the Rangers hitless for 7.2 innings before giving up a solo shot to Mike Napoli . He seems to be picking up the slack for the injured Sonny Gray , and his fantasy owners couldnt be happier . Graveman has posted 12 strikeouts in 13 innings , with a 2.08 ERA and 0.85 WHIP so far . His next scheduled start is Friday the 14th against Houston . If he is still available in your league ( 58% owned on ESPN ) , stop what you are doing and pick him up immediately ! <h> Amir Garrett Cin SP <p> Amir Garrett was stellar in the first two starts of his Major League career . With 9 strikeouts and just 7 hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-hander is already catching the attention of fantasy owners in need of a sleeper starter . The 24-year-old rookie will look to keep it going Tuesday against the red-hot Orioles . If the Reds offense can start producing runs at a steady pace , Amirs value should keep rising . Garrett is only 27% owned , making him an easy acquisition as he is n't quite discovered yet . <h> Chase Anderson Mil SP <p> Chasing Chase Anderson Anderson has been lights out so far for the Brew Crew in 2017 . He has given up just 1 earned run in 13 innings pitched , including 11 strikeouts and just 6 hits . Dominating both the Rockies and Blue Jays is impressive given the depth of each lineup , but it will be interesting to see if Anderson will continue his early season success . He will face a tough challenge on Monday , as he gets the start against the World Champion Cubs . Anderson is just 2% owned so he should be available in just about all leagues . <h> Mark Reynolds Col 1B <p> Mark Reynolds has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . The veteran first baseman has already hit 4 bombs on the young season , with help from the high altitude in Colorado . Fantasy owners are beginning to doubt themselves for passing up on him , after missing out on his 10 RBIs and .300+ batting average in the first few weeks of the season . Reynolds is 67% owned , meaning his window of availability will be closing soon . Since the Rockies have such a stacked lineup , I expect Reynolds to see plenty of pitches to hit while filling in for the injured Ian Desmond . <h> Ryan Zimmerman Was 1B <p> I think its safe to say that no one expected Zimm to perform the way he has in 2017 . The 32-year-old has hit safely in all but one game so far ( 8 games total ) , bringing his hit total to 13 . Not bad for an old guy ! His .382 average and 3 homeruns are quite promising considering his under-par performance last season . Zimmerman has had a lengthy injury history , so his fantasy owners might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is with out a doubt one of the better first-base options on the waiver wire at the moment . <h> Manuel Margot SD OF <p> Rookie of the Year candidate ? The scorching-hot Manuel Margot has taken the league by storm . Like the player mentioned directly above , this young man also has an impressive 13 hits in just a handful of games this year . His power is legit , as he already has a multi-homerun game to add to his blossoming resume . The Padres are n't  exactly an offensive juggernaut , but if Wil Myers can continue to provide enough protection for Margot , he has a shot at putting up All-Star caliber numbers . Add him to your fantasy roster before an opposing owner reaps the benefits of owning such a productive player . <h> Yunel Esocbar LAA 3B <p> The table-setting Escobar has been absolutely raking at the top of the Angels batting order . At one point earlier in the week he had gone an eye popping 11-for-17 with three doubles and a homerun . He is hitting .366 with 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he s worth an add if you are lacking in the third base department . Escobar is n't known for his power , and its safe to say that speed has never really been a part of his game . If you are looking for steals , then look elsewhere ! He is 27% owned , so there is a good chance that he is available in your league . Go ahead and plug him into your lineup while he s swinging a hot bat . <h> Cesar Hernandez Phi 2B <p> Hail Cesar Hernandez has been a terror at the plate for opposing pitchers thus far , as the first year player has four multi-hit games through his first nine starts . The second baseman is hitting .308 with 9 runs scored and a homerun during that span . Second base is a tough position to fill in fantasy baseball , so when a productive middle infielder like this appears on the waiver wire , it would be wise for you to take your chance on him . He is only 29% owned in leagues , so if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know if these waivers helped you out or any waivers you disagree with below in the comments .

@@90847904 @6347904/ <h> Fantasy Baseball Buy Low Hitters <p> Making trades is one of the most exciting parts of fantasy baseball for a lot of us , while others may find it intimidating and nerve-racking . The idea is to improve your team in any event and making a move for a player who is underachieving can pay big dividends . It is all about finding the right player(s) to target whose value may be lower than normal and getting him at the right price . <p> There are a handful of predominant hitters on this list who are worth dealing for as Buy-Low candidates . Be on the lookout for our Sell-High piece coming soon and sometimes players from each list can be used to trade for each other . <h> Allen Craig , StL 1B/OF <p> It was just a few years ago that the man with two first names busted onto the scene and played himself into fantasy lineups everywhere . Since then , Craig has been a very solid producer having hit over .300 with at least 90 RBIs in each of the past two seasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 29-year-old as evidenced by the sub-.250 batting average and through more than 40 games . Craig has let his owners down so far , but that will change pretty quickly . <p> The 29-year-old is traditionally a slow starter at the plate with a career .236 average in March and April . Craig hits over .300 in every other month except June ( .283 ) and he is starting to heat up right now with 14 hits over his last 11 contests . <h> Wil Myers , TB OF <p> The second-year outfielder is not putting up the kind of numbers we saw out of him as a rookie . Pitchers and scouting reports have caught up to Myers a bit and that was to be expected out of a young hitter . <p> Myers might be hitting closer to .200 than .300 and some owners may be losing patience having drafted him around the sixth round . He did hit .293 with 13 homers in 373 plate appearances a season ago and that raw talent has n't gone anywhere . It is time to make some adjustments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fantasy owners in need of an outfielder should target Myers because his upside is so high while the price could be considerably lower in comparison . Trust that the 23-year-old will make your team better sooner than later . <h> Jean Segura , Mil SS <p> Here is another struggling young ballplayer with a lot of potential . The 24-year-old was an All-Star last season and finished with a .294 batting average , 42 extra-base hits ( 12 homeruns ) and 44 stolen bases . Segura 's great play got him drafted around the fourth or fifth round in most drafts this year . <p> Segura 's owners should n't give up just yet , but some will get impatient enough to listen to offers . It is normal for young players to go through growing pains . Expect his bat to start coming around soon while the speed will never slump . <h> J.J. Hardy , Bal SS <p> Last year 's American League Silver Slugger at shortstop has n't hit a homerun yet this season after bashing 25 in 2013 . Hardy has been a quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 75 RBIs over the past three years . <p> The 31-year-old veteran has been hitting a lot better as of late with four multi-hit games over the past week raising his average considerably . Look for his power stroke to come back soon as this streaky hitter can rattle off a bunch of productive contests in a row . Fantasy owners who ca n't get Segura should target Hardy now before owners are more reluctant to deal him . <h> Matt Kemp , LAD OF <p> You need to act fast if you want to make a deal for the slugger who is rounding into form in the month of May . It was hard to trust that the injury-prone outfielder would be healthy enough to warrant a mid-round pick , but it 's paid off so far . Kemp is right around .275 with a handful of homeruns and stolen bases with the aggressiveness of the base paths being a very encouraging sign . <p> The Dodgers have a very potent lineup that figures to get even better with the addition of Alex Guerrero down the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and he will get better as the season gets older with 25/25 being a good possibility .

Carlos Martinez , StL SP <p> When looking at the Cardinals starting rotation , most will go for Adam Wainwright , Michael Wacha or the talented but often-injured Jaime Garcia . But Martinez averaged more than a strikeout an inning , totaling 184 in his first season as a starter with an ERA that just missed being under 3.00 , finishing at 3.01 . This spring training he has continued his last season success and might be the best projected fifth starter in all of baseball .

Tyler Clippard , Ari RP <p> He may be stuck behind Brad Ziegler , who had a great season as Arizona 's closer , but Ziegler is 36 years old and the Diamondbacks have improved greatly in the offseason . As Arizona 's best setup man , he will get chances to close when the Diamondbacks give Ziegler a day off and if Ziegler is n't able to replicate his 2015 season .

Jonathan Schoop , Bal 2B <p> After showing power but struggling with his batting average his rookie year , Schoop was having a much-improved 2015 until he got injured .

Trayce Thompson , LAD OF <p> Not having the spring he would have liked , Thompson still has upside and a lot of potential . He showed the ability to hit for average and power when he got called up to the majors late in 2015 . With Andre Either out with a leg injury and Scott Van Slyke not offering much as a backup , Thompson has a chance of getting some at-bats . The younger brother of Golden State Warriors all-star Klay Thompson , comes from an immensely talented family and is still only 25 years old .

However , with emerging prospects like Kris Bryant , Carlos Correa , and even Trevor Story , we 're starting to see how impactful rookies can be across fantasy leagues . This year , you know guys like Corey Seager , Trea Turner , and Alex Bregman . They were on everyones radar to start the year and , if you 're in a redraft league , they will almost certainly be drafted very high next season .

Like most young hitters , he needs to work on two things : cutting down the strikeouts and drawing more walks . He has a horrendous 2% walk rate and strikes out over 27% of the time . If he wants to continue to succeed at the Major League level , hell need to improve upon those numbers . There 's a ton of promise and a lot of things to like with Anderson , making him an intriguing option next season in deeper leagues . <h> Keon Broxton Mil OF <p> The Milwaukee Brewers once again did n't  compete this year but they have some young pieces such as Jonathan Villar , Scooter Gennett , Hernan Perez , and Orlando Arcia that , if nothing else , will make the Brewers an interesting team to watch .

Its a tough break as the outfielder has been one of the better overall contributors since the All-Star break .

Benintendi is , without question , the left fielder of the future for Boston , and the future is bright .

As a result , he may not get drafted in shallow fantasy leagues . <p> Hitting should n't be much of an issue for Guerrero when he does arrive to the Show . He has a ton of raw power with swing that looks effortless . It might take some time for him to adjust to a new league and country , but his long term potential could be worth more the $28 million deal the Dodgers gave him . <h> Jurickson Profar , Tex <p> The game 's top prospect a season ago will be the Rangers ' starting second baseman this season with Ian Kinsler being shipped to the Tigers this past offseason .

This is the time of year when a handful of unknowns ' begin to emerge into fantasy stardom . <p> Derek Morgan , DE , Titans " It has taken a few seasons , but the former first-round pick is starting to realize the potential that many scouts expected from his time at Georgia Tech . Morgan has been a standout on the Titans ' defense with 10 solo tackles , four assists and a sack through two contests . He is the type of defensive end who can defend the run and rush the passer at an above average level . It will be interesting to see how much the 23-year-old progresses this season . <p> William Moore , S , Falcons " The former Missouri Tiger is becoming a force in IDP leagues with 15 total tackles ( 12 solo ) , two interceptions and a sack through two games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consistent tackler going forward with the potential to produce some big plays along the way . <p> Moore 's sack of Peyton Manning on Monday night marked the first full sack of his career ( he had .5 sacks last season ) .

Freeman has 18 total tackles ( 11 solo ) in the first two games while starting in place of the injured inside linebacker Pat Angerer ( foot ) . The second-year player had a pick six ' in Week 1 and had a sack last week while seeing lots of snaps .

@@90848155 @6348155/ <h> 2013 Fantasy Football WR Sleepers <p> Of all the positions in fantasy football , wide receiver is one that is rostered more than any other . More players drafted means more players targeted as sleepers . But with more options to go with late in your draft , finding the right wideouts to target is n't necessarily an easy objective . <p> Titus Young , Golden Tate and Brian Quick were three athletes advertised as go-to sleepers last season by some ( not by me ) who never lived up to the billing . Last season , I presented you a group of five sleepers that was highlighted by Randall Cobb , Demaryius Thomas and Torrey Smith . This year I hope to offer up similar results with a few more options in the mix . <h> T.Y . Hilton , Ind <p> Like Colts quarterback Andrew Luck , T.Y . Hilton was an impressive rookie last season that garners serious attention in your draft . The two of them were an impressive duo last year under offensive coordinator Bruce Arians . However , with Arians hired as head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the both of them . Do n't  buy into that . This WR3 had a better season last year than Darrius Heyward-Bey has had his entire four-season career so do n't  write him off for the former first-round pick . That pick WAS made by the Raiders <p> Hilton has 4.34 speed and made good use of that speed with double-digit plays of 25-plus yards . Hilton also had 100 yards receiving or more in five games and should be able to repeat that with the schedule he and Luck have lined up . At times last year he was a bit up and down . But with another year beside Luck and Reggie Wayne collecting social security in the not-so-distant future , Hilton should be able to warrant more consistency this year . He racked up 506 receiving yards and 5 TDs in the last seven games of last season . Expect T.Y . Hilton to start producing Week 1 . <p> Hilton can be had as early as the 6th round and that is exactly where you should grab him . Call me crazy , but I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jordy Nelson , who are often being selected ahead of arguably the best WR3 in football . <h> Emmanuel Sanders , Pit <p> If there was one receiver out of the AFC North worth targeting in your draft late , Emmanuel Sanders is that guy . With Mike Wallace taking his talents to South Beach , a less than stellar rushing attack in Pittsburgh , Heath Miller shelved for the first part of the season and Sanders in a contract year , Sanders is a great third or fourth receiver to draft . <p> The Patriots signed him to an offer sheet in the spring but the Steelers quickly matched thanks in large part to the advice of part-time quarterback and part-time GM Ben Roethlisberger . When given the field-time on game day , he has been able to produce , given his soft hands and quick feet . The third-round pick out of Southern Methodist University will certainly be given more looks down the field at times ( 13.2 yards per catch on mostly short routes ) with Wallace gone and Antonio Brown filling the void left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanders should thrive given Todd Haleys short-passing offense that will look to make defenders miss . He s going off the board in the 10th round beside names like Vincent Brown , Michael Floyd and Kenny Britt . There 's no logical reason to draft him behind those guys so take him in the ninth and reward yourself with an ice cream . <h> Kenbrell Thompkins , NE <p> Just as everyone was wondering who Tom Brady would throw to in New England , Kenbrell Thompkins has given them one answer thus far in the preseason . As much as I liked ( and still like ) Aaron Dobson as a sleeper in New England , its hard to ignore the 6-foot-1 , 25-year-old receiver out of Cincinnati . <p> The undrafted rookie wideout has led all New England pass-catchers with 15 grabs for 157 yards in preseason action . More importantly , Thompkins has also shown the ability to get off the line in press coverage , while also soliciting his versatility by working out of the slot and split-end . The sample size for Thompkins has been small this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If they can muster up some type of consistencywhich Brady has made a career out ofthe individual who selects Thompkins should be able to reap the rewards . With Thompkins going off draft bards in the 7th-8th round , you may have to pay to play with him but that reward is definitely worth the risk given his quarterback and Amendolas durability issues . <h> Chris Givens , StL <p> With all the promotion Tavon Austin seems to be yielding , many seem to have forgotten about Chris Givens . Givens has 4.41 speed and big play ability that has been seen both last year and this preseason . As a rookie , Givens had a five-game stretch in which he had a reception of 50-plus yards . This preseason he has done it again , putting together two straight games in which he had a 50-plus-yard catch . <p> He s a dangerous option on a developing offense and given the question marks in the run-game and the division they play in , the passing game will certainly be a focus of coach Fisher and his pass-happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvin , in comes Patterson . The Vikings added Greg Jennings in the offseason but do n't  let that scare you away from drafting arguably the best rookie receiver in the league . He offers big play ability both through the air and on the ground , as he was able to rush for 308 yards on 25 carries at Tennessee . The opportunity for success will certainly be there as long as Adrian Peterson stays healthy and Christian Ponder can get him the ball . <h> DeAndre Hopkins , Hou <p> Of the receivers named , Hopkins is my favorite rookie receiver to draft this year . He s got a top 10 receiver on the other side of the field and he s looked good so far in the preseason . Houston has long been searching for a No. 2 receiver to pair with Andre Johnson , and the thought of having the Clemson receiver alongside him can only mean good things in Houston . If you 're able to take him in the 10th round , do it . <h> Rueben Randle , NYG <p> Like Cobb last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass-heavy offense that should definitely be targeted as a late-round selection . I do n't  expect him to do what Cobb did , but if Victor Cruz or Hakeem Nicks go down with an injury , 40-50 catches and 700-plus yards should be within the realm of possibilities . I liked him as a sleeper last year and given his limited opportunities , I have no reason to change my opinion of him . Take advantage of Kevin Gilbrides offense and Randles late-round potentialit wont cost you much at this point in his career . <h> Honorable Mention <h> Justin Blackmon , Jac <p> A good draft pick as your No. 5 WR in shallow leagues and No. 4 in deeper formats . Blackmon is suspended for the first four games of the season , but do n't  let that deter you from drafting him , as he you wo n't even need to start him until the dreaded Bye Weeks . <p> To see the Bye Weeks for the 2013 NFL season Click Here .

@@90848212 @6348212/ <h> 2013 Fantasy Football QB Sleepers <p> With the emergence of young quality quarterbacks like Cam Newton , Russell Wilson , Colin Kaepernick and Matt Ryan , the dividing line in the quarterback talent pool is a lot closer than it has ever been . <p> The older , more weathered quarterbacks , who are nearing the end of their careers offer more concerns ( minus RG3 ) and in Tom Bradys case , his receiving core is n't what it used to be . For Peyton Manning ; the only Manning worth starting on a consistent basis , its hard to ignore the major surgery done on his neck a year ago . Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers should go one and two sometime between the latter-first and second round . here 's the order quarterbacks were taken in a mock I did the other today : <p> 1 . Aaron Rodgers ( GB , pick 10 ) 2 . Drew Brees ( Ind , 14 ) 3 . Peyton Manning ( Den , 21 ) 4 . Tom Brady ( NE , 29 ) 5 . Cam Newton ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 42 ) 7 . Colin Kaepernick ( SF , 45 ) 8 . Robert Griffin III ( Was , 57 ) 9 . Matt Stafford ( Det , 63 ) 10 . Russell Wilson ( Sea , 73 ) This gives you two or possibly three tiers to work with and 10 quarterbacks already off the board . This leaves you with a player some may not consider a sleeper now , that in my opinion , should be a guy taken before some of the guys already mentioned . In a ten or twelve team league , this leaves you with a late-round picksometime after the eight or ninth round to take your top 10 quarterback and this would allow you to invest more time in every other position . <p> However , unlike any other position , Luck is the only quarterback worth starting outside that list . Tony Romo has gone before him in some leagues , but because of my overwhelming passion for the 49ers I find it impossible to draft him ( but you can eat your Tony Romo heart out ) . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mock drafts and quarterback rankings . But if there was one player at the position you could deem a sleeper and start ; Luck is that guy . <h> Andrew Luck , Indianapolis Colts <p> The 23-year-old second-year quarterback out of Stanford is the last of a third tier at his position . He s is a player I 've drafted , so I 'm just as invested in him as you would be and despite the loss of an offensive coordinator , there 's not a big risk . He is going much later than he should be which will allow you to stuff your skill positions with talent , while sitting back to swipe Luck . He lived up to expectations in 2012 , throwing for 4,374 yards and 28 scores ( five on his feet ) . Luck also had six 300-yard games through the air , which was more than Griffin , Wilson , Kaepernick , Newton and the same number as Aaron Rodgers . <p> Unfortunately for Luck the Colts focused on defense in the draft so the only noticeable addition at wide receiver was Darrius Heyward-Bey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Luck as a rookie with 31 more receptions , 395 more receiving yards and 10 more 20-plus yard receptions . T.Y . Hilton is also a receiver to highlight , underline and put a star next to in your rankings . Hilton has wheels on par with the fastest receivers in the league and was able to grab seven scores , 50 receptions and 861 yards in Lucks inaugural season . An additional reason I like Luck this year is because of his schedule . Indy starts off the year with Oakland at home and finishes the season hosting Jacksonville . They also play San Diego ( twice ) , St. Louis , Tennessee ( twice ) , and Kansas City . <p> Let others invest a second-fifth round quarterback in the draft . Luck will be available after the eighth round and I 've observed via mock drafts , the great teams that assemble when picking at the tail end of the snake draft . <h> Carson Palmer , Arizona Cardinals <p> Carson Palmer may be the second happiest guy in Arizona ( behind teammate Larry Fitzgerald ) now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite upgrade for Bruce Arians and his new coaching staff . Fitzgerald may have been bored the last couple seasons , playing for awful quarterback after awful quarterback . For that reason Fitzgerald owners will be happier than I was last year and Rashard Mendenhall is an added bonus that also improves a position . If Palmer can stay off his back this season , Arizona may be competition for San Francisco and Seattle . Its easy to forget the 4,000 yard , 22-touchdown season he had in Oakland . With an environment like Arizona Palmer is a reliable backup for any QB without the week 9 bye . <p> I 'd expect Palmer is n't a guy you would draft to start , but being that he s a quarterback ranked outside the top 20 he s a great backup to have behind Luckor whoever else you decide to go with on draft day . <h> Geno Smith , New York Jets <p> Do n't  let Geno Smith become an afterthought during your draft . Ranked outside the top 30 quarterbacks in most QB rankings Ive seen , the 22-year-old rookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the season . Rex Ryans Mark Sanchez is beginning to loosen up a bit and so is the USC quarterbacks grip of the starting job . <p> Smith has been impressive in camp and I would n't be surprised if he outplays Sanchez well enough in pre-season . Do n't  sleep on Smith , make him a sleeper . He s got the tools to become a strong pro and if started now hed easily make his way into the top 25 strictly because of the potential he offers . Smith is looking to become a " franchise quarterback " like he stated after the draft . And with goals as high as that and a quarterback ahead of him named Mark Sanchez , Smith will certainly get a chance to prove his worth and those who passed on him wrong . <h> Matt Schaub , Houston Texans <p> Schaub is similar to Palmer in that he s a guy that tends to be ignored in mock drafts/rankings . Like Palmer , he too is being draft and ranked outside of the top 20 quarterbacks . He s got one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson and Arian Foster . Schaub also just became teammates with arguably the best receiver taken in the draft . DeAndre Hopkins is a large athletic receiver that will make Johnsons job a bit easier in Houston . No disrespect to Kevin Walter , but Hopkins will most likely be the best No. 2 receiver Houston has had since they become a team in 2002 . If you have n't already , mark Hopkins down as a sleeper and do the same with Schaub . <p> Like Luck and the Colts , Houston faces the same cupcake schedule that their AFC South counterpart will face . Its an added bonus worth notice come draft day . Do n't  make Schaub your starter but if your starting quarterback goes down Schaub is one of the best backups you can have this season . <h> Honorable Mention <h> E.J. Manuel , Buffalo Bills <p> There 's a reason the Bills shocked everyone by taking Manuel over Smith with their No. 16 pick . He is considered a longterm project that projects to be a solid starter at some point . He s well worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have 12 or more teams .

With the right mix of youth and statistically targeted vets , you can build a juggernaut that will leave you near the top of your standings for years to come .

We have seen the emergence of guys like Steph Curry , James Harden , Anthony Davis , Brandon Knight , Nikola Vucevic , Andre Drummond , Jimmy Butler , Damian Lillard , Draymond Green and Kawhi Leonard along with a small sample of guys like Rudy Gobert , Hassan Whiteside , Nerlens Noel , Andrew Wiggins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of fantasy team anchors for years to come . <p> There are always omissions from any ranking , this particular list takes age as a major consideration .

Luckily in fantasy you do n't  have to worry about salary caps and your guys demanding a huge pay rise once they prove themselves worthy of rostering . The old guard havent made the list , guys like Kobe and Dwayne Wade .

Irving leads all rookies with 17.4 points per clip in under 30 minutes per game . Irving has scored more than 20 points seven times and has scored in double digits in every game except one . He continues to fill the net as well as the stat sheet . Irving is well on his way to a Rookie of the Year season if he continues to put up the numbers that he is . <p> Ricky Rubio ( Minnesota Timberwolves , 11 PPG , 4.6 RPG , 8.3 APG , 40.6 3p% , 2.4 SPG ) The import from Spain has proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way with the ball that reminds many of the late Pete Maravich . Almost a magician with the ball , Rubio has shown us why there was so much hype already becoming a fan favorite in Minnesota . His turnovers are a concern for some but when you pass the ball like Rubio does it 's easy to forget about some of them . Although he may not play like a rookie , he is one . And that fact is a scary one for any team that does n't have him on their roster . <p> In such a guard heavy draft class it 's no surprise that the top two players so far this season bring the ball up the court . But luckily for everyone else there is no fast-forward button , so those not named Ricky Rubio and Kyrie Irving have time to gain the attention of the league and their fans before ballots are due . Here are the best in class for those in a deep , or keeper league : <p> Jimmer Fredette ( Sacramento Kings , 7.6 PPG 2.1 APG 33.6 FG% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the NBA he had his own theme song . Fredette had unlimited range at BYU but has been introduced to those limits so far this season . He has shown signs of what may be to come with 20 points and 6 assists in 32 minutes of play Sunday against Memphis . Superman may still sleep in a Jimmer jersey but it may take some time for Superman to trade in his BYU no. 32 for a Sacramento Kings no. 7 . Kawhi Leonard ( San Antonio Spurs , 7.8 PPG , 5.5 RPG , 0.9 APG , 1.2 SPG ) Although he may not be Bruce Bowen , Leonard has shown San Antonio that he is the athletic forward they wanted to fill that void Bowen left with his departure . Leonard opened some eyes early on in the season hitting a crucial three pointer opening night against Memphis . Leonard has continued to give San Antonio hope for their future as their best players get older . <p> Chandler Parsons ( Houston Rockets , 6.9 PPG , 5.5 RPG , 1.3 APG , 1.1 SPG ) Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he has been the best pick from where he was drafted . The 6-foot-9 200 pound forward was overlooked by most NBA scouts but Houston did n't let him go by when they drafted with their 38th pick . Houston is one of the hotter teams out west currently riding a seven-game win streak and Parsons ' hustle off the bench is a big part of that . <p> Iman Shumpert ( New York Knicks , 12.3 PPG , 3.5 RPG , 3.6 APG , 38.4 FG% , 31.1 3p% ) While New York continues to struggle Iman Shumpert has continued to show New York he was worth their selection . Shumpert has played in 12 games this season and scored in double figures 10 of 12 games . He has been surprisingly well on defense averaging over 2.5 steals per game . <p> Markieff Morris ( Phoenix Suns , 7.7 PPG , 4.9 RPG , 1.1 APG , 47.1 3p% ) So far this season Markieff has fit right in with the run and gun style of the Phoenix Suns . Considered to be the lesser twin coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris twin remaining a force down low while spreading out the defense with his 3-pt range . <p> Kemba Walker ( Charlotte Bobcats , 11.4 PPG , 3.3 RPG , 3.2 APG , 38.1 FG% , 33.3 3p% ) Ever since the Bobcats introduced into the league in 2004 , Charlotte has been in search of a player to build their team around . The Gerald Wallace train has come to a stop and the Kemba Walker train will soon be boarded . Walker had an impressive college run and will continue to play at the highest level once he gets used to the faster pace of the NBA and gets the pieces around him that he needs to win . <p> Brandon Knight ( Detroit Pistons , 12.5 PPG , 3.5 RPG , 3.3 APG , 38.8 3p% , 88.5 FT% ) Brandon Knight was stuck behind Rodney Stuckey early on but we all knew that would n't last long . Knight has started the last 11 games and scored in double figures 9 of 11 games . Detroit has struggled so far this season but Knight can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring ability Detroit has a very good piece moving forward . <p> Marshon Brooks ( New Jersey Nets , 15.4 PPG , 4.6 RPG , 1.6 APG , 46.7 FG% , 36.5 3p% ) Marshon Brooks is by far the biggest surprise in the most recent draft . The 6-foot-5 guard out of Providence has had just one game this month in which he did n't reach double digits in points . He is also second among rookies with five 20-point games this season . Brooks has been a pleasant surprise for New Jersey this season and I expect him to give Rubio and Irving a run for their money as the season gets closer to its end .

He would have had another interception on a Hail Mary pass at the end of the first half had it not been for an offside penalty that negated the play .

Detroit had a high-powered offense with Reggie Bush reeking havoc on the Minnesota 's defense and there were lots of tackles to go around . With that being said , Henderson is an every-down linebacker and that will boost his fantasy value considerably . <p> Playing middle linebacker is in Henderson 's bloodline as his older brother , E.J. , used to call the plays for the Vikings ' defense from 2007-11 and played his entire nine-year career with Minnesota . Fantasy owners in need of help at linebacker can turn to Henderson knowing he is a solid tackler in a good situation . The six-year pro out of Maryland is owned in around five percent of both ESPN and Yahoo leagues right now . <h> Trent Cole , Phi DE <p> Last year was a free fall from grace for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 40 total tackles each season from 2006-11 .

Cole pinned his ears back and sacked Robert Griffin III late in the fourth quarter when the Redskins were attempting a comeback with successive pass plays . <p> The Eagles ' defense switched from a base 4-3 to a 3-4 in the offseason and Cole is starting at right outside linebacker , but has defensive end eligibility in IDP leagues .

Alonso was drafted in the second round ( 46th overall ) out of Oregon and has a very bright future as the Bills ' defensive play-caller . Fantasy owners should take notice quickly as a 100-plus tackle season is very likely this year . <h> Justin Houston , KC OLB <p> With three sacks against Jacksonville on Sunday , Houston is turning into an elite pass-rushing outside linebacker in Kansas City 's 3-4 defense . It 's not a wise move to rely on Houston as a consistent producer from week-to-week because sacks are his main source of scoring . With that being said , he put up 10 sacks last season and is capable of notching around 15 this year and that is worth a look .

@@90848317 @6348317/ <h> 2014 Fantasy Baseball Waivers for August <p> With just a handful of weekly matchups left in the regular season , many fantasy owners are already facing " must win " situations . Missing the playoffs can not only be heartbreaking , but quite embarrassing as well . Below are some over-achieving players in which we deem worthy of adding to your roster in pursuit of making it to the post-season . Good Luck ! <h> Fantasy baseball players to add for August , 2014 <h> Josh Reddick , Oak OF <p> If you were one of those unfortunate fantasy owners who drafted Reddick last season , then you probably went out of your way to stay away from him in 2014 . The Athletics ' outfielder seems to have much more success at the plate without his distracting beard getting in the way . The 27-year-old hurt himself earlier in the year but hit .353 with four homers , 10 runs batted in and 11 runs scored in just over 50 at-bats since returning from the disabled list on July 22nd . Reddick , who is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .255 on the season with eight bombs and 34 RBIs . Although his overall numbers are far from impressive , its what he has done lately that has his fantasy value soaring at a season-high ( 74% owned in ESPN leagues ) . With the departure of Yoenis Cespedes in a trade-deadline deal with the Red Sox , expect Reddick to see a healthy chunk of playing time the remainder of the season . <h> Dustin Ackley , Sea 2B/OF <p> Ackleys outstanding July and August stretch continues as the second baseman is hitting an eye popping .346 with 13 extra-base hits in 30 games since the end of June . He has a respectable four home runs and 10 RBI is his last 10 games , and will look to remain a fixture in Seattles starting lineup . The recent acquisitions of Austin Jackson and Chris Denorfia could eventually cut into Ackleys playing time , but for the time being he seems to be getting plenty of at-bats . The 26-year-old is hitting .255 on the season , with eight dingers and a respectable 42 RBIs . <p> Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and not every owner is lucky enough to have picked up the red hot Josh Harrison . Whether you need an injury replacement or would like to bolster your rosters depth for the playoffs , make your move on Ackley while he is still available in the majority of fantasy leagues ( 43% owned ) . <h> Billy Butler , KC 1B/Util <p> After an extremely disappointing first , four months of play , Billy Butler is finally beginning to turn this lackluster season around . The designated hitter has been destroying Big League pitching in August , and has managed to tally 18 hits in his last 45 at-bats ( .400 ) . He also has a solid .413 on-base percentage during that span , making him a valuable utility option in category leagues . Butler is now hitting .279 with seven homers and 47 RBIs on the season . <p> Butler should see a lot of playing time at first base with Eric Hosmer scheduled to spend some time on the disabled list . The right-handed hitting slugger is known to swing a hot bat while getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take immediate advantage of his recent success . He is just 45% owned , but we expect this number to gradually rise over the next few weeks so it would be wise to keep him on your radar . <h> Vance Worley , Pit SP <p> Worley has been terrific for the Pirates in the second half of the season and remains one of fantasy baseballs best kept secrets to this point . The right-hander has posted a stellar 0.96 ERA in four starts since the All-Star break , which includes a 1.00 WHIP , and a 17:5 strikeout to walk ratio over a 28-inning span . At 5-1 with a 2.30 ERA and 1.07 WHIP on the season , Worley is with out a doubt a must add pitcher right now . Amazingly , he is just 33% owned , so stop whatever it is you are doing and make your move now ! <h> Brandon McCarthy , NYY SP <p> The Yankees have had terrible luck with their pitching all year long but the one bright spot in their rotation lately has been Brandon McCarthy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month , going 4-0 with a 2.28 ERA with 25 punch-outs in 23.2 innings . He struggled as a Diamondback earlier in the year , which explains his poor overall record at 7-10 and ERA of 4.37 . He seems like a completely different pitcher as of late and an easy addition if your fantasy squad lacks in starting pitching . <h> Wei-Yin Chen , Bal SP <p> Chen has been masterful for the Orioles all season long , posting a dominant 12-4 record with a 3.90 ERA so far . The 29-year-old just snapped his five game winning streak against the Blue Jays after he surrendered four runs . Chen continues to get slept on by fantasy owners ( 37% owned ) not realizing that he is pitching for one of the hottest teams in all of baseball . He seems to get outstanding run support game after game , so if you are in need of wins , then why not take your chances with this hidden gem . <h> Yangervis Solarte , SD 2B/3B <p> Since being traded to the Padres in late July , utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southern California . Many players seem to strive after detaching themselves from the magnifying glass that comes along with playing in pin stripes . Since joining the Friars , the 27-year-old Venezuelan is hitting .302 with two bombs and nine RBIs . His eligibility at both second and third base could certainly help those struggling fantasy owners add some infield depth . He is hitting .262 on the season with eight home runs and 40 RBI . At 61% owned , hurry and check to see if he is still available in your league . <h> Tommy Medica , SD 1B <p> here 's another Padre who has been a pleasant surprise offensively as of late . First baseman Tommy Medica has gone 10-for-21 with three jacks to begin August . Oddly , Manager Bud Black still does n't  seem comfortable with Medica as an every day player . If he s in the starting lineup for that day , then his owners in deeper leagues should definitely deploy him with confidence . The 26-year-old from Northern California is hitting .275 with seven bombs and 23 RBIs in just 167 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SP <p> Since scuffling in mid-June and through July , Dallas Keuchel seems to have straightened out a few things mechanically , regaining his form over his last three starts . The southpaw has only allowed two runs with a 16:4 K:BB over 23 innings pitched during that stretch . His 2.89 ERA has attracted many fantasy owners , but his 10-7 record should be a lot better considering the terrible run support provided by the Astros lineup . There is a good chance that Keuchel is available in your league ( 64% owned ) and I would strongly suggest picking him up if the fellows mentioned above are n't  available . <p> Spencer 's main passion is baseball . His consistent winning record in fantasy baseball and dead-on predictions is what makes for the perfect formula . Spence has gained the trust of Fantasy Couch fans .

If you are lucky enough to be a front-runner in your league , think of waivers as adding depth and potential players to start depending on weekly matchups . Whatever the case , enjoy this week 's waiver wire pickups and direct any questions you have to our Twitter handle @fantasycouch or send IDP questions directly to me @AndrewEggers . <p> K.J. Wright , LB , Sea " The Seahawks have two young and talented linebackers in Wright and Bobby Wagner ( mentioned in preseason ) who have both played very well through seven games . Wright has been a surprise to say the least , with his team-high 65 total tackles being ranked eighth in the NFL . The second-year pro out of Mississippi State has racked up at least seven solo stops in the past three weeks with 31 total tackles in that span . Wright was a fourth-round pick in 2011 and it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of production from . Fantasy owners with the chance to pick him up should enjoy the ride as he continues to get better down the stretch . Wright is a great IDP waiver wire pickup , as he 'll bring that consistency you need at the linebacker position . <p> Brad Jones , LB , GB " Here 's a guy with a golden opportunity playing inside linebacker in place of the injured D.J . Smith and Desmond Bishop , who have already been ruled out for the season . Jones has 10 total tackles ( seven solo ) and a sack last week against the Jaguars almost assuring he will be the starter going forward . Playing alongside the talented A.J. Hawk , the other starting inside backer who will draw more attention from the offense , Jones is sure to get plenty of chances to makes stops on the ball carrier . <p> Jones makes for a good waiver wire in deeper leagues and is hardly owned at all at the moment . <p> Malcolm Jenkins , S , NO " If you 're looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . He 's made 55 stops this season , 41 of the solo variety , with no sacks or interceptions . Jenkings makes for a great IDP waiver wire pickup in tackle-friendly leagues , but not big play leagues ( sacks and ints ) . <p> The four-year man out of the Ohio State University was a first-round pick who played mostly cornerback in college . Jenkins is now a very solid safety and should continue to flourish statistically as the Saints ' run defense continues to let ball carriers get to the second level . <p> Michael Bennett , DE , TB " Talent at defensive end position is relatively thin and the 26-year-old has emerged as the Buccaneers ' best pass-rusher with five sacks so far this season . Fantasy owners can get Bennett in almost any league at this point and expect him to continue to pressure the quarterback consistently . His 17 total tackles on the season are too low to make him valuable in most leagues , but Bennett is worthy of an IDP waiver wire pickup in deeper leagues that reward big plays .

The players listed below are available in the majority of leagues at the moment and that could change in the next few weeks . <h> Alec Ogletree , StL OLB <p> It did n't take long for the rookie linebacker out of Alabama to make an impact on the St. Louis defense . Ogletree has posted 15 total tackles ( all solos ) , two passes defended and one forced fumble through two games so far and looks to be adjusting quickly to the pro game . The Rams drafted the former Georgia Bulldog at the end of the first round ( 30th overall ) in last year 's draft . They will roll with the 21-year-old as their starting left outside linebacker for the foreseeable future after releasing the suspended Jo-Lonn Dunbar two weeks ago . <p> Ogletree was mentioned as an IDP Sleeper in the preseason and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues . At the moment , he 's owned in less than five percent of ESPN leagues and seven percent in Yahoo . <h> Philip Wheeler , Mia OLB <p> Here is another linebacker who was mentioned in the IDP Sleepers article and is still available in most IDP leagues . Wheeler had a monster game on Sunday with 12 total tackles , two for a loss , two passes defensed and a sack in Miami 's win over Indianapolis , the team that drafted him in the third round back in 2008 . <p> It did n't work out as expected in Indy and Wheeler spent last season in Oakland where he had a career year with 109 combined tackles to go along with three sacks . That earned him a five-year , $26 million contract with the Dolphins this past offseason .

Church has impressed in the first two games of the season with 15 tackles , including 14 solo stops , a forced fumble and a fumbled recovered for a touchdown . The Pittsburgh native is 25-years-old and has spent his entire four-year career with Dallas , but has played sparingly up until this season . <p> Church 's fantasy value is boosted because he 's getting that chance to be an important piece in defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin 's Cover 2 defense . He should get a lot of tackle chances while also being able to make several more big plays this year .

If you 're fortunate enough , you 're either beginning your H2H playoffs or jockeying for those last few critical points in your roto league . Whichever your format , we 're going to look at a handful of players out on the waiver wire ( owned in less than 50% of ESPN and Yahoo fantasy leagues ) that can make an impact for you down the stretch and help you bring home a fantasy baseball championship . <h> Hitters <h> Chris Carter Mil 1B <p> Carter is a flawed and limited player but what he does , he does well and one big thing that Carter does is hit for power . The Brewers first baseman has 33 big flies , good for third in the National League , trailing only Nolan Arenado and Kris Bryant . However , he carries with him a .228 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning he s pretty much all or nothing at the plate and thus can be found on a majority of waiver wires . Through the first week of September , Carter is batting .411 ( 7 for 17 ) with three homers and seven RBI . He s a streaky power hitter so when he gets going , the home runs come in bunches . If you 're in the need for homers these last few weeks , Carter is someone you can look to as a premier power source for a cheap price . <h> Asdrubal Cabrera NYM SS <p> Its hard to believe that Cabrera is only 30-years-old but the veteran infielder has been on fire the last couple of weeks with six homers over his last eight games . At this point of the year its extra important to ride hot streaks . While this streak could go cold at any moment , he only faces the Nationals pitching staff for only three of the teams final 23 games , so he should have favorable matchups down the stretch . <h> Kendrys Morales KC 1B <p> The Royals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as of late as they try and sneak into that final wild card spot . Morales has n't  had a huge part in the Royals second half run but he s come on very strong over the last week and a half . He s already surpassed his 2015 home run total of 22 by hitting five home runs over his last seven games . Over Morales last nine games , he s hitting .368 ( 14 for 38 ) with the five home runs and 14 RBI . Morales is another streaky hitter and is someone that can keep this up for another couple of weeks . <h> C.J. Cron LAA 1B <p> Cron was on his way to having a career year before he was forced to miss six weeks with a broken hand . He returned to action on August 20th and picked up right where he left off . In 16 games since returning from the DL , Cron is batting .318 with 4 home runs and an .889 OPS . There 's a good chance that owners cut bait on him in July and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Mike Trout and Albert Pujols so there should continue to be lots of production out of the cleanup spot . <h> Pitchers <h> Ivan Nova Pit SP <p> Nova was sent over to the Pirates from the Yankees at the trade deadline and has been fantastic since he s been paired up with Pirates pitching coach Ray Searage . In his six starts since the trade , Nova is 4-0 with a 2.89 ERA , 0.99 WHIP , and 28/2 K/BB . Until otherwise noted , Nova is a must-start in fantasy and will give owners a nice return for the final month of the season . <h> Seth Lugo NYM SP <p> The Mets brought up Lugo to join the bullpen earlier this season but as usual with the Mets staff , their starters are n't  healthy as Steven Matz is the latest hurler to miss time . With that , Lugo has been thrust into the starting rotation and has found relative success . In his four starts , Lugo is 3-1 with a 2.18 ERA and has only given up three runs in his last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he s posting these kinds of numbers and is a solid streaming option the final month of the season as the Mets will face Atlanta six times , Philadelphia seven times , and Minnesota three times . <h> Luke Weaver StL SP <p> Weaver is another in the long line of homegrown pitchers for St. Louis and has looked pretty solid in his five career starts . He s struck out 31 in 25 innings but has posted an ERA of 3.96 , due in large part to surrendering a home run in each of his starts . His HR/FB rate currently sits at 22% almost double the league average so expect that number to come down a bit over the next few starts . With that and the nice strikeout numbers , Weaver can certainly string together a nice September for you fantasy baseball team . <p> Be on the lookout for more fantasy baseball content that will be coming out real soon .

They will roll with the 21-year-old as their starting left outside linebacker for the foreseeable future after releasing the suspended Jo-Lonn Dunbar two weeks ago . <p> Ogletree was mentioned as an IDP Sleeper in the preseason and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues . At the moment , he 's owned in less than five percent of ESPN leagues and seven percent in Yahoo . <h> Philip Wheeler , Mia OLB <p> Here is another linebacker who was mentioned in the IDP Sleepers article and is still available in most IDP leagues . Wheeler had a monster game on Sunday with 12 total tackles , two for a loss , two passes defensed and a sack in Miami 's win over Indianapolis , the team that drafted him in the third round back in 2008 . <p> It did n't work out as expected in Indy and Wheeler spent last season in Oakland where he had a career year with 109 combined tackles to go along with three sacks . That earned him a five-year , $26 million contract with the Dolphins this past offseason . Wheeler is starting at weakside linebacker and will see lots of tackle opportunities . <p> The 28-year-old is a high energy guy with a motor that does n't slow down . Wheeler is an ideal waiver wire pickup at this point of the season if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the second straight season with the occasional sack and big play . He is owned is less than five and seven percent in ESPN and Yahoo leagues , respectively . <h> Barry Church , Dal FS <p> The Cowboys seem to have found their starting free safety of the future . Church has impressed in the first two games of the season with 15 tackles , including 14 solo stops , a forced fumble and a fumbled recovered for a touchdown . The Pittsburgh native is 25-years-old and has spent his entire four-year career with Dallas , but has played sparingly up until this season . <p> Church 's fantasy value is boosted because he 's getting that chance to be an important piece in defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin 's Cover 2 defense . He should get a lot of tackle chances while also being able to make several more big plays this year . He is only owned in around six percent of ESPN leagues and 13 percent in Yahoo leagues . <h> Dontari Poe , KC DT <p> It is becoming apparent that the second-year nose tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position . Poe notched four unassisted tackles , including two sacks , on Sunday as the Chiefs moved to 2-0 after beating the Cowboys 17-16 . This coming after the 23-year-old had 1.5 sacks in Week 1 , giving him 3.5 through two games this season . <p> Kansas City drafted Poe out of Memphis in the first round ( 11th overall ) in 2012 and as a rookie he had just 38 total tackles and no sacks . When you 're drafted that early , high expectations will follow and Poe is starting to live up to them . Fantasy owners should not expect him to continue the same sack pace going forward , while 10 or more for the season is certainly reachable . Poe could easily accumulate 60 or more total tackles in 2013 . <p> Poe is owned in 20 percent of ESPN leagues and 16 percent in Yahoo formats . <h> Kyle Williams , Buf DT <p> The eight-year veteran is n't a stranger to IDP lineups with an average of 66 total tackles per season from 2008-2010 . Williams fell out of favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down considerably in 2011 followed by a disappointing season last year . <p> It has been a different story this season as the former Louisiana State Tiger has racked up 12 total tackles ( 8 solos ) and a sack combined through two weeks . Williams is n't showing any i 'll effects from the Achilles surgery he had this past offseason . <p> Williams is a very good run stopper and is useful in tackle heavy leagues , especially ones that require a defensive tackle . He is only owned in around five percent of ESPN leagues and in three percent of Yahoo setups. 
@@90848347 @6348347/ <h> IDP Waiver Wire Pickups for Week 9 <p> It 's Week 9 and your IDP team is likely in need of a tweak or two with bye weeks and injuries . If you are lucky enough to be a front-runner in your league , think of waivers as adding depth and potential players to start depending on weekly matchups . Whatever the case , enjoy this week 's waiver wire pickups and direct any questions you have to our Twitter handle @fantasycouch or send IDP questions directly to me @AndrewEggers . <p> K.J. Wright , LB , Sea " The Seahawks have two young and talented linebackers in Wright and Bobby Wagner ( mentioned in preseason ) who have both played very well through seven games . Wright has been a surprise to say the least , with his team-high 65 total tackles being ranked eighth in the NFL . The second-year pro out of Mississippi State has racked up at least seven solo stops in the past three weeks with 31 total tackles in that span . Wright was a fourth-round pick in 2011 and it looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of production from . Fantasy owners with the chance to pick him up should enjoy the ride as he continues to get better down the stretch . Wright is a great IDP waiver wire pickup , as he 'll bring that consistency you need at the linebacker position . <p> Brad Jones , LB , GB " Here 's a guy with a golden opportunity playing inside linebacker in place of the injured D.J . Smith and Desmond Bishop , who have already been ruled out for the season . Jones has 10 total tackles ( seven solo ) and a sack last week against the Jaguars almost assuring he will be the starter going forward . Playing alongside the talented A.J. Hawk , the other starting inside backer who will draw more attention from the offense , Jones is sure to get plenty of chances to makes stops on the ball carrier . <p> Jones makes for a good waiver wire in deeper leagues and is hardly owned at all at the moment . <p> Malcolm Jenkins , S , NO " If you 're looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available . He 's made 55 stops this season , 41 of the solo variety , with no sacks or interceptions . Jenkings makes for a great IDP waiver wire pickup in tackle-friendly leagues , but not big play leagues ( sacks and ints ) . <p> The four-year man out of the Ohio State University was a first-round pick who played mostly cornerback in college . Jenkins is now a very solid safety and should continue to flourish statistically as the Saints ' run defense continues to let ball carriers get to the second level . <p> Michael Bennett , DE , TB " Talent at defensive end position is relatively thin and the 26-year-old has emerged as the Buccaneers ' best pass-rusher with five sacks so far this season . Fantasy owners can get Bennett in almost any league at this point and expect him to continue to pressure the quarterback consistently . His 17 total tackles on the season are too low to make him valuable in most leagues , but Bennett is worthy of an IDP waiver wire pickup in deeper leagues that reward big plays .

@@90848350 @6348350/ <h> 2013 Fantasy Baseball Sleepers Shortstop <p> Of all the positions this year , shortstop is by far the toughest spot to predict a sleeper being that the tiers of talent are so obvious . However , I 'm going to identify the players that offer the best value for the position despite the extreme disparity between the elite shortstops and everyone else . This is in large part because of a gradual decline in talent at the position and a large group of players that define mediocrity . <p> In a pool of players that yields Troy Tulowitzki , Jose Reyes , Starlin Castro and Hanley Ramirez , it 's hard to pass on them early with guys like Ben Zobrist , Elvis Andrus and Jimmy Rollins slotted right behind them . Of course there are good players available beyond that first four , but what matters most is the value at which you allow your shortstop to have . Noticing the difference in talent level is crucial in deciding who wins and who loses in fantasy baseball . <p> In most drafts , Zobrist , Andrus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of shortstops after that first select few . Having the patience to wait and get guys who will finish with similar numbers at the end of the season will allow you the opportunity to build on other positions while someone else essentially wasted a pick . If you would rather put your picks to use , draft one of those first four guys mentioned or draft one of the following : <h> Alcides Escobar , Kansas City Royals <p> Alcides Escobar , 26 , did n't do much for fantasy owners in his first two years in the majors , but found himself getting the attention of some last year . If it were n't for his location in Kansas City , Escobar would have been an even hotter commodity in a place like Boston or Los Angeles . <p> A big part of this turnaround was his consistency . After hitting .235 in 2010 and .254 in 2011 , Alcides hit .293 last season to go along with 68 runs , 52 RBIs and 35 stolen bases . Although he has as much power as an AA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra bases with 30 doubles and seven triples last season . <p> To put these numbers in a bit of perspective , Escober hit one less double and two less triples than Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus . Escobar also had 19 more stolen bases , two more home runs and a better batting average than Andrus . Although I expect an average a little closer to the one he had in his first two seasons , Escobar is definitely worth a good look as he is going in rounds 15 and beyond , while Andrus is somehow going as early as the ninth round . <h> Andrelton Simmons , Atlanta Braves <p> Andrelton Simmons , 24 , is a guy who can be drafted later than Escobar , but that does n't necessarily mean he should be . Despite a small sample size of 49 games in 2012 , Simmons showed the Braves that he was a viable option for the club at shortstop as he is expected to be given as good a chance as any , most likely leading off ( with Michael Bourn gone ) for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Upton brothers . <p> In the 166 at bats that Simmons was given last year , he hit .289 with three home runs , two triples , 17 runs and 19 RBIs . With a full season to work with , Simmons should be able to hit 25-to-30 doubles , 5-10 triples and double-digit home runs . If he hits around the .290 clip that he did last year , it 's hard to imagine a season that Simmons does n't drive in around 65 RBIs and cross home plate around that same amount of times , if not more . I would also expect a few more steal attempts than the one he had in 2012 . Simmons has plenty of speed and should be given the green light much more this season . <p> On average , Simmons is going in the 23rd round besides the likes of Kevin Youkilis , Dayan Viciedo and Emilio Bonificacio , but do n't expect this to be the case in a few weeks when you draft . Keep an eye on his stock over the next couple weeks and plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this years draft , here are a few more guys worth drafting in the later rounds of the 2013 fantasy baseball draft :

It is a 12-man , PPR league with a $350 buy-in fee and the grand champion of the tournament gets $300,000 . I will give you the draft results round-by-round and below that I provided some analysis and opinion on some of the teams and draft picks . I will mainly focus on analyzing my team . I get fed up with traditional mock drafts , so I prefer participating in alternate methods to practice drafting to get me prepared : <p> Free leagues I draft in a free , public league and then never actually play I know , I 'm a jerk . <p> Draft Simulator ( Draft Wizard ) I finish mock drafts 20 times faster with this tool . You have to try it ! <p> MFL10s These are leagues that you actually buy-in that start at $10 but all you do is draft and that 's it . These leagues are what all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what better way to mock draft than to spend 350 bucks on one ! Ill post more mock drafts in the future . My analysis and commentary can be found at the very end of this postyou can scroll all the down or click here . By the way , my team name is BrainChild and I had the 11th pick in this snake draft . Here are some of the basic scoring settings in this league : <h> Analysis <p> Let 's start off with my team . My team overall is decent , but my glaring weakness in this draft was the tight end position . I tried to make up for that by drafting Vernon Davis and Austin Seferian-Jenkins in back-to-back picks , then going for upside with rookie Maxx Williams . I was hoping Gronk would fall to the eleventh overall pick , but that was a fantasy and nowhere near a reality ( he went No. 2 overall ) . In order to win this thing , I need Vern to have a bounce-back season or ASJ to have a breakout year . Or , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Maxx Williams to be the best rookie tight end in the history of the NFL . Tight end , Zach Ertz , was taken before I could get to him and Owen Daniels was drafted earlier than I anticipated . No one is to blame but me here . <p> We wont know yet , but another obvious draft choice that may haunt me , is passing up on Marshawn Lynch and Arian Foster , to get C.J. Anderson . I love the upside with C.J. and I think hell be a top 5 RB with Kubiaks Broncos . In a league like this with 20 rounds , its a good strategy to draft backup plans and handcuffs . I was able to handcuff Mark Ingram with Khiry Robinson at a much later pick ( 203 overall ) . I noticed team Comeback Player drafted Todd Gurley along with Tre Mason and Isaiah Crowell along with Duke Johnson . <p> This year I decided not to be the first team to draft a team defense , and I 'm happy with the Houston Texans D. It would have been nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that likely would n't of happened . The Rams defense was selected late in the 14th round and I thought that was a great value pick . I would rather have the Rams in the 14th round than the Seahawks in the 11th . As long as these two events happened , I was ready to draft a team defense : 1 ) it had to be late in the draft , and 2 ) at least two defenses had to be selected before I committed to drafting a one . I would have been happy with the Rams , Dolphins and even the Broncos D if they fell a couple rounds . Both DEN and MIA defenses went in the middle of the 17th round , and those were great value picks . But you do n't  want to wait too long and be like team Burn Dust and Eat Rubber who is stuck with their sole team defense being the Tennessee Titans . <p> Both Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota were ranked in the online draft very low ( this could have been a glitch ) , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was fortunate enough to draft Winston in the last round ( 230 overall ) , but other owners likely wont be able to do this as his current ADP is a bit high at 162 . <p> I think Miss Piggy ( pick 9 ) and Dazed and Confused ( pick 12 ) have the two best teams . The combination of Tom Brady and Tony Romo should work out will for Miss Piggy . Getting Marshawn Lynch at pick 16 and Justin Forsett at pick 33 are sure to make this owner happy . Dazed and Confused enjoyed having back-to-back picks and used the perks of that draft position when selecting Zach Ertz and Matt Ryan in the sixth and seventh rounds . I really wanted to get Forsett and Ertz but failed to do so . <p> Leave a comment or hit me up on social media @fantasycocuh and let me know what you think . I hope these 2015 fantasy football mock draft results help you out in your preparation for your draft . 
@@90848381 @6348381/ <h> 2014 Fantasy Baseball Sleepers " Starting Pitchers <p> With lots of fantasy drafts taking place this weekend and for those owners who may have drafted already , but want to add a player or two to their team , here are some undervalued starting pitchers to look over . There is a ton of talent on this list , so make sure to pay attention to all the guys listed below because you never know where the next , big talent will come to form . <h> Masahiro Tanaka , NYY <p> Coming off of a 24-0 season in Japan , Tanaka will look to make an immediate impact in the states as the newest member of the Yankees ' pitching staff . The 25-year-old right hander signed a seven-year , $155 million contract during the offseason , adding great pressure to his highly anticipated first season in the Bronx . In seven seasons in Japan , Tanaka posted a 99-35 record with a 2.30 earned run average , but during his past two seasons he managed to reduce his ERA to an epic 1.27 . With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly gain the respect of most Major League hitters . Expect him to win around 15 games and approach 200 strikeouts this year , especially since the Yankees did a great job upgrading their aging offense during the offseason . He seems to be going relatively low in the majority of fantasy drafts , which makes some sense for a player who has n't played in the Show yet . With that being said , it should be well worth taking a chance on adding this stud to your roster . <h> Gerrit Cole , Pit <p> Most 23-year-old pitchers do n't come as polished as Pirates ace Gerrit Cole . The beefy right-hander had an outstanding rookie season , where he collected 10 wins with a 3.22 ERA and 100 Strikeouts in 117.1 IP . His fastball averages around 95.5 mph , but has been known to flirt with triple digits on a good day . Having a deep arsenal of pitches ( curveball , cutter , changeup , slider , and sinker ) makes the former UCLA Bruin tough for opposing batters to figure out , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> During the first half of the season , Cole sported a 3.89 ERA to go along with a 5.40 K/9 ratio . After the All-Star break , he began to dominate hitters and trimmed his second half ERA down to 2.85 with an eye-popping 10.97 K/9 . Numbers like this tend to catch the eye of fantasy owners , so as long as he is n't drafted unrealistically high ( ESPN ADP : 11th round ) , then you have my blessing on using him to bolster your squad 's rotation . <h> Michael Wacha , StL <p> How could one forget about the magic that Wacha brought to the Cardinals during their 2013 postseason run ? With just 65 innings of regular season baseball under his belt , the 22-year-old managed to be named NLCS MVP , before falling just short of a World Series title . Standing at six-foot-six , Wacha 's mound presence has proven to be a big factor in dazzling some of baseball 's top hitters , especially when the lights shine the brightest . The Iowa native possesses a changeup that gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plus fastball and swooping curve that keeps hitters honest . <p> Just like Cole , Wacha 's fastball reaches the upper 90s , but it 's the right-hander 's curveball that needed work this offseason in order to take him to that next level . Pitching to the best defensive catcher in the big leagues in Yadier Molina and learning behind a well-polished Adam Wainwright will be key in his development . His current ADP is 129.9 and he usually gets selected somewhere around the 13th round of fantasy drafts . Although we only have a small sample size , Wacha has the potential to be absolute fantasy gold . Owners should expect big things out of him , knowing that the Cardinals organization seems to know how to win a game or two these days . <h> Andrew Cashner , SD <p> Here we have yet another flamethrower for you fantasy owners who are looking to add pitching depth to your rotation during the late rounds of your draft . At age 27 , right-hander Andrew Cashner is going into his fourth season as a big leaguer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up being dealt to the Padres in a four-player trade involving first baseman Anthony Rizzo . Pitching in the spacious Petco Park can be quite refreshing for any pitcher and Cashner seems to be taking full advantage of it . The Texan went 10-9 , with a 3.09 ERA and 128 strikeouts in 175 innings pitched in 2013 . Not exactly the flashiest numbers around , but there is definite potential from a fantasy standpoint due to his low ERA and WHIP . <p> Like Wacha , Mr. Cashner stands at a daunting six-foot-six and has one of the more impressive fastballs on this list . It averages at around 95 mph , and has been known to top out around 99 mph . His slider has been quite effective against right-handed hitters , and has proven itself by piling up a good number of punch-outs . Many fantasy owners are waiting until around the 17th round to obtain Cashner , which is great value for a pitcher with this type of upside and overpowering stuff . If he can get his changeup working as well as his other pitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Sonny Gray , Oak <p> It 's always Sonny in Oakland ! In 2011 , Gray pitched extremely well at Vanderbilt and earned himself a first-round selection by the A 's ( 18th overall pick ) . Two years later , the 24-year-old was called up to the Big Leagues after spending half of the season in Triple-A . Gray has ace-like stuff and in 12 appearances , he managed to hold a 2.67 ERA , 9.4 K/9 , and respectable 5-3 record during the second half of 2013 . It would be unrealistic to expect him to duplicate that low of an ERA in 2014 , but it would be wise for any fantasy owner to have high hopes for this up and coming right-hander . <p> With the loss of both Jarrod Parker and A.J. Griffin due to injury , manager Bob Melvin recently named Gray the Opening Day starter . Without a doubt his ERA will be somewhere in the low to mid 3s , along with a good dose of strikeouts and decent WHIP . It is almost certain that the frontline starter will outperform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being taken with the 164th overall pick . <h> Chris Archer , TB <p> It is safe to say that the Rays have had their fair share of impressive young pitching over the years . We all know what David Price brings to the table and the talented southpaw Matt Moore has blossomed into what some would call ace material . With that being said , next in line to shine is the brilliant Archer . The 25-year-old right-hander really helped my fantasy team last year outpitching some of my team 's aces at one point . <p> Archer led all AL rookies in ERA , opponents ' average ( .226 ) , shutouts ( 2 ) , complete games ( 2 ) , WHIP ( 1.13 ) , and hits per nine innings ( 7.5 ) . He finished third in voting for the AL Rookie of the Year award behind teammate Will Myers and Jose Iglesias of the Tigers . I expect a cool 12-14 wins out of Archer in 2014 , so fantasy owners should do what they can to draft him in the later rounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big things out of Mets right-hander Zack Wheeler in 2014 . With the painful , year-long absence of ace Matt Harvey due to Tommy John surgery , the Mets are going to need Wheeler to be on his A-game if they are going to compete in what appears to be the toughest division in the National League . <p> In 17 appearances last year , the southpaw finished with a 7-5 record , a 3.42 ERA and a solid 7.56 K/9 ratio . He did n't get to complete the campaign due to shoulder soreness and with the teams ' playoff hopes far from possible , shutting him down was the smart thing to do . Fantasy owners should pay attention to his availability come draft day , as he might even have the chance to become the teams number one starter over the ancient Bartolo Colon . <h> Alex Wood , Atl <p> At 6 ' 4 , 215 pounds , Braves ' starter Alex Wood will look to get back to where he left off last season as a rookie . The quirky left-hander spent most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting rotation when an unexpected injury bug hit the team . The former 2nd round draft-pick in 2012 posted a 3.54 ERA in 11 starts , with 54 punch outs in 56 innings . <p> Wood was even more effective in relief , where he struck out 23 batters in 21.2 innings while holding onto a minuscule 2.08 ERA . His strikeout ability makes him a valuable fantasy sleeper and his owners should expect anywhere from 170-180 Ks this season . There 's nothing wrong with getting mid-round production out of a player who is generally drafted extremely late , if at all in some leagues . <h> Michael Pineda , NYY <p> Michael Pineda appears to be at the end of his two-year journey back to the Big Leagues from a major shoulder surgery . On Tuesday , Yankees ' manager Joe Girardi broke the news that the lengthy right-hander will be the teams ' No. 5 starter this season . Pineda was nothing short of dominant as a member of the Mariners and has proven this Spring that he can indeed be the beast that Yankee fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The 25-year-old went 2-1 in four Grapefruit appearances with a 1.20 ERA while striking out 16 batters in just 15 innings . Owners should realize that there is definite risk involved with Pineda , as no one knows if he can stay on the field for an entire season . With that being said , this pitcher has far too much raw talent to go unnoticed , especially with the caliber of season that New York is projected to have . <h> Yordano Ventura , KC <p> Ventura 's triple-digit heater has earned him a safe spot in the Royals ' young rotation . The 22-year-old flamethrower is considered one of baseballs ' top prospects and is on his way to becoming fantasy relevant in 2014 . His intense strikeout ability can help fantasy owners in deep category and roto leagues and the Dominican rookie has had quite the spring , going 1-1 with a 1.77 ERA and 18 strikeouts in 4 quality starts . Many are choosing Ventura over his struggling teammate Danny Duffy as the better sleeper pitcher to add depth to their anxious fantasy squads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make someone look like a complete genius , so thank us later for this one . <p> Spencer 's main passion is baseball . His consistent winning record in fantasy baseball and dead-on predictions is what makes for the perfect formula . Spence has gained the trust of Fantasy Couch fans . 
@@90848382 @6348382/ <h> Fantasy Baseball Sleepers Revisited <p> Max Scherzer has been the most successful pitcher in baseball . Yasiel Puig is attempting to save the Dodgers single-handedly . And Jean Segura is the best short stop in baseball . If you heeded my advice and was able to draft those three and maybe a few more of these sleepers , I 'm interested in knowing how your season has gone so far ? <p> Like any other list of sleepers , mine did offer its fair share in duds . I expected a much better season from the newly demoted Boston third baseman Will Middlebrooks . I also expected more from Rockies second baseman Josh Rutledge who was demoted and then promoted because of an injury to teammate Troy Tulowitzki . New York Mets starter Jonathan Niese was also a pitcher I liked later in the draft . I guess , what I meant by draft Niese was " draft Matt Harvey . " Prior to this season I had sifted through the infield and outfield of the MLB and picked out the players I felt warranted the sleeper title . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its customers and the military has quality control to keep them honest and productive . <p> I have this article . <p> Along with Scherzer , the Athletics Jarrod Parker and the Braves Julio Teheran were two other starting pitchers that you could draft in rounds 14-16 but I pushed for both of them to go as early as the 12th or 13th round . I felt the two starters offered more than their perceived value indicated and after a tough start to their seasons , the both of them are being started above guys draft four or five rounds before them . <p> As for Scherzer , who has been the most successful ( not best ) , he has done even better than I had expected . Im convinced my Uncle Eugene ( who was drafting one spot ahead of me in the draft ) read the article and drafted him right around where I had planned on drafting him in a points league . He currently is ranked second in total points to Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright ( who I own ) . Here is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't watch a chick flick with a woman because of the cinematic value , you do n't eat fast food for its health benefits and you do n't draft Scherzer for his ERA and WHIP . Although he is decent in those categories , the righty offers a lot to the table in strikeouts and wins and deserves to go ahead of many pitchers going earlier than him . " <p> If you drafted him , congrats . But for those like me who allowed him to pitch for their team , I feel your pain . <p> When it came to catchers this year I offered up two names : Salvador Perez and Wilin Rosario . I did n't  promise that they would outplay Buster Posey , Yadier Molina or Joe Mauer but here is what I said : <p> " If Perez is able to mimic what he has done the last two years in one full season in Kansas City , he should be able to garner another .300 average and have a 20-70-70 season that is well worth the 12th or 13th round selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Recently I 've seen Rosario taken off the board in rounds 14-16 aside players like James Shields , Mike Napoli , Grant Balfour and Daniel Murphy . If you get the chance to take him there or feel obligated to reach a bit on him , do n't shy away from it . " <p> Both catchers are currently top ten at their position outscoring A.J. Pierzynski , Andre Ethier and Paul Konerko . <p> Ethier was one player ; along with Puig and Carl Crawford , who I expected more from this season . One of my sleeper selections was " Dodgers Outfielders Not Named Matt Kemp . " Kemp was one player I refrained from drafting and luckily I grabbed Puig instead . Hopefully you too headed that advice and grabbed the hottest hat in baseball . Puig , who has 40 hits in 96 ABs also has four doubles , seven homers and 16 RBI . <p> Milwaukee outfielder Norichika Aoki sleeper I pointed out who has lived up to my expectations of him and surpassed those of drafters who did n't  know who they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added some power numbers that have tailed off since he went on paternity leave . This homer drought ( 39 games ) will surely pass so hold onto him . <p> I used Rangers short stop Elvis Andrus as a verbal punching bag earlier in the year when I compared him with Andrelton Simmons and Alcides Escobar . <p> " To put these numbers in a bit of perspective , Escober hit one less double and two less triples than Rangers ' shortstop Elvis Andrus . Escobar also had 19 more stolen bases , two more home runs and a better batting average than Andrus . Although I expect an average a little closer to the one he had in his first two seasons , Escobar is definitely worth a good look as he is going in rounds 15 and beyond , while Andrus is somehow going as early as the ninth round . " <p> Escobar has lived up to the billing and currently leads Andrus in total hits , batting average , doubles and home runs . Andrus does have six more steals , four more RBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reconsider drafting Andrus four rounds earlier than the young Kansas City short stop . <p> If you were unable to draft either ( which I actually drafted both ) I wrote to grab Segura . If you were fortunate enough to miss on Escobar or Simmons and grabbed him I 'm sure you 're loving it just as much as I 'm loving the success of my Oakland As . <p> Kyle Seager and Chase Headley were two corner infielders I liked in March and both have played well given where they were being taken in the draft . Anthony Rizzo and Josh Rutledge have been two of my major flops when it came to sleeper predictions . Like Segura , I had mentioned to draft Manny Machado if Headley or Middlebrooks got by you . Unfortunately for me , Machado was n't a guy I felt strong enough to draft him late in either of my drafts . Shame on me . <p> A few months ago I wrote in one of these sleepers articles that having a team made up sleepers would n't be a good game plan .

@@90848386 @6348386/ <h> IDP Week 10 <p> The waiver wire is getting thinner and thinner as the season rolls on , which is typical especially in IDP leagues . Unlike offense-only leagues where players burst onto the scene each week with great performances , things tend to settle down in IDP by this point in the regular season as players settle into their roles . Here are a few players who may be available and worth a look if you ca n't get any of the guys listed in previous IDP articles . <h> Pat Angerer , Ind ILB <p> The inside linebacker fell from IDP grace last season when a broken foot saw him miss all of the 2012 preseason and six games of the regular season . This coming after he put up 148 total tackles ( 78 solo ) in 2011 . Angerer saw action in each of the final 11 games last year , but started only three of them , and tallied a combined 28 tackles . Teammate Jerrell Freeman played very well in his absence and ultimately won the job as the middle linebacker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3-4 defense before this season and that allowed Angerer to play alongside Freeman on the inside . It has taken some getting used to for Angerer and he has missed two games with injury . The former second-round draft pick out of Iowa has 35 total tackles and a half sack in six games in 2013 . His 12 total tackles ( seven solo ) last game in the win over the Texans is a good sign that more consistent stats are to come the rest of the season . Freeman is certainly a better option for IDP owners , but Angerer is useful in deeper formats . <h> Chris Clemons , Mia SS <p> Speaking of falling from fantasy football grace , Miami 's strong safety has n't put up number like he did in 2012 . Clemons had 98 combined tackles last season and has only 46 through eight games so far this season . He plays alongside free safety Reshad Jones , who is having a slightly better season statistically , in the Dolphins ' secondary . <p> Clemons racked up 20 tackles collectively in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his first two games of double digit tackles all year . Fantasy owners can expect his production to be on the upswing going forward and he is worth is look in most IDP leagues . <h> Prince Amukamara , NYG CB <p> The former Nebraska Husker is now in his third year as a pro and really coming into his own as the Giants ' top cornerback . The nice thing about Amukamara is that he puts up a pretty good amount of solo tackles per game , with 42 out of his 45 this season being unaccompanied . <p> The 24-year-old has one interception through eight games , which is only the third of his career and a season-high . Fantasy owners in tackle friendly leagues will find him quite valuable , especially if the format requires a starting cornerback. 
@@90848389 @6348389/ <h> Fantasy Football IDP Week 12 <p> With Cincinnati , Seattle , Buffalo and Philadelphia all on their bye , there are some high caliber players missing from IDP teams this week . <p> Top scoring linebackers Vontaze Burfict ( mentioned in this year 's IDP sleeper article ) , Kiki Alonso ( mentioned in IDP Waivers Week 2 article ) and Demeco Ryans all have the week off . Bobby Wagner owners will be without a great talent as well . He would have been mentioned as a top producer if it were n't for an ankle injury that sidelined him in both Week 6 and 7 . I 've already mentioned guys like Paul Worrilow , Thomas Davis , Jon Beason , Kevin Burnett , Jon Bostic and Pat Angerer in past IDP Waiver articles and all are worth an add in the order they are listed . If you ca n't get any of those guys , go for someone listed below . <h> 2013 IDP Week 12 Waiver Wire Pickups <h> Darryl Sharpton , Hou ILB <p> The Houston defense suffered a major loss when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn Lateral Crucial Ligament ( LCL ) in Week 5 , landing him on the injured reserve . It was the second straight season Cushing was lost to a season-ending injury after he torn his Anterior Crucial Ligament ( ACL ) in the same season in Week 4 of 2012 . <p> Cushing has been replaced by the 25-year-old Sharpton , a former Miami Hurricane selected by the Texans ' in the fourth round of the 2010 draft . Sharpton has been pretty solid since joining the starting lineup as the inside linebacker with 28 tackles , 21 of the solo variety , over the past four games . He has matchup this week against Jacksonville and middle/inside linebackers have done fairly well statistically against the Jags this season . <h> Demario Davis , NYJ WLB <p> The Jets ' former third-round pick in 2012 is their starting weakside linebacker with 70 total tackles ( 37 solo ) , an interception and a sack through 10 games . It is obvious that Davis needs to get more solo stops and/or additional big plays ' to be more valuable in IDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jets will travel to Baltimore this weekend after the Ravens run game came back to life in an overtime win over Chicago last week . Davis plays the weakside in the Jets ' 4-3 defense and had 10 combined tackles last week against Buffalo , with only three being solos . Owners should n't expect Davis to have any outstanding games going forward , but the second-year pro should have a solid game this week and a couple more along the way . <h> Manti Te'o , SD ILB <p> It might sound crazy , but the rookie out of Notre Dame is n't a terrible play this week against Kansas City . The Chiefs figure to run the ball often with Jamaal Charles and that should spell plenty of tackle opportunities for the San Diego defense . <p> Te'o has shown improvement each week even if it does n't show up in the box score . Owners in deeper leagues might want to give him a go if there is no better choice on the waiver wire . <p> Defensive tackle Dontari Poe and end John Abraham have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if available in your league , in that order . If they are n't on the waiver wire , look for these guys to pickup . <h> Sheldon Richardson , NYJ DT <p> The 22-year-old is having a great rookie season so far having registered 50 total tackles , two and a half sacks and one forced fumble in 10 contests . Richardson was taken No. 13th overall by the Jets for good reason as the former Missouri Tiger has been able to contribute right away . Fantasy owners can pick him up as a fill-in , but may end up using him as their starter as the season goes on . <h> Star Lotulelei , Car DT <p> The Panthers were a slot behind the Jets in last year 's draft and they also took a defensive tackle with their first round pick . It was Lotulelei out of Utah and the rookie has been vital to Carolina 's success this season on the defensive side of the ball swallowing up double teams , although it has n't fully shown statistically . IDP owners in deeper leagues can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack of the season against New England on Monday night . <h> Olivier Vernon , Mia DE <p> Here is a guy you have n't heard much about unless you are a Dolphins fan , but Vernon is quietly putting together very nice season with five and a half sacks and 32 total tackles ( 23 solo ) . Vernon has been overshadowed by teammate Cameron Wake even though he has only six and a half sacks himself . IDP owners who pick up Vernon can expect a relatively consistent output from him on a week-to-week basis and that goes a long way . <p> Last but not least , owners will be without regulars in the secondary with Earl Thomas , Kam Chancellor , Jairus Bryd , Da'Norris Searcy , Aaron Williams and Brandon Boykin . Others like Antrel Rolle , Ryan Clark , Prince Amukamara , James Ihedigbo , Duke Ihenacho , Eric Reid and Tashaun Gipson have been talked about in previous IDP waiver article and should be considered before players listed below . <h> Andrew Sendejo , Min FS <p> When Harrison Smith went down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was thought that Jemarca Sanford would step up in the Vikings secondary and get most of the tackles . Sanford has been in and out of the lineup himself with a groin injury and has been somewhat productive when healthy . <p> Sendejo has been the safety to own as of late though with 27 total tackles the past two weeks . The Packers will host Minnesota this weekend , which is n't a great matchup without Aaron Rodgers leading a pass-heavy attack . Even still , Sendejo should have a pretty good game racking up tackles especially if running backs Eddie Lacy and James Starks to the second level with regularity . <h> Tramon Williams , GB CB <p> Speaking of Green Bay hosting Minnesota , Williams is also a useful play for IDP owners this weekend and beyond . The 30-year-old veteran is one of the better cover corners in the NFL at this point in his career and is a very capable tackler as well with a combined 50 ( 35 solo ) this season . <p> The only thing that hurts his chances to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a very good passing attack , so there wo n't be a ton of tackle opportunities theoretically . Williams had only two stops when the two teams met in Week 8 . He does however make for a great pickup for the rest of the season . <h> Tracy Porter , Oak CB <p> The six-year veteran has bounced from the Saints , to the Broncos and now the Raiders this season . Porter has 48 combined tackles ( 36 solo ) , two interceptions , one for a touchdown , one and a half sacks and 11 passes defensed . <p> The Raiders will host the Titans this weekend and that likely means that Porter will be assigned to Kendall Wright , Tennessee 's top wideout . Wright typically gets lots of targets and that will probably be the case with backup Ryan Fitzpatrick under center . Porter makes for a good play because he has a knack for being around the ball and can make the occasional big play .

Fantasy owners can expect his production to be on the upswing going forward and he is worth is look in most IDP leagues . <h> Prince Amukamara , NYG CB <p> The former Nebraska Husker is now in his third year as a pro and really coming into his own as the Giants ' top cornerback . The nice thing about Amukamara is that he puts up a pretty good amount of solo tackles per game , with 42 out of his 45 this season being unaccompanied . <p> The 24-year-old has one interception through eight games , which is only the third of his career and a season-high . Fantasy owners in tackle friendly leagues will find him quite valuable , especially if the format requires a starting cornerback. 
@@90848418 @6348418/ <h> Fantasy Football IDP Week 12 <p> With Cincinnati , Seattle , Buffalo and Philadelphia all on their bye , there are some high caliber players missing from IDP teams this week . <p> Top scoring linebackers Vontaze Burfict ( mentioned in this year 's IDP sleeper article ) , Kiki Alonso ( mentioned in IDP Waivers Week 2 article ) and Demeco Ryans all have the week off . Bobby Wagner owners will be without a great talent as well . He would have been mentioned as a top producer if it were n't for an ankle injury that sidelined him in both Week 6 and 7 . I 've already mentioned guys like Paul Worrilow , Thomas Davis , Jon Beason , Kevin Burnett , Jon Bostic and Pat Angerer in past IDP Waiver articles and all are worth an add in the order they are listed . If you ca n't get any of those guys , go for someone listed below . <h> 2013 IDP Week 12 Waiver Wire Pickups <h> Darryl Sharpton , Hou ILB <p> The Houston defense suffered a major loss when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn Lateral Crucial Ligament ( LCL ) in Week 5 , landing him on the injured reserve . It was the second straight season Cushing was lost to a season-ending injury after he torn his Anterior Crucial Ligament ( ACL ) in the same season in Week 4 of 2012 . <p> Cushing has been replaced by the 25-year-old Sharpton , a former Miami Hurricane selected by the Texans ' in the fourth round of the 2010 draft . Sharpton has been pretty solid since joining the starting lineup as the inside linebacker with 28 tackles , 21 of the solo variety , over the past four games . He has matchup this week against Jacksonville and middle/inside linebackers have done fairly well statistically against the Jags this season . <h> Demario Davis , NYJ WLB <p> The Jets ' former third-round pick in 2012 is their starting weakside linebacker with 70 total tackles ( 37 solo ) , an interception and a sack through 10 games . It is obvious that Davis needs to get more solo stops and/or additional big plays ' to be more valuable in IDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jets will travel to Baltimore this weekend after the Ravens run game came back to life in an overtime win over Chicago last week . Davis plays the weakside in the Jets ' 4-3 defense and had 10 combined tackles last week against Buffalo , with only three being solos . Owners should n't expect Davis to have any outstanding games going forward , but the second-year pro should have a solid game this week and a couple more along the way . <h> Manti Te'o , SD ILB <p> It might sound crazy , but the rookie out of Notre Dame is n't a terrible play this week against Kansas City . The Chiefs figure to run the ball often with Jamaal Charles and that should spell plenty of tackle opportunities for the San Diego defense . <p> Te'o has shown improvement each week even if it does n't show up in the box score . Owners in deeper leagues might want to give him a go if there is no better choice on the waiver wire . <p> Defensive tackle Dontari Poe and end John Abraham have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if available in your league , in that order . If they are n't on the waiver wire , look for these guys to pickup . <h> Sheldon Richardson , NYJ DT <p> The 22-year-old is having a great rookie season so far having registered 50 total tackles , two and a half sacks and one forced fumble in 10 contests . Richardson was taken No. 13th overall by the Jets for good reason as the former Missouri Tiger has been able to contribute right away . Fantasy owners can pick him up as a fill-in , but may end up using him as their starter as the season goes on . <h> Star Lotulelei , Car DT <p> The Panthers were a slot behind the Jets in last year 's draft and they also took a defensive tackle with their first round pick . It was Lotulelei out of Utah and the rookie has been vital to Carolina 's success this season on the defensive side of the ball swallowing up double teams , although it has n't fully shown statistically . IDP owners in deeper leagues can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack of the season against New England on Monday night . <h> Olivier Vernon , Mia DE <p> Here is a guy you have n't heard much about unless you are a Dolphins fan , but Vernon is quietly putting together very nice season with five and a half sacks and 32 total tackles ( 23 solo ) . Vernon has been overshadowed by teammate Cameron Wake even though he has only six and a half sacks himself . IDP owners who pick up Vernon can expect a relatively consistent output from him on a week-to-week basis and that goes a long way . <p> Last but not least , owners will be without regulars in the secondary with Earl Thomas , Kam Chancellor , Jairus Bryd , Da'Norris Searcy , Aaron Williams and Brandon Boykin . Others like Antrel Rolle , Ryan Clark , Prince Amukamara , James Ihedigbo , Duke Ihenacho , Eric Reid and Tashaun Gipson have been talked about in previous IDP waiver article and should be considered before players listed below . <h> Andrew Sendejo , Min FS <p> When Harrison Smith went down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was thought that Jemarca Sanford would step up in the Vikings secondary and get most of the tackles . Sanford has been in and out of the lineup himself with a groin injury and has been somewhat productive when healthy . <p> Sendejo has been the safety to own as of late though with 27 total tackles the past two weeks . The Packers will host Minnesota this weekend , which is n't a great matchup without Aaron Rodgers leading a pass-heavy attack . Even still , Sendejo should have a pretty good game racking up tackles especially if running backs Eddie Lacy and James Starks to the second level with regularity . <h> Tramon Williams , GB CB <p> Speaking of Green Bay hosting Minnesota , Williams is also a useful play for IDP owners this weekend and beyond . The 30-year-old veteran is one of the better cover corners in the NFL at this point in his career and is a very capable tackler as well with a combined 50 ( 35 solo ) this season . <p> The only thing that hurts his chances to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a very good passing attack , so there wo n't be a ton of tackle opportunities theoretically . Williams had only two stops when the two teams met in Week 8 . He does however make for a great pickup for the rest of the season . <h> Tracy Porter , Oak CB <p> The six-year veteran has bounced from the Saints , to the Broncos and now the Raiders this season . Porter has 48 combined tackles ( 36 solo ) , two interceptions , one for a touchdown , one and a half sacks and 11 passes defensed . <p> The Raiders will host the Titans this weekend and that likely means that Porter will be assigned to Kendall Wright , Tennessee 's top wideout . Wright typically gets lots of targets and that will probably be the case with backup Ryan Fitzpatrick under center . Porter makes for a good play because he has a knack for being around the ball and can make the occasional big play .
