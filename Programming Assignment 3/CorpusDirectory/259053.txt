@@37221541 @6221541/ <p> The purpose of this game is to help your beginner reader to recognize and spell the basic color words . It is geared for children ages five to six years old . Playing the basic game is simple . <p> In PART ONE of the game a color word is shown with different color squares under it . Your child clicks on the color square he/she thinks matches the word . <p> Many parents of preschoolers expand on PART ONE by saying the word , spelling it , saying it again and then having their child do the same . For instance , you say " red " " r - e - d " " red " . And then the child says " red " " r -e - d " " red " . And then the parent tells the child to click on the square he/she thinks is the red square . <p> Children who are 5 to 6 years old are usually ready to read words phonetically . Parents often help these children by pointing to the color word , let 's say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word out . For instance , you say " how does an R sound ? " You want to help them get the " Rrr " sound . Then you work on the E ( " Eh " ) and then the D ( " Duh " ) . Afterwards you have the child say it faster - " Rrr Eh Duh " and faster until it comes out as " Red " . <p> Learning to pronounce words is very difficult . A five year old child will have problems sounding out many words . Take the word WHITE - " Wih " " Hah " " I " " Tuh " " Eee " - It is a difficult leap to get from " Wih Hah I Tuh Eee " to WHITE ! <p> Some words will be learned by phonetics , and some will be learned by repetition and recognition . Either way , it is a challenge for a child . Learning to read is hard ! Remember , the English language is very confusing . Take the letter E - sometimes it sounds like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is silent ! English is full of confusing sounds and language rules that are hard to master .

@@37221572 @6221572/ <h> Summary Answer <p> While we will examine some various reasons for the buildup of tension between the Southern states and the <p> Federal Government there is a key concept answer . During the 1840-1850s the states from the North and South were evenly divided in Congress.The ultimate battle becomes not over slavery itself , but rather over whether slavery would be allowed to expand.If it did expand the South would ultimately control the Congress and the reigns of the Government.The same holds true for the north . <p> Now for the specific long term reasons , <h> I.Congress Attempts to Deal with the Expansion of Slavery <p> Now remember the goal here is to preserve the balance of power in the Congress . So , the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was the first attempt was a simple plan , draw an invisible line across the map.North of the line ( drawn through Missouri ) was free land , below it was slave land . <p> The Fugitive Slave Act is in itself a cause of the Civil War.Its intent was that Northerners would be legally obliged to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing more trouble for them.I call this the poop in your own back yard concept.Before the Fugitive Slave Act , Northerners were not for slavery but did not actively fight against it.By making them part of the system they smelt the stench of slavery and began to believe that it needed to be destroyed . <p> +New territories in the future would be settled by popular sovereignty.This seemed to conflict with the Missouri Compromises invisible line . <p> +Well here is Judicial Review at its worse.This Supreme Court decision in 1857 is simple , Dred Scott was a slave brought to free land , and he then claimed he should be treated as a free man.The court could of coursed freed him and took a activist stand.Sadly they did not , the ruling basically said , SLAVES ARE PROPERTY . <p> +The silver lining is the EFFECT , which was it really got under the skin of northerners.Its one thing to ignore a problem that is far off and silent , but splash it across the papers and you take notice , Northerners did and it turned them against slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the effect is the South began to see that the tide was turning against them and it might be time to jump ship and SECEDE . <p> +John Brown was a radical abolitionist who believed that violence was the only way to end slavery.During Bloody Kansas he and his followers knifed to death a pro-slavery family who came to vote for slavery in Kansas . <p> +Following that event he and his followers began an uprising and tried to take over a Federal arsenal.They failed were tried for treason and executed . <p> +John Browns death made him a martyr to the abolitionist movement and made the flames goes higher.He even became immortalized in a famous poem and song . Listen to JOHN BROWNS BODY HERE <p> +Remember the Federalist Party ?

Sediment is eventually deposited(dropped) . <p> Deposition - the settling of particles . <p> Gravity drives most of erosion and deposition ! <p> The change in the velocity of moving liquid water ( and wind ) will determine if a particle is deposited or transported . Because of this , particles are usually well sorted when deposited . Ice and gravity by itself usualy drop all sizes and shapes together . The particles are usually unsorted . <p> 1 . RIVER/RUNNING WATER <p> Running water is the predominant agent of erosion on the Earth . As streams downcut the underlying bedrock , they initially cut a V-shaped channel ( see image B ) . The slope and discharge ( volume of water ) determines the velocity and carrying capacity of the river . Large volumes of fast moving water has the ability to carry large quantities of all sizes of sediment ( watch videoA ) . When the volume of water decreases and/or the slope decreases sediment gets deposited , largest particles first , smallest last . We call this sorting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape and density of the particles . <p> Glaciers are found either at high latitudes and or high elevation . An example of a region with high elevation glaciers are the Rockies . These glaciers are called valley or alpine glaciers .

These are examples of continental glaciers or ice sheets . These glaciers radiate out in all directions from the zone of accumulation to the zone of ablation . <p> Rivers carve small V- shaped valleys and glaciers carve large U-shaped valleys . Sediment deposited directly by the glacier tend to be unsorted . New York Stateis an example of a location that was once covered by an ice sheet several miles thick .

Outwash is believed to be caused by the melting glacier water .

Although the earth has experiences many interglacial periods , scientist hypothesize this warming is caused by human . Humans are adding greenhouse gases like CO2 in the atmosphere which is causing a larger amount of infrared energy to be absorbed in the atmosphere . Climate change has been observed globally and many of the effects are negative . Some effects include drought , flooding , sea-level rise , and extinction of species . <p> Most wind erosion and deposition occurs in deserts and lake/ocean coastlines .

( E ) The worst outbreak of disease X was in the 1920s . <h> Logical Reasoning Practice Answers <p> 1 . ( E ) We 're told that if Dieter sings , then Jarik gets a headache and Kari groans . Then we 're told that Kari is not groaning . Using the contrapositive , we get the following logic : If Jarik does n't have a headache and/or if Kari is n't groaning , then Dieter must not be singing . So if Kari is not groaning , then there is no way that Dieter is singing , and choice ( E ) is our answer . <p> 2 . ( B ) The sentence can be rearranged to read : " If Dave does not cook , then Joe will eat the orange . Whenever a Logical Reasoning question gives you an " If ... then " sentence , the only thing that must be true is called the " contrapositive " " take the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two halves . For this question , the contrapositive is " If Joe did not eat the orange , then Dave did cook . " Choice ( B ) matches this perfectly . <p> 3 . ( A ) If one juror had never been able to agree with the others , then the members of the jury never came to a unanimous agreement ; they never reached a verdict ( A ) . ( B ) is wrong because it contradicts this idea . ( C ) , ( D ) , and ) E ) may all be true statements , but we have no way of knowing for sure from the information in the question stem . <p> 4 . ( B ) The trick here is to recognize that the second sentence does NOT say where Bernard 's treadmill is ; it may or may not be at City Fitness . Only if the treadmill is at City Fitness is he violating the rules ; in other words , if he is not violating the rules , he is not running at City Fitness ( B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is out because Bernard could be running at City Fitness and just flouting the rules . <p> 5 . ( J ) This Verbal Deduction question revolves around an improvement in medicine . We 're told that people diagnosed with disease X lived only six months to a year in the 1920s " whereas nowadays with treatment they can live five years or longer . ( J ) is the valid conclusion . The other choices involve too much inference ; nothing is said about curing the disease ( F ) or how many people survive the disease ( G ) . Likewise , there is no information about how disease X compares to other serious diseases ( H ) , or whether the 1920s were the worst outbreak of disease X(K).

@@37221823 @6221823/ <p> Neutralization reaction between an acid and base produces an ionic compound called a " salt " and water <p> Salt ( ionic compound ) is produced from the positive ion from the base and negative ion from the acid . There are many types of salts depending on the type of positive and negative ions that combine in acid-base reactions . <p> KCl is a salt because the positive ion K1+ comes from the base KOH and the negative ion Cl1- comes from the acid HCl .

@@37221842 @6221842/ <p> The Iroquois Midwinter Ceremony is held in either January or February . When the dipper constellation ( not our teddy bear one in the cartoon ! ) appears in the sky directly overhead , you then wait for the new moon to be seen . This is when the spiritual year begins . You then wait 5 days after the new moon to begin the ceremony . The celebration lasts 9 days with a lot of traditional events , as well as choosing new council members for the next year . <p> This celebration is observed among the tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy or The Six Nations : Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga , Seneca and Tuscarora . Because the Mohawk flag is purple and white , I chose to use that color scheme for this page . <p> This is also known as the " New Year 's Ceremony " because it marks the beginning of a new ritual year . The " Big Heads " announce this ceremony . They are masked messengers who visit the longhouse ( a bark covered structure where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity space . The Big Heads invite everyone to participate . <p> There is no specific order to this ceremony . Each tribe has their own way of doing it . But the usual custom is to first begin with the " Stirring of the Ashes " as a symbolic gesture of showing gratitude for all the blessings bestowed during the previous year . There is a public naming event where all the children born during the previous year are now given their Indian names . There are also two traditional Indian dances , The Bear Dance and the Feather Dance . <p> Tobacco is an important element in many Native American celebrations . In the Midwinter Ceremony , they have a Tobacco Invocation ceremony that represents a way of communicating to the Creator , both a message of thanksgiving , as well as a plea for a successful growing season for the new year . <p> The Iroquois also believe that dreams are not just fantasies . They feel dreams represent a cure for diseases and mental disorders . So they have a Dreamsharing Ritual . They feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting opinions on what those dreams might mean , the Iroquois believe that they are better able to resolve whatever problems or conflicts gave rise to the dreams in the first place . They have a group of medicine men known as The False Face Society , who perform the appropriate curing ritual once these dreams have been interpreted . <p> One of the highlights of the Midwinter Ceremony used to be what was called The White Dog Sacrifice . It is no longer done ! Instead today , instead of a dog , they use a white basket . For more on this read further below under the specific customs . However , it could be a bit disturbing for animal lovers and some children . <p> The Midwinter Ceremony ends with a speaker who gives a summation of the 9 days of the celebration . He also gives a brief thanksgiving address . It is at this time that the new council members ( who have been chosen for the upcoming year ) are introduced to the crowd at the longhouse . The rest of the tribe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dreams . And a new year is now welcomed . <p> Details of the Specific Symbols and Rituals <p> Bear Dance <p> The Bear Dance is a medical curing ritual . Iroquois Bear Dancers include both men and women . Their movements are a somewhat lumbering , waddling mimic of a bear as they dance in a counterclockwise circle . This bear dance can be performed publicly or privately for a sick person . It is done for the purpose of curing people of their problems and any misfortunes that have beset them over the past year . <p> Big Heads and Stirring Ashes <p> The Iroquois refer to them as " Our Uncles " because they represent the tribal founders . The Big Head messengers dress in buffalo skins and cornhusk masks with braids . They carry wooden mallets used to mash corn . This symbolizes both hunt and harvest . They make visits throughout the village at the New Year to announce the festivities start . When at a house , they take their mallets and stir up the ashes in the household 's fire . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Creator . While doing this they also ask that the New Year bring renewal and fertility to the earth . Ashes symbolize the earth to which all living things return and that life springs from . <p> Tobacco Invocation <p> After the " Stirring of the Ashes " ( described above ) there is often the sprinkling of the tobacco on the burning embers . The smoke from the burning embers is believed to rise up to heaven , taking with it the message of thanks to their Creator . The Iroquois are also referred to as " The Tobacco People " or " Tobacco Nation . " The word " ierokwa " is where their name originates from and it means " they who use tobacco . " <p> Besides using tobacco for ceremonial purposes and communicating with spirits , they also use tobacco to treat burns , sores , the pain of a toothache and diseases . Tobacco was the one crop that women were not responsible for cultivating . When Naive American men got together to make peace or conduct their business , they often shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believed induced " good thoughts . " <p> Dreamsharing <p> This is a sacred activity in which the Iroquois try to get rid of troubling thoughts and make their wishes come true . It is also known as " Dream Guessing . " What they do is describe their dreams in front of the tribe members . After listening , this assembled group then offer their interpretations and suggestions . The purpose is to try to help the dreamer identify exactly the dream is trying to relay to him : a need , a wish or a desire . Sometimes people reenact each other 's dreams ; and , then invite the spectators to guess what they mean . Those that come up with the most accurate dream interpretation are then required to help see that the dream is fulfilled . This is done by either presenting the dreamer with symbolic gifts or by actually helping him/her satisfy their needs . <p> The Dreamsharing is considered a central part of the Midwinter Ceremony because they believe it helps people be cured of their illnesses that are symptomatic of unresolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's dream and then helps to resolve their situation is honored . It 's not considered an obligation . And , by doing this it is felt that tribal traditions and friendships are cemented . <p> False Face Society <p> This society is a group of medicine men who wear masks carved out of a living tree . They have deep-set slits for the eyes . The noses are large and extend across the forehead with a spiny ridge or crease . The False Face Society members are believed to possess the power to scare off evil spirits that cause illness . The group holds its most important meeting in the longhouse during the Midwinter Ceremony . The members participate in the curing rituals , often reaching into the hot ashes of a fire without burning their hands . Then they rub or blow off the ashes on to those in need of a cure . Although both men and women can belong to the False Face Society , only the men wear the masks . <p> Great Feather Dance <p> This dance is performed for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the people during the past year . The dancers dance to two singers who sit face-to-face . Turtle shell rattles are used to create the rhythm . The dancers are dressed in full tribal regalia . The dance is held on the 8th day ( next to last night ) of the 9-day festival . This dance is considered one of the " Four Sacred Ceremonies " essential for salvation as named by the 18th Century prophet , Handsome Lake . <p> Peach Stone Game <p> This is another one of the " Four Sacred Ceremonies " , which symbolizes the game played by The Creator and his evil brother as they competed with each other during the creation of the earth . Six peach stones are either burnt or blackened on one side . Then they are put into a bowl and shaken . The score is based on how many of the " black " sides and " white " sides ends up showing . This is a game of chance a lot like dice , or flipping a coins heads or tails . <p> When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal of the earth , especially the battle for survival that fruits and vegetables have against the harsh elements of Nature . The outcome of this game is used to predict the success of next year 's harvest . It also symbolizes the good luck that The Creator has bestowed on the inhabitants of the earth . Men play against women . One clan can play against another clan . The game can go on for as long as two days ! Bets are often placed also on who will win . <p> The following information could be disturbing to animal lovers and some children . Use your discretion when reading it . <p> White Dog Sacrifice <p> The central sacrificial rite of the Midwinter Ceremony involved the killing of a white dog . This is no longer done today because the Iroquois love their dogs and to have one of their pets killed as a sacrifice was a sign of how seriously the actually took this ritual . Killing a white dog symbolized purity . So sacrificing the dog was a way of purifying the entire community . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks on it . It was decorated with red paint , feathers , beads , wampum and ribbons . It was then laid on the fire , and then a basket of tobacco was thrown on the flames .

Instead they use a white basket as a substitute of burning a white dog .

@@37221906 @6221906/ <p> Harmony Hunter : Hi , welcome to the podcast . I 'm Harmony Hunter . If you lived in colonial Virginia , there was hardly a building you could enter that a carpenter had n't been in first . From houses and outbuildings to shops and churches , all were brought into being by the carpenter 's hands . Today master carpenter Garland Wood has stopped by to tell us a bit about the carpenter 's trade in America 's early years . Garland , thank you for being here today . <p> Garland Wood : Hi , how are you ? <p> Harmony : You practice the trade of carpentry . That 's actually distinct from the cabinetmaker 's trade . You both work in wood , but how is your specialty different ? <p> Garland : Yes , and we should add another trade too , which is joinery . So carpentry is the heavy work , it 's the construction of the timber frame and a carpenter 's tools , you know in our time are really chisels and mallets so we 're cutting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's our responsibility as a carpenter to move other people into a shelter . So our job is working outside putting everybody else inside . So we raise the frame , we cover the frame against the weather and secure it . <p> A joiner is someone who uses the same kinds of chisels and mallets to make mortise and tenon joints , but they 're doing the finish work for the house ; so window sashes and panel doors and paneling and what we would today call trim carpentry . And then a cabinetmaker 's specialty is really not building , but furniture . So once the carpenter has raised the frame and the joiner has embellished with fine moldings and pretty windows and doors then it 's often filled with nice luxury furniture of a cabinetmaker . That makes the distinctions . <p> Harmony : If you 're looking at the buildings in the 18th century , is it fair to say the carpenter built everything that was n't brick ? <p> Garland : I think that is fair to say . Even a brick building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden staircases , rafters , ceiling beams , so there is a tremendous amount of wood in a brick building . <p> Harmony : So you ca n't have a town without a carpenter . Is this a very prestigious trade ? <p> Garland : Well , it 's a very common trade and some of the carpenters in Williamsburg were very shrewd businessmen . Some even elevated themselves through their business dealings into the lower levels of the gentry . There are n't many other trades that you can say that about . Williamsburg 's Benjamin Powell is a wonderful example of a very good builder and businessman who became a member of the gentry during the Revolutionary war . <p> There were probably more people in Williamsburg involved in fashion trades than anything else , but one you run the milliners and barbers and wig makers and tailors out of town , the builders are the most numerous . That would be carpenters , joiners , bricklayers , brickmakers , blacksmiths . We 're still interpreting a trade that did not have a single machine involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , in the time period we stress here at Colonial Williamsburg human hands form every part of a house , whether it 's the bricks or the nails to actually sawing the logs with hand saws into planks , splitting out the shingles so we make every part of the building traditionally . And I think that 's part of the appeal of the program today , because that 's pretty unusual and our visitors really enjoy seeing that kind of work . In many cases they get to help us out doing some of that work . <p> Harmony : Do you find that different carpenters in the period develop different specialties ? <p> Garland : That 's a good thing to talk about . Carpentry is one of the few 18th-century trades that , in Virginia , seems to be broken up into different categories . So for instance , you 'll find in the city of Williamsburg a man who says he 's a house carpenter or a house carpenter and joiner . To the period that means someone who is doing a fairly refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish work himself too . You also see the term clapboard carpenter , and a clapboard carpenter really is a rural woodworker . His job might be a log slave quarter , or you know , a smokehouse , or a hogpen or the kind of rustic work . <p> And of course , Virginia being an extremely rural colony of farmers , there was way more work for clapboard carpenters than there was for these more sophisticated house carpenters and joiners . You also see the term Negro carpenter , and the best way to explain that is that skilled white craftsmen in colonial Virginia were in scarce supply and many planters brought slaves up as apprentices in a trade . So that they had a sort of home-grown corps of craftspeople that worked for them all the time . <p> The term Negro carpenter is kind of interchangeable with clapboard carpenter , but it means a carpenter who 's trained to do every kind of woodwork that might be required on a plantation or farm . So you might be framing a building , you might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bridge or a wheelbarrow , kind of a general purpose woodworker . So we 've got a carpenter , we 've got a joiner ; we 've got a house carpenter joiner , clapboard carpenter and Negro carpenter . All kind of different facets of the trade , but who are all involved in the most fundamental thing , which is putting people under a roof . Carpentry is one of the most ancient trades there is , and it goes back well before written history and of course it 's still a thriving trade today in the 21st century . <p> Harmony : Colonial Williamsburg has 88 original buildings . Are you able to study those originals and get an understanding for the way that these problems are being thought out ; these projects are being carried out ? <p> Garland : We 're really privileged to have access to that original source material , and that 's really the way we think about it . In our trade today we talk about object-based work . Maybe another way to think about that is in the period in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was leaning over his shoulder and telling him exactly what to do . And then the traditional trade of carpentry died . We started using machines to build houses and to make pieces of houses . So it would be great to be able to go to the cemetery and dig up one of these 18th-century carpenters and ask him , but we ca n't do that . But what we can do is look at the buildings that they left behind , and that 's their legacy . And so really the smartest thing we can do is look very carefully at what they built and then model our work on it . Otherwise , we 're just making stuff up . <p> Harmony : We said that the carpenter 's trade was indispensible in the 18th century . You 're in no less demand today . They keep you pretty busy from projects like restoring the Peyton Randolph House and its outbuildings , building Charlton 's Coffeehouse recently , and currently Anderson 's Armory reconstruction . The carpenter 's hand is still very evident throughout Colonial Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work in progress . We 've got a long way to go before it 's all finished . It may never be finished . And , let 's say 70 or 80 years ago , when the work of reconstructing and restoring the town took place , it was done by very skilled but very modern carpenters for the time period . It 's only been fairly recently that we have created a carpentry-joinery program where we can do the same kinds of work as a public program . And the good news is , there are dozens and dozens and dozens of buildings still to be reconstructed in Williamsburg . And so there are really three useful things about those kinds of projects . <p> One , the public finds it fascinating and we 're glad it 's fascinating and we encourage them to come and watch . Two , we have to sustain these trades by bringing in apprentices who are novices at this kind of work and having them put up buildings so Colonial Williamsburg helps us to develop the apprentices so that they will then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . <p> And the third thing is , we get a very believable-looking building . If you go down this path of deciding that you want to build a real 18th-century building from the ground up , it 's a pretty daunting task . Because you can build a beautiful timber frame , but if you set it on cinder blocks it looks horrible . You 've got to have bricks . And if you 're going to have a brick foundation , well they really should be handmade bricks to look right . And once you 're ready to put hand-planed boards on the wall , then you ca n't use a modern nail . That takes away from the overall looks so then the nails , the glass , the plaster , the paint , the wood , the bricks and the mortar all have to be made traditionally , and we can do all of that at Colonial Williamsburg in our trades program . <p> So the buildings have a believability that I think is unsurpassed . They do n't just look like 18th century buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same material , they 're just new 18th century buildings . So I think that 's the legacy that we leave behind as we put these structures up . I think every generation here wants to do better , more authentic work than the generation before and we hope to continue that process as we reconstruct the other 100 buildings for the town . <p> Harmony : Garland , thank you so much for being our guest today and talking about this trade . <p> I grew up in Williamsburg and the history of this place has been with me from an early age . I thought it would be fun to get a summer job at Colonial Williamsburg while I was in college , and spent six weeks working as a carpenter . After that summer , it was all I wanted to do , and so I became an apprentice and spent the next six years learning the trade . That summer job was 32 years ago ! <p> It really is.I did n't  know being a carpenter was this interesting , I always thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write about what carpenters do to help other people , and what really cool tools they use . <p> hi , do you get rich for all the work you do ? and another question i would like to ask is what kinds of tree wood do you use ? and that is all my questions i have for you today thanks and have a wonderful day . <p> i want to be a carpenter.in my school i 'm in a carpenter group and i love my group . if only i could be harmony and talk to a real one . it would be awesome ! ! ! ! ! i 'm leaning about colonial job in school , and colonial times . p.s. i <p> Website <p> Notify me when new comments are added . <p> Since 2005 , " Past and Present " has taken you behind the scenes to meet interpreters , chefs , tradesmen , musicians , historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our podcast : one that 's audio-only and one that includes a slideshow.

@@37221914 @6221914/ <p> Harmony Hunter : Hi , welcome to the podcast . I 'm Harmony Hunter . Continuing our series on historic trades , this week we 're talking with the master of a trade we could hardly do without : the shoemaker . Our guest today is Al Saguto , who 's master boot and shoe maker in Colonial Williamsburg 's Historic Area . Al , thank you for being here today . <p> Al Saguto : Well thank you Harmony . <p> Harmony : We 've been talking to a lot of the tradespeople of Colonial Williamsburg 's Historic Area , but I understand that shoemaking , as a trade in the 18th century , was one of the most widely-practiced trades . Why was there such a demand for this trade ? <p> Al : Well , first of all , everybody 's got feet and they all have to have shoes . The rate of consumption per pair , per year , per person from the 18th century doubles from about two pair a year to about four pair a year , so it necessitated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of the first trades that arrived in Virginia is the shoemaker 's trade . Jamestown colony is established in 1607 . Sixteen-ten we see the first shoemaker . Does that suggest something about the necessity of this as a trade ? If you 're breaking a wilderness , you 're going to need shoes . <p> Al : Well absolutely , and Britain had had some experience in supplying its colonists from a distance just as the Romans did centuries before them . The supply lines were very long , however , and the idea that the London Company had at the beginning at Jamestown was to sell them everything they needed and that was n't very practical when it came to shoes at the rate that they were wearing out . So they went on a very aggressive recruiting campaign in London to recruit shoemakers and other trades too by 1610 to come over here and supply the needs . <p> Harmony : I 've also heard the shoemaker called the cordwainer . What is that about ? <p> Al : Well , that 's an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The French word is " cordonnier , " which means a worker in cordovan leather in French . The English just sort of chopped it into cordwainer . <p> Harmony : And now in the parlance of our times it 's shoemaker . <p> Al : It 's shoemaker , or it 's still cordwainer in the inner circles . <p> Harmony : But the one thing that you will not tolerate being called is a cobbler . How is that different from what you do ? <p> Al : Well , according to the dictionaries of the time , a cobbler is a bungling workman in general , especially a botcher or a mender of old shoes . Shoemakers and cobblers have lived in enmity since the middle ages because the cobblers wanted to fix old shoes and sell second hand shoes and of course the shoemakers , or cordwainers , wanted to make and sell new ones . <p> So we basically squashed the cobblers through legislation . They wind up being sort of the wretched trade that sits out in the street with the dogs mending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have no friends . <p> Harmony : Tell me about how you make a shoe . What are the materials that you need ? What is the assembly process ? <p> Al : Well it varies widely between men 's shoes and women 's shoes at our time period . Most of the women 's shoes are made from textiles in the uppers , the upper part of the shoe is made out of silks and wools , the heels are carved out of wood . The soles , of course , are leather and it 's all stitched together around a wood form called a last . <p> The men 's shoes are all leather ; top , bottom , inside and out and they 're likewise made around a wood form . The whole process was divided into specialized tasks within a shop very early actually , about 2,000 years ago . So it 's not one person making the shoes start to finish . <p> You have the master of the shop , who does the pattern work and who buys the leather . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets embezzled . Then it goes to another worker called a closer who sews the uppers , the real thin parts of the shoe together . Once the uppers are completed , the master cuts out the rest of the bits and gives them to the journeymen in the shop and they build the shoe around the wooden last , again sewing and stitching all the way . <p> Harmony : I imagine you must have some specialized tools to accomplish all of that . What are some of the tools that are distinct to the shoemaker 's trade ? <p> Al : Well , relative to other trades like the blacksmiths , we use very few tools compared to some of the other trades : mostly awls for sewing , curved pointy things for poking the holes for the sewing , knives for cutting , pinchers for pulling and stretching the leather , polishing sticks and rubbing bones to polish the work up when you 're done and that sort of thing . The old phrase was , " A good shoemaker could make a pair of shoes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , the tool makers and marketers of tools were trying to make more and more tools to sell to more and more workmen . <p> Harmony : And in the 18th century we do n't have a distinct form for the left and the right foot ? <p> Al : Not any more . The crooked-shaped , crooked forms were given up about 1600 for economy . So like your socks or your stockings , there 's no shape to it until you put your foot in it . <p> Harmony : I want to think about some of the styles that were popular in the 18th century . What are people looking for in a shoe ? What 's defining the style of the time ? <p> Al : Well shoemaking , like a lot of the other trades , were real arbiters of fashion through all the centuries . The number of styles for men and the number of styles for woman were very diverse . You had slippers for indoors , common shoes for wearing every day , strong shoes for workers and say rural workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots for hunting on foot , even specialized forms like tennis shoes were popular with the French who were quite given to playing the royal tennis in specialized shoes , dancing pumps for dancing . <p> Good heavens , there 's endless variety of styles . Actually there was an archeological example dug up on the eastern shore of Virginia from about 1660 and the toe of the shoe forked , not real pronounced in the devil horns like some of them did in Europe , but into the little forked shapes so even the outrageous styles were making their way to transatlantic . <p> Harmony : You mentioned evidence that came from an archeological dig . I imagine that must be one of the sources of research that you use . How do you know what you know about shoes and shoe making in the 17th and 18th century ? <p> Al : Well , you 've really hit the nail on the head . Archeology probably informs about 95 percent of what we do and know about shoes in the time period ; how they 're put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years so we can actually peek inside of them , which the curators do n't like us to do with nice shoes in Collections . So they 're very informative in that regard . Shoemaking also has benefited from having a number of sort of do-it-yourself textbooks since the 17th century published on how to make a shoe . That also informs our work . <p> Harmony : So we have the shoemaker as a resident trade in the colony , but he 's also competing with imports . How is that organization working ? <p> Al : Well , the vision for the colonies in the beginning was one of creating a new market abroad for goods from home . However , that model did n't succeed terribly well and you had entrepreneurial people here too that wanted to make some money . So early on , the shoemakers in Virginia were making shoes , but they were exporting them out of Virginia . Local people were not getting the benefit of them . They were going off on the coastwise trade , down to other colonies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoe making industry in the colony . It was that important . They basically stipulated that each of the 16 counties at that time had to erect one or more tan houses and shoe manufactories and they forbade export . So while this is going on locally , the shoemakers in London of course see this as a cash cow . They 're exporting up to 40,000 pair a year they send here in the 1640s . So you 've got locally-made products , some of which are being sold locally , some are being exported , and then you 've got thousands and thousands of pairs coming in from England as well . <p> Harmony : Is there a difference in quality between the imported or the way that the shoemaker in colonial Virginia constructs a shoe versus the way that the imported shoe is going to be made ? <p> Al : Not fundamentally . The shoemakers here are English shoemakers , or at least one generation removed , or they were trained by English shoemakers . The product , if it 's substandard , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell locally where there 's sophisticated taste . You might get away with it on the Eastern Shore , down in the Carolinas . But locally the product is pretty comparable to shoes coming out of London . The point there is , no country ever exports its best stuff . Even though there are a lot of comments made during the 18th century about how superior British goods are and how wonderful they are , and in many cases they were , the best never left Britain . <p> Al : I think one of the most delightful things for me as a shoemaker for almost 40 years now is when people put on a shoe or boot that I made and they go , " This does n't feel like a new shoe , this feels like my foot . " I feel like I bridged that gap between something that I made with my hands throughout the day that somebody else has put on and interacted with it successfully , that it works as a tool , as a garment . I mean you figure making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them an inch too short and they just sort of look nerdy , but a pair of shoes you do n't have that luxury if you miss , you know , you cripple somebody . <p> Harmony : We can see your work throughout the Historic Area on historic interpreters and even interpreters like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson . Where can people come see you at work ? <p> Al : Well , the shoemaker 's shop is located right next door to the Greenhow Store on the Duke of Gloucester Street in the middle of the Historic Area . We are the smallest interpretive space in the entire Historic Area , but we 're in there diligently making shoes , trying to give people a good understanding as we like to say . <p> Harmony : Al , thank you so much for being our guest today . We hope that everybody makes it by your shop on their next visit to the Historic Area . <h> Comments <p> When i worked in cw the only shoes ever made in the shop were my own.the shop made tankards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes the master of the shop at that time had never made a pair of shoes Are things still the same ? Thank you for an answer ! Terry Lind <p> There were approximately 12 shoemaking firms operating in Williamsburg in the 18th century , not just one . Some made mens , others made womens shoes . The techniques and materials were drastically different , so the trade was divided into separate branches . <p> Imported shoes for both men and women of all classes were also plentiful and were available from over 30 merchants and milliners in the Williamsburg area . <p> Cobblers strictly repair old shoesshoemakers make new shoes ( and a better living ) . It is just a bit of old-time trade snobbery really . Nobody intended to become a cobbler usually , cobblers were just people who could not get work making shoes because they didn+GGt have the skills . In the 18th century , and in British-English , " cobber " is not a very complimentary term , it denotes a clumsy , bungling workman , especially the menders of old shoesSee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this pod cast on their Chromebooks , however , two of them had difficulty .

Blacksmiths really run a service industry so that when you come to a blacksmith shop there 's not a show room , there 's not a display area of finished products . <p> Usually you come to the blacksmith 's shop with a need . You either have been searching for a product that the merchants do n't sell and the blacksmith can manufacture that , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and needs to be fixed . So , we 're responding to repair and maintenance in an 18th century shop . <p> Now that the shop that we run in Colonial Williamsburg today is providing a lot of the commercially produced goods from the 18th century . In 2011 we do n't have access to manufacturers in England who produce building hardware and tools and the modern commercial products do n't look like the 18th century examples . <p> So our work differs from our 18th-century counterparts in that we 're doing a lot more manufacture than was done in the period . <p> Harmony : You talked about things that the blacksmith would have repaired . What is the range of some of those items that would have come through the blacksmith 's shop for repair ? <p> Ken : I think overall in the Chesapeake the biggest demand for ironwork relates to the biggest industry , which was agriculture . So there 's a lot of demand for axes , hoes , plows , rakes , harrows , wagon hardware . But , Williamsburg being an urban environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household goods : fireplace equipment , cooking tools , tools for the other workmen in the shops , some building hardware , so it 's a pretty broad range that we cover in the shop . <p> Harmony : And you mentioned also things that are getting manufactured : new commercial goods . What is the blacksmith making just brand new ? <p> Ken : In the 18th century you do see that there are objects that local consumers desire that are n't provided by English industry or that there are objects that are expensive to transport . Transportation from England , the cost is usually calculated by volume , so something like a wagon or a cart was expensive to transport . <p> You 'll see smiths then that manufacture wagon and carriage parts and pieces for carts , other vehicles . The type of tools that were used in tobacco cultivation in Virginia were different from those that were used in England and so the English farm tool manufacturers were n't making tools that were well suited to Virginia , and so you find a whole class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Virginia tools different than the English ones ? <p> Ken : One of the most common complaints you see from the 18th century regarding farm tools is that where the handle attaches to the blade , they break off , so there was a weakness in the design that was overcome by making that joint stronger , thicker . <p> I think the big difference is that Virginia soils have a much heavier clay base to them . In the Virginia heat of the summer they bake into an almost concrete-like ground surface and the English tools just did n't hold up to that . So the Virginia versions were a little bit heavier in construction and stronger where the handle joins . <p> Harmony : What is in your shop ? Walk us virtually through the Blacksmith 's Shop so we can understand what 's happening there and what kind of tools you have out everyday ? <p> Ken : In the blacksmith 's shop , we 're working with iron and steel as the raw materials and so the equipment necessary to shape iron and steel begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at room temperature . <p> By heating the material we can soften it and give it clay-like properties so the forge with the bellows to raise the temperature and a chimney to conduct the smoke and the fumes out of the room . Once the material is hot , it goes to the anvil and it 's primarily hammered into shape . So shaping iron and steel is a squeezing process much like working with clay but it 's done with hammers and anvils . <p> So we 'll squeeze out the shape , hammer out the shape . For many objects there 's then a follow-up process of smoothing , polishing and assembly , which is done at the vice . So you have a workbench usually near the window with a vice and the finishing work is done with files and saws and smaller hammers . The finishing work at the bench is usually done cold so it takes a lot longer than working the material hot . <p> Harmony : I 'm thinking about what the blacksmith in the 18th century knows about what processes are happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge them into water , at what temperature things change . <p> The blacksmith must understand these things by sight and by feel . Just as a modern person when you reflect on the body of knowledge that we have now versus what the blacksmith had to work with in the 18th century , does it strike you as kind of miraculous that he was able to work and produce what he did ? <p> Ken : It 's like all other materials . The knowledge developed over time . So it was an empirical knowledge of working with the material rather than a scientific analysis of what was happening in the work . We do much the same as our 18th-century counterparts in that while we have the science available to us we do n't necessary have to know , for example , exactly what the temperature is when we 're working the material in degrees Fahrenheit . We can judge that by color . <p> What 's important to us is at a specific temperature what are the characteristics of the metal ? What can we accomplish at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by experience . As for how rate of cooling affects the material , again , that 's something that the workman learns by experience . <p> You usually learn from somebody who 's already skilled at the work who can guide you through the basics , the fundamentals of learning a process , but then you have to actually participate in the work . You have to fail several times usually and then you kind of narrow down your options until you figure out how to work the material to achieve the desired result . <p> Harmony : What are you making right now in the shop ? <p> Ken : Actually , we 're working on a pretty interesting project at the moment . There 's a church in Pennsylvania that was built in 1743 that has two weathervanes that were built for the building in 1743 . The original weathervanes are still on the structure . <p> The church has decided that it 's time to remove the originals from the structure so that they can be preserved , because being out in the weather a single bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things could be lost forever . So the originals will be preserved and we 're putting the copies on the new building . <p> Harmony : That sounds like kind of a very sculptural object . Do you get to the chance to make more artistic objects in the shop or more utilitarian ones ? <p> Ken : Most of our work in the shop is very utilitarian . Tools , agricultural implements , hardware for construction , but part of what attracted me to 18th century work is that even these very utilitarian objects usually have a pleasing aesthetic so the look and the design of the object was part of the thought process in designing the piece . <p> Harmony : What sort of stature does the blacksmith have in town ? It sounds like he 's indispensible as a tradesman . Everybody 's got to come to him at some point for either a broken farm implement or a wagon wheel or they need an axe . What is his standing in town though ? <p> Ken : A blacksmith 's standing in a community like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to have success in the trade you have to be skilled as a workman , so I 'm sure there were blacksmiths in town that were less skilled than others . <p> In a small town the less skilled will stand out . Everybody in the town will know that he lacks in skill or organization and wo n't frequent his business as well . So somebody that has strong hand skills , strong organizational skills , and management skills could succeed very well . <p> James Anderson is an example of that . He owned several properties right in the middle of town as a blacksmith . Also status would depend somewhat on birth , and by that I mean there we many skilled slaves who were involved in trades like this and they did n't receive the economic benefits of those skills . <p> Harmony : I just learned yesterday about a skilled free black man who was Williamsburg 's blacksmith in the 19th century and he actually practiced on the opposite end of Duke of Gloucester Street from you up where Merchants Square is today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that continues through a couple of centuries , but is there a modern-day equivalent that we can look at today and say that it 's a descendant of the 18th century blacksmith trade ? <p> Ken : Well , if we look at a colonial blacksmith as a service industry doing repair and maintenance on metal work or custom manufacturer I think in 2011 you could look to a welding shop or a small machine shop as doing the same sort of work . <p> A welding shop will do a lot of repair but they also do some creative manufacture of custom pieces . That 's kind of the modern version of the colonial blacksmith . <p> Harmony : We encourage all of our guests to stop by the Anderson Blacksmith Shop and Public Armory and see all the great work that 's happening there with Ken and his <p> Website <p> Notify me when new comments are added . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you behind the scenes to meet interpreters , chefs , tradesmen , musicians , historians , curators , and more .

@@37221986 @6221986/ <p> Reading Recovery is a short-term intervention for first graders having difficulty with early reading and writing . Specially trained teachers work individually with students in daily 30-minute lessons lasting 12 to 20 weeks . Reading Recovery teachers learn how to systematically observe childrens behavior , build on the childs strengths , and select teaching moves that make it easy for children to learn . One-to-one instruction is essential to allow students to accelerate their learning and meet grade-level standard . After a full series of lessons , about 75% of these formerly lowest students reach grade-level standard . This early intervention is essential because without help , these students continue to fall behind and the achievement gap widens in later grades . Since its introduction in the U.S. in 1984 , Reading Recovery has reached more than 2 million struggling first graders with one-to-one lessons . <p> The lesson begins with something easy--reading known books . It is a time to enjoy stories and celebrate what the student already knows how to do . Your child reads 3-4 familiar books . This gives your child an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , children need to make their reading sound natural like talking , or they will not be able to understand what they read . Also , it is a time for your child to practice using some new reading strategies . The teacher does not jump in quickly to correct the child , but allows the child to use what he/she knows to be an independent reader . <p> Running Record : <p> Your child will read a book which was introduced and read once at the end of the previous days lesson . The teacher will be observing and recording the childs reading , noting errors and self-corrections . The teacher will watch to see how the child solves the tricky parts of the text and only tell words if the child is really struggling . <p> At the end of the reading the teacher will make 1 or 2 teaching points based on what she saw the child do . The teacher and child will go back to a page to look at how a problem was solved or to find a hard part to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors . It is most effective to limit the number of teaching points so your child does not feel overwhelmed and unsuccessful . Students will have other opportunities to read the text and work out more of the tricky parts in other lessons . <p> Word Work : <p> The purpose of this part of the lesson is to help your child understand how letters and words work . The focus will change over time . Initially the child may search for specific letters within a jumble of letters . ( " Find all the bs ! " or " Put the uppercase and lowercase letter pairs together . " ) Your child will work to control a consistent left-to-right orientation to letters and across words . Later your child will use the magnetic letters to break known words into familiar parts . Understanding how words can be taken apart and how the parts in one word look and sound like parts in other words , helps students use what they know to solve new words in reading and writing . <p> Writing : <p> The student will compose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a springboard . The teacher and student work on writing together . There may be opportunities for any of the following : <p> Work on letter formation Fast writing of high frequency words Use of sound or letter boxes to work out the spelling of new words Use of known words to help write new ones ( can/man ) . The teacher will encourage the child to check on his/her work and develop independence in the different aspects of the writing process . <p> After the child has written a short story , the teacher will copy a sentence on to a strip of paper and cut it up for the child to put back together . This activity helps a child pay attention to the order of words , sequence of letters , and the way language is recorded in print . <p> Introduction of New Text : <p> Each day a new book is introduced to your child . Together , the teacher and student look through the book to get the meaning of the story , try out new language structures and vocabulary , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child does a first reading of the new book . During this reading , the teacher offers support as needed . This support will look different in different lessons based on the students reading behavior . If the student gets stuck , the teacher may prompt the student to try a strategy . The teacher encourages the child to search print and pictures , reread , discover how words look , problem solve , check his/her reading , self correct , and enjoy the story . <p> As in the running record , some errors are ignored . This leaves some reading work for the child to try to solve independently on the next days running record .

In the mid-unit assessment , students will read a new excerpt of " If , " analyze how that stanza contributes to the overall meaning of the poem , determine a theme communicated in that stanza , and compare and contrast how that theme is communicated in Bud , Not Buddy . In the second half of Unit 2 , students return to a close reading of the novel as they prepare to write a literary argument essay about the nature of " Buds Rules .

@@37222004 @6222004/ <p> Harmony Hunter : Hi , welcome to the podcast . I 'm Harmony Hunter . Colonial Williamsburg 's Historic Area is alive with working tradesmen and women who practice 18th-century trades every day . Among them is Ramona Vogel , who is a cooper . A barrel might seem like a simple enough object , but she 's worked for years to master the trade . Ramona , thank you for being here . <p> Ramona : The cooper 's trade is such an important trade in our past and history that 's really pretty much been forgotten unless you 're in anything still dealing with spirits , wine and that industry . But it was so much a part of everyday life as well as the economy , mercantile system overall . Because a cooper is the one who 's going to be making all the barrels for shipping all of your different goods . Not just beer and wine and spirits like we tend to think of it today , but all of your food products . <p> So here in Virginia in the 18th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing here and shipping back to England , some of that wheat being ground into flour , of course tobacco , we all talk about tobacco here quite a bit . All those are being put into casks that are made by a cooper and shipped back . Then all the stuff we 're importing : china , shoes and hats and glassware . All of that stuff would be coming in different sized barrels . <p> Harmony : You mentioned a whole lot of things that are shipped in barrels , from wet to dry . Why barrels ? Why not crates or glass bottles for some of the liquids ? What is it about a barrel that really makes it the first choice ? <p> Ramona : Well a barrel , and of course , we do n't know who first invented it and whether it was a graduation of people that really refined it , but it is even today still considered the strongest wooden structure made by man . They 've even tested it , there 's been television shows on it where they 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosen up the hoops to see where finally that breaking point is . So it is really such a strong structure , much stronger than a box . <p> You have that continual compound arch and the pressure so you kind of think of each individual piece is a keystone . If you 're familiar with architectural language at all and how strong that structure is . And of course , the conveniences of rolling it . You do n't think about it with a box , because everything we think of today , when we 're going to have to move a bunch of stuff , you pack up your house , you put it in a box , and then it goes now into a big truck or a forklift because we have forklifts today . <p> But back then , you do n't , so you were rolling these barrels . You 're going to be unloading the ship at high tide , using gravity . Loading a ship at low tide , using pulleys , as they 've been around for a long time . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulley mechanism . So rolling it and being able to steer it because of that belly and being able to push on one side to another . So very versatile moveable container . <p> Harmony : Let 's talk about some of these , I guess they 're properly called " casks . " <p> Ramona : " Casks " is a very general term . " Barrel " is not . We tend to think about that a lot today as people come in to the shop and say , " Look at all the barrels here . " And it 's pretty rare that we actually have a barrel in the shop . We have a variety of different casks . <p> What we tend to look at today in a modern viewpoint is when we look at a container , we think of a barrel as anything that has that widest area being a belly , tapering to either end . A barrel is a size . It 's not a shape . A cask is a general term , cooperage would be a general term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , and that barrel will change . <p> You get into , we 'll say just beer size measurements . You have four standard beer measures in the 18th century , and it does vary as we move along through time . But the smallest common shipping size would be a firkin . That would ship nine gallons of beer . A kilderkin would ship 18 gallons . So it doubles . Then a beer barrel would ship 36 gallons , and a beer hogshead would ship 72 gallons . <p> So you do see a change where a hogshead of beer would ship 54 gallons , but it 's a set size . So you can see how you ca n't call a firkin a barrel , because it 's a total different size measure . So it would really mess with economic systems and what you 're getting as a consumer or as the actual merchant . <p> Harmony : Let 's talk about how you make a cask . Where does it start ? <p> Ramona : The apprenticeship still is an average of six to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to how it was back then . The big thing you 're going to learn in that apprenticeship is learning to see all those correct shapes and angles , tapers , all of that by eye . And that 's a really hard concept for us to think of , because everything 's so mechanized for us in the modern era . You plug in a few numbers , and it calculates it for you . So we do n't really think about doing things visually anymore . <p> It 's very hard for people to understand and justify that that 's really what we 're doing . But the convenience of it , if you can do that , and accomplish that skill , it 's so much faster to make that container . Because I 'll ask you . How long do you think it would take a skilled cooper to make a bucket ? <p> Harmony : A bucket . . . a week ? <p> Ramona : One hour . I mean , that 's how much more efficient it is . The week is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not surprising to me at all . But the convenience of being able to learn how to cut all those pieces , not continually having to put a different jig on a particular tool , sharpening that tool , to fit that jig and changing all of that , getting rid of all of that time and just being able to maneuver your hand and visualize what you need to cut that particular piece of wood to fit into that particular diameter of hoop . Being able to visualize that cuts down that time dramatically . <p> A big thing that 's important is you do n't cut a bunch of staves for 50 buckets . You make one bucket complete , then you make another one . So you 're not having those pieces sitting there on the chance that those shapes that you just cut are going to change and you 'll have to go back and re-cut them . So that 's one thing . <p> And even then that was the process . You make one complete , then you work on another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a cooper it is visual , as I 've mentioned . You 're going to see those correct shapes , but it 's also tactile : feeling how the wood 's cutting with that blade . I think that 's a big difference between hand tools and machinery . You 're not going to feel that same process . You 're still going to feel and hear if a machine if it 's not working , but it is different . <p> You also , when you 're working with a piece and you 're hammering those hoops on , a big trick of it is getting the ability of hearing the correct sound or pitch that it should be making if everything is fitting as it should and there is not an area that is not snug . You actually hear a different sound to it . So if , by chance , there was something you missed visually , then you should still be able to hear it . <p> Harmony : Beyond the tools of your eyes and your hands and your ears , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Ramona : We have a number of tools that are very specialized to our trade . There are about two dozen tools that we 'll use in the process . There are definitely ones that we use more often than others . I would say the most common tools that we 're going to be using are going to be the drawknives . <p> There are three different drawknives that we use . We use a drawknife called a backing knife , and that 's used for shaping the back of the stave , cutting that arc shape into it . You have a hollowing knife which is going to cut the concave shape on the interior of the stave . You 're also going to use a jointed plane which is going to cut the angle and taper on either side . That is a stationary plane . As far as I know we 're the only trade that used a stationary plane in this period of time . It was n't until later that electric joiners come about , which , a cooper 's joiner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we move the piece of wood across it . So we 're different in that aspect . <p> The other drawknife I had n't mentioned is a heading knife that 's used for cutting when we 're making what we call the heads . But nobody understands that so I 'll change that terminology . When you 're making the bottoms , or tops , or lids . That is another drawknife that 's used . So there is the three . <p> A cooper 's hammer is a little different than a blacksmith hammer . A cooper 's hammer is typically going to be a little heavier because the work that we do and the metalwork that we do is cold work . It is not heated . Then it 's just also the weight of the hammer we 're using for hammering the hoops on so tight . So it is a versatile tool throughout the process . It has a straight peen on it as well , so it 's a little different than a blacksmith 's hammer . <p> Then we have something called a driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hoop and that 's the driver that you actually hammer onto with your cooper 's hammer . Then you have , there 's a number of tools . Another tool a lot of people hear about is a tool called a croze , and that 's c-r-o-z-e . That 's used for cutting the groove in the bottom . That 's how the bottom fits into place . That 's how that 's fitting into that groove . So that 's a tool very specific to our trade . <p> A cooper 's broadaxe is different than a hewing axe or other broadaxes in other trades . It 's off-center and it 's at a taper . We 'll rough out those staves before we take them to the joiner plane . So there 's a number of tools that I 've touched on , but those are the ones that we use quite frequently and have to be used through each process . <p> Harmony : One of my favorite things about historic trades is how it 's an economy unto itself . You see George Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see Patrick Henry wearing the wig that was made from the wigmakers . Where throughout the town will you see the evidence of the cooper 's trade ? <p> Ramona : You will see evidence of the cooper 's trade everywhere . Every shop you go into . Sometimes you may not see it , because you 're not looking for it , but it 's there . You go into the shoemakers , they have tubs that they are putting the leather in to soften when they are making soles and working with all of this and working it to a certain shape . <p> You go into the kitchens , they 've got to wash dishes , they 've got slop buckets , they have salt tubs when they are salting meats . You go into the gunpowder magazine , they 've got all the gunpowder would have been in barrels . So you 've got cooperage all throughout the gunpowder magazine . <p> You go to any of these buildings in the Historic Area , you go into the cellars of the Governor 's Palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You go over to Great Hopes , that rural farm site , and you 're going to see tobacco hogsheads that we 've made , grain barrels that are actually filled with grain over there . <p> So there 's a number of areas , because for these trades to function , accurately to the 18th century which is what we 're all about , they need to have cooperage to do it accurately . So we 're kind of a neat trade that everybody needs our items to utilize to function accurately to the time period . It 's nice to have a sterling silver coffeepot , but not everybody needs it . It 's beautiful and it 's stunning , but not everyone needs it . Where everyone needs our stuff to function . <p> Harmony : We hope all of our listeners will make it by the coopers shop to see you and your fellow coopers making all kinds of casks . Ramona , thank you so much for being our guest today . <h> Comments <p> Hello Ramona , My ninth great grandfather , Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raised in the Mid Atlantic . We are trying to track down his parents . I had read a book from England about Coopering and it referred to a Coopers Guild started in Boston in the 1640s . Are you aware of any kind of Coopers Guild or Union that my have a listing from that far back ? Another , point of interest , there was an Edward Salter , Cooper that was hung in Williamsburg , VA with Blackbeards crew . An author named Kevin Duffus wrote a book called the Last Days of Blackbeard the Pirate . He believes Edward Salter from Bath , NC , my ninth great grandfather was the same Edward Salter on Blackbeards crew . He believes he escaped the noose and resurfaced in Bath two years after Blackbeards crew was executed . The Edward Salter in Bath signed his name Edward Salter , Cooper . He bought the Governor Eden Plantation . I contacted the JDR library in Williamsburg and requested someone who was an expert on the Blackbeards crew . Can you help me ? From : Brian Blount <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history so far back . Its clearly a colorful one ! The fine experts , researchers , and librarians at the John D. Rockefeller library are just the right people to help you identify more sources to look at . <p> There were and are no cooper+GGs guilds in the colonies or America . You might try contacting the Historical society in Boston . You might also try the guild records in England as there were guilds throughout Europe . Good hunting ! <p> I 'd like to clarify that I have never stated that the cooper Edward Salter " escaped the noose . " That notion was expressed by a news reporter for the Washington Daily News . The records are very clear that Edward Salter and the other former members of Black Beards crew who were not present at the battle at Ocracoke on Nov. 22 , 1718 , and who were arrested at Bath , NC , two weeks later , were eligible , and received , the gracious pardon of George I ( the second pardon issued in 1718 ) , and the men were released . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Hi Romona , My name is Yurelle Cooper my friends and I were wondering If you lived as a cooper was your Job as difficult as it sounds ?

Are there people who still work as a cooper with apprentinces in the future ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> Cooper Ramona Vogel tells us , " We do n't  have a size of barrel for shipping china at this time . We have seen references to shipping china in barrels , but no size was listed . We also see china shipped in crates and packed in tea . " <p> Journeyman Cooper Jonathan Hallman adds , " China was not necessarily imported in barrels . If you ordered a tea service , it might well come in a crate , packed in straw or cloth . In the case of bulk shipment , I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel . " <p> My friend Nan who is a descendant of Captain Starbuck , recalls her great grandmother having barrels of china from the shipping trade in her attic .. and if a plate broke the children were sent to the attic to get another plate from the barrel . <p> There was also a sunken river boat near Kansas City MO that was excavated in a farmers corn field . The boat was shipping all sorts of things in barrels glass and china included . Barrels were used for shipping the cargo that also held jarred pickles , rubber boots.I think it sunk around 1854 . You can find it on line . <p> My name is Martin Cooper . I have been the cooper here at the Louisiana Renaissance Festival for 13 seasons now .
