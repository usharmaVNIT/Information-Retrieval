No matter what your specific degree of affection for the animal world , every human on earth has an animal spirit guide ( except for Cubans ) . Animal spirit guides , also called power animals , animal totems and fuzzy buddies , are animals that are spiritually and emotionally connected to us . <p> Different people have different animal spirit guides . The type of animal that walks in your shadow ( not literally ) bestows upon you unique natural powers that may help you adapt to new surrounding , become leader of the pack , or bite the heads off of all of those who oppose you ( literally ) . <p> Chances are , you have already thought of an animal that you want to be your animal guide ( its a shark , right ? ) . Well , think again , buddy , because I 've got news for you " you do n't  choose your animal spirit guide . It chooses you ! You cant just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be just like them " dominant , cunning and completely hairless . " <p> That 's just not how it works . Unfortunately , you have to wait for your spirit animal to come to you . Luckily , there are a couple ways to bait your spirit animal out of hiding so that it will reveal itself to you . According to the Native Americans , the first to harness the power of spirit animals , there are two ways to effectively find your animal spirit guide : <p> The most ideal way to find your spirit animal guide is through intense meditation . Start by journeying deep into the forest , desert or produce section of your grocery store . Then , draw a circle around you and bless the area with a sacred medicine , such as healing sage , soothing mint leaves or tough actin Tinactin . Sit in the middle of the circle and meditate . Breathe deeply , in and out . Clear your mind completely and open your heart . <p> After a period of time " from several hours to several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit animal coming to greet you ( or possibly the produce manager telling you the store is closing ) . Your spirit animal will speak with you . However , unless you speak Wolf ( or whatever ) you wo n't understand a thing the animal is saying . That is okay , though , because you have found your spirit animal and soon it will teach you how to speak in howls , meows , chirps or ca-caws so that it may guide you in your daily life . <p> Alternatively , if you do n't  feel like meditating , you can probably just open up a zoology book or something and stop on a random page . Then , you could pick the animal on that page that you like the best , and maybe that can be your animal spirit guide . <p> Once you have found your spirit animal , it is important to connect with it so that it can more easily guide your path . Learn everything you can about it " what it eats , special skills , life cycles , its baby making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get close to your spirit animal in the physical world . For example , if your animal is a forest creature , go camping and gain reverence for the forest . Or , if your animal is a bird , build a nest out of twigs and stones and put it in a tree . Then , sit in the nest for a few days ( naked ) , grooming yourself with a papier mache beak and incubating the eggs you bought from the supermarket . <p> After you gain a better understanding of your spirit animal , it will help guide you spiritually , mentally and sexually . Eventually , you will achieve your full potential and you and your spirit animal will become one . At such a time , you will transform into a superior half-man , half beast transmorph that possesses the power to both drive a car AND rip the flesh from an antelope through sheer force . <p> The cat is a messenger , and it is telling you to STAY AWAKE during meditation . I apologize , this is likely my fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not take your bed with you into the jungle , desert or produce department . It may be more comfortable , but it invites items of failure such as sleep and house cats . <p> I agree . I was disappointed to read the jokes . I came onto this site with intentions to learn from it , but its hard to take seriously when it does n't  seem to have been serious at all . Sorry , but this seemed more like a bad joke than an informative how to on the matter . I 'm not taking anything from this . <p> I might try this , if I have time . My friend wants to take me camping , as I have n't before , so I think that will be a good time . I sure hope its a wolf !

Its mainly genetics . <p> You cant just add up all of the risk factors and that is how much your life will be shortened . The fact is , a lot of these risk factors occur together at the same time in people .

My parents taught me all those basic life skills . I had a home ec class in the sixth grade and the only thing I remember from it is making a felt envelope/purse thing . I remember cooking ranges being in the room , but not using them . That 's my story .

Kids go hungry ALL THE TIME . Seriously , I guarantee that 1 in 5 kids are not getting fed properly . And the ones that are well off enough to eat regularly often eat garbage that messes up their health and their brain . <p> Then there 's simple neglect , which perfectly good people have no choice but to do since they need to work and cant afford proper care . And not to mention how often parents find themselves in a pinch and not having a someone to watch their kids in an emergency ( not everyone has a support network ) . <p> And kids would benefit from having that much more social interactions , which they 're clearly being deprived of thanks to helicopter parenting and media hysteria . <p> Now , what 's that Republicans ? Cost you say ? Well , how much would this REALLY cost ? <p> For one , the buildings are already there anyway , so its really just food , staff , power , and insurance . <p> And for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the long run it would SAVE us money . Imagine how much we would be saving on court and prisons when kids have the proper supervision and mentoring . And then the court costs of DHS cases that can be alleviated by parents that just needed a place for their kid for a little while . Then there 's that much less medical issues with kids being properly cared for . Oh , and of course emergency room visits would drop ( which by the way drive up the costs of health care as a whole ) . <p> Then thirdly ( and mainly ) , who cares what it costs ? It costs , what it costs . Taking care of children should NOT be a luxury . We , as a nation , should be ashamed that children shelters need to panhandle to big businesses so that they donate expired food and faulty products which they in turn deduct it from their taxes . OR they 're run by religious institutions that force their religion on the kids , regardless of what religion they are . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much . I have always been a mamas boy , I am not ashamed of that . Maybe your argument is that if we start since the kids are small they will consider this the norm and will not be bothered by it , however I just cant see how it can be good to weaken the bond between parent and kid . But I think that is just my own selfishness and you should n't take it in consideration unless you think the same . However , in my fifteen years old of my life , I 've got do admit that this was a great idea and if not by the opinion I stated previously , I would be completely in favor of it , maybe not as a 24 hours thing , but more like mornings and the afternoons . Leaving the night ( when the parents are home ) to the kids enjoy their family . because they 're worried about us when we are little kids and maybe ditching lunch is already something they will miss us for . And just for the heck of it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and cared by personnel are at a higher risk of poor physical and psychological development . They are more likely to be abused and to abuse . They are more likely to end up in prison or on well-fare . They are also at risk of dealing with physical and mental problems and substance abuse . And the earlier they were institutionalized , the worse . <p> And it is not about money , its about attachment . To develop properly children need a stable caregiver with a special relationship to them . In other words kids need parents not staff . <p> Studies show that any parent ( as long as they do n't  abuse or severely neglect ) is better than no parent . <p> I am talking about large group homes not foster care ( I now see that in the States you call both fostering ) . Foster parents are parents . Kids in foster homes ( if they are not too many ) do better than kids from group homes ( " orphanages " ) . They are not necessarily placed there because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid is placed there the worse the outcomes . They have never been abused by their parents . Their problem is that they have never had a real relationship with a parental figure . If they are adopted early enough they can overcome the adverse effects , but the more time they spend there the harder it gets . <p> And if the cost is no issue then why do n't  you invest those money to support the parents so that they could afford proper care . Better child support , free daycares , kindergartens , payed parental leaves , summer schools etc. are all better options . <p> There are a lot of orphanages in Africa and India , but very few or none at all in Scandinavian countries I doubt that the reason is that the latter do n't  spend enough money on welfare . <p> And if you just mean some kind of free boarding schools , as you clarify below , OK , but I still think that if you HAVE to send your kid away there is some kind of problem you are either not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own .

Come on all in all this ENTIRE thing made me laugh &amp; smh <p> I am absolutely stupefied my all of the people out there who find this racist . How come its considered not politically correct to call someone black but its completely okay to call us white . If you can call us by the color of our skin then why cant we call you by the color of yours ? I just do n't  understand the logic . Is it because of the fact that your ancestors got segregated against decades ago and were treated completely unfairly , cause last time I checked that happened to them , not you . I understand that there are still racist people out there , but you are n't  getting treated as badly as they did .

Nevertheless these are just coincidences except the discounted black dolls . Black dolls do n't  sell as well because black children see them as bad or ugly . And its perfectly fine to call black people , black people . Its a widely accepted term over African American because all black people are African American but not all African Americans are black . Good hearted people will see were all human beings and were individuals . <p> Your statement that " All black people are African Anerican " is false .

" And with a range of 40,000 kilometers , there 's enough distance in these suckers to get you pretty much anywhere you want to go . <p> *Correct me if I 'm wrong , Star Trek fans . <p> LONG ... <p> 2 . Star Wars Walkers <p> Fuel source : Fuel cells <p> As seen in : Star Wars <p> Unlike landspeeders and other planet-based Star Wars vehicles that rely on traditional combustion engines , the AT-AT and AT-ST Walkers functioned on fuel cells . Both these modes of transport benefit from exceptional exterior armor and blaster weaponry . With the ability to carry 40 stormtroopers , the AT-AT is the futures badass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office , you 'll want to invest in the 2-seater AT-ST . <p> With the ability to withstand bullet blasts , rockets , torpedoes and other forms of damage , Tony Starks iron suit is oodles more safe than your average minivan . Add in its supreme versatility of being able to fly , swim underwater and soar through outer space , and the Iron Man suit is a family-friendly vehicle that both moms and kids can agree on . <p> I 'm just taking a guess here but is n't Iron Mans suit ( movie based fact ) powered by the Arc Reactor in his chest ? Its supposedly the only reactor with enough power to power the suit . If I remember correctly that 's why Jeff Bridges character stole his arc reactor in the first film .

@@13832690 @2432690/ <h> How To Survive Being Eaten By A- Whale <p> Oh , those pesky whales . It seems us land mammals cant swim more than three feet in the ocean without encountering one of these giant , gentle beasts . With such an overpopulation of whales these days , its no wonder marine biologists frequently and candidly refer to them as " the rats of the sea . " <p> While whales rarely mean to cause harm to us humans , the sad fact is that they are just too hungry ( and stupid ) for their own good . What with the constant skimming for krill , its no wonder those bumbling sacks of blubber swallow an estimated 5 million people each year . <p> Do these people die once swallowed ? Some do , yes . But others , such as Jonah from the Bible or Pinocchio from the Koran , survive comfortably and live to tell the tale . While these heroes only survived in a whale for a few days , long-term survival is also possible ( example : I once successfully dodged the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , if you ever find yourself eye-to-eye with a whale , take a few tips from the expert ( i.e. me ) , and you 'll likely emerge unscathed . <p> Get Swallowed Whole <p> Living inside a whale is hard enough as it is . Suffering a lost limb , open gash or decapitated head upon entry will certainly make survival a bit more difficult . Because of this , when encountering a whale , experts agree that curling up into a tight ball is the best course of action . That way , when swallowed , you will minimize the surface area of your body that might become crushed or caught on one of the whales many giant , jagged teeth . <p> Avoid The Whales Stomach Acid <p> Like most animals , the whales stomach contains a noxious concoction of highly acidic bile . Let the bile come in contact with your body for too long , and oops , you 've been digested ( and later , turned into poop ! ) . Do n't  let the whale win like this " as soon as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bile and into a floating piece of wreckage . Whales swallow tons of junk everyday , so there will be plenty of items to choose from " rowboats , the crows nest from a pirate ship , a sailors coffin that was thrown overboard ( tip : dump the sailors rotting corpse overboard for extra room ) . <p> Do n't  Worry About Oxygen <p> Some people think that all those noxious fumes in the stomach might be poisonous if inhaled . While this might be true if swallowed whole by another animal , as cartoons have taught us , a whales stomach is inexplicably linked directly to the mammals blowhole , for some reason . As such , plenty of fresh oxygen will get circulated throughout your new home . <p> Catch Food To Eat <p> I hope you like eating krill , because that 's what 's going to be served at Chez Whale for breakfast , lunch and dinner . Use a fishnet to skim these little crustaceans out of the bile and into your makeshift life raft . <p> Pass The Time <p> Once you 've attended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next biggest concern : dying of boredom . If you planned ahead , hopefully you brought along some coloring books or something to keep you busy . If not , you might try using the bones of fish and dead sailors to put on a puppet show . Or , try using a wooden plank to see how fast you can row around the circumference of the stomach . Then , try to beat your record ! <p> Escape From the Whales Stomach ( Optional ) <p> No matter how much fun you 're having in the whales stomach , eventually you 'll probably begin to miss things like eating beef , watching sunsets , discussing the weather with acquaintances , and walking . Here are a few ways to end your captivity and get back to the " real " world : <p> Like Geppetto , you can start a campfire and force the whale to sneeze you out <p> Pinocchio does n't  matter anything with Koran ! Its a tale wrote from Carlo Collodi ( nom de plum of Carlo Lorenzini , 1826-1890 ) , Italian writer and journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have wanted to be eaten by something . I wanted to be eaten by a whale but I did n't  think I would survive and live to tell the tale but thanks for the info on it now I can do it and live to tell the tale . U should come with . I have been wondering If u would water went to the stomach if you have a iPhone or iPod you should kik me . My name is gooch42 thanks again . P.s. comment back . Bye <p> I remember when I was in Middle/High school and I would get eaten by whales on purpose when my Lame parents would n't let me do/have cool things like a pair of British Knights shoes , or let me go to a Milli Vanilli concert . I 'd go hide out in a whale for a few months , theyd freak out/call the cops/ etc. , etc. and I 'd show back up later , and my Parents would forgive me , I 'd get a couple of book/movie deals , Free Nikes and Swatches , get to bang some exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal and morning show interviews . Getting swallowed by a whale literally solves all your problems , I highly recommend it . 
@@13832693 @2432693/ <h> How To Dispose of a Dead Body <p> First-degree murder . Someday it will be legal ( God willing ) , but for now , us " outlaws " have to keep things on the down low . Let me guess , right now you 've got an ex-loved one dead on the ground behind you ( its your wife , is n't it ? ) and you 're struggling to keep all that blood on your hands from getting all over the computer keyboard . <p> I bet you thought the hard part was over . Well think again , buddy , because no matter what your motive for revenge ( wifey was gon na call the cops , was n't she ? ) , now you 've got a big , heavy body to dispose of . And guess what ? That cumbersome pile of flesh and bones is gon na start smelling pretty foul any minute now . <p> Youve got to get rid of that body fast . And if you want to get away with your " crime " so you can enjoy your newfound freedom , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is n't your cocker spaniels dog poop were talking about here " you cant just throw it onto the neighbors lawn and expect the problem to disappear on its own . You need a plan . To help out , here are some of the best ways to dispose of a dead body : <p> Dump the body in the woods : Our nations wooded areas are riddled with dead bodies . And why not ? Dense forests provide plenty of cover during the actual burial . Plus , the body is unlikely to be found , because very few people go digging random holes in the middle of the forest ( unless they 're burying a body , in which case , you probably wo n't have to worry about them alerting the authorities ) . <p> Bury the body at your house : If you 're worried of being caught red-handed out there in the real world , use your own property to bury the body . That backyard rose garden is a perfect place to hide a body ( bonus : human bodies make great fertilizer " those roses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If you 've got nosy neighbors , then bury the body in the basement or encase it behind a bedroom wall . If you choose the latter , be sure to stock up on Febreze " that decomposing body is gon na get pretty rank . <p> Roll the body up in a carpet and throw it off a bridge : Got blood all over your tiger-skin rug ? Kill two birds with one stone and throw the evidence and the deceased off a nearby bridge at the same time . Tip : choose a bridge that 's over a body of water . That freeway overpass may look convenient , but when that rug starts blocking up traffic below , someone will eventually look inside of it . <p> Chop the body into little pieces : Bodies are harder to identify when only partial remains are found . Make the cops work for that positive identification by dumping various parts of the body throughout the nearby city and countryside . Good places to drop body parts include dumpsters , lakes and the rental return box at Blockbuster . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a few barrels of sulfuric acid lying around ( and who does n't  these days ? ) , you can get rid of the remains altogether by dissolving it . Be sure to place the body in a container that the acid ca n't eat through . After neutralizing the acid , ideas for getting rid of the sludgy remains of the body include flushing it down the toilet , pouring it down a storm drain , or baking it into banana bread and feeding it to your enemies . <p> funny , but missing a lot of important details , for instance , you cant just put a body in a wall , the moisture and decomposing flesh will smell and cause mold , at least blead the body in a plastic lined bath tub w/ a pipe lining the drain as to not leave bloody evediance everywhere also cut it into managable pieces . not to mention that you downplayed the smell factor way to much , It reaks ! ! ! and for a long time too , anyonee that enters your house will know exactily what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is put the body in a lot of concreate , and making a concreat wall takes time , na , the best thing is to make a hole in the floor , fill it 1/4 of the way with concreate , let it dry . take the pieces out of the deep freeze and put them in the hole and fill the rest of the way . this should avoied that sickly sweet smell from lofting through your walls and into tour house , but the body is doomed for discovery at that point as houses get old , they fall apart and need renovations with time or accedents happen , floods , watterlines , fires , etc . Next is the rug over a bridge concept , again , funny , that part about not thowing it onto a highway , but not very helpfull to someone with a problem , Right ? ? ? seariously flawed , first a rug is a bad idea even if you duct tape it closed , ure a non bioderatable heavy thick sinthetic sacks , again cut the body into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacke w/a counter waight. punch a few small holes into the sack so the air can escape . this will prevent the sacks from floating . put all thies sacks into onre air tight sack ( for transport ) then freese them while you go rent a boat , adwayt drop them in the ocean , less chance anyone will smell the escaping gasses also its deeper and they wont wash up on shore . <p> hay man , somtimes people need help , and giving them veuge information with all sorts of falicies attached to hummoris but half truth information can get them to trouble . and if someone gets in trouble because of what you told them you do n't  think they might be mad after thinking about it in a cell for 20 years . <p> A hogpin full of hungry hogs will totally devour a body or bodies in less than 24hrs. , make sure the pin is on your property . Hogs are the only species on the north american continent that have molers that will crush bone into a fine powder , very effcient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no worries ! ! ! ! ! <p> or you can just bath the body in liquid nitrogen and it will freeze like glass then you have nice statue unless its covered in blood which in that case you go into the garage and get a sledgehammer and make a huge pile of dust . <p> There is lake between the us and canada that is owned by no one so you can dump the dead body or bodies there and not have the lake be searched . My teacher told me this soooo.have fun going to the us and canada border <p> the best why to get rid of a body is to past the blame on to someone else . plant blood , hair and pictures your enemy home . when the person leaves go in the back door , brake in then find spare keys then wait a month , kill the person some where you can hide the body safely for a day or two . then take blood , hair , and pictures of the person you killed plant them in your enemy home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sim. get someone else to call the police and tell them you thing some one has been attacked . when the police come to the house and do a search they will find blood hair and picture in that house thinking that are friend . and so the person will get the blame . problem solved . but this plan will need more planing to make sure you get away with it . Good luck . : 0 ) <p> First , be smart from the very beginning . Pulverize all teeth , burn off fingerprints , and disfigure the face . Forcing a DNA test to establish identity ( if it ever comes to that ) might introduce the legal/forensic hurdle that saves your ass down the line . An unidentifiable body can , in a pinch , be dressed in thrift store clothes and dropped in a bad part of town where the police are less likely to question it . I do n't  reommend that disposal method , I 'm just saying an easily identifiable body is an even bigger threat than the opposite . <p> Assuming you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a bit , the first thing you want to do is drain it of fluids . This will make it easier to cut up , and slow decomposition a little bit . The best way to do this quick and dirty is to perforate the body with a pointed knife , and then perform CPR on it . Cut the fronts of the thighs deep , diagonally , to slit the femoral arteries . Then pump the chest . The valves in the heart will still work when dead , and the springback of the ribcage can put apply a fair amount of suction to the artria . Do this in a tub . Plug the drain , and mingle lots of bleach with the bodily fluids before unplugging the drain to empty the tub . This should help control the stench of death , which would otherwise reek from your gutter gratings . Do everything you can to control odors . Plug in an ionizer , burn candles , leave bowls of baking soda everywhere . Ventilate the room in the middle of the night , but otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet while its in the tub . <p> If you want to bury , I recommend seperating the body into several parts , and burying them seperately . For one thing , its easier to dig a deep enough hole for a head than for an entire body . this reduces your chances of being discovered while you are actually outside and digging the grave . That is the one thing you cant do inside the doors of your house , and represents a vulnerable moment you want to keep brief , under 2 hours . Do it between 3 and 5 am . Its also less likely for someone to call the police if their dog digs up some chunk of meat , than if they dig up an enitre body . They may assume its an animal carcass disfigured by decomposition , and leave it alone or dispose of it . Its also more likely that the dog will consume all of it before anyone knows the difference . A whole skeleton is another story . You can cut a body into 6 pieces faster than you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it takes more work , a big knife , and time . A hammer will be useful for pulverizing joints or driving the knife deep where it does n't  want to go . Anyway its wise to crush as much of the skeleton as you can along the way . It will aid in making the body less identifiable for what it is as it decomposes . <p> Do n't  return to the same site 6 times for 6 burials.Youll attract suspicion from anyone nearby , and you 'll wind up placing the body parts close enough together to be found by any serious investigation . Put them in plastic bags with lots of bleach , and store in a freezer until you have enough time to bury them all . <p> Depending on what tools you have available , you may find that you 're get really good at deconstructing the body . You might prefer to slowly sprinkle it down a drain without leaving your house . This avoids the long-term risk of discovery associated with burial , and the overwhelming supply of bacteria in a sewer accellerates deconomposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truly grinding down a body takes a lot more work , and you run the risk of fouling your plumbing and calling in a plumber . So do n't  try it unless you know how to clear bones and meat out of a drainpipe . A good food processor can be useful . But do n't  over-use it , or power drills or saws . Theyre noisy and they attract attention . And forget the kitchen sink . Its better if you actually remove one of the toilets in your house from its base , which will give you direct access to one of the largest sewer pipes that enters your house . Follow any disposals with lots of bleach and then run the water for 5 or 10 minutes on top of that . And plug that pipe when you 're not using it , to prevent any sewer gasses from backing up into your house . Usually , a U-trap inside the toilet does that for you . <p> Well for starters , you have to not leave blood any where its hard to get out of carpets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all fake ha.ha.hanervous laughjk guys jk But if any of you are seriousThats some messed up poop <p> Haha brilliant ideas . But you forgot one . Cover them in concrete , do some nice artwork on them when the concrete sets and stick them on a pllnth out on your lawn . Of course you might need a block and pulley to get them erected out there , or a small crane ( hired one is a good idea ) They can stay there for a long time , and if you get them in the right position they can even hold a birdbath ! <p> Thank goodness I came across this site . Did n't  know what to do with my friends body after I accidentally killed him when he was helping me do some electrical wiring in the basement of my house . I guess you should say " All clear ! " when you 're turning the juice back on . Thanks to you problem solved and it was easier than I thought it would be . Who says you cant learn new things on the internet.
