@@37861980 @6861980/ <h> A tale of two sanctuary cities : Texas and California setting trends in immigration policy <p> by Leandra Bernstein <p> FILE - In this Friday , July 8 , 2016 file photo , Texas Gov . Greg Abbott , right , responds to questions during a news conference at City Hall in Dallas . Abbott says he 'll work with top conservatives to try to remove from office sheriffs across his state who refuse to enforce federal immigration law . It 's the latest sign that Abbott is moving hard to the right and more closely tracking the new Trump administration , which is plotting ways to crackdown on immigration . ( AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez , File ) <p> Since President Donald Trump signed his January executive order threatening to cut off certain federal funds to sanctuary cities , statehouses across the country have been racing in two different directions with new legislation that either follows the president 's tough policy or bills that defy federal immigration enforcement and defend sanctuary cities . <p> Texas took the first major step in the direction of tougher immigration enforcement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a controversial bill that will require all Texas cities and counties to comply with federal immigration laws and immigration detainer requests or face harsh penalties . <p> This latest action in Texas could make the state a standard bearer for other statehouses considering more stringent enforcement of federal immigration laws . But it also comes at a time of a strong countervailing trend in states like California , where lawmakers and immigration advocates are fighting to keep sanctuary policies in tact and block the efforts of the federal government to cut off funding . <p> Among the measures that will go into effect in Texas beginning on September 1 , are subjecting local officials , including lawmakers , sheriffs and police chiefs to misdemeanor charges and jail time for not cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) immigration detainer requests , in other words , improperly shielding illegal immigrants wanted by federal authorities . They can also face fines as high or fines as high as $25,500 . The bill also allows police to question a person 's immigration status during routine stops , a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement officials up in arms . <p> In the hours after the bill was signed , lawsuits were initiated on both sides . On Monday , the League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ) filed suit , calling into question the constitutionality of the provision that allows police to demand immigration papers during a routine encounter . <p> The state of Texas fired back with its own lawsuit preemptively asking the Western District Court of Texas to rule that the new law does not violate constitutional protections against undue search and seizure or the right to equal protection against discrimination , legal questions that the state anticipates from opponents of the law . <p> The lawsuit is being brought against prominent supporters of sanctuary policies including Sheriff Sally Hernandez of Travis County , Austin Mayor Steve Adler and all City Council members , and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund . <p> Mayor Adler 's spokesman , Jason Stanford was somewhat puzzled by the preemptive lawsuit , saying the state Attorney General Ken Paxton was essentially " accusing the mayor and others of violating a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city of Austin has seen a chilling effect as a result of the passage of SB-4 , Stanford explained , with members of the Hispanic community " measurably less interactive " with police officers . " They are less likely report crime , less likely to step up as witnesses because ICE had grabbed people at our courthouse , " he said . " It 's all part of the same culture of fear and confusion that is making our city less safe . " <p> Even as supporters of the bill celebrated its passage as a victory for the rule of law and public safety , members of the law enforcement community have emerged as some of the toughest critics . San Antonio Police Chief William McManus spoke on behalf of his colleagues throughout the state of Texas in saying that the law " will instill a lot of fear " and could deter individuals from cooperating with the police . <p> " There is nothing positive that this bill does in the community or in law enforcement , " the police chief asserted . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other statehouses fighting to impose tougher penalties on sanctuary jurisdictions . According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , there are dozens of pending sanctuary city bills pending in statehouses across the country , many proposing to suspend state funding for jurisdictions or educational institutions that fail to comply with federal immigration enforcement . <p> According to Ira Mehlman , communications director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , Texas is a leader among the states who want to enforce federal immigration laws and could set a standard for states where legislation is pending . <p> " I think they are blazing the trail for other states that have been wanting to do this for a long time , " Mehlman said , noting that the new Texas law " puts teeth in anti-sanctuary policies . " <p> He also recognized the opposing trend in pro-sanctuary policies , like California 's so-called sanctuary state bill ( SB-54 ) . The bill , which passed the state Senate on April 3 , would no longer require local law enforcement to cooperate or notify federal immigration authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement from asking about an individual 's immigration status and prohibit the use of local law enforcement resources to help federal immigration enforcement . <p> " With regard to immigration , California tends to take the lead among those handful of states that want to do everything they can to impede enforcement of federal immigration laws , " Mehlman said , explaining that other states could follow as they tend to " take their cues " from California . <p> Illinois , Nevada and New York are all actively considering measures that would restrict local and state cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agencies . This can include not honoring federal immigration detainer requests that require local law enforcement to hold an arrested individual or convicted criminal until the feds can pick them up for deportation . <p> Maryland was also weighing a sanctuary state bill until lawmakers suddenly pulled the bill in April . The decision to kill the bill followed public outrage over the rape of a high school girl in Montgomery County by two men , one of whom obtained sanctuary in the state despite facing charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Montgomery County Maryland , which still maintains its sanctuary policies , faced another crisis , when an 18-year-old citizen of El Salvador was released on bond by county authorities after he stole an AR-15 assault rifle from an unmarked police car . ICE filed an immigration detainer with the county , but it was ultimately ignored . <p> " We are starting to see states and localities moving in those two directions , " said Philip Wolgin , immigration policy director at the Center for American Progress . The fight has fallen to the state level in order to " fill the vacuum " left by the federal government , which has so far failed to address comprehensive immigration reform . " Some states are taking a pro-immigrant approach and some states are taking an anti-immigrant approach , " he noted . <p> Whether California or Texas becomes the " vanguard " of immigration policy , Wolgin said , will depend on the outcomes of a host of pending legal challenges for and against sanctuary policies . <p> During his Facebook Live signing ceremony , Governor Abbott stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been tested at the United States Supreme Court and approved there . " However , Wolgin has some doubts , noting a recent Supreme Court case that could apply to the Texas bill . <p> In 2012 , the Supreme Court ruled that a number of provisions in an Arizona immigration law ( SB-1070 ) were unconstitutional , including a provision allowing local law enforcement to routinely demand individuals ' immigration papers . The court favored the Obama Justice Department in finding that that provision and others essentially usurped federal immigration enforcement authorities . <p> But with Donald Trump in office , it is unlikely Attorney General Jeff Sessions would bring a similar suit against a state that is rigorously implementing the administration 's own policy . <p> " I do n't see any inclination on the part of Jeff Sessions to bring a lawsuit against Texas , " Mehlman noted . " There 's a new administration and they are far less likely to bring a lawsuit . " <p> Trump has already indicated he is serious about enforcing the nation 's existing immigration laws and compelling local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After California District Judge William Orrick successfully blocked President Trump 's sanctuary city executive order in April , Trump took to Twitter to warn that he would take the fight all the way to the Supreme Court . <p> Even if his own executive order is tied up in court , President Trump can still wield significant influence , encouraging states to take a tougher approach to federal immigration enforcement . Trump 's Justice and Homeland Security Departments are further supporting his policy by releasing weekly statistics documenting the hundreds of declined detainers and naming the specific cities , counties and states that have refused to cooperate with the feds . <p> According to recent polls , the president 's position on sanctuary cities and the new Texas law is in step with the beliefs of the majority of Americans . According to a February poll , as many as 80 percent of American voters disapprove of sanctuary cities . The majority believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to federal authorities .

Another order calls for the creation of a task force to reduce violent crime " even though the murder rate has declined sharply in recent decades " and a third is aimed at dismantling international drug cartels . <p> Taken together the directives , announced amid a national dialogue about racial bias in policing and appropriate police use of force , suggest that the White House wants to prioritize law and order and align itself closely with local law enforcement . <p> " We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in blue need to know that we 're with them 100 percent as they patrol our streets .

Holder denied those accusations , repeatedly noting his support for the police and that his brother was a retired officer . <p> On Thursday , in response to the executive order , Holder posted on Twitter a Justice Department press release from 2011 announcing an initiative aimed at preventing police officer deaths .

Under existing law , federal prosecutors already have the ability to pursue the death penalty in cases involving the murders of law enforcement officers .

Any personnel at the school could carry a gun if they passed the appropriate training . Those people would be known as School Protection Officers . <p> Legislators proposed a similar bill in 2012 , just after the mass shooting in Newtown , Connecticut . <p> In 2013 , at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills related to arming teachers and school staff . <p> While seven states moved forward , the Palmetto State did not . <p> That 's why legislators are trying again . <p> State Representative Phillip Lowe from Florence County said since schools are known gun-free zones , that makes them targets . <p> " The people who are deranged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun-free zone , and they can inflict the most punishment on innocent people , " said Lowe . <p> If the bill becomes law , it does n't mean every district would have to take part in it . <p> " It does n't force the district to participate , and it does n't force them to take every candidate who may want to be a protection officer , " said Lowe . <p> The school boards would work with each school and choose administrators who would go through extensive training , allowing them to have a gun on school property . <p> Alan Walters , Director of Safety and Risk Management for Georgetown County Schools said the School Protection Officers would undergo the same training law enforcement goes through . However , law enforcement training is 12 weeks long , not 2 weeks . <p> " It 's a major responsibility when you 're putting a firearm in the hands of a civilian in a school .

Most law enforcement agencies do n't let officers out until they 've gone through all their training . This essentially says they can start those duties in the school while waiting for the training , " said Walters . <p> Walters is most concerned about the safety of the civilians . <p> " If an incident were to happen , an active shooter situation and you have officers converging on that school , now you have civilians who are n't in police uniforms brandishing weapons , and the cops coming in do n't know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are .

Georgetown County schools also have them in elementary schools . However , Defeo said in some cases , one just is n't enough . <p> " If you look at our real large high schools , one SRO may not do it .

A few weeks later , Chaffetz abruptly resigned from Congress . We asked the " Oversight Man " what changed his mind about being a lead watchdog with not only a GOP majority in Congress , but also a Republican in the White House . He told me it 's more a matter of what has n't changed . We started the interview with me asking how he told party leaders he was quitting . <p> Chaffetz : " I called Speaker Ryan first , and when I talked to him , he wanted to try to talk me out of it , and I interrupted him and I said , ' Paul , I 'm not asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie Chaffetz made this decision .

( AP Photo/Evan Vucci , File ) <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) " Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements , President Donald Trump 's former national security adviser , Michael Flynn , is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn 's firm sent back last year to the client . The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn 's accounts to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flynn 's company , Flynn Intel Group , told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work . But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn 's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying . <p> The difference matters because Flynn 's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional , military and intelligence inquiries . Congressional committees and the Pentagon 's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey . His firm 's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser . <p> On Monday , former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn 's misstatements about his contacts with Russia 's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail . Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin 's firm , Inovo BV , and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government . That filing " prompted by Justice Department pressure " came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post . The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia 's ambassador to the U.S. <p> The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin 's company without specifying what , if any , work was performed . <p> Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn 's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work . When Alptekin did n't see any lobbying work , he said , he asked Flynn Intel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin . <p> The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications . National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant . <p> The law " says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material , " said Stephen I. Vladeck , a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law . <p> Flynn 's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin . The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally , Alptekin 's lobbying demands , arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin 's company , Inovo BV . <p> In the filing , Flynn 's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a " consultancy fee " came from the firm 's accounting records . Similar " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team hired for the work . <p> Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin 's statements and the filing , Flynn 's attorney , Robert Kelner , said : " We 'll stick with what 's in the filing . " Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement . <p> In a brief statement Tuesday , Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work . Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel 's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error . <p> In Monday 's Senate hearing , Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D-Conn. , that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly . Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn 's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments , though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines , not prosecution . The Defense Department 's inspector general is investigating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , told the AP he had not looked into Flynn 's foreign agent disclosures but he " would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it 's necessary .

" <p> Flynn Intel 's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen , a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year 's attempted coup against him . The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey 's extradition requests . <p> It 's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance , though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump , who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers . International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab . <p> Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign agent because he says the work was n't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he does n't have any ties to Erdogan 's administration . But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey 's finance ministry . In its Justice Department filing , Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work . <p> Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations . <p> Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars , but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn 's foreign agent filing was correct . <p> Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying , public relations , research and other work . That arrangement specified Flynn 's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations , Alptekin said . <p> Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments " one in September and the other in October " as refunds , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But Flynn 's firm reported lobbying activity .
