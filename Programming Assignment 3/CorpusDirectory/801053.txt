" It does good for all the mayors of Pennsylvania , as far as boroughs go . I think we won pretty much across the board .

" To that extent , I 'm very pleased with the ruling , " he said . <p> Martin said he 'll have to spend more time reviewing the court 's opinion before deciding whether or not an appeal to the state Supreme Court is appropriate . <p> The appeals court disagreed with Varricchio about whether council has the power to throw out Harry 's suspension and reversed her decision on that front .

 The Wooden Match in Bethlehem wants to open wine bar next door <p> View full sizeA wine bar is planned for the former train cargo building next to The Wooden Match restaurant in Bethlehem . This photograph is from when the building was renovated and opened as an architect 's office in 2009 . Express-Times File Photo <p> There are new owners at Bethlehem 's The Wooden Match restaurant and they 're seeking to expand the eatery into a former architect 's office next door . <p> Steve DiDonato and Vince Randazzo were looking for space to open a wine bar in Bethlehem when they came across the former train cargo building next door to The Wooden Match , itself a former train station . The business partners loved the 140-year-old building which had been renovated extensively by former tenant George J. Donovan AIA &amp; Associates but were put off by the fact they 'd have to find a liquor license for it , which is especially expensive in Lehigh County , DiDonato said . <p> But when an offer to buy The Wooden Match and its liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect pairing . <p> " We got an opportunity to do this so we 're going to make this whole place a food , wine and beer complex , " DiDonato said . <p> DiDonato , an Upper Macungie Township resident , said he was n't looking to get back into the restaurant business after he closed Abruzzi on Main in Coopersburg in 2007 . He had transitioned into the wine system selling business but saw The Wooden Match deal as one that was too good to pass up , he said . <p> Randazzo owns Dominick 's Restaurant and Pizza and Sportsbar &amp; Grille in Quakertown , where he lives . <p> The restaurant , at 61 W. Lehigh St. , was previously The Main Street Depot restaurant . In addition to cigars , The Wooden Match is known for craft beers and upscale pub food , both of which DiDonato and Randazzo plan to continue . <p> They also want to add a new cocktail lounge in the restaurant 's basement and renovate its second floor for events and private parties , DiDonato said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open a wine bar also serving Italian meats , cheeses and other cold tapas .

Both buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places as contributing buildings in the Central Bethlehem Historic District . <p> George Donovan , an architect who serves as the historic officer for Bethlehem 's historic and architectural review board , said he was sorry to sell the cargo building last year after investing so much time in its renovation but his firm no longer needed so much space .

There were structural issues that had to be resolved in late 2011 , as well . <p> Now that it 's nearing completion , Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr . said the city 's " really happy about it , " adding that he had " felt bad for Mike " as tried for years to get the project done .

 do 's and don'ts of picking out an engagement ring <p> View full an engagement ring can be an affordable and pain-free process , if you take the right NEWS Photo <p> So you want to get married ? <p> The first step is to buy an engagement ring a process that can be just as nerve-wracking as the big day itself . <p> But there are general rules of thumb to keep in mind when picking out a ring in order to ease stress and not send your bride-to-be running for the hills . <p> Budget counts <p> Bobbi Vitko , of Sacks Jewelers in Wilson Borough , says the first step is to start with a budget . <p> " When someone comes in , one of the very first questions I ask is , ' What is your budget ' ? " says . " It 's about finding out what they want that 's in their budget . We try to educate them as much we can . " <p> says diamonds have become more affordable in the past 10 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as challenging as it seems . " Diamonds are a lot less complicated than people think , " Vitko says . <p> Elaine Smith , vice president of sales for Freeman Jewelers , has spent the last 37 years working in the jewelry business . She says the industry standard of spending the equivalent of three months salary on an engagement ring has gone out the window . " People spend what they feel comfortable , " Smith says . <p> The rarity factor of a diamond also plays a part in the overall price , Smith says . " Larger diamonds are rarer and harder to find , " Smith says . " Men are usually concerned with the quality of the diamond . Women are more concerned with the size of the diamond . " <p> Four Cs <p> The four " Cs of jewelry " cut , clarity , carat and color can play a part in a customer 's decision . <p> " What a diamond is all about is beauty , " Smith says , adding that the " four Cs " determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most important of the four . <p> " If cut properly , it will be brilliant and return the maximum amount of light to the eye of the beholder , " Smith adds . <p> Thomas R. Anderko , owner of Musselman Jewelers in Bethlehem , adds that the cut enables the diamond to make the best use of light . He says the clarity will determine the value for your money . <p> " Diamonds , like prisms , can reflect the colors of the rainbow , " he says . " There are different grades on the color scale and are intrinsic to the value of the diamond . " <p> In terms of clarity , Smith says the difference in clarity could mean hundreds , or thousands , of dollars . <p> " Some people think they need the highest clarity grades , " Smith says . " More important is that it sparkles and it 's the color you like .

" If you know who you 're dealing with , you ca n't go wrong . " <p> Smith concurs . " Find somebody who can walk you through the process of how diamonds are priced , " Smith says . <p> Smith and Vitko agree that buying a ring from a jeweler , in a store , is a safer bet than ordering a ring online . " I would say , personally , I would n't buy anything online without seeing it , " Vitko says . <p> Smith adds that she often sees customers come in " buying a piece of paper " - with their choices pre-picked instead of actually looking at the rings . " It 's like picking a wife from the description on a driver 's license ; two women who have blond hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely different , " Smith says . <p> Details such as the size of a diamond can often be skewed by looking at pictures online rather than holding them in your hand or looking at them in a display case . <p> " Buying a diamond sight unseen on the Internet , there are so many factors that go into it , " Smith says . <p> The setting of the diamond is also important in the decision-making process , Smith says . <p> " Right now a style that is very popular is micro pave ; there are a million different versions , " Smith says of the different band styles . " It 's when little tiny diamonds are set into gold , in addition to the center diamond . It 's problematic because the little diamonds fall off . " <p> Smith suggests sticking with a setting that is a little simpler , such as having diamonds in addition to the center diamond set in a prong or channel . <p> " People expect to wear them every day .

 's death prompts review of underground fraternities <p> View full sizeThe Kirby House is reflected in the glass exterior of Lafayette College 's David Bishop Skillman Library . Everett Glenn , inset , was found unresponsive in the Kirby House residence Hall and was pronounced dead at Easton Hospital . Express-Times File Photo <p> The springtime death of Lafayette College freshman Everett Glenn could lead the college to make major reforms in policies dealing with underground fraternities . <p> Glenn , 19 , died in his dorm room after drinking alcohol supplied to him by people who , in the words of Easton police Lt. Matt Gerould , " were formerly of on-campus fraternities that were not on campus anymore . " <p> According to a Dec. 5 memo to Lafayette College faculty , several " underground selective membership organizations " exist in violation of campus policies , and the members of an unrecognized organization were involved in Glenn 's May 5 birthday death during All-College Day celebrations . <p> The organizations being discussed are not legally operating Greek organizations , such as recognized fraternities and sororities . Rather , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , having been suspended from the college for violations of college policy , circumvent those sanctions by organizing and operating unrecognized chapters at the college . " <p> There are four currently recognized fraternities and six recognized sororities on campus . <p> " The College has no interest in restricting the rights of students to associate freely , " Clow said in an email . <p> Unrecognized Greek organizations , however , " may undermine the efforts of the recognized fraternities and sororities to operate according to community standards , and may place the health and safety of students at risk , " Clow said . <p> In the last 20 years , nine fraternities have closed , according to Clow . One closed due to low membership , while the other eight closed in the wake of disciplinary action or after being threatened with disciplinary hearings , Clow said . <p> He did not reply to an email asking if the college believes any of those organizations are now functioning against college policy , or how many underground organizations may exist . <p> Attempts to reach Glenn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There 's clear circumstantial evidence that Everett was participating in a recruiting event for an organization that had lost its charter a year ago , " Weiss told the student newspaper .

Express-Times File Photo SUE BEYER <p> Kappa Delta Rho , a national fraternity , revoked the charter for the Lafayette chapter in June 2011 after a series of poor behavior . <p> KDR National Executive Director Joseph Rosenberg said he can not confirm or deny whether former members of the fraternity are continuing to act as KDR members at Lafayette . <p> He expressed sympathy for the Glenn family but also could n't say whether those with Glenn the day he died called themselves members of the fraternity . <p> That 's because Lafayette has refused to give his organization a list of students they believe might be acting as a rogue group , he said . <p> " The president has yet to tell us who was involved so we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are men of membership in KDR that are operating not to our knowledge and against our policies and values , " Rosenberg said . " They wo n't show us anything . " <p> Rosenberg said Lafayette representatives told him the information can not be released because of an ongoing investigation . He said he is concerned that Lafayette fingered KDR without providing him documentation . <p> Refining policies <p> At the next Board of Trustees meeting in February , the Student Life committee , one of the committees involved in proposing policy changes , will meet . <p> Clow would not specify if " unrecognized selective membership organizations " will be on the agenda , saying only , " If and when the board takes action ( on such groups ) , it will be reported to the Lafayette community . " <p> At this point , the board will debate if policy changes are warranted , Clow said . <p> In the Dec. 5 memo , committees on student life , conduct and appeals recommended some changes , including clarifying the definition of selective membership organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no longer recognized by the college and continue to operate , according to the memo . <p> Otherwise , according to the memo , students may get the wrong idea and be fearful of joining organizations outside the scope of the college but not operating illicitly , such as the Daughters of the American Revolution . <p> In the draft policy proposed by the committees , any students attending or participating in such a group could " be subject to the full range of disciplinary sanctions available to the College , up to and including suspension or expulsion . " In some circumstances , members of underground organizations , under the draft policy , could face criminal and civil penalties . <p> However , the draft policy described in the Dec. 5 memo would include a provision allowing students to appeal to the student conduct committee to as a way of reaffirming " the right of students to freedom of association and freedom of expression . " <p> Police find no wrongdoing <p> Easton police concluded an investigation into Glenn 's death in July , but could not gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone for providing liquor to a minor , Gerould said . <p> " There were so many people involved in so many different locations that it was unable to be proven , " Gerould said . " The evidence we had did n't warrant enough probable cause to arrest anybody . " <p> But the reach of the underground organizations has not been felt in the surrounding community , according to Easton Police Chief Carl Scalzo . He said the relationship with Lafayette College police was a good one . <p> Underage drinking on campus typically is handled by campus police , he said . While the Easton department will respond to underage drinking in off-campus housing , he said he has not seen anything to make him believe underground fraternities have a strong foothold on College Hill . <p> Mayor Sal Panto Jr . agreed . As a former fraternity member himself , Panto said it 's important that conversations about fraternities do not become witch hunts .

Its disciplinary problems began in 2010 when some members held a party with a keg of beer in a front yard , Rosenberg said . <p> The police arrived , and the entire fraternity was placed on disciplinary probation . Fraternity members found themselves in trouble twice more , including once for a party during the probation , Rosenberg said . <p> After that , the fraternity had its membership status suspended for five years . The national fraternity could establish the branch at Lafayette again in 2016 . <p> If a KDR member was involved in Glenn 's death , Rosenberg said , he could face expulsion from the group and disciplinary action before the national organization 's judicial board . <p> FORT BRAGG ,

" That 's No. 1 . No. 2 is the fact I enjoy what I 'm doing and it 's not presented as a job ; it 's more sharing my life , making it a scrapbook that happens to be a haunted house . " <p> Patrick said he was put in touch with Reda Productions through Lehigh Valley Heritage Museum Executive Director Joseph Garrera . had reached out to Patrick about speaking at the museum for a presentation on the history of television when he mentioned the Redas , Patrick said . <p> Scott Reda , Lou Reda 's son , added that the show is still in the early stages and that additional characters are being cast in Macon . " Right now , it 's kind of a matter of figuring out how the show is going to look , " Scott Reda said . <p> Lunch on Ferry Street <p> Patrick arrived in Easton on Friday to discuss the project with the Redas ahead of his weekend appearance at the David T. Jones Convention at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their meeting included a late-morning lunch stop at Easton 's Sette Luna on Ferry Street . <p> " It 's great . He 's terrific , " said Lou Reda . <p> Patrick said the importance of doing a series focusing on the house , including its restoration , is to honor his grandmother 's memory . He says it will differentiate itself from other supernatural-themed reality shows in that it will include elements of " American Pickers " and Americana . <p> " The town ( of Macon ) knows about it , it 's kind of a local legend there , " Patrick said . " I think living in the Midwest had a definite effect on keeping your sanity and not getting too wrapped in own your stardom , so to speak . ... I think this will allow me to do some things I 've been wanting to do for a long time . " <p> Patrick , who began acting at age 8 , said he used to take trips from Los Angeles to Macon when he was a boy . But he never realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It seemed everybody saw the ghost but me , " Patrick said . " I was never inside . I was always out running around with the guys . " <p> Last year , Patrick re-visited the house his first trip back in 20 years and was told it was in foreclosure and vacant . He said there were developers interested in the property and a group of people wanted to demolish the structure for its glass , walls and fireplaces . " I decided I was going to try and save the house , " Patrick said . <p> Patrick , whose screen credits include " I Dream of Jeannie " and " My Favorite Martian , " is hopeful the new series will appeal to fans of " The Munsters . " <p> The new show is " not so much about what going on , but it 'll pique curiosity for what Eddie Munster 's doing these days and bring back fond memories of their ( viewers ' ) past and that 's all we want , " he said . <p> Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 to 1966 on CBS . Patrick said the show 's theme of acceptance continues to resonate . <p> " The ' 60s were a wonderful time for TV comedy writers , " Patrick said . " ' The Munsters ' was sort of a social statement about people living next door and do n't judge a book by the cover . There was a lot of stuff there that had undertones of social commentary . It was a sleeper show that had a lot of good stuff that people were n't aware of . " <p> Patrick was supposed to make a cameo on NBC 's " Mockingbird Lane " show last fall as a scout leader . But the show , a modernization of " The Munsters " clan , ended before he could get in front of the cameras . ( The pilot ran as a Halloween special but was not picked up for a series . ) <p> " I liked it . I thought it had legs , " Patrick said , adding that he was disappointed by the news . <p> Patrick , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the visage of Eddie Munster on the back , has not completely put his " Munsters " past behind him . He still makes appearances at comic-book and pop culture conventions across the country . <p> " People do n't know me if I 'm walking through the airport , but if I turn around you see the Eddie Munster on my back , they know that guy and they like him , " he said . <h> Aerial Fumigation Comes 
 with Taylor Swift ? Is there a special place in hell for women who do n't support other women ? <p> Samantha in Easton <p> Dear Samantha , <p> No , but I do think there might be a special place in hell for people who ca n't take a joke . <p> Tina Fey and Amy Poehler joked during the Golden Globes that Taylor Swift should maybe put the brakes on dating and spend some time getting to know herself . Pretty innocuous stuff when you consider first , that T-Swift has made millions writing and performing songs about her failed romantic relationships and , second , that she often reveals who among her ( sometimes famous ) exes inspired a given song . <p> Taylor 's claim during a Vanity Fair interview that Tina 's and Amy 's jokes about her were " frankly , a little bit sexist " is , frankly , a little bit stupid . The two " Saturday Night Live " ladies ' hardest jab of the night was aimed at director James Cameron , who is a man . Poehler quipped that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture because she was married to Cameron for three years . <p> Anyway , if Swift does n't want people to talk about her love life , then maybe she should stop , I do n't know , being famous . <p> View full and Miley Cyrus are in live , Photo <p> Dear Pinky , <p> Is Liam Hemsworth cheating on fiance Miley Cyrus with January Jones ? <p> Joanna in Allentown <p> Dear Joanna , <p> IDK .

" We love it . We 're hams . " <p> is one of the oldest community theaters in the Lehigh Valley . It was created when the former Easton Express Glee Club merged with The Easton Players Guild . <p> Their first production was an original musical called " Everybody Sings .

" <p> " I played Mayor Shin in ' The Music Man ' , " he recalls . " That was one of my favorites because I could yell at all of the kids .

President Patricia , who has been a member since 1977 , says it can cost up to to put on a show of that size . ( The group 's most recent musical productions were " Dirty Rotten Scoundrels " and " Curtains " in 2009 . ) <p> The next production will be " Storybook Breakfast with Characters " on April 13 at Casa Italia in Forks Township . <p> " We 're generally strapped for cash , " says .

 Inc. magazines highlights industry-wide trouble <p> View full Inc. , and its 95 magazine titles , have struggled to keep revenue up as the market continues to take a digital Photo MARK LENNIHAN <p> From Sports Illustrated to People to its namesake magazine , Time Inc. , was always an innovator . But now when the troubled magazine industry is facing its greatest challenge , the company Henry Luce founded is struggling to find its way in a digital world . <p> Time Warner Inc. ' s decision to she 'd its Time Inc. magazine unit last week underscores the challenges facing an industry that remains wedded to glossy paper even as the use of tablet computers , e-readers and smartphones explodes . <p> Although the new devices might seem to present an array of opportunity for Time Inc. ' s 95 magazine titles , many publishers have found the digital transition troublesome . Digital editions of magazines represented just 2.4 percent of all U.S. circulation in the last half of 2012 , or about 7.9 million copies , according to the Alliance for Audited Media . <p> Although that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hardly gangbusters growth , considering that the number of tablets in the U.S. also more than doubled last year to 64.8 million , according to research firm IHS . <p> The fact that so few tablet owners are buying magazines on their devices is a concern because both ad and circulation revenue from print editions have fallen more than 20 percent since their peak near the middle of the last decade . And , according to forecasts , there 's no recovery in sight . <p> " We have to get much better at capturing those ( digital ) readers , " said Mary Berner , president of The Association of Magazine Media . <p> Before publishers can accomplish that , they need to address a number of problems , experts say . First , the range of free content on the Web has given some readers the impression that it 's not necessary to pay for the digital versions of magazine stories . Also , there 's no industry standard for pricing . Publishers are n't in agreement over whether to include free access to digital copies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges , too . It 's been difficult for magazine makers to create compelling digital editions that fit every screen size and resolution . <p> Berner acknowledges that customer confusion is part of what 's preventing the magazine industry from selling more digital copies . She is working with industry players like Time Inc. , Hearst Corp. , Conde Nast and Meredith Corp . to standardize both the format of magazines and the way they are sold . <p> " There used to be a couple ways you used to be able to get a magazine : you could subscribe or buy it at the newsstand . Now there 's 25 ways . Joe Average consumer just is n't that clear on it yet , " she said . " The confusing part is hurting . " <p> Advertisers are making matters worse . The ad industry has been slow to warm to the notion that they still need to pay top dollar to advertise in the tablet editions of magazines , even though much cheaper website ads are just a finger-swipe away . <p> But many magazines still command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , costs to reach the readers of 1.1 million copies , or about for every 1,000 , according to a rate card that the magazine posted online . <p> Compare that to a ad during this year 's Super Bowl , which at most cost per 1,000 TV households , or million to reach 108 million TV sets , according to CBS . A typical website ad costs in the single-digit dollars per 1,000 viewers , although pricing varies by ad size and other features . <p> Magazine insiders say the price of their ad space is worth it because ads reach a targeted , engaged audience that actually wants to see the commercial advances . Even so , advertisers bristle at the idea that tablet editions command the same price premium as print pages . <p> " The costs per thousand are out of whack , " said George Janson , director of print for GroupM , a subsidiary of advertising agency giant WPP , whose clients include Ikea , Mars Inc. , Marriott and Xerox . " The advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's very little accountability . That 's starting to change now at the advertisers ' insistence . " <p> The magazine industry 's slim but growing digital subscriber base could help convince advertisers of the value of magazines . Research firm eMarketer predicts that while print magazine ad revenue will remain flat at about billion from 2011 to 2016 , digital magazine ad revenue will grow from billion to billion over the same period . <p> But even as overall magazine advertising revenue grows , it 's not expanding nearly as fast as U.S. ad spending as a whole . The predicted turnaround wo n't return the industry to pre-recession levels and it may come too late for Time Warner Inc . <p> Revenue at its Time Inc. unit slipped to billion in 2012 , about 38 percent below its peak in 2004 . Operating profit declined to million , down by more than half of the million posted eight years earlier . <p> Analysts say spinning off the magazines into a separate , publicly traded company reduces Time Warner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the spin-off , its shares hit a 52-week high of . <p> Magazines do n't have a lot of time to figure the digital transition out . TV and digital ad spending is growing quickly , and there are more ways than ever to track down consumers and get a company 's message in front of them . <p> " It 's not just print and TV and radio , " said Brenda White , a senior vice president in charge of publishing industry ad spending at Starcom USA , a subsidiary of ad agency giant Publicis Groupe , whose clients include Facebook Inc. and Google Inc . " There are all these different digital channels : mobile , tablets , social . Publishing companies have had to evolve their business models to keep up . " <h> Hackers get a 
 administrator of emergency operations and public safety at Lehigh Valley Hospital , said Lehigh Valley Health Network has reviewed the incident , but does n't believe there was much that could have been done to prevent it . <p> " This is the struggle , " Wargo said . " There is no profiling that could have been done that could have given you a suspicion of what was going to happen . <p> " He was going through the same routine as every other day . There was nothing out of sorts . There was nothing off-kilter that day . " <p> When hospital staff went to the room to investigate reports of gunshots , they found the Osmans , Wargo said . It was quickly clear that there was no active shooter . <p> " That gave us a comfort level . ... We could continue our response , but we knew that there was n't any harm posed to our staff and patients , " Wargo said . <p> Hospitals not common targets for violence <p> Lehigh Valley Hospital security staff had met the same morning as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Township campus . The Lehigh Valley Health Network conducts active shooter drills in connection with local law enforcement and EMS to create as real a replica as possible , according to hospital spokesman Matthew Burns . <p> " We 're ready for these kind of things , " he said . <p> Hospitals are generally not violent places , Wargo said , so security measures such as metal detectors would likely do more harm than good to daily operations . <p> A September 2012 study about hospital-based shootings out of John Hopkins University finds that of the shootings between 2000 and 2011 , 22 percent were motivated by an i 'll relative . Fifty-nine percent of all hospital shootings ended with the shooter ending his or her own life , according to the study , and 31 percent of victims are patients . <p> Wargo said the hospital is unique in that it has a full security department rather than security force . The advantage of the " all-hazards " approach , Wargo said , is that the hospital has trained staff that can handle myriad aspects of a wide variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one big team , in a sense , " Wargo said of the certified staff members . " So we 're ready no matter what the issue . " <p> " security codes are in place , drills are conducted , entrances and exits are monitored , and access is controlled , 24/7 , " according to the statement . <p> St. Luke 's University Hospital Network has a security program accredited by the International Association for Healthcare Security &amp; Safety , according to Don Sieple , vice president of the hospital network 's operations . The program has been accredited since 2009 and is headed by Alan Lynch , who also serves as president of the Susquehanna Chapter . <p> counted the highly trained staff as the hospital network 's best defense . <p> " It assures us that the officers we have are trained and prepared for any number of situations , " Sieple said .

Subsequent meetings have aimed to address any loopholes or concerns by other workers , he said . <p> " We continue to look at those events and assess them by learning from them , " Sieple said . " That was a tragic event at LVH and our hearts go out to them ... but we all can use that an opportunity to at least take an inward look at our own operation . " <p> Though area hospitals will compete for patients , one thing they wo n't fight over is safety preparedness , according to Wargo . <p> " We immediately heard from neighboring hospitals , " Wargo said .

 offers custom crepes to community <p> It is a less than sunny afternoon in Bethlehem the town 's bleak weather cast a dreary shadow over New Street , and cars and pedestrians zip along the damp road , skimming through the day . However , discretely located within this block is a restaurant that has been brightening the drab setting , catching the attention of both Lehigh students and locals , called Full of Crepe . <p> Full of Crepe , a restaurant that specializes in making both sweet and savory crepes , has quickly become a spot where Lehigh students have chosen to gather for a bite to eat . They order either lunch or dessert items , from the array of choices , in order to satisfy their salty and sweet cravings . <p> After hearing rave reviews from my fellow peers , I was a bit surprised when I walked into the store . Immediately upon stepping inside , I saw that the kitchen is located directly behind the register . There 's only enough room for customers to order and leave with their food . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant . It creates a cozy atmosphere for customers to mingle and chat , which is enhanced by wonderful , friendly service . <p> The store 's owner , K. Ashley Caldwell , is a busy , yet efficient woman . As I waited for my " Moravian Sugar Cake , " a crepe filled with butter , brown sugar and cinnamon , Caldwell scurried between the kitchen and the section of their restaurant that is under construction . At the same time , she was assisting her culinary staff , head chefs Carrie Ponicsan and Heather Armitage , and even offered her opinion on my decision to add some powdered sugar to the crepe . " Powdered sugar is not recommended , " she said . <p> Under the " Sweet Favorites " section of the menu , the restaurant features several sugary treats for customers , including the popular " CBPB , " a crepe consisting of milk chocolate , banana and peanut butter . The " Savory Favorites " section has more lunch or dinner options , one being " The Kid , " a crepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat cheese with balsamic reduction . <p> Customers have the option of making their crepe into a " Mega " by adding an egg , served over easy , and Boar 's Head bacon . The restaurant also offers gluten-free batter , as well as several " Fill your own " options that customers can choose to have in their crepe . <p> The service is incredibly fast and efficient . The chefs make the crepes freshly on the griddle right after customers order them , which makes finally eating your meal all the more satisfying . As soon as my crepe was cooked and neatly packaged in a container to go , I took a bite , expecting a sweet , regular taste , but it turned out to be much more enjoyable than I predicted . The taste is simple yet extraordinary , and Caldwell was right it did n't need powdered sugar . <p> As I tried to juggle scribbling notes and swallowing the mouth-watering crepe at the same time , with some food stains on my journal as evidence , I asked Caldwell what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gem . <p> " I 'd like to pick what gem I am , " Caldwell said . " I love that . There 's so many things that are exciting affirmations as a business owner , to know people are talking about your food , such an amazing feeling . It 's a beautiful sentiment . " <p> But Caldwell was n't always making crepe creations . She actually slid right into the idea a few years ago . <p> " I 'm a big skier , " Caldwell said . " I saw a crepe stand when I was in Breckenridge , Colorado . I 'm an entrepreneur at heart . One day when I was 40 years old , I quit my job and opened a crepe shop . It was an early midlife crisis . " <p> As I finish up the delicious crepe , Caldwell asked me how the crepe is , to which of course I replied , " Amazing . " Upon hearing this , a customer waiting in line said , " Everyone 's been saying the same thing . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little to improve on . Though this may be true , she still sets high standards and goals for the restaurant , both features that were evident when I asked her what her goals are for Full of Crepe . <p> " I want to serve fresh , well-prepared food at a reasonable price and for everyone to feel like they 're our friends , " Caldwell said . <p> Caldwell strives for the restaurant 's crepes to be presented well , and purchasing ingredients from local vendors is also important . Even though she is visibly ambitious , this restaurant entrepreneur remains humble at the same time . <p> A new section of the restaurant will be opening April 15 , with enough seating for approximately 15 people . Full of Crepe will hold extended hours from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. for their customers . It is located on 335 New St. and normal hours of operation are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m . Monday through Saturday and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays . Contact them at <h> Veniamin Konstantinovich Balika 
 Corey Glover looks back on 25 years of ' Vivid ' <p> View full rock band Living Colour will perform Thursday night at the Keswick Theatre in Glenside , Pa.Photo Courtesy of the Keswick Theatre <p> Corey Glover says it is hard to believe that more than two decades have passed since the release of Living Colour 's groundbreaking debut album , " Vivid . " <p> " I 've been trying to wrap my head around it , doing something , anything for 25 years , " Glover says in a recent phone interview . <p> " Vivid , " released in May 1988 , is an amalgam of musical styles that set the band apart from its rock contemporaries during a time when the genre was changing . Alternative and grunge were on the verge of exploding as pop-metal was on its way out yet " Vivid " encapsulated the best of both worlds , along with swirls of jazz , hip-hop , pop and funk . <p> " We never believed in labeling , " Glover says , " How do you label something that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that concept . " <p> The band 's breakthrough came following the release of the single " Cult of Personality . " The pointed , politically-charged tune which opens the album with Vernon Reid 's snarling , blistery guitar intro and includes audio snips of political speeches and references to John F. Kennedy , Gandhi , Stalin and Mussolini became Living Colour 's signature tune , as the video made its way onto MTV . <p> " We were all pretty green as it pertained to what we were venturing into , new territory , and wondering what was going to happen , " Glover recalls , " We did n't know how it was going to be perceived ( musically ) . That was going to happen , whether we were trying or not .

Miller spent most of his days guarding trains that traveled through Berlin with two other military police officers . During the Berlin Airlift , the Soviets held up their train at a checkpoint in Marienborn for three days . <p> Honorably discharged from the Army , Miller still looked like a baby-faced teenager when the Korean War broke out in June 1950 . Miller said people accused him of being a draft dodger , so he signed up for the Air Force that fall . <p> Sitting at his kitchen table last week , Miller recounted watching the Koreans go down to the river to beat and wash their clothes . He showed a picture of himself with Korean children as they watch jets take off .

 School of Business will close due to funding cuts <p> After eight years of operation in Allentown , the Pennsylvania School of Business will close its doors for good . <p> Officials from the post-secondary business school at 265 Lehigh St. announced today that congressional funding cuts from last year will force their closure . <p> The school will discontinue operations in January , but measures have been taken to allow current students to graduate or transfer their credits to other nearby institutions . <p> " Congressional funding cuts effective last July prevented 50 percent of our student population from beginning their studies , " school President Michael O'Brien said in a news release . <p> " And with enrollment dropping at that level , we determined it would be impossible for us to remain open beyond this coming January , " O'Brien said . <p> Students who do not graduate before January can transfer their credits to such schools as Lehigh Carbon Community College , Central Penn College , DeVry Institute , McCann School of Business , Technical Career Institute and Lincoln Technical Institute . <p> Dick Dumaresq , president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the students have a full semester to deal with the transfer will allow for a streamlined , managed transition . <p> " These institutions stepped up and students will have an incredible amount of choice among all these schools , " Dumaresq said . <p> " I 'm sure most of these students were frustrated , but we 're trying to tell them they should n't just give up and walk away from this great investment they 've made in their education . " <p> A total of 259 undergraduates were enrolled at the Pennsylvania School of Business in Fall 2012 , according to the National Center for Education Statistics . <p> While institutions across the state are experiencing funding cuts and declining enrollment , state officials say the Pennsylvania School of Business was hit particularly hard . <p> That 's because in July 2011 , Congress eliminated all funding for Pell Grants going to ability-to-benefit students , Dumaresq said . <p> ATB students lack a high school diploma or GED but received grants to allow them to pursue higher education if they met certain conditions such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A billion cut to Pell Grants , which are federal grants that help students pay for college , cut funding for ATB students altogether . <p> Dumaresq said there are only a handful of Pennsylvania schools with ATB students , and they make up only a small portion of the student population for those that do . <p> But PSB had a larger percentage , which particularly hurt the school when paired with changes that prevented students from getting Pell Grants if they went to school during the summer . <p> " The model for most business and technical schools is that they go year-round , " Dumaresq said . " So once that money was cut , it had an impact . " <p> Minority students were particularly affected by the federal funding cut . About 31 percent of ATB students are Latino and 19 percent are black , according to the American Association of Community Colleges . <p> The cuts to ATB students only affected new students , not those in school when the cut was approved in 2011 . <p> Other post-secondary business schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , Dumaresq said . <p> Edinboro University this week announced plans to cut more than 50 staff members , while Clarion University will eliminate up to 40 jobs . <h> Church 's Chicken 
 at Centenary College remains part of Hackettstown lore <p> View full sizeOn April 9 , 1886 , 18-year-old Tillie Smith , a domestic who lived and worked at Centenary Collegiate Institute in Hackettstown , was raped and strangled . Her body was left in an open field in plain view.Photo courtesy Denis Sullivan <p> Tracy Ray 's arms begin to tremble , her legs become weak and tears well up in her eyes . <p> It 's twilight , an eerie feeling hovers in the air and she has become convinced that she is standing at the exact place where the beaten body of Matilda Smith was discovered April 9 , 1886 . <p> On this patch of grass outside the Taylor Library on the Centenary College campus , Ray begins to experience every horrifying moment of the attack . <p> The psychic medium empath along with a nationally renowned paranormal researcher , local historical fiction author and adjunct science professor at Centenary , visited various places around campus earlier this year as part of their investigation into the murder of the young woman known as Tillie by longtime residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local lore . <p> Ray , David Rountree , Maryann McFadden and Karl Hricko are trying to reach back across time to unearth new evidence and perhaps explain why Tillie 's ghostly apparition has been seen many times around the campus over the years . <p> When they reveal their findings during a program at the Warren County Library 's Northeast Branch on Oct. 12 , they 'll argue that an innocent man spent 19 years in prison for the crime while Tillie 's murderer went unpunished . <p> " When you look at everything , " said Rountree , a Hackettstown resident , " I think we have some compelling evidence . " <p> McFadden , who has spent years investigating the murder and the subsequent trial for her next book , " Finding Tillie , " said court transcripts state Tillie had finished her shift as a potato peeler in the school 's kitchen and wanted to see a band that was in town .

She was found dead the next morning and police could n't find one person who heard so much as a scream despite evidence that indicated she had struggled with her attacker before being raped and choked . <p> McFadden said no one believes James Titus was guilty , and that he only signed a confession months later to save himself from the gallows . <p> While speculation as to who may have committed the murder has swirled for decades , McFadden feels Tillie has " become a footnote in the story of her own life . " <p> " She comes to the college , she just learned to read and she 's meeting a different class of people , " McFadden said . " If I was in her shoes , I would see this as a chance to better my life . " <p> While most of the details of Tillie 's life have faded , her spirit refuses to rest .

Jones further claimed he and former authority Chairwoman Laurel Napolitani received a " surprisingly hostile reaction " from one to two members of the authority for investigating . <p> Jones , who served as special counsel for the authority in 2011 , sent his allegations in the form of a letter to the authority and the Warren County freeholders the third week in December . <p> Express-Times File Chamberlain <p> Jones did not name the male employee accused of wrongdoing . Freeholder Director Everett Chamberlain , who also sits on the authority 's board , identified the individual as Jim Williams , the landfill 's director of operations . The landfill is in White Township . <p> Efforts to reach Williams for comment Friday were unsuccessful . <p> Since the letter was mailed , two members of the board left their positions because their terms ended , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rift formed among the freeholders about what to do . <p> Freeholder Jason Sarnoski sent a letter of his own last week to local elected officials stating Chamberlain should abstain from all discussions about the allegations because of his dual role on both boards . Chamberlain has yet to do so . <p> Sarnoski also sought to involve the Warren County Prosecutor 's Office , have county counsel review the authority 's minutes and launch an investigation into the allegations . <p> Chamberlain said Sarnoski was engaged in " character assassination " for " political gain . " <p> Sarnoski said in response he was trying to bring an issue to light that his fellow board member failed to share . <p> Sarnoski said Chamberlain had known about the allegations against Williams for roughly six months , and the rest of the board only found out about them after the letter arrived in December . <p> " Why now are we addressing the issue ? Why is this the first time this freeholder board is hearing about this issue ? " Sarnoski asked a reporter Friday . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce Jones letter .

" Bringing politics like that to Warren County is sad . " <p> Deputy Freeholder Director Rick Gardner on Friday said he was surprised Jones ' letter was made public , saying he thought it was private under attorney-client privilege . <p> Gardner admitted to not knowing much about the allegations against Williams . <p> " I know that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some wrongdoing .

 Remembering the Flying Tigers of World War II <p> Today marks the 20th anniversary of the passing of my father , Wilfred R. " Will " Seiple . In honor of his memory , I would like to share his story as the youngest member of the famed World War II volunteer fighting group , the Flying Tigers . Led by Gen. Claire Chennault , the Flying Tigers fought the Japanese over the skies of Burma and China in the darkest first months of the war . <p> Like all the Flying Tigers , my father dreamed of a life of adventure and excitement . His 1938 Easton High School yearbook said he had " wanderlust " and wanted to " roam the seven seas and travel the world . " But the only Depression-era job he could find was factory work . With much of the world already at war , he horrified his parents by joining the Army Air Force . <p> Schooled in Philadelphia in aircraft engine repair , he was stationed at Mitchel Field in Long Island when he heard a presentation by CAMCO , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ground crew for the American Volunteer Group . This was really a covert operation set by the U.S. government to help China fight against the invading Japanese . Clearly in violation of neutrality laws meant to keep us out of the war , the U.S. government did not admit to this until the 1990s . <p> My father and about 350 other volunteers arrived in Burma in September 1941 . The airfield at Toungoo was hot , humid and infested with bugs . It was there , listening to the BBC , that my father heard the news of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor . We were finally at war , and the Tigers were the only American front-line air unit ready and in place to confront the enemy . <p> Several other local men joined this fighting group , including George Walters of Wilson Borough , Stephen of Catasauqua , and Ernest " Bus " Loane of Bloomsbury , all now deceased . <p> The well-trained Flying Tigers scored impressive successes against the shocked Japanese but were unable to stop their takeover of southern Burma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 750 miles along the twisting and hazardous Burma Road to Kunming , China . His scrapbook pictures clearly show the rugged , beautiful wilderness of this desolate region . <p> My father 's unit , the 3rd Pursuit Squadron , also known as the Hell 's Angels , was reassigned to Magwe , Burma . During the Japanese air raid of March 1942 , my father and two others were dreadfully wounded . John Fauth had most of his arm blown off and died that night . Frank Swartz lost most of his jaw . My father had a collapsed lung and his back and legs were riddled with shrapnel . My father and Swartz were airlifted to a British army hospital in India . My father recovered , but he had to suffer the sounds of the nearby Swartz , delirious with infection , as he slowly died . <p> My father rejoined his group in Kunming , China , and the Tigers fulfilled their one-year contract to CAMCO , which ended July 4 , 1942 . However , the U.S. government wanted the volunteers to all stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abandoned in Asia with no way home unless they immediately enlisted , they were threatened with being drafted as buck privates on their return to the U.S. if they did not agree to the government 's harsh terms . Disgusted , more than 90 percent of the volunteers refused to re-enlist and had to make their own way back to America the government would give them no help . <p> My father managed to fly with several others to India . He had to borrow money to board an English freighter to take him back to Philadelphia via South Africa . Soon after he came home and within days of his honeymoon he was drafted . <p> He spent the last two years of the war in England repairing planes that had been shot up over the deadly skies of Germany .

 Bruno victims file wrongful death suit <p> Express-Times Photo BILL members of Chad Horne , 22 , of Freehold , N.J. , and Robin Villegas , of Staten Island , N.Y. , hug outside of the Northampton County Courthouse following a verdict for an auto accident that took their lives in Bethlehem Township , Pa. in Jan. 2010 . <p> The families of Robin Villegas , of Long Island , N.Y. , and Terri Ann Buskirk , of Bethlehem , filed lawsuits in the Philadelphia County Court last week seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages in excess of . <p> The two women and their designated driver , Chad Horne , had just left a wake for Horne 's grandmother and were driving through a green light at the corner of Easton Avenue and Willow Park Road when Bruno 's 2006 Dodge Dakota slammed into their vehicle shortly after midnight Jan. 28 , 2010 .

It also accuses all the bars and the bus trip organizers of not stopping Bruno from driving or calling police since he was clearly intoxicated . <p> The defendants also did not properly train employees or provide the necessary security to prevent alcohol abuses , the suits claim . <p> The Northampton County District Attorney 's office had photo evidence that Bruno had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there was no way these businesses should have kept giving him drinks , Marciano said . <p> " I think it 's difficult at this point to quantify fault , but clearly right now , SMG is one of the front runners in their service of alcohol , " he said .

 in a column in The Brown and White on Sept. 29 , 2000 written by a student named Andrea Tantaros . Tantaros is now a national political commentator and columnist on Fox News Channel , Fox Business Channel , CNN , CNBC and MSNBC , and has come a long way from her college newspaper columns . <p> Tantaros visited Lehigh last year and talked to students not only about her job and her life at Lehigh , but how to succeed . Her speech stuck with me and since then she has been a big influence on my journalism path . <p> Now as many of you know may know , college campuses are usually full of liberal students . These students think they know what they want and simply take on the ideology because it sounds " cool . " I would like to change this- I want every Lehigh student to actually think about what they are saying , doing and most importantly , what they believe . The right to have a belief and share it with the world is a powerful thing something we often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and supply educated opinions on a topic I would be perfectly happy , even if they opposed mine . <p> However , this is not usually the case . Many times I find myself arguing ( which I admit I love to do ) with fellow students who have no reasoning at all to back up their claims . Simply stating something such as " Well George W. Bush was worse , " does not make an argument . This is n't a blame game , and even though politicians do it frequently , we should be looking at the facts , figures , policies and credentials of each candidate , not just making vague , unsubstantiated claims . <p> I also have a problem with all the students who make comments such as " I hear Canada calling my name , " or " Guess I 'm moving to Europe " when a certain candidate wins a given poll or a primary for the GOP . For example , these types of statements appeared many times on social networking sites when Newt Gingrich won the South Carolina primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look stupid . I do not agree with President Obama 's policies and personally think he is ruining our country , but that does n't mean I 'm going to tweet or status update that I 'm heading to Canada if he gets elected again . There 's a mature way to handle politics and opposing viewpoints to any candidate , and that is not it . <p> But let 's get back to Andrea Tantaros and why I initially began this column . When I heard her speak last year , I realized that the problem between my generation and politics is based in apathy . There have been many times I 've been watching Fox News in my spare time and people have asked me how I can watch a whole hour of a political news show . <p> This is exactly our problem . It is convenient to live in our college world and ignore everything that is happening around us . Yet , in a few years we will all be out in that world making our own way , our own decisions and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it to be run . <p> In my editing class , Professor Kathy Olson gave us a test of things we should know in the world to be good journalists . Taking her exercise even further , I believe we should know them to be educated citizens as well . However , many students in the class could not name two congressmen from their home states , and there were even some that could not name the current Secretary of State . <p> This was a huge shock for me . <p> I could not believe that these students are making the effort to get a great education at Lehigh , but do not even know basic facts when it comes to politics . This is when I realized that what Tantaros had talked about in her column back in 2000 was still true there are too many uneducated students on this campus . How can we expect them to vote for what they believe when they do n't even know what is really going on in Washington D.C. or what their vote signifies ? <p> So if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be this no matter what ideology you side with , and no matter why you have chosen it , please take some time to really learn the policies of the candidate you want to support before November . Now some of you will just shrug me off as a " terrible conservative " and ignore what I 've said , but the truth is I 'd rather have everyone vote for President Obama again and know why they are doing it , than to just simply make an uneducated vote , following the crowd . <p> CNBC Sports Business 
 and about 90 others in Hunterdon County have two natural-gas pipes in their yards , and the Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Co. wants to build a third that would be 42 inches in diameter . <p> " If that happened here , what happened in Allentown , I ca n't even imagine how many residents would be gone , " said Alison , who lives 21 feet from where Transco wants to build the new pipe . " Every explosion that happens like Allentown , our heart breaks for the victims , and it breaks for our community , that we might face the same kind of consequences . " <p> William Schulte , an environmental attorney representing four parties opposed to the Transco line , said explosions " will certainly be a large part " of his case . He 'll argue before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , which decides if Transco can build . <p> " One of the things we 're really pressing the commission to do is to look at the potential for an explosion and look at the potential damage should an explosion occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good way of showing that , A , it 's not outside the realm of possibility that these explosions occur and , B , that when they do occur they are massively destructive . " <p> In the Transco application , Schulte represents Fight the Pipe , Clinton Township , the New Jersey Sierra Club and the New Jersey Highlands Council . He also represents property owners opposing a separate pipe that would carry gas through the densely populated Jersey City area . <p> FERC spokeswoman Tamara Young-Allen said explosions and their potential damage fall under an environmental review completed for every pipeline application . If the pipe is approved , Transco becomes responsible for maintaining its safety to standards set by the U.S. Department of Transportation , she said . <p> " Every issue is important and that 's why it 's part of the environmental review , " Young-Allen said . " Obviously , safety is key because we do n't want to put infrastructure in place if it 's not going to be safe . " <p> Five employees and 10 citizens have been killed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 employees and 51 citizens injured , according to FERC . Those figures do not include deaths and injuries from residential natural gas pipelines like the one in Allentown , which was made of cast iron and installed in 1928 . <p> " The incident in Allentown is definitely a tragedy , " said Andy , Alison 's husband , adding his thoughts are with Allentown victims as the one-year anniversary of the blast approaches . <p> " What concerns me , " he said , " is we have pipes that are 50 , 60 years old next to our house that certainly could be in the same situation . " <p> In a response to concerns raised by residents at a Clinton Township meeting , Transco said its " pipeline integrity plan covers rigorous inspections for our entire pipeline system . <p> " We have customized our plans to include state of the art technology , a variety of tools and methodologies and ongoing analysis all of which work in conjunction to reduce risk and increase prevention , " the response says . <p> Over time , 
 front , Mike Miller of Slatedale , Scott Rauch of Salisbury Township and John George of New Tripoli set their sights on snow geese preparing to descend on a Whitehall Township cornfield . <p> If you 've never hunted snow geese before , there 's something quite beautiful and amazing that unfolds before your eyes the very first time you pursue the birds . Laying in wait amid the decoys , looking up at the sky in anticipation of their arrival , it 's like staring at and into a work of art . <p> Just as the brush strokes of a painter transform his vision into reality , the details of the morning slowly come to life in the minutes after the initial rays of light hit the Earth . Shortly after sunrise , the geese begin to appear on the horizon , first in small groups and then in much larger flocks until the sky is filled with thousands and thousands of birds flying amid the brilliant blue skies and beautiful white clouds . Closer and closer they get , creating an awe-inspiring experience , one that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " OK gentlemen , take them . " <p> With that command from Mike Miller of Slatedale , the group of hunters laying in the cut Whitehall Township cornfield takes aim on the first group of snows descending to the decoys , putting three of the geese on the ground . It 's a great start to what will turn out to be a very good day afield for the eight friends who have come together to match wits with a bird that 's among the wariest of waterfowl . <p> A bird that nests in the arctic and sub-arctic regions and migrates south through the United States come fall and winter , the snow goose is a species whose population has soared to record levels over the past decade . Due to the overly abundant population , which now numbers more than five million continent-wide , the birds are causing extensive damage to their nesting habitat , as well as agricultural lands and marshlands in their wintering grounds in the U.S. As a result , several states , including Pennsylvania and New Jersey , have instituted special conservation hunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years to give hunters additional opportunities and tools to help bring the populations down to more manageable levels . <p> For the past six years , Miller , along with Mike Kilpatrick of Orefield , John George of New Tripoli and Andrew Mack of Slatington a group of friends and avid waterfowl hunters who go by the name Team Mayhem have been actively pursuing snow geese once they arrive each winter . The friends say it 's an amazingly challenging bird to hunt and one that requires different tactics than those used on Canada geese . <p> " They 're a lot trickier to hunt , " George said . " More eyes in the air and a lot warier . They do n't want to commit as easy , that 's for sure . They want to give multiple looks before they come in . " <p> Like most other forms of waterfowl hunting , the keys to successful snow goose hunting include scouting before the hunt , using the proper decoy spread and making sure you 're set up in the best location possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has access to several properties throughout the Lehigh Valley and neighboring Berks County , which allows them to be in close proximity to the birds no matter where they are passing through the region . They also use a decoy spread that includes hundreds , not dozens of birds . <p> " We 're pushing 1,000 decoys , maybe 1,200 , and that 's only a speck compared to when the snow geese hit the field , " Kilpatrick said . <p> Like many waterfowlers , Team Mayhem members migrated to snow goose hunting in recent years as opportunities to pursue the birds have increased . While they were experienced Canada goose hunters , the men say they quickly learned that snows are indeed a bird of a different feather . <p> " If you 're asking my opinion between a Canada goose and a snow goose , the only thing that puts those two even remotely close together is the name ' goose , ' " Kilpatrick said . " Other than that , they 're completely different birds . You ca n't hunt them the same , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't decoy them the same . " <p> One way the men try to fool the thousands upon thousands of eyes that will be upon them as the snows start to descend on the decoys is to make the decoy spread look as much like a real flock as possible . Included in their massive layout are more than 200 SilloSocks , which blow in even the lightest of winds , as well as rotary flying electronic decoys and even flag decoys that they wave to mimic landing birds . Electronic calls , which are not permitted in other waterfowl seasons , are also part of their arsenal and have definitely helped increase the odds for success since they were legalized . <p> While Team Mayhem thoroughly enjoys pursuing snow geese , as well as Canada geese and ducks , they 're also passionate about introducing others to the sport as well . As on this day , they 're usually joined in the field by other family and friends , often including young children and others who may be hunting waterfowl for the first time . <p> " Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfowlers have now become waterfowlers , " Miller said . " They saw the passion we had for it , and the time and effort that sometimes it takes . We 've taken a lot of kids out who shot their first duck or goose . Seeing the smiles on the faces of kids who have never done that before , that 's awesome . " <p> By morning 's end , this particular group , which also includes Tim Knopf of Whitehall Township , Scott Rauch of Salisbury Township , Trevor Corriere of Easton , Ryan Marlatt of Slatington and Mike Tenuto of Orefield , has 15 geese in the bag . While it 's a far cry from the 25 per person per day allowed during the conservation hunt , a limit is the last thing on anyone 's mind . Rather , it 's all about the time spent together and creating memories that will last a lifetime . Plus , there 's also the added fact that , at least for one day , they were able to go toe to toe with a bird that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a lot of days when you do n't do well . And then you have days like this when you see a lot of birds and they commit , and it makes you remember when you 're having those tough days , " Miller said . " You have a bunch of good guys out here in the field today we 're a bunch of friends together hunting and we had a good time . The thing with snow geese is they are such a tough bird to decoy . Your average age of a snow goose is 10 years old , and they did n't get that old by being stupid . " <h> ' Fear Factor 
 company told a special U.S. Senate committee last year it would take 40 years to replace all of the city 's cast-iron pipes . <p> " That 's crazy , " Pawlowski said . " We 're not just talking about a water pipe here . We 're talking about a pipe that transports a product that 's flammable and combustible and blows things up . " <p> UGI officials say they have stepped up the pace at which they are replacing cast-iron pipe with high-density plastic in Allentown and the rest of the Lehigh Valley . <p> The company replaced seven miles of city gas main in 2011 , UGI spokesman Joe Swope said . That 's more than the six miles it planned to replace , which itself is more than twice what the company had replaced the year before . <p> In 2012 , UGI plans to replace seven and a half miles of pipeline , Swope said . That would leave about 64.5 miles of cast-iron pipe in the city . <p> " Safety is our primary concern , " Swope said . " In general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in older types of main have been very consistent . " <p> But replacing pipeline costs about per mile , and UGI officials have previously said they can not replace gas lines at this pace every year . <p> Even if they stuck to six miles per year , Pawlowski said , it would take more than a decade to replace it all , which the mayor said is too long . <p> " I 'm glad they 're replacing more than a mile a year , like they 've done in the past , " he said . " But they have 70 miles to replace . More needs to be done . " <p> Swope said UGI works in conjunction with the city 's residential street replacement plan , replacing pipe as the city repairs its roads and avoiding tearing up the same streets twice . <p> But Pawlowski said it also means the work is n't done according to which pipes are oldest or most in need of replacement . <p> " It does n't necessarily mean that 's where the oldest pipe is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " he said . <p> Although the city knows what streets UGI 's gas pipelines run through , Pawlowski said , the city does not know basic information such as the age of specific pipes , when they were replaced and where exactly they are underneath the roads . <p> " Only UGI has that knowledge , and that has not been shared , " Pawlowski said . <p> If undisturbed , cast-iron pipe can operate for years without problems . But as they age , they become less resilient and more susceptible to leaks , cracks and pressure from street traffic . <p> The new pipe installed by UGI is made of a sturdier high-density plastic , Swope said , which is often sleeved through the existing cast-iron pipe to create an additional layer of protection . <p> There are 217 miles of cast-iron pipe in the Lehigh Valley . That does not include 13 miles worth that were replaced in 2011 , Swope said . <p> Since most of the Valley 's cast-iron pipeline falls outside Allentown , this is a regional concern , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , or 15.71 percent , are either cast iron or bare steel , which PUC spokeswoman Jennifer Kocher described as " risky pipeline . " <p> Swope said that since 2000 , UGI has replaced more than 290 miles of cast-iron pipe systemwide , and the company spent million on natural gas main and service replacements last year alone . <p> It will probably cost UGI about million to replace the seven and a half miles of cast-iron pipeline it plans to replace this year in Allentown , Swope said . <p> " UGI has been very aggressive in replacing older cast-iron pipe and replacing them with contemporary materials , " Swope said . " Yes , it 's going to take some time to get it all replaced . " <p> Among the challenges in replacing older pipeline is finding construction crews qualified for the work and working with municipalities to determine which mains should be replaced in which order , he said . <p> There are 60,418 miles of pipeline throughout the state , according to the Pipeline Safety Trust , a Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas distribution and service , 10,834 are gas transmission and 2,532 are hazardous liquid , according to the organization . <p> Nationally , 31 percent of gas distribution lines were installed prior to new regulations in the 1970s , according to the U.S. Department of Transportation . <h> Takeda launches EDARBYCLOR 
 PhotoThis box containing a dead chicken , fruit and candles was found Monday at an intersection in Tewksbury Township , police say . <p> Tewksbury Township Police stumbled upon an unusual find Monday afternoon , following a call for what appeared to be a dead bird in a box full of fruit and candles . <p> Authorities said they believe the brown cardboard box recovered at Potterstown and Rockaway roads may have been placed there as part of a Santeria ritual . The religion blends West African roots with several different beliefs , including those of medieval Roman Catholicism . <p> Police said the find about 2:20 p.m. was unusual but that they have no intention of attempting to find who placed the box there or pressing charges in connection with the chicken carcass found inside . <p> The reddish-hued fowl was covered with red and white candles , popcorn , apples , oranges , potatoes and a few coins . <p> Police could not recall a similar discovery in the township going back 20 years . <p> The presumption that the box was part of a Santeria ritual is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torre , a religious professor at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver , Colo . But he cautioned against making the assumption . <p> " Just because somebody finds a dead chicken and some candles in a box does n't mean it is part of a true Santeria ritual , " De La Torre said . " It could be anything from some sadistic teenagers pulling a prank ... to Santeria wanna-bes who read about some things on the Internet . " <p> Deciphering the offering <p> De La Torre , who is an ordained minister , was born in Cuba just before the Castro Revolution to parents who practiced Santeria . The professor of ethics and religion wrote a book in 2004 about the burgeoning belief system titled " Santeria : The Beliefs and Rituals of a Growing Religion in America . " <p> Despite his warnings not to jump to conclusions , De La Torre used his knowledge of the religion to try and decipher why and for whom the Tewksbury offering was made . That 's no easy task in a religion whose origin can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretations of a ritual can range wildly . <p> But by examining the contents of the box and even the colors of the items left inside , De La Torre said it 's possible to detect to which orishas , or deities , an individual is praying . There are about seven deities which have gained the most popularity in the United States , he said . <p> The box 's discovery at an intersection and the red candles inside prompted De La Torre to think of the Santeria god Eleggua , who rules over crossroads and is said to have the power over fortune and misfortune . Eleggua is also known sometimes as a trickster , De La Torre said , and could take kindly to the coins in the box as well . <p> De La Torre said if the box was placed on the Monday it was discovered , the holy day for Eleggua , it would provide further evidence an orisha was being called upon . <p> The oranges and potatoes in the box reminded De La Torre of Inle , an orisha who is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be an offering for help with a medical problem . It 's left at a crossroads , so it 's as if the person is seeking to open the paths to healing , " De La Torre said , adding : " That 's my educated guess . I could be totally wrong . " <p> A religion kept quiet <p> De La Torre acknowledged that discovering a box filled with such unexpected items could be unnerving for residents of the rural bedroom township , but he said it 's a simple case of a different culture . <p> " I 'm assuming that the folks in that county once a year , get their own fowl , say a turkey , and then offer it in thanks to their deity for all the blessing of the year . They call that Thanksgiving , " De La Torre said . <p> " And we do n't see anything wrong with that because it 's our tradition , " he continued . " In this tradition , there is also an offering to a god for thanks and prayers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . " <p> De La Torre said it 's hard to put a finger on how many people practice Santeria nationwide . The persecution of the religion in Cuba , where it was popularized , has led many practitioners to keep it secret , he said . <p> The religion has gained a following in urban areas , De La Torre said , and not just by people of Cuban or Hispanic descent . An increasingly diverse population is " finding this religion within the melting pot of the United States . " <p> On getting older 
 of Lehigh Valley Plastics today , Gov . Tom Corbett said the Bethlehem Township , Pa. , plastic manufacturer is an example of what both business and government should do to survive tough times . <p> The 42-year-old company survived the recent economic recession and is almost back to its prerecession revenue and employment levels , Corbett said . <p> " What business does , government needs to do , which is control our costs , " he said , referring to his recent budget proposal that slightly cuts state spending . " You are the people who create the jobs it 's not the government sector .

When asked if he would consider one , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this company should pay an extra tax because you 're making money ? " The question was greeted with hearty laughter . <p> Corbett said natural gas companies pay all the state business taxes like other industries and should n't be subject to taxes on top of those he is considering , like a local impact fee for affected municipalities and counties . <p> Lehigh Valley Plastics President Dave Keim said he likes Corbett 's positions on industry , especially the possibility of tax credits for job creation . <p> " The less taxes , the more we can spend to expand our business , " he said . <p> Lehigh Valley Plastics moved to its North Commerce Way facility in 2006 after 35 years in Allentown . The larger facility was intended to allow for expansion , and the company 's workforce grew from 115 to 155 from 2006 to 2008 , Keim said . <p> The recession forced the company to cut staff to 120 but management hopes to hire an additional 10 employees this year , he said . <p> The company also is within 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to top that number this year , he said .

 neighbors at odds over volume of worship services <p> View full sizeExpress-Times Photo MATT SMITH Terrence Miller stands on his porch last week with Church of God by Faith sits in the background . Miller and his neighbors are complaining about the noise at the church . <p> Is it noise or the joyous sounds of worship ? <p> If you live next to a church , should you be subjected to each note , word and utterance voiced every Sunday , or is that just part of living in a tight urban neighborhood ? <p> There 's a potential First Amendment tussle brewing in the city 's West Ward , where neighbors have grown weary of boisterous sermons emanating weekly from the Church of God By Faith mostly during Sunday morning services that last into the afternoon . <p> City council members , meanwhile , are reluctant to do anything that may infringe on parishioners ' right to worship . <p> The issue began simmering about three years ago as the volume of services at the pentecostal church in the 600 block of Walnut Street slowly escalated , particularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor Terrence Miller , who lives within the church 's shadow at Ferry and Walnut streets . <p> He reports using a decibel meter to measure average noise levels of 70 decibels inside his living room with measurements peaking at 90 to more than 100 decibels . He even posted a video on YouTube in May 2011 to illustrate the problem . <p> A city ordinance prohibits making noise that causes a disturbance across a property line , but church worship services are exempt . <p> Heading to city hall <p> Describing himself as a devout Christian , Miller said he 's engaged the church by making financial donations , repairing pews and chasing people out of the parking lot because of what he sees as a responsibility to be a good neighbor . And he has no desire to limit the church 's right or ability to worship only to see its congregation find a middle ground with the neighborhood . <p> Things quieted down last spring for about a month before the volume again began to rise , Miller said . He claims to have written letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's recently reached out to city council and attended council meetings . <p> " Does that church have the responsibility to police its noise issues ? I think it does , " Miller said . <p> City Councilman Jeff Warren invited the pastor , Michael Brown , and members of the congregation to a Public Safety Committee meeting earlier this month to discuss the matter . Bible in hand , Brown addressed the issue by quoting Scripture . <p> As if he were standing at the pulpit on a Sunday morning , Brown preached that he and his congregation have the right to worship and praise God , and he dismissed Miller 's characterization of the " noise " emanating from the church . <p> " It 's not noise , " Brown said . " It 's praise to the God we serve . " <p> A phone number listed for the Church of God By Faith was disconnected , and Brown could not be reached for additional comment for this story . <p> The city noise ordinance specifically exempts church worship services , and council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council meeting expressed no desire to ask the church to operate under any restriction . <p> But Miller does n't share council 's view , arguing this is a public health problem . <p> " City council seems determined that this is a First Amendment issue , " he said . " We ca n't practice that way in my house because the institutional church , according to the city , has more rights than someone practicing in their own way . " <p> Letter of the law <p> But the neighborhood may have difficulty convincing the city that it can legally ask the church to quiet down , according to constitutional and legal experts . <p> Houses of worship do receive accommodations when it comes to things like zoning laws , but a local government could apply a noise ordinance without violating the First Amendment , provided it 's a religiously neutral law and a municipality shows " reasonable government interest " in trying to regulate noise , according to Silverstein . <p> " A municipality would want to make sure it was n't imposing a regulation on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonreligious institution , " she said . <p> The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act enacted by Congress in 2000 , however , places a much higher standard on local governments , Silverstein said . <p> " So there has to be a compelling reason for the government to regulate and the action has to be imposed in the least restrictive way possible and ca n't substantially burden religious exercise , " she said . <p> Attempting to regulate noise generated at a Sunday morning sermon is a much harder sell , for instance , than a church pumping out 90 decibels at 3 a.m. , Silverstein said . She noted that Easton would need to carefully weigh any change to its noise ordinance , considering it already exempts houses of worship . <p> Miller further questions whether an individual has just as much right not to hear a religious message as a church has to worship . Neither Silverstein , nor Mary Catherine Roper , senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania , believes such an argument can be made . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be listening to it , " Roper said . " There 's no right to a cone of silence around your property . " <p> Roper , who lives in Philadelphia , said she 's not without sympathy if the neighborhood feels the church 's sermons are too loud . But it 's not a unique situation , especially in a close urban neighborhood , and the city under state and federal law would need to prove it necessary to limit the noise , she said . <p> She offered the example of a hospice situated next to a church in which particularly loud worship services could affect patient care . <p> " This is one of those circumstances where religious services are protected more than other types of activities and the city should exhibit caution , " Roper said . <p> Finding middle ground <p> The Rev. Phil Davis , of Greater Shiloh Church , attended this month 's Public Safety Committee meeting to show his support for another church and , if need be , oppose any proposed restrictions . <p> A church needs to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of God by Faith has been in the neighborhood for many years and the city ca n't hinder anyone 's ability to worship . <p> There are similar situations in the West Ward of churches situated in and coexisting with residential neighbors without complaint , Davis said . <p> " My stance is that the church has been there a long time and is an integral part of the community , " he said . " I 'm sure there 's a common ground . There 's always more that can bring us together than separates us . " <p> For now , Miller is considering options that include petitioning neighbors to amend the noise ordinance , working with West Ward Neighborhood Partnership to craft a solution , exploring legal options and inviting city council members to his home on a Sunday to experience the noise themselves . <p> Ultimately , he told city council he would have preferred the issue never even made it to their collective desk . <p> " For Christians to come together as brothers and sisters with government to find a solution is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oxford Nanopore (

But Lampanelli 's no-nonsense attitude did n't sit well with Gotti , who was given the task of stage manager and felt she was being left out of the fun . <p> One of my favorite quotes of the night came from Lampanelli , poking at Gotti for showing up to practice wearing a designer messenger bag . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Ferrigno 's character " won " the swordfight and , in turn , the hand of Lady Dee , who pulled down her veil , only to reveal her , let 's say , unsightly grimace .

Actress Tia Carrere and singer Debbie Gibson also went at it , with Gibson having a brief , and unintended , wardrobe malfunction . Singer Aubrey O'Day finished the skit by charging in as Snooki from " The Jersey Shore . " <p> However , Gotti missed some of her lighting and sound cues . Later in the boardroom , Lampanelli called out Gotti , who questioned Lampanelli 's leadership skills .

But I digress ... <p> Trump revealed that the audience voted for Team Unanimous ' performance as their favorite of the two .

Trump asked the latter who he would bring with him to the hot seat and he picked Ferrigno and Takei though both men , like the rest of the team , praised the entertainer for his leadership and performance skills . <p> Naturally , Ferrigno and Jillette made up as the men 's team got along almost too well . ( You and I both know that wo n't last the whole season ) . <p> While Team Unanimous played nice with each other , Lampanelli returned to the boardroom with Gotti and Mendoza in tow . After more seemingly endless back-and-forth bickering between Gotti and Lampanelli , Trump sided with the " Queen of Mean " and told Gotti " you 're fired . " <h> Daily Edition <p>

He hopes to amend the bylaws that prevent trustees from holding independent investigations and from talking with faculty , students or alumni on pending issues , he said . <p> He argues current policies force trustees to rely too much on Penn State 's president for information . <p> Fulmer said he finds it shocking that trustees can not publicly question actions of the board . <p> " That is scary to me , " he said . <p> Fulmer said he has been disappointed to see so much focus on Paterno and not on sex abuse victims and Sandusky 's alleged crimes . He believes Penn State has been unfairly disparaged , noting alumni and students banded together to raise money for child abuse victims and drummed up million to fight pediatric cancer during THON . <p> " The governor has a clear conflict of interest when he is campaigning for cutting the state 's contribution to the university 's budget and then deciding how that money will be spent , or more importantly , what programs should be cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Penn State a place for Pennsylvanians to get an affordable , high-quality education , he said . <p> Fulmer is joined on the ballot by a diverse group of candidates .

Those candidates include prominent donor Anthony Lubrano , whose name is on the campus baseball stadium . <p> Fulmer is a member of the group but fears it erred by selecting three candidates who fit the mold of the current board . Fulmer applauded Lubrano 's generosity to the university , but worries that Lubrano , whom he does not know , is just another example of the " ol ' boy network .

Using marking paints available on the job , it took Pappas about a year to complete and is dated March 15 , 1985 . <p> Pappas served much of his 33 years of service as operator of one of the two rotary straighteners that were the transition points between the combination mill and the beam yards . <p> The " rotaries , " as they were called , were massive machines about high with rows of rolls positioned one above the other . When the beams were drawn between the top and bottom rolls , they were straightened . They transformed the bars into 200-foot-long pieces , or " blooms , " ready to be cut to length , piled and shipped . <p> Pappas , of Bethlehem Township , Pa. , was also an artist of some renown . The accompanying painting is one of his works . It shows some of the workers who toiled in the rotary straightener work areas . Each of the seven dwarfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jiminy Cricket , Mickey Mouse and Pinocchio is based on the personality of an individual steelworker . <p> The combination mill , or " the Combo , " the mill 's shorthand name , was the last structural steel mill at the Bethlehem plant . It opened Dec. 15 , 1968 and was closed March 21 , 1997 , 15 years ago Wednesday . <p> The mill got its name from its ability to roll a wide variety of structural shapes in various weights and sizes , from angles and channels to I-beams , H-beams and sheet piling . Running at full capacity , the mill could produce over a million tons of structural steel annually . When the plant 's hot end principally the blast furnaces and the rolling mill were shut down in 1995 , the Combo kept rolling , supplied with ingots of raw steel from the Steel 's Steelton plant and other outside sources . <p> Its closing signaled the end of an era and a way of life for generations of steelworkers who worked the mills and the beam yards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 64 , there were 2,380 guys in the yard , " Pappas said .

Workers , then about 220 in the beam yard and less than 100 in the mill , were each given a quarter-inch slice of the last beam as a keepsake . <p> " The next day , I was on Labor , " Pappas said . " I worked for Bobby ( Supon , labor foreman ) in the yard . There was nobody there . There were about 10 of us going around picking up tools .

For the past five years , he battled leukemia and was recently informed by his doctors that he needed a bone marrow transplant to survive . <p> Fortunately , this story ends happily . Simon 's 10-year-old sister , Sydni , was a match , and she was able to donate the bone marrow Simon needed to keep on fighting . The surgery was a success , and today he is home and progressing well . <p> It is great when a search like Simon 's ends happily , but that is not always the case . <p> Like Simon , thousands of patients with life-threatening diseases depend on a bone marrow transplant .

As of March 2011 , there were 318 patients in Pennsylvania who were searching for a marrow donor outside of their families . <p> We have the power to help . More than 650,000 new potential donors joined the registry last year .

The man loved to kid people and could find the humor of a situation unlike any other person in the department , according to his co-workers . You could count on the officer to use his sense of humor to diffuse difficult situations and gain others ' trust . <p> " Danny had a grasp for how to solve problems and how to do stuff like that , " said city police Capt . David Kravatz , who worked alongside Rice . " He was darn near the envy of his co-workers because of the humor that he had . Some guys do n't get that in 25 years . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Danny Rice 's real strength was his ability to break down barriers and communicate . DiLuzio said he learned the importance of the skill set from Rice , his former field training officer . <p> " Communication is a police officer 's No. 1 weapon , " DiLuzio said . " He taught me to be down there with the people . When you go on a call shake their hand , treat them like family . You 'd be amazed what people will open up about . " <p> It was , Kravatz said , the perfect example of what officials want in a community policing officer today . <p> " Before community policing was a buzzword , he was one of those guys that lived it , worked it , " Kravatz said . " In a way ( he and his partners ) were probably models for it .

Creighton , a scholar in American literature , has been serving as interim president at Haverford , in Montgomery County 's Lower Merion Township . <p> " I think it 's the right time , " Weiss said of his decision to leave Lafayette . " I think Lafayette is in as strong a position as it 's ever been . " <p> He said the college had a record number of applicants this year , that fundraising is strong and the quality of the students is improving . The school is among the nation 's best in graduates finding employment , what Weiss referred to as " outcomes . " <p> " On all of these metrics , Lafayette is thriving , " he said . <p> Move is ' right fit ' <p> Weiss said he 's sad to be leaving Easton but that Haverford was the " right fit " for him . <p> Weiss came to Lafayette in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downtown . During his tenure , the college announced plans for an arts campus on North Third Street and the surrounding neighborhood that would include performance and exhibit spaces . It expands on the Williams Visual Arts Building that was carved out of an auto repair garage several years ago at the base of College Hill . <p> The president and Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr . have worked together on such initiatives as the Easton Ambassadors program , which provides information to visitors in addition to swept sidewalks . Panto today called Weiss ' departure " not just a loss for the college but a loss for the community . " <p> Besides the arts campus , Weiss has the college studying the West Ward 's lack of access to community grocery stores and fresh produce , Panto said . <p> Weiss , the mayor said , helped instill the importance of community relations in the college 's board of trustees . <p> Weiss , who with wife Sandra , a local lawyer , has children ages 12 and 15 , said he believes the college 's commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 've built a model of community-college relations , " Weiss said .

" There 's going to be a new president at some point . Hopefully , ( he or she ) will be of the same mind . " <p> Presidential search <p> The board of trustees will form a committee to begin the search for a new president , Weiss said . He said he plans to help with a " smooth transition " in whatever way he can . He said he kept the board up to date while he was in the running for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a job , " Weiss said , adding that eight years at the helm is about right for a college president . " These things happen . " <p> Ruggles said the timing is n't good as far as a major fundraising campaign . While Weiss said the capital campaign was not about to enter the public phase , Ruggles said that would come soon and the transition could complicate the effort . <p> " The president is the face " of the campaign , Ruggles said . <p> Weiss became the 16th president of Lafayette on July 1 , 2005 , succeeding Arthur Rothkopf . The had been the dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at The Johns Hopkins University as well as an art history professor . <p> Weiss made a salary of , with a total compensation of , according to Lafayette 's 2009 IRS Form 990 , the latest available . <p> Weiss ' predecessor at Haverford , Stephen G.

The board remains firmly committed to the vision for Lafayette set forth in the strategic plan whose development he led , " board of trustees Chairman Edward W. Ahart , Lafayette Class of 1969 , said in a story posted on the college 's website . " We remain resolved to building on the momentum that has been established toward achieving the plan 's goals and to maintaining Lafayette 's position as a premier small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences , and engineering and has international reach and presence . " <p> Athletic scholarships , culminating in recent months with the addition of football grants , were added during Weiss ' tenure . The rebuilt Fisher Stadium opened in November 2006 after a privately funded million upgrade . <p> The college also during Weiss ' tenure undertook a serious study of how fraternities and sororities fit in to campus life . Greek organizations in 2011 were given three years to " enhance the quality " of the experience , and the study could lead to the organizations being removed from campus . <p> In 2007 , the college celebrated the 250th birthday of its namesake , the Marquis de Lafayette. <h> Implosion makes way

 because they either failed to file state tax returns specific to the zone by the Jan. 30 deadline , or failed to file returns altogether , said Allison Roberts , spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue . <p> Roberts said 207 of those 241 businesses failed to file any of the returns . <p> This was the first time businesses were required to submit the returns , and officials have acknowledged there may have been some confusion with regard to what had to be filed and by when . <p> " But it 's our responsibility to carry out our administrative duties with regard to the ( zone ) and enforce the requirements set forth in the law , " she said . " The law requires a penalty , so we 're obliged to impose that penalty .

 Locascio , of Hope Township , appears in New Jersey Superior Court in Belvidere during the vehicular homicide trial in 2009 that ended with her conviction . The guilty verdict was reversed , according to an appellate court decision published Friday . <p> New Jersey Superior Court judges decided Friday that Jennifer Lee n't receive a fair trial , due primarily to faulty " expert " witnesses and dismissal of contradicting testimony , according to the judges ' opinion published Friday . The three-judge panel ordered a new trial . <p> The crux of the 32-page opinion renews the debate at the heart of the 2009 trial : whether Locascio was the driver in the Nov. 16 , 2006 , crash that killed her boyfriend , Ryan Berry , 25 , of Frelinghuysen Township . <p> Both were intoxicated at the time after leaving a bar where they celebrated Locascio 's 24th birthday , authorities said . A jury believed she was behind the wheel and found her guilty after a six-day trial . <p> Defense attorney George Daggett objected to testimony by former Warren County Medical Examiner Isidore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was overruled . <p> As an expert in strictly " pathological medicine " and not accident reconstruction , Mihalakis " transgressed the scope of his qualifications , " Superior Court Appellate Division Judge Jack M.

" ... Such opinions address far more than matters of pathology and causes of injuries that Dr. Mihalakis observed in performing the autopsy of Berry ... .

He did n't specifically analyze whether or not Berry was the driver , according to the opinion . <p> In an interview Friday , Mihalakis , who retired in December 2010 and continues to work in forensic pathology , said he did n't remember details of the case . He said that throughout his career , during which he provided expert testimony in more than 600 legal cases , he 'd render an opinion based on police reconstruction reports . <p> " I do n't reconstruct , " Mihalakis said . " Based on the reconstructionist 's report as to how the vehicles moved about , then I can determine who was seated where .

These three dueled in the driving rain in the district cross country championships with Stoner outkicking Darlington over the final stretch to win by a stride and a half . The weather should be better , and even though none of these girls will likely double at the PIAA Championships , these two races could be classics . Stoner is the favorite , but the times for all three could really be good . <p> The Class AAA boys 400 meters . Yes , I know the Lehigh Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dud . But if Freedom 's Jarrod Dilts and Nazareth 's Andrew Bridgeforth do n't get DQ'ed this time , those two plus Nazareth 's Tanner Lipsky could run in the 48s , something only 12 runners in this region have ever done . <p> The Class AA boys 110 high hurdles . LVC champion Tyler Horton of Bethlehem Catholic finds himself as the No. 2 seed ( 14.68 ) behind Tamaqua 's Eric Hertzog ( 14.65 ) .

Right down to the hand-chipped ice , things are done slowly and methodically here . <p> Your drink wo n't come out fast . If you want a quick drink , go somewhere else .

 airs ' on the side of unconventional <p> Courtesy conventional convertibles , the Fiat 500 Cabrio retains its pillars and doorframes . This design enables it to be driven with the top open to any of three positions , and permits the top to be closed at speeds up to 50 mph . <p> As he surveyed the olive green Fiat 500c sitting in the driveway , Brandon 's face looked as if he had just sucked on a lemon slice dipped in jalape ? o juice . <p> " Just what we need , " he said . " A Fiat ! " <p> He spat the word Fiat and simultaneously shook his head like a nanny admonishing a naughty toddler . <p> " But it 's a convertible , " I said . " I thought you like convertibles . " <p> " I do , but I do n't like Fiats . And it 's not even a REAL convertible . " <p> That depends on your definition of the word . What Brandon should have said is that the Fiat 500c ( Cabrio ) is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional convertible , and the only thing remaining above the beltline is a windshield and perhaps a trace of the folded top . <p> But look at the 500c in profile and you might not realize that 's it 's a cabriolet . That 's because it retains its pillars , doorframes , and even a horseshoe sliver of a roof . <p> The rest of the roof is a cloth top that , at the push of a button , can be peeled back all the way to the trunk . <p> The Fiat 500c is the automotive world 's version of a sardine can . But it 's the cutest sardine can ever conceived , and its distinctive design has some real advantages over a conventional convertible . <p> Start with its structural integrity . Because side pillars and roofs help prevent car bodies from twisting and torqueing , removing them presents problems for automotive engineers . <p> But the extra bracing adds weight . So do the electrical and mechanical components of conventional soft-top and hardtop convertibles . The folded tops and components that operate them also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops become sails or wind foils when they 're operating . They can only be activated while the car is stationary or at slow speeds . <p> For example , by merely getting scalped instead of decapitated , the 500c retains much of its structural integrity . Its only additional bracing is in the front windshield frame , which is slightly taller than the 500 hatchback 's windshield . <p> Enjoyable if unconventional <p> The 500c 's cloth top , which folds like an accordion , also employs less hardware than conventional convertible tops . <p> As a result , the Cabrio weighs just 52 pounds more than the 500 hatchback and sacrifices only about a half-inch of rear-seat hip room . The soft-top , which features a glass rear window with defroster , can be opened at speeds up to 60 mph and closed in seconds at speeds up to 50 mph . <p> Unlike conventional convertibles , the 500c 's top can be used in different stages of " openness . " Stage 1 provides a giant sunroof above only the front seats . Stage 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 is fully open , with the top resting on top of the trunk lid . <p> When it 's closed , the 500 Cabrio 's insulated top does a terrific job of muting wind and road noise , even at highway speeds . <p> When it 's closed , the 500 Cabrio 's insulated top does a terrific job of muting wind and road noise , even at highway speeds . It is n't until the 500c reaches highway speeds that wind buffeting becomes noticeable with the top down . <p> But that 's true of most convertibles . Most convertibles , however , treat the driver to unobstructed views of the world with their tops down . The 500c , on the other hand , provides a clear view of only the sky . Like the hatchback , its " B " and " C " pillars get in the way . <p> But its much easier to see directly behind in a 500 hatchback than a top-down 500c . That 's because its fully lowered top sits in a big clump , like a novice camper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . This renders the rearview mirror nearly useless . <p> Thank goodness the 500c has decent powered side door mirrors . The driver 's side has a convex inset whose panoramic view exemplifies the expression " objects are closer than they appear . " <p> The Cabrio also has a much smaller trunk ( 5.4 vs. 9.5 cubic feet ) and trunk opening than other 500s . And although its rear seatbacks fold , they form a narrow pass-through rather than the spacious cargo hold of the hatchback . <p> But convertible fans do n't buy them for their utility ; they buy them to enjoy open-air motoring . <p> As stylish , nimble , and as much fun to drive as its hatchback counterpart , Fiat 's 500c delivers on that promise . <h> A Goofy State

At the end of the time period , the man and woman with the most votes are declared the Chapter 's Man and Woman of the Year at a grand finale event held on June 21 at SteelStacks in Bethlehem . <p> To gather donations , many candidates are turning to social media to connect with Facebook friends and Twitter followers .

 ruling will affect Easton case of Batts <p> View full sizeExpress-Times File Batts , shown here during the opening day of his murder trial . <p> The U.S. Supreme Court today said it 's unconstitutional to sentence juveniles to life in prison without parole for murder a ruling that will have a direct effect on the case of Batts . <p> Batts was 14 in February 2006 and an up-and-comer in the Bloods street gang when he fatally shot 16-year-old Clarence " C.J. " Edwards in the 700 block of Spring Garden Street in Easton . <p> At 16 , Batts was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole . Today 's Supreme Court ruling offers hope for Batts that he wo n't spend the rest of his life behind bars . <p> But the question of if and when Batts might gain freedom remains an open one that will result in additional court hearings and perhaps a new sentencing . <p> The high court threw out Americans ' ability to send children to prison for the rest of their lives with no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with others the court has made , including ruling out the death penalty for juveniles and life without parole for young people whose crimes did not involve killing . <p> The decision came in the robbery and murder cases of Evan Miller and Kuntrell Jackson , who were 14 when they were convicted . <p> Miller was convicted of killing a man in Alabama . Jackson was convicted of being an accomplice in an Arkansas robbery that ended in murder . <p> Northampton County Assistant District Attorney Terry Houck , who prosecuted Batts , reacted with dismay when told of the court 's decision this morning . Batts ' crime , which Houck described as a cold-blooded execution , is far more heinous than the two cases that appeared before the Supreme Court , he said . Edwards ' murder was premeditated and committed for self-gain , Houck said , and the assistant district attorney plans on arguing that Batts should never be allowed to be released from prison . <p> Jun 26 ,

 Photo COLIN Roberto Clemente Charter School in Allentown , which currently teaches grades six to 12 and is seeking to expand to elementary students . <p> Eighteen months after the Allentown School Board rejected it , the Roberto Clemente Charter School is still fighting to open its doors to elementary students . <p> The board in February 2011 narrowly voted down a proposal to expand the downtown school , which currently serves grades six to 12 , to include students from kindergarten to fifth grade . <p> The charter school , at South Fourth and Union streets , is appealing the board 's decision , and on Friday the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court cleared the way for its appeal to move forward to the state level . <p> The board voted 5-4 against the proposed expansion , claiming the charter school 's application did n't offer anything innovative for the new students it was seeking to take in . <p> " We did n't see anything they were offering that was anything different than what we were offering , which is one of the requirements for a charter school , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time argued the board 's decision was based on budgetary concerns and countered that charter applications can not be rejected for financial reasons , according to board meeting minutes . <p> Robert Smith Jr . <p> Board President Robert Smith Jr. , who cast one of the four votes in favor of the expansion , agreed with that assessment and said he believes the charter school 's appeal will ultimately succeed . <p> " They have a good track record with the middle and high school level , and there 's a tremendous waiting list on elementary children , " Smith said . " I just thought they deserved to expand . " <p> The charter school filed an appeal last year , but the school district argued it should be dismissed for procedural reasons because the signatures were not properly submitted . <p> The school was required to obtain 1,000 signatures from among residents living in the district , according to court documents . <p> The Lehigh County Court rejected the district 's argument on Feb. 16 , and the Commonwealth Court upheld that decision Friday , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter will now proceed to the Pennsylvania Charter School Appeal Board for a final decision , said Rebecca Young , an attorney for the Allentown School District . <p> The expansion would nearly double the school 's 320-student enrollment . Proponents said it would increase student safety and keep class sizes small . <p> But during the meetings last year , board Vice President Julie Ambrose said those are not valid reasons to support a charter application , and that the school failed to prove its programs were innovative , according to meeting minutes . <p> Ambrose , who was not available for comment Monday , pointed out most arguments in the application were related to the school 's high school program , and she suggested it expand those services rather than take on elementary students , according to the minutes . <p> The board 's vote came as a great surprise to its supporters , Smith said , because the board 's education committee had voted 5-4 in favor of the proposed expansion just two weeks earlier . <p> Former board member Holly Edinger changed her vote in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes .

The original two-story open floor plan has been split into two separate floors . The conservatory room , spanning the length of Sayre 's library addition , has a glass ceiling that gives guests a 180-degree view of Bethlehem and is referred to as a " tree-top refuge . " <p> The mansion 's only other restored pieces include the original interior hallway , main staircase , detailed carved ceiling on the second floor and a marble fireplace in the front room , says Ohlandt .

 high heels , flats and those must-have , shoes <p> View full Photo Alvaro heels may make your calves look good , but what havoc are they wreaking on your toes ? <p> In a mall they ca n't be missed , and people flock to store windows just to stare . Shrines are built in closets just to house them . <p> The average American owns 11 pairs of shoes according to a survey by Eneslow , a company that makes and sells footwear support . However , that number does not represent the amount of shoes that are typically worn . <p> Round , flat , pointed , platform and kitten are just some of the many varieties that shoes comes in ; although cramped , sore , pinched and blistered feet are what those fancy shoes provide . But what makes shoes so uncomfortable ? Dr. Joseph Saka blames it on the toe box . <p> During a Healthy Woman Event " Oh My Aching Feet ; the perils of wearing high heels " held at Easton Hospital during the summer , Saka explained why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of the shoe where the toes go . <p> " A narrow toe box compresses the toes together . This causes the metatarsal bones to pull on the toe , " says Saka who specializes in medicine and surgery of the foot and ankle . <p> By forcing toes into tight spaces , women can experience hammer toes , a disorder where toes claw up . This bending of the toes tightens and shortens muscles and tendons . Tight shoes can also cause bunions , but bunions can also be caused by a biochemically flawed foot . <p> " When they put that 4 inch ( wide across the toes ) foot in a 3 inch shoe , something 's got ta give , " he says . <p> The height of the heel and the movement of the foot may serve to put more pressure on the toes as they are squished into the tight space below . <p> Although , height is n't always a bad thing .

Joseph Saka , examines a foot following his workshop on High Heel dangers at Easton Hospital . <p> The key to wearing heels is moderation , Saka explains . " You do n't have to forget style , just remember comfort . ... If the shoes feel comfortable when you put them on they 're probably okay , but if they hurt , you should n't wear them ; it 's that simple , " he says . <p> For shoe shopping , Saka suggests trying on shoes at the end of the day when feet are swollen from walking . This will make it easy to find the best fitting shoe . <p> Although heels get a bad reputation for being harmful to the feet , flats can cause much more damage .

Bunions are removed at the source using techniques that prevent them from returning and hammer toes ( where the toe bends downward ) can be permanently corrected . <p> The other solution is orthotic support , but Saka says to stay away from gimmicks like the Dr. Scholl 's machine that dispenses pads and supports based on the way someone stands and the pressure they apply . For someone with serious comfort needs is better off getting custom orthotic pieces that are made from molds of their own feet . <p> " I 'm going to think on his advice .

 of the Year ? How about ' forfeit ? ' <p> View full sizeExpress-Times Photo MATT North Hunterdon vs . Delaware Valley Regional High School wrestling match was a rarity Wednesday night no forfeits . In this bout at 125 pounds , Del Val 's Bobby Stevely , top , controls Brandon Loftus en route to a 7-1 victory . From my viewpoint , the early frontrunner for 2010 Express-Times Wrestler of the Year is " forfeit . " Perusing through the 17 wrestling team summaries published in The Express-Times on Thursday , only three matches Parkland vs . Freedom , North Hunterdon vs . Delaware Valley and Warren Hills vs . Franklin were void of forfeits . This discourse wo n't even discuss lopsided scores . <p> Still , it 's difficult to ignore that Easton , Nazareth and Bethlehem Catholic defeated the three Allentown wrestling squads by a combined . What chance did Allen have of beating the Red Rovers knowing it was going to forfeit six of the 14 weight classes ? Central Catholic forfeited three times against Nazareth . 's 70-0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huskies conceded just one weight class but unfavorable matchups . <p> In the Colonial League , forfeits reign supreme . For instance , Notre Dame defeated Palmerton 48-30 with 24 points coming from four Blue Bombers forfeits . Even perennial power Wilson appears to be in a down cycle forfeiting four weights in a loss to Catasauqua . Then there 's Salisbury , which sent just five wrestlers to the mat in a 75-3 loss to Pen Argyl . <p> Our New Jersey teams seem to do a better job of fielding full teams , even though P'burg forfeited a pair of weights to Voorhees . , Hills and North meets had just one forfeit each . Let 's give the Garden Staters a trophy for participation . <p> Why all the forfeits ? Here are some reasons I 'm hearing : <p> Fewer kids participating . <p> Wrestlers who drop out if they do n't crack the starting lineup as freshmen or sophomores . <p> Coaches refusing to put inexperienced wrestlers on the mat with state qualifiers or the like . <p> Burnout among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling among the upper weights . <p> Something has to change . Here are a couple of suggestions : <p> If a team does n't have enough wrestlers to field at least half the weights , it can not compete in a dual meet and the match is not held . <p> If that 's not politically correct , then schedule tri or quad meets in which the weaker teams all line up to face a stronger team in one day . The stronger team can utilize its depth in the multiple meets ; the weaker teams can make their taxpayers happy by saving on transportation costs . <p> Create eight-man leagues . It 's not a concept that 's popular on the east coast , but in some midwestern and western states , many rural schools play 8-man football because of the lack of students . Statistics are insane , the players take it just as seriously as a Texas big schools state championship and it 's the perfect vehicle for the small communities . Why not incorporate the same concepts and encourage some of our smaller schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join a league in which dual meets include just seven weight classes ? Once the postseason begins , these wrestlers still would be eligible to compete at any of the 14 weight classes . <p> It 's just a thought , but I 'm sure getting tired of typing and reading the word forfeit three-to-four times a week . <p> Rabbi Yechiel London

 Cash 's final album , ' Ai n't No Grave ' a fitting goodbye for a music legend <p> Photo Courtesy of Lost Highway Records " Ai n't No Grave " is a collection of the last songs Johnny Cash ever recorded , including " Corinthians 15:55 , " the last song he Cash had a remarkable life , but the way he shuffled off his mortal coil is really something to admire . <p> Through disease , the loss of his soulmate , June Carter Cash , and the ravages of age , the Man in Black kept working at his craft , up to the end , almost . The songs on " American VI : Ai n't No Grave " were recorded less than four months before his death in September 2003 . <p> You could argue that death has been present in Cash 's songs throughout his career : He " shot a man in Reno just to watch him die , " for starters . At the other end of his body of work , the Rick Rubin-produced " American Recordings " are filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " The Mercy Seat , " " Hang My Head " and others . <p> But on " Ai n't No Grave " the specter of Cash 's own death is ever-present but never haunting . The title track sets the tone for an artist who can confront his fate with , if not relief , certainly a lack of fear . <p> In a news release , Rubin said he thought the recording sessions that resulted in the 10-song " Ai n't No Grave " were what kept Cash alive after June Cash 's death . <p> " I think it was the only thing that kept him going , " Rubin said . <p> Cash 's voice sounds weakest on the opener and gets stronger as he goes along .

When Cash asks , " Death , where is thy sting ? " it 's not so much a question as a challenge . He sounds unimpressed by the threat of death . This song seems like the basis for every other selection on " Ai n't No Grave . " <p> Cash 's sendoff comes in the form of " Aloha Oe " by Queen Liliuokalani .

I ca n't remember my exact thoughts when Jay said that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least some people in the world still have some sense about youth sports . <p> A few years ago , a former colleague of mine said someone in her daughter 's T-ball league signed up a 3-year-old to play . Let me repeat that - a 3-year-old . <p> I know there is always a tendency to romanticize the good ole ' days when comparing them to the present , but that 's not how I remember youth sports when I played beginning 21 years ago . And just to be sure my memory was correct , I called my parents . <p> To begin with , I did n't start playing organized baseball until I was 7 , moving to softball when I was 9 . Now , that did n't stop me from playing ball before that , however , baseball in the field with neighborhood kids played with a tennis ball is a far cry from playing with a hardball with a bunch of kids who are n't always paying attention to what is taking place on the field , even if the baseballs are softened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as practice is concerned , we did that once a week for about two hours and my mom thinks that happened on a Saturday morning , not when 6- and should have a story read to them before they get into bed . And once games began , practices all but stopped for the first few years . <p> Now obviously as I got older and games actually became competitive , sports took up more time , but never did a single sport actually take over my life . Even when I played 18-and-under fastpitch softball there was a limit to what we did . During the winter , we practiced Sunday nights for about an hour-and-a-half ; once games began in the summer , we did n't practice unless we did n't have a doubleheader or tournament that week . <p> And because leagues and coaches realized that dare I say it the world does not revolve around sports , I was able to play three sports at Dieruff High School and went on to play softball at Moravian College . <p> Want a better example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at risk of injury by starting them too early , having them play too much or having them perform certain skills such as sliding or throwing a curve ball before they are physically ready to ? <p> Take my other older brother Josh . He did n't play organized baseball until he was 8 , never attended a baseball camp and also played multiple sports growing up . After playing baseball and basketball at Dieruff , Josh earned a scholarship to play Division I baseball at Liberty University and was drafted in the fourth round of the 2001 MLB amateur draft by the St. Louis Cardinals . <p> What 's the root of this sports insanity ? There 's no clear-cut answer or even an all-inclusive list , but here 's just a few ideas that come to mind : <p> Parents living vicariously through their kids . <p> Parents thinking they have the next Derek Jeter , Peyton Manning or LeBron James on their hands . <p> Coaches forgetting that youth sports are for fun and learning the game , not winning . <p> And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become youth sports , I have a game plan to bring a bit of reform to them . Next week I 'll propose some guidelines and rules that will help regain the proper perspective on youth sports . <p> Childhood obesity has

 five keys to unlock success in Game 4 of Stanley Cup finals <p> AP Photo KATHY Flyers players celebrate as they leave the ice after beating the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 in the overtime period of Game 3 of the NHL Stanley Cup hockey finals.Now that the thrills and tingles from the Philadelphia Flyers ' overtime thriller of a win Wednesday in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals have dissipated , time to take a cold , hard look at reality and analyze what the Flyers need to do to send the series back to Chicago tied . <p> And let 's face it , they pretty much have to even up the series now . If the Blackhawks win tonight 's Game 4 ( 8 p.m. , Versus ) they will be in control , having taken a game on the road and going home with the momentum . That would be almost as high a mountain to climb for the Flyers as the comeback against Boston , given that the Blackhawks present a superior challenge to the Bruins . So Game 4 is about as critical as Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to unlock victory . <p> 1 ) Irritate Dustin Byfuglien . The Hawks ' burly , forward has had but little impact in the series after he dominated the Western Conference semis and finals . That 's mostly due to the masterful job Flyers defenseman Chris Pronger is doing in keeping him away from the crease and not allowing him a head of steam behind the net . Byfuglien 's frustration is starting to show in little chips and bits here and there , such as the moronic slash of Pronger Wednesday that produced a power play and the Flyers ' second goal . <p> If the Flyers can turn up the heat on Byfuglien 's futility and annoy and harass him into taking more penalties , it will produce power-play chances which have been gold for Philadelphia in the finals and limit Byfuglien 's effectiveness and thus the impact of his linemates , Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews . Anything that slows those two down helps the Flyers hugely . <p> 2 ) Stay out of the penalty box . The Flyers were quite fortunate Wednesday when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a trip by Pronger , whose status apparently allows him to escape punishment for such infractions ) . Sure , Chicago 's power play has had less success hitting the mark than BP has lately , going . <p> That 's a testament to the Flyers ' brilliant penalty killing ( and , it must be said , to the Hawks ' over-fastidiousness in shooting and looking for the perfect shot while passing up good ones ) but it would be tempting fate very seriously to give Kane and Toews too many man-up chances and expecting them to keep failing to cash in . <p> 3 ) Related to No. 2 , lose Daniel Carcillo . Yes , he 's popular with the Rock ' Em Sock ' Em Robot sector of the Flyer fan base and occasionally delivers a delicious hit , but he 's a penalty waiting to happen . He ca n't even stay on his feet , turns the puck over , adds nothing to the offense and his best hit of the series leveled his own man , Jeff Carter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4 ) Rebound from the rebounds . Michael Leighton gave up an awful lot of oh-my-goodness second chances in Game 3 that , had they bounced a little differently , could have wound up in the back of his net . That 's not ideal but if the only way Leighton can stop shots is to give up the rebounds , then the Flyers will have to live with that and make it a top priority to make sure they are cleared promptly . This also means keeping Byfuglien , Marian Hossa , and other Chicago types clear of the crease is absolutely critical . <p> 5 ) Get the first line going . Carter , Mike Richards , and Simon Gagne have one goal between them in the finals . It is unlikely the Flyers can win the series without a more robust performance from their top line , especially as the Hawks ' No. 1 line showed signs of waking up Wednesday with Kane 's first goal of the series . Give the Hawks credit for slowing Carter , Richards and Gagne down , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matchups , the first line should be more productive . <p> Inside , the

 Photo " Fish Market Part 2 " is the latest release by rapper Chali 2na , with help from a plethora of hip-hop sextet Jurassic 5 has always baffled me . So much promise that faded so quickly . <p> Their 2000 full-length debut , " Quality Control , " was a phenomenal album , with great production values and , to steal a line from one of the songs , " vocal harmonies that sound so sweet . " <p> But two albums later " Feedback " got lukewarm reviews and featured inexplicable guest appearances by the likes of Dave Matthews . A year later , the group would be no more . And , to be honest , the rappers Chali 2na , Marc 7even , Zaakir and Akil fell off my radar . <p> So it 's welcome news to find that 2na not only has n't stopped working ; he 's been painting , rapping and doing voice work for the likes of Coca-Cola and Sega , according to his website . The rapper 's first solo album , " Fish Market , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Market Part 2 " was released today . ( In between was 2009 's " Fish Outta Water . " Luckily the well of seafood puns is bottomless . ) But it 's less a bonafide album than a collection of B-sides and collaborations . <p> " Fish Market Part 2 " has some terrific beats and turntable work . 2na 's rhyming seems effortless , particularly on " Hood Up " and " Step Yo Game Up , " a basketball song reminiscent of Jurassic 5 's " The Game . " But his biggest strength lies in 2na 's sonorous baritone . It takes a backseat too often on the 22 tracks . <p> That 's right . There are 22 tracks on " Fish Market Part 2 , " adding up to nearly an hour 's worth of music .

The best part of " 4 The Luv " is the sampling of the Yardbirds classic " For Your Love , " but otherwise it does n't add much to the album . <p> 2na gets serious toward the end . The finale , " Save The People , " is a steady meditative litany of our social ills the aftermath of Katrina , the deterioration of public schools , the perpetual problem of poverty and a call to unify and solve these troubles . The tone is more thoughtful than angry . This helps it linger well after the album has stopped playing . <p> Here 's a track from " Fish Market Part 2 " called <p> " Across the Map , " which features 2na teamed up with J-Live .

 exit from 2010 FIFA World Cup a result of reversion to bad habits <p> View full Photo ELISE Dempsey reacts after the U.S. soccer team lost to Ghana , 2-1 , today in extra time at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenberg , South Africa . <p> The United States ' World Cup run ended today because the U.S. team reverted to three bad habits during a 2-1 loss to Ghana after extra time . <p> The first bad habit , and the overwhelmingly worst one , is a frustrating inability to play all 90 minutes . The U.S. team tempted fate by falling behind early one too many times . <p> For some reason , this American team simply is not ready to play when the whistle blows . In its four World Cup games , the U.S. conceded three goals in the first 15 minutes and saw Algeria hit the crossbar . <p> There 's no possible intelligent explanation for this except that the U.S. simply is n't set to go at the whistle . Whether it is taking foes lightly or lack of mental preparation or simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it happens too often not to be a fluke . It is inexplicable and inexcusable . It is the greatest fault of the Bob Bradley regime . <p> The second bad habit is the persistent trend of U.S. defenders to give far too much space to opponent attackers . Jay DeMerit surrendered acres of ground to Kevin Prince-Boateng on Ghana 's first goal and then when he did close , got spun around like a turnstile at a Lady Gaga concert . <p> For an example of how defense should be played , watch Brazil 's Lucio , Argentina 's Walter Samuel or Germany 's Philipp Lahm square up , stop the ball and then take the ball away . U.S. defenders lack the confidence to do that . <p> The third bad habit is the lack of flair and confidence when shooting . Robbie Findley should have scored in the first half all alone against Richard Kingson but instead of firing at the far post he went for the easier short post and missed . <p> Michael Bradley should have done better when turned loose in the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second half . There was plenty of good delivery into the box , and while Ghana 's central defenders were stalwart and unyielding , the U.S. should have done better . <p> A gallant effort by the U.S. all around . The team showed oceans of heart and hustle . Any U.S. fan should be proud . This was far better than the 2006 World Cup debacle , which was also ended by Ghana , 2-1 . Worlds of progress have been made . <p> But World Cup progress will not come in spades until the U.S. unlearns those bad habits .@@1535804 <p> Two cruisers were 
 PhotoPhil Harris , late captain of the crab boat Cornelia Marie . <p> Viewers of tonight 's episode of " Deadliest Catch " were treated to the best scene of the season perhaps the greatest in the hit show 's six-year run . <p> With millions watching the gripping drama surrounding crab boat Captain Phil Harris ' massive stroke , a tender moment played out in the wheelhouse of Harris ' Cornelia Marie . <p> The success of Discovery 's most popular show has come as its makers captured the gritty toughness of crab fishermen on the rolling , frigid Bering Sea . <p> Rarely have we seen the raw , human emotion that we did tonight , and nothing to this point has compared to the conversation between Phil 's son Josh Harris and deckhand Freddy as cameras rolled . <p> With his dad taken away on a life flight , Josh agonizes on the boat about what to do next : Stay with the vessel that has supplied his family with everything it has , or catch a flight to Anchorage for what ultimately will be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is where he 'd want me to be , " Josh rightly says on the boat , which is at St. Paul Island after unloading crab . " This is his legacy . His memory lives on . I owe him that to be here to make sure things get done the way he 'd want things to get done . " <p> But Freddy , whose appearances on the show have largely portrayed him as a hard-working , fun-loving deckhand loyal to a fault , strikes a gravely serious tone . His message : The crab will always be there . Your dad may not . <p> With tears in his eyes , Freddy explains how his own father died in Australia while Freddy was wrapping up an opilio crab season just like the Cornelia Marie is doing now . He warns Josh not to make the same mistake . Or suffer the same stinging regrets . <p> " I was not there for him , " Freddy says , choking up . " The hardest thing ever . Show up for a dead body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves Josh with a whirlwind of mixed thoughts . He says something likely not heard often on the open sea . <p> " I love you , Josh . " <p> Phil Harris died in early February from complications arising from his stroke . It happened months before this sixth season of " Deadliest Catch " began . And it 's the reason the show is at a ratings zenith now . <p> Phil , 53 , suffered his stroke during crab offloading , less than a day after learning his youngest son , deckhand Jake , was addicted to painkillers . Fans have sympathized with Jake , who lost his dad so soon after his admission . Yet tonight we find Josh battling his own demons as his dad teeters on the brink . <p> " This is a nightmare , " says Josh after instructing Jake to accompany Phil to the critical care center . " Seeing my dad in this position . I do n't know how to feel right now . ... This is not easy on any of us . I feel really lost right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite . He was a respected crabber admired by his peers . <p> The show 's producers masterfully capture how word of Phil 's crisis spreads among the fleet . Josh makes a phone call to Time Bandit co-captain Andy Hillstrand to break the news . <p> " I would not want to be those kids right now , " Hillstrand says afterward . <p> Sig Hansen , fiery captain of the Northwestern , slams his handset and angrily hurls a pack of smokes after Hillstrand radios him the latest . <p> " Well , he was coherent . He could talk , right ? " Hansen asks , searching for strands of hope . " Oh , man . What do you do ? What do you say ? Walking a thin line , that 's all I know . This stuff is killing him . " <p> He then gathers his stonefaced crew to share the news . <p> It is here where two storylines intersect , and again , where the folks who make this show shine . <p> Secondary to the Harris story this season has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually spent time during the king crab season with Phil on the Cornelia Marie . <p> Back on the Northwestern for opilio season , Anderson learns in a phone call from his mother that his father is missing , his truck found abandoned on an old logging trail . There has n't been a sign of him for days , and it 's taken a toll on the young fisherman 's work . <p> Jake Anderson ties both of the stories together tonight with a few heartbreaking words . <p> " He always told me the things I wanted these guys to tell me , " he says of Phil Harris . " Those poor boys . I know what they 're going through , thinking about losing their father all day . It never goes away . " <p> The episode ends with Josh Harris indeed traveling to visit his dad , and meeting up with his racked brother and Time Bandit co-captain Johnathan Hillstrand at the hospital . <p> Phil is shown in the hospital with his head shaved from skull surgery , and earlier in the episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's loaded onto a plane . They 're not pretty sights . <p> Some have suggested " Deadliest Catch " has gone too far in showing Harris ' removal from his boat and his condition after his paralyzing stroke . I could n't disagree more . <p> The access afforded the camera crews , coupled with Phil 's and the show 's popularity , demand it . <p> Granted , I 'll give you that the makers went overboard with the maudlin music and repeated shots of a raven perched on the Cornelia Marie as Harris was carted from his boat deck in a life basket . It was unnecessary and overstated . <p> But , as Josh suggests , I think the story 's being told in a way that Phil would have wanted .@@1538422 <p> Riding a bicycle

Remember , too , that Vick is not the same mercuric figure that was one of the NFL 's most exciting players while he was a star with the Atlanta Falcons , so the argument that Lurie is just protecting a superstar to salvage his own selfish interests does not hold . <p> Vick is a backup with the Eagles , not a difference-maker even on the rare occasions when he does find his way to the field .

A game in which he surpassed the Iron Horse Lou Gehrig 's consecutive games played record . A game that will probably stand as one of the greatest moments in baseball I ever witnessed . <p> I did n't get to see the replay in its entirety . I did n't have to .

 under scrutiny for treatment of concussions in Sunday 's game <p> View full Photo Miles are questioning whether Kevin Kolb should have returned to the game after sustaining a concussion Sunday . <p> Stewart Bradley banged his head on a teammate 's leg , struggled to get up , took a couple steps and fell helmet-first onto the ground . <p> Clearly , something was wrong . <p> Bradley sustained a concussion when he collided with Ernie Sims during the Philadelphia Eagles ' 27-20 loss to Green Bay on Sunday . Yet somehow , the Eagles ' middle linebacker returned for a few plays before he was pulled for the rest of the game . <p> Minutes before Bradley went down , Kevin Kolb 's head was slammed down so hard on a tackle from behind that a chunk of grass got stuck in his helmet . He got up slowly and walked off the field . <p> The team initially said Kolb had a jaw injury , and the quarterback returned to throw three passes before sitting out the rest of the game with a concussion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offseason .

" We did n't just stick ( them ) out there without having followed the protocol . We also made sure that we stayed on top of it when they came back off the field and made the decision when symptoms were there . I have full trust in the trainers and the doctors and the procedure they admit through .

When it happened , Kolb already was receiving attention , so it 's unknown which members of the medical staff witnessed Bradley 's disturbing tumble . <p> Reid would not allow head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder to speak to reporters today , saying : " I gave you everything that needed to be done .

 dividing up college football does n't make sense anymore <p> View full Photo The Inquirer , MICHAEL S. University linebacker Adrian Robinson was as good as anyone on the field Saturday for UConn , a member of a Bowl Championship Series conference . <p> In the first month of college football season , when the whole point is to overreact and reverse course as many times as teams play games , East Carolina University gave fans and pundits a reason to change their minds again . <p> There are a few ways to look at Virginia Tech 's 49-27 win over the Pirates , the defending Conference USA champions who topped everyone 's list of bowl snubs last year with a 9-4 record . The logical conclusion is : Whereas small conference teams have been criticized for not being able to survive the week-in , week-out competition of the BCS leagues , it now appears BCS teams can have just as much trouble surviving the week-in , week-out competition of their non-BCS schedule . <p> What ECU 's loss means is that in the past three weeks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a FCS team and beaten a non-BCS team . In the coming weeks , it 's probable they will have about the same record against their BCS brethren in the ACC . <p> In other words , there is nothing to read into it because the old classifications just do n't mean what they used to . <p> After so many years of the elite non-BCS teams knocking on the door , the middling non-BCS teams are now proving that they , too , can be competitive with their peers in the middle of the BCS pack . <p> All around the country , results like these confirm that deciding a " BCS Champion " or designating certain Division I teams on a level below other Division I teams does n't make sense anymore . A common refrain by big-time college apologists was that while the best I-AA teams may compete with some I-A teams , and the best non-BCS teams may compete with some BCS teams , as a whole the entities were not comparable . It 's time to put that idea to bed , with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually wrong . So throw out the shockers like James Madison over Virginia Tech and the predictable outcomes like Ohio State trouncing Ohio . <p> You get the point . Nothing about these outcomes made waves , but it was all enough to show a subtle trend to anyone who 's been paying attention . <p> As always , the bigger programs get the wins in these games more often than not . When one program has 20 extra scholarships and triple the recruiting budget , that 's inevitable . <p> Addressing this would not require a drastic change , such as following basketball 's format and designating 347 Division I teams . A smaller adjustment , similar to an exception already given to independent Notre Dame in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( formerly Division I-A ) , is all that is necessary . <p> In the new model , a FCS team beats at least two FBS teams and wins at least nine regular season games is bowl eligible . As with the current format , no team would be assured of a bowl berth . And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would n't even have to choose between playing the bowl or playing in the FCS playoffs . It 's possible they could do both . <p> But FCS teams would have something more to play for in their early-season visits to SEC opponents ( beyond the hefty payout ) , and the now-meaningless non-conference schedules big-time programs put together would become a lot more interesting .@@1639433 <p> LOS ANGELES (

On Saturday Easton , Riegelsville and the Trenton area had river crests in " action stage , " defined as " a declared stage at which some person or agency needs to pay attention to the hydrologic situation and perform a function . " ( minor street and parking lot flooding ) . <p> Can you imagine what would have happened if all of the reservoirs on the Delaware River tributaries did n't have void space in them ? It would have been another flood like 2006 . <p> Think what would have happened if Lake Wallenpaupack was n't below 50 percent and the three New York City reservoirs Cannonsville , Neversink and Pepacton did not have void spaces of 61 percent , 35 percent and 34 percent , respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday and the Sunday projections call for Cannonsville to be at 97 percent , Neversink at 99 percent and Pepacton at 98 percent . <p> Legislators and the public have been saying the same thing for six years : Void space in reservoirs provides a safety net for downriver communities . This pokes holes in the statement : " Oh no , do n't pay attention to the reservoirs you will flood anyway . " <p> Coincidentally , there were two meetings last Wednesday in New Jersey a Delaware River Basin Commission meeting on the flood analysis model delayed for more than eight months and a hearing on the statewide drought warning declaration issued by the state Department of Environmental Protection . <p> Frustratingly , members of river advocacy groups who attended the flood analysis model meeting discovered this model paid for with more in taxpayer dollars , authorized by the governors of four states is not intended to do anything but show what happened during three flood events . <p> Politicians and the public thought they were getting a publically available tool to simulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying amounts of rainfall would have on river levels so riverside communities could prepare for a flood . We thought the idea was to use this model with other software tools to responsibly manage the reservoirs . What we got is a model that somewhat reflects the dynamics in three flood events in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 only . There appear to be no plans to perfect the model or make it usable for future storm events or reservoir and river operations . <p> Sorry , but Govs . Rendell , Christie , Paterson and Markell have been had , just like the rest of us . <p> The drought meeting in Trenton was more satisfying : I pointed out the current Delaware River Management Plan allows New York City to continue diversions from the Delaware River Basin above what the city needs on a daily basis during all drought conditions , while New Jersey has to cut back diversions severely . <p> OK , we ca n't blame Govs .

Both the drought conditions of the summer and this last rain event show New York City retains much more water than it can possibly consume under any hydrological condition . Communities and businesses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania suffer economically in flood devastation , clean-up and repair as well as under premature if not needless drought restrictions , both of which can be ameliorated by New York City releases . <p> More rains are coming .

 answers about the Red Rovers to the questions he posed , enjoy Part 2 of our Q&amp;A below . <p> QUESTION 1 : After winning the district title last year , Easton has to be the favorite to win the championship again . What are the differences between this team and last year 's ? <p> Me : I 'll be honest with you . I only saw Easton once last year ( filling in for a colleague ) because I was the field hockey beat writer . From what I did see and have learned by talking to coach Steve Shiffert and the players , this season is that the Red Rovers are different in their run game . Graduated seniors Quran Hughes and Gaddy were two quick backs that led the dominant run attack in 2009 . This year , junior James Middleton , who missed the first four weeks , is the speed guy who runs to the outside , while senior Zack is the bruiser up the middle . <p> QUESTION Justin Pacchioli is a pretty good baseball player , ticketed to play at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me : It 's still weird to say is going to play baseball at Lehigh next year . In terms of football , which I think he can play in college , Patch is the typical dual-threat quarterback . He has a rocket arm when he 's looking for his go-to guy Jonathan down field and can put enough finesse on the ball when needed as well . His best asset is his ability to run . Whether it 's a designed play or scramble , Pacchioli is slippery . He somehow weaves and dodges his way past defenders whether he 's avoiding a sack in the backfield or racing to the end zone on an scramble like how he opened last week 's win against Del Val . QUESTION Bisci leads them by a wide margin in receiving . What kind of player is he ? A possession receiver ? A big-play guy ? <p> Me : Bisci is a little bit of everything . He 's listed as tight end and lines up there or out wide . Like I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy in tight spots . He actually holds the school single-season reception record , which he set last Friday . The only thing with Bisci is that some games he can have six catches and be a difference-maker , then go the next Friday without a reception . Luckily for him and Easton , seniors Tyler Holjes and Justin Souders can step up when needed . <p> View full sizeExpress-Times Photo JIM Shiffert <p> QUESTION 4:The Red Rovers have four guys with at least 288 yards rushing , led by with 572 . Do they design a lot of runs for him or does he use his legs to get out of trouble ? And how do they determine who 's at RB or do they go with the hot hand ? <p> Me : Some of Pacchioli 's runs are designed , but he does the most damage scrambling . There was a stretch in the middle of the season when the offensive line could n't block the blitz and he was sacked often , but that 's changed . In a blink of an eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . He 's definitely the most electrifying player on the team . In regards to the other guys , coach Shiffert has been looking for the right combination . Earlier in the season , the backs struggled with putting the ball on the ground but , like the line , have improved . Sophomore Austin Brown has seen his time decrease since Middleton 's return . QUESTION is a veteran coach who wo n't let his team look past East Stroudsburg South . What is his message to his kids to make sure they 're not looking ahead to playing either Whitehall or Nazareth for the title ? <p> Me : The coach was concerned with his team 's mindset heading into the game against Del Val last week . Obviously they changed their tune as evident in the 39-7 scoreline . If Easton is looking ahead , it 's in regards to playing rival Phillipsburg on Thanksgiving . The team was in this same boat last year and won three games in eight days en route to the PIAA quarterfinals. <h> Panasonic offers gigantic 
 Sunny in Philadelphia Recap : ' Charlie Kelly : King of the Rats ' <p> Credit : Fox Devito and Charlie Day in " Charlie Kelly : King of the Rats . " <p> Well , not every episode can be king of the rats , I guess . <p> After last week 's Sunny set the bar for the rest of the season impossibly high , I feared that tonight 's episode , " Charlie Kelly : King of the Rats " would pale in comparison . And I was right . It 's hard to follow up an instant classic , so I ca n't fault this episode for not being able to do so . But I wish the writers made it seem like they were trying . Because what we got tonight was ... merely pleasant ? <p> Sunny has coasted before , namely in the first couple episodes of Season 6 , but at least each of those were chock full of great one-liners and that showed their potential .

But of course , their actions are misguided , and in the process of trying to become less cynical , use Charlie 's surprise party as a means to really only benefit themselves . It 's a standard Sunny formula , but most of the time , those formulas get fleshed out with great character moments and jokes . I ca n't say the same for " Charlie Kelly : King of the Rats . " <p> I feel like the things I should have laughed out loud at Duncan from under the bridge 's bizarre apartment , Charlie writhing around fully clothed in the steaming sauna instead only merited nice obligatory chuckles .

But I just hate to see a cast and writing staff so talented phoning it in because they needed a breather . <p> With all this being said , I truly did love the last few minutes of the show , where Dennis , Mac , and Dee read through Charlie 's amazing dream book ( it 's mostly just pictures , you know , because of the whole thing ) and recreate his wildest fantasies to make him happy : A denim chicken , a worm hat , and a bird with teeth . It was a moment of sweetness that showed these characters do kind of care about each other , even beneath all the cynicism , and I do appreciate how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long .

 LeBron James may be the victim of a global society <p> View full Photo JEFFREY M. James and the Miami Heat have yet to take off as expected , and many fans are thrilled about that . <p> With LeBron James set to make his return trip through Cleveland on Thursday and the Miami Heat loitering around the middle of the pack in the NBA 's Eastern Conference , the LBJ hate is sure to reach Code Red status some time in the coming week . That 's saying something , since by most measures James is already none too popular . <p> That game will be nationally televised , of course , as will seven Heat games in December . Things come to a head in March , when seven of the Heat 's first 10 games that month will be shown on TNT , ESPN , ABC or NBATV . <p> Talk about over-saturation . <p> When we consider that as Pennsylvanians , we will be able to watch dozens of Heat games this season , it 's worth wondering how big a role our global , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James . <p> When " The Decision " went down , I was in Italy on my honeymoon . Having left the states assuming James would sign with the New York Knicks or New Jersey Nets , I was shocked when I logged on at an Internet cafe one afternoon and discovered James , Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh had formed what was already being called a " superteam . " With a few clicks , I found the news story in the Cleveland Plain-Dealer , where the reader comments were predictably negative . I then navigated over to the blog of columnist Joe Posnanski , a Cleveland native , who summed up why James ' decision rocked the Rock ' n ' Roll Capital . <p> Sitting there in Rome , I had a front-row seat to what people were feeling in Cleveland . <p> Never before in our history would this have been possible , and we tend to take for granted what a recent phenomenon it is . When the Carolina Hurricanes won the Stanley Cup in 2005-06 , few outside of Connecticut could understand how painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone ? It 's not like there are thousands of Hartford Courant readers in Dallas . <p> But now , there are . Or at least there could be . Consider how the perception of these situations might have been changed if they happened today . <p> Seventeen years ago , Charles Barkley essentially forced a trade from the Philadelphia 76ers to the Phoenix Suns , and Barkley 's popularity exploded . <p> During the Chicago Bulls ' playoff run that season , Michael Jordan was the subject of a gambling controversy . Jordan had plenty of time to lead the Bulls to their third straight title before he admitted to thousands of dollars in gambling losses . <p> John Elway declared prior to the 1983 NFL Draft that he would not play for the Baltimore Colts , prompting the team to trade him to the Denver Broncos , where he became arguably the most popular quarterback of his era . <p> More recently , but in a world that seems centuries ago from a media standpoint , Eli Manning issued the same ultimatum to the San Diego Chargers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few seem to hold Manning 's demand against him now . <p> Did all these moves have their vocal critics ? Absolutely . But there was n't the cacophany of voices and there was n't the immediacy there is now . Jordan had to face Ed Bradley on " 60 Minutes , " but he was n't subjected to Gawker . When Manning made his trade demand in 2004 , Bill Simmons was still considered somewhat of an odd duck for being something called a " sports blogger " ; now voices like Simmons are all over the web . <p> The most apt comparison for James might be Barkley . Philadelphians may have been hurt by the Barkley trade , but many realized the trade gave Barkley a real chance at winning it all . There 's little evidence of that sentiment coming out of Ohio , where James repeatedly tried and failed to win a ring with the Cavs . Or maybe those Philadelphians just did n't have an outlet to voice their frustration back then . <p> But when James ' decision to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkers ( probably partly jealous for being scorned in favor of South Beach ) signed on with the hate . Chicago momentarily forgot its own role in the Cavs ' malaise ( " Shot on Ehlo ... Good ! " ) and hopped on the anti-LeBron bandwagon . We were all suddenly Clevelanders . <p> Take this story , for instance . Whereas 10 years ago , this would have been the muted bleating of a random reporter in a local daily newspaper , it can now be linked , e-mailed , shared via Facebook or Twitter ( probably along with the qualifier , " Listen to what this idiot has to say ! " ) to almost anyone . <p> LeBron James , hip young symbol of a new generation , failed to grasp that his every move would be magnified in this , web-driven world . The irony is unmistakable . However this works out for James , the result will be magnified , too . For better or worse . <h> San Diego to

 should have made a statement , turned down bowl invite <p> View full Photo KEITH Wannstedt guided the University of Pittsburgh 's football team to bowl games in the last three seasons , but it was not enough for him to remain the Panthers ' coach . <p> Dave Wannstedt arrived at the University of Pittsburgh in 2004 with big goals . He was introduced as Pitt 's football coach and promptly declared that he intended for the Panthers to contend for a BCS bowl berth every season . <p> Wannstedt 's failure to achieve that lofty goal was underscored Tuesday when he resigned as the Panthers ' coach . It was n't a bad six years under Wannstedt , a Pitt alum . He guided the Panthers to a 41-32 record and a 10-3 mark last season , leading to championship aspirations entering this season . <p> An uninspiring loss to Utah on opening night proved to be a sign of things to come , however , and the 7-5 Panthers are going to Birmingham , Ala. , to play Kentucky in something called the BBVA Compass Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely eliminated the fiduciary motivation to participate in the game , here 's what Pitt football should have said when it received its bowl invitation : <p> Thanks , but no thanks . <p> As infuriating as it may be to purists who embrace the " positive experience " of taking part in a bowl game and the quaint idea that nearly 30 percent of all Division I-A teams " get to finish the season with a win , " a major conference program like Pitt traveling to a minor bowl to finish off a depressing season is not worth it . <p> Think about it : <p> Pitt has yet to name a new coach . Athletic director Steve Pederson said the school will immediately conduct a national search for a new coach , but a thorough search will take time and a hurried search could result in hiring the wrong candidate . Because Wannstedt will coach the bowl game , according to defensive coordinator Phil Bennett , the new coach wo n't even have the benefit of a few extra practice sessions , which the NCAA allows all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new coach would get a jumpstart on pursuing his next recruiting class and securing commitments from those who already agreed to play for Wannstedt . In the long-term health of the program , strengthening the incoming class is far more important than putting the existing roster through a few extra drills this winter . <p> The bowl game does n't matter . Pitt , and all schools that take part in this time-honored tradition of firing their coaches prior to bowl season , admitted this by canning Wannstedt when it did . Honestly , if you really felt the final game of your season mattered , would you relegate the face of your program to lame duck status ? Thought so . And if the game does n't matter , why even bother playing in it at all ? <p> The television exposure from the bowl game will not help the program . Two things can happen in regards to viewership with this bowl , which is scheduled for noon on the last Saturday of the season . It 's likely that nobody will watch the game because viewers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Championship two days later . Those who do watch will be treated to a third-string announcing crew that , having next to zero exposure to Pitt or Kentucky football , will remind viewers start to finish that Pitt is coming off a disappointing season that led to the impending departure of its coach . Not exactly what you want potential recruits hearing . Turn down the invitation , though , and the conversation changes drastically , which brings us to the next point . <p> The message would be unmistakable . Sorry , alumni and boosters , you wo n't be able to pack up for sunny Birmingham to schmooze with your boys . But is that all you want out of Pitt football ? Wannstedt promised more , and the new coach will , too . Turning down an invitation to the BBVA Compass Bowl would have sent the powerful message that at Pitt , Pizza Bowls and Savings &amp; Loan Bowls wo n't suffice . This might have been a little harder sell if the athletic department was turning down a multi-million-dollar bonus , rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the band . <p> This is nothing but talk now , of course . Pitt accepted the bowl invitation , as every team always does . Dedicated alumni and fans are surely excited for one last chance to watch their twin Big East Conference defensive players of the year , senior defensive ends Jabaal Sheard ( 2010 ) and Greg Romeus ( co-winner , 2009 ) . Sophomore running back Dion Lewis has a chance to get the 44 rushing yards he needs for 1,000 this season , and sophomore quarterback Tino Sunseri has another chance to show he can eventually carry Pitt to a Big East title . <p> Pitt certainly could win this game . Kentucky has been a typically enigmatic SEC team that beat South Carolina and lost to Tennessee . The Panthers very well could parade off Legion Field heading due north with their new Compass Trophy ( or whatever the reward is for winning the BBVA Compass Bowl ) . <p> It wo n't matter , though .

" However , one major security standard always is in place : If an adult leaves the room , the door is locked , Young said . <p> One solution is to put metal plates on doors to allow them to be securely locked . In the short term , the problem facing learning institutions is not preventing these events from happening , but reducing the amount of damage a shooter causes .

 Board on Tuesday night rejected a proposal to bring Waldorf education to the Lehigh Valley . <p> School directors voted 7-0 against the Circle of Seasons Charter School application submitted by founder Phil Arnold , who said he plans to either amend and then resubmit the application or appeal Parkland 's decision to the state . <p> " I feel like we have a pretty solid application here and many times the state appeals board is much friendlier to charter school applications than local school districts , " Arnold said . <p> Board members did n't say what motivated their decision before Tuesday 's vote , but outlined their reasons for denying the application in a 65-page resolution . <p> After the meeting , board President Jayne Bartlett said the application fell short on several fronts , particularly in its proposed curriculum . <p> " We use public money , taxpayers money . We can not ask the taxpayers to fund a public school that does not meet state standards . That 's not going to happen , " she said . <p> Board member David Cohen said of the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state statutes . Our goal is always the best interest of our community 's children . " <p> School directors David Kennedy and Jef Reyburn missed the vote . <p> RELATED COVERAGE : The Salisbury Township and Catasauqua Area school boards , respectively , this month approved the Arts Academy Charter School and the Medical Academy Charter School applications . Circle of Seasons was the third Lehigh County charter school up for approval in February , but the first to be denied . <p> The resolution lists eight reasons for the board 's rejection of the application , including : <p> It 's not clear which grades or age levels the school will serve . <p> Arnold said during a December hearing that Circle of Seasons would be a K-12 school , but the board says the application does not include information about a curriculum for kindergartners and ninth- through <p> Circle of Seasons does not have a lease agreement for land on a Cedar Crest Boulevard horse farm in South Whitehall where Arnold proposes building or renovating a structure for the school . <p> No additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building in Upper Macungie that Arnold said also could house the school . <p> The school 's curriculum does not align with state academic standards . <p> The resolution cites comments during the hearing from Circle of Seasons educational consultant Eugene Schwartz which imply that students may not meet state standards until their sixth to eighth year of a Waldorf-methods education . <p> There are conflicting statements in the application about how the school 's board of trustees will be chosen . <p> No community groups are involved in the school 's planning process . <p> Circle of Seasons does not have the support of Parkland community members . Many of the people , businesses and organizations described as the school 's supporters are based outside the district and , in some cases , the Lehigh Valley . <p> The application says children of parents who helped found the school or siblings of current Circle of Seasons students would be given preference in enrollment over Parkland residents . Charter school law dictates that district students are to receive preference . <p> The school 's financial plan is inadequate . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said during the hearing that if Parkland 's budget remains flat over the next five years , the school would end up in the red . <p> Superintendent Richard Sniscak said , " There were just multiple deficiencies that warranted denial of the charter application . " <p> Arnold said he did n't know which way the board was leaning before Tuesday , and thought it odd that district administrators and not school directors asked most of the questions at December 's hearing . <p> " Part of what 's troubling is that during the public hearing , the school board asked little to no questions . It was mostly school personnel , " he said . <p> Arnold , who helped launch Seven Generations Charter School in Emmaus , said he needs to review the resolution before deciding whether a resubmission or an appeal is appropriate . He acknowledged that the board 's rejection could push Circle of Season 's projected opening date beyond fall . <p> Circle of Seasons supporters said they 'll stick with him through the process .

You 've got to have hope , " he said . <p> Parkland resident Nicole Antunes said she , too , remains hopeful Circle of Seasons will leap this hurdle and open in the fall .

Background checks have turned up convictions for everything from furnishing alcohol to minors to burglary , he said . <p> A few candidates disqualified themselves by spilling their guts during polygraph tests , admitting to regular marijuana use , inappropriate acts with animals and " all sorts of crazy stuff , " Pepe said . While he 's glad those folks were honest , it 's disconcerting that they thought such activities could be overlooked . <p> " The police officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepe said .

" But we do see a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions , toward experimenting with stronger styles and toward lower-alcohol concoctions known as session beers , Gatza said . <p> Preventing over-serving <p> At Weyerbacher , patrons can get six free 2.5-ounce samples , totaling about 15 ounces , per visit , Bragg said . The brewery prevents over-serving patrons by providing color-coded wristbands once the limit is reached . Its higher-alcohol brews are ideal for pairing with food such as pork or barbecue , which makes each of its beverages a " more flavorful , bolder type , interesting beer , " he said . <p> In an effort to educate employees of businesses such as restaurants , hotels and clubs on how to serve alcoholic beverages responsibly , the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board created the Responsible Alcohol Management Program . Regardless of what patrons are drinking , the program teaches business owners and employees to detect an intoxicated person and , in turn , prevent from over-serving , spot minors and identify false IDs , and reduce alcohol-related incidents . Licensees are required to score 80 percent or higher on a test to be RAMP-certified . <p> Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is RAMP-certified . Whenever the bar changes kegs , it updates the craft list and places beers ' alcohol content on the menu so patrons are aware of how much alcohol is in their drinks . <p> " We do n't want them to over-drink and think , ' Oh , I did n't know that was a strong beer , ' " Anderson said . " If you are going to sit down and have three or four beers , you might be wary of doing a third beer if you knew it was a strong one . " <p> Along with the patrons being aware of their alcoholic intake , Anderson said , the employees are also aware of the content of each beer . <p> Manager Josh Vogel said that along with the employees being , they are also trained to offer patrons a cup of water and a taxi to get home safely . <p> " We are n't necessarily like the club bars , where people are going and just pounding shots , " Vogel said . " Our clientele tend to be little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while longer . " <p> Smaller pours <p> Beverages with a higher alcoholic content , Vogel said , tend to be served in a 12-ounce pour to " make sure they are not pounding those big beers . " <p> Across the Delaware River , in Phillipsburg , Free Bridge Wine &amp; Spirits has carried beers from places such as Australia , Poland and New Zealand to name a few . Owner Patricia said her patrons normally sip on two to three glasses of beer throughout their visit at her business . <p> uses small , either 5-ounce or 8-ounce , glasses for higher alcoholic beers but also for rare and more expensive brews . <p> Steve Pappy , a patron of Free Bridge , said he enjoys hoppy India pale ales not because of their alcohol content . <p> " You do n't drink it to drink lots of it , " Pappy said .

Before his election to the county bench , the Republican was a partner of the law firm and Smith in Easton , and he served as solicitor for Upper Nazareth Township and the Northampton County Industrial Development Authority . <p> Northampton County President Judge Stephen Baratta said try as he might , he could not think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pithy one-liner during Smith 's dozen years as a judge . That was a testament to Smith 's professional demeanor , his intellect and dedication to the law , he said . <p> " He will be greatly missed in Northampton County , " Baratta said . <p> Easton attorney Joseph Corpora said the FBI interviewed him as part of Smith 's vetting process . When an agent asked him if there was anything embarrassing in Smith 's past he needed to know about , Corpora told the crowd the first and only thing that leaped to mind was a 20-year-old home video of Smith in a Barney costume performing for a children 's birthday party . <p> He was visualizing the video playing in the Oval Office when the agent interrupted his day dream to ask the question again , Corpora said . <p> " Yes , " he recounted answering , " I can truthfully say he does n't sing or dance very well .

 we pin and we pin , and what do we have to show for it ? Project Pinterest is a Sunday Morning feature taking inspiration from pinterest.com and requires us to make good on our project wish list . Sometimes we find great success , and sometimes we do not . <p> The project : This was n't the first time our 6-year-old mixed-breed rescue , Omar ( a schnoodle , the vet says ) , has been sprayed by a skunk . The first time was about 24 hours before my wife , Amanda , went into labor with our youngest son . The second time was July 14 : He used to run off a lot , but he 's been good lately , so I let him out off the leash at dusk to pee . Boom , he bolted across the street out of sight . I shouted his name a few times , and he did n't come back . He finally came into view , lingered by a bush and trotted to me as I walked to him . <p> At first I thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been sprayed again ) so I let him in the house , where it quickly became apparent that I was wrong ( and the bad guy in both skunk encounters ) . Amanda took action right away , tossing outside the hallway rug Omar had rubbed his stinky face on and turning to the iPad for what Pinterest had to say about skunk remedies . Last time around , in September 2009 , I tried tomato juice at night and , in the morning , took him to the groomer . This time , Amanda found a way to save . <p> For the dog , she found a recipe for " a mayonnaise-like paste out of hydrogen peroxide , baking soda and a little dish soap . " I got to do the dirty work , lathering him up in the backyard . We left it on for about five minutes ( allowing time , the pin says , to snap some " photos of his sorry , depressed and very naughty face " ) . After a rinse , we tried another pin she found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air dry . <p> For the house , she found a pin to " mix one part white vinegar with 10 parts water " and spray throughout everywhere it stinks . ( A slightly stronger blend can be used for spraying than scrubbing affected surfaces , belongings , etc . ) She used the same spray on the rug , and it 's now back in our hallway . For added measure in the house , she added a pot of water boiling with baking soda inside and uncapped a container of carbon pellets we had for the turtle tank . <p> The result : I thought the whole house ( and me ) smelled like a skunk all night . But at 7 the next morning , I drove three co-workers in my hatchback 70 miles to training for work and they all agreed ( to my face ) that I did n't smell . ( I did give myself the " mayo-like paste " treatment in the shower after washing Omar . ) When I came home , the house smelled fine ! And Omar , after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smelled ... not that bad . ( For about a week you could still smell skunk if you really got close to him . ) <p> The tip : Affix plastic bags with rubber bands over your arms for the scrub and rinse . I did n't use rubber bands and my bags fell off , and I swear the next day at training my hands smelled like skunk again after washing them ; moisture seems to reinvigorate the skunk stink . <p> * * * <p> The details <p> Cost : Less than . <p> Time : About an hour of effort including post-wash shower . <p> Skill : Minimal . <p> Repin It ? : Yes , though the groomer in 2009 included a haircut of his poodle hair and nice kerchief around his neck . <h> latest news <h> 
 pediatric dentist suspected the disease evolved over about five years or the entire lifetime of the little girl . <p> But even in the face of what he termed a " frightening " infection in the child 's mouth , McGuire admitted today at a hearing for the girls ' parents that he did n't provide antibiotics during their first visit in February .

Morganelli said the death had been ruled as due to natural causes . <p> " We 're not saying there 's anything criminal here , " Morganelli said . " But with those two deceased children and in light of the third case that came in with the dental issues we decided we should look at the whole thing and make sure we 're not missing anything here .

He said Pennsylvania law does not permit charges against a mother if a child is stillborn due to drug use . <p> Dental needs extensive <p> Yandel said she took photos of the 's teeth at school for their records and urged the parents to visit a dentist 's office . <p> During the first visit to McGuire 's office , he said his son , also a certified pediatric dentist , conducted the examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the severity of the infection . <p> McGuire said the child had 16 teeth that needed work : Seven needed to be removed , eight required the removal of a nerve and one required a cap . He said three of the child 's teeth were abscessed two so badly that they were missing parts of the root structure . He said the child did n't complain of pain but that pain would not be a necessary byproduct of the decay especially for the high pain tolerance and adaptation of a child . <p> The judge would n't allow McGuire to answer why it was that Lehigh Township police reported the number of abscessed teeth at 14 when charges were filed , and police were never called to testify . <p> McGuire said dental disease like the kind the little girl endured can prove fatal . <p> " We wanted to treat her as soon as we could get her into an operating room , " McGuire said . <p> Yandel said she understood that the family wanted a second opinion in the case . McGuire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insisted under cross-examination that he and his son made clear the potentially fatal danger of the disease . <p> " If he did n't want me to treat his child , I told him , just get her treated by another pediatric dentist , " McGuire recalled of a conversation he said he had with Wanamaker . " All I said was : Please get this child treated . " <p> No treatment by June <p> McGuire said he was dismayed to find out in June that the child had still not been treated for the dental disease . <p> " This mouth disease could change in the matter of days , " he said . " Progression of this type of disease is unpredictable . " <p> The dentist said he 'd assumed that Hoffman and Wanamaker had gone elsewhere to get their daughter help . <p> " If a patient is not treated by me , then they 're usually treated by someone else , " McGuire said .

He told Sharpe that though he scheduled surgery for five to six weeks after the June visit , he was willing and ready to move up the date if the girl 's symptoms worsened . <p> Yandel said Hoffman claimed McGuire was n't urgent about the need for treatment because the teeth were not permanent , but the dentist testified that his office strongly recommended against foregoing treatment . <p> Father 's bail is revoked <p> Hoffman 's attorney , Michael P. Gough , said he believed valuable information came to light during the hearing pointing to contradictions between the dentist and caseworker regarding antibiotics prescriptions . <p> He said the child eventually received treatment for her dental disease . Sharpe said previously another doctor prescribed a less aggressive treatment that was completely covered under the family 's new medical plan . <p> Gough said the girl had five teeth removed two of which were loose and did not require full extraction .

 Casey says awareness will help in the effort to control Lyme disease in file photo <p> Nearly one in five of the nation 's Lyme disease cases in 2013 was in Pennsylvania . <p> And nearly one in 10 cases that year came from New Jersey . <p> The number of actual cases could be even higher because the symptoms fever , headache , fatigue and a characteristic skin rash often are confused with other ailments and go underreported , U.S. Sen. Bob Casey , D-Pennsylvania , said Thursday . <p> When it 's not properly diagnosed , Lyme disease can spread to joints , the heart and the nervous system , Casey said . <p> With the warm weather arriving and deer ticks the ticks transmit the disease to humans now found in all 67 of Pennsylvania 's counties , Casey said he wants to promote awareness as well as to encourage proper funding of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The CDC shares responsibility with the states for education , research and prevention of the disease , Casey said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of information and are underreporting , " Casey said in a conference call with reporters . He said he plans to continue advocating for better CDC funding and better surveillance of the disease . <p> Casey said he will trust people in the field to address the amount of money needed . <p> Of the nation 's 27,203 confirmed Lyme disease cases in 2013 , 4,981 were in Pennsylvania . That was tops in the country . New Jersey had 2,785 confirmed cases , which was No. 5 in nationwide . <p> The deer tick spreads Lyme disease to file photo <p> Talking about the West Africa Ebola outbreak that last year came as a surprise when a few cases arrived in American emergency rooms , Casey said , " One of the realities is our public health system was n't prepared . <p> " Part of the reason is the federal government " was n't properly focused , he said . <p> Hospital preparedness , he said , was properly budgeted but the money was n't properly appropriated . <p> " We have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are appropriated at that level , " he said . <p> Much of it comes down to people understanding the risk and ways to prevent infection wearing proper clothing and checking for ticks after time outdoors , among other things , Casey said . <p> " We can dramatically reduce the cases ( of Lyme disease ) if people are more aware , " he said . <p> While Casey was vague on how much money was needed or what sort of research was necessary to battle ticks at the source , he said it was important for him to " use this voice to get this information out . " <p> He could n't say why Pennsylvania which has for five years topped the CDC 's list of confirmed Lyme infections was hit so much harder than other states . <p> " That 's what the numbers tell us , " he said , adding that his staff would provide more information . " It 's a huge number . I 'm not sure I 've seen anything so high where ... our state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . " <p> As for research , he said , " I think the best way to address that is to support the CDC . " <p> The Pennsylvania DEP , in announcing the 67-county outbreak , said Pennsylvania went from no deer ticks in the 1960s to the current infestation . While there are ticks now in the western part of the state , the risk of infection is n't as great there now as the rest of the state , the DEP said in a news release . <p> But one thing was clear " Every Pennsylvanian , from Philadelphia to Erie , must take precautions to prevent the spread of Lyme disease , " acting DEP Secretary John Quigley said . <p> And that means knowing what to do . <p> " The first line of defense against Lyme disease and any other tick-borne illnesses is avoiding tick-infested areas , " acting Physician General Dr. Rachel Levine in a news release . " We know , however , that as the weather becomes nicer many residents spend more time outdoors . We suggest that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and do a full body check after spending time outdoors . " <p> Prevention is only half the challenge , she said . <p> " If an individual has been bitten by a tick , we recommend that they remove the tick carefully with a set of fine tipped tweezers , " Levine said . " If an individual develops signs and symptoms of Lyme disease after a tick bite , we urge them to seek medical attention . Early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease may prevent late-stage complications . "@@3235119 <h> The High-Wire Washington

While Brown tried to move the ball from one hand to the other , it popped loose . <p> Junior cornerback Brandon Leaks was right there to scoop up the ball and bring it back to the house for an 84-yard score and the 42-14 lead . <p> " Coming out , we knew the ball was going to be loose , honestly , " Leaks said . " First of all , I saw the tackle by Tyler Cavenas . Once I saw it pop out , I knew the first thing I had to do was pick up the ball and catch it clean .

" <p> Instead , Evan Harvey recovered it and kept all of the momentum on the Mountain Hawks ' side . <p> 4 . Shafnisky spreads the love . Lehigh took advantage of the good field position because of the onside kick , as it marched down the field using six plays to go 48 yards for the score . <p> The touchdown came on Shafnisky 's nine-yard pass to Troy Pelletier , the fourth different receiver he hit for a TD .

The first play was a beauty , as Shafnisky faked the handoff to Dom Bragalone before dropping back , setting his feet and letting off a 34-yard pass to Knott . <p> " Their run defense is tremendous , " Coen said . " They 're a pretty aggressive group , so we thought we 'd try to take the opportunity to hard play-action fake and Nick executed it really well and Derek did a nice job with it . It was just part of the plan to open them up , soften them up . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the air , and got Shafnisky in an early groove . <p> 7 . Brown finds the edge .

The 1,000-yard watch was on for Bragalone , who entered the game needing 80 yards to become the first Lehigh freshman to surpass the mark in program history . <p> He was kept under tabs early before breaking off a 44-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter , which gave him 1,008 yards on the season and the 49-28 lead in the game . <p> 9 .

" <p> 10 . Rigaud 's early exit . Lehigh cornerback Olivier Rigaud was flagged for targeting late in the first quarter trying to make a tackle .

 County Prison guard is being investigated for allegedly assaulting a deaf inmate who smuggled a cell phone behind bars the same guard who sources said failed to find a loaded gun on an inmate about a week earlier . <p> Frank C. Buccini , 39 , of Upper Mount Bethel Township , claims former Corrections Officer Jorge R.

They also learned there was video of Soto taking out of his cell and then returning him that night . <p> Naugle met with Buccini and took his statement on Jan. 18 . Buccini also went to Easton Hospital because his back still hurt from the assault . <p> Frank Adams said the doctor wanted to take an MRI , but Buccini does n't have health insurance and he declined it . <p> Since Buccini 's statement was taken , both he and the Adamses have been waiting for news , particularly if Soto will be charged in the incident . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams said . <p> " They just left us out in the dark , " Christie Adams said . <p> Meyers said Buccini could face contraband charges because the phone was smuggled into the prison .

Efforts to reach Asteak late Friday were unsuccessful . <p> " The gun is more dangerous than a cell phone , " Buccini said . " I 'm not afraid of the charges .

 File University needs more fans like these at its athletic events , sports writer Michael LoRe writes . <p> It did n't matter if the game was home or away . In fact , it might have been better on the road . The Lehigh University men 's basketball team clinched the No. 4 seed for the Patriot League playoffs thanks to American 's win over Lafayette last Saturday . <p> That meant the Mountain Hawks would host Navy in the quarterfinals on Wednesday , which they did . Unfortunately , it seems the memo got lost in the shuffle of papers on campus as an embarrassing " crowd " of 921 supporters showed up to watch Lehigh win , 87-75 , at Stabler Arena . <p> It 's still to be determined if that number included members of the media , cheerleaders and the Navy band . <p> Despite recent success on the basketball court , football field or whatever playing surface you can think of , the fan turnout for games in Bethlehem is still sparse and that 's being nice . <p> I sat down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game to talk about Lehigh 's crowds , or lack thereof . <p> " It 's not just Lehigh . What I hear from people all over the place is that it 's sort of a generational thing , " Sterrett said . " This is a generation of young people who are not inclined to go to games as much . " <p> The men 's basketball team , which won the Patriot League championship last season , is averaging 931 fans per home game . That ranks second worst in the league , only topping Colgate 's 628 fans per game . <p> Lafayette sees an average of 1,614 for home games . Bucknell , the top seed in the tournament , averages a league-leading 3,043 supporters every game at Sojka Pavilion . <p> Every team except Lehigh and Colgate average at least 1,000 fans per home game . <p> " We draw for Lafayette and that 's about it . It 's disappointing . I think it 's a big part of what the college experience is about , " Sterrett said . " I think students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they should experience some of the lectures on campus instead of sitting in their residence halls . " <p> It 's not just the men 's basketball team that faces a lack of support . The football team saw poor numbers this fall despite going 10-3 overall , winning the Patriot League with an unbeaten record ( 5-0 ) and advancing to the second round of the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs . <p> When coaches like Andy Coen or Brett Reed are asked about the numbers , they say things like " We 're happy with the fans that support us . " They say things like that because they have to . <p> There is no excuse why students ca n't support their fellow classmates . Sure , Lehigh , Lafayette and Patriot League institutions put a lot of emphasis on academics . Yet the student athletes who dedicate their time and effort to sports and academics are able to balance the two . <p> " I do n't know what it 's going to take . I do n't think it 's a function of a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At these kinds of institutions , midweek games have always been tougher because there 's a lot going on academically and I do n't begrudge that . Weekend stuff , from my perspective , there 's no excuse to not have better turnouts . " <p> Sterrett said he 's interested to see the turnout for Saturday 's Patriot League women 's quarterfinal game between Lehigh and Lafayette because Lehigh students begin Spring Break . Despite expecting a low student fanbase , Sterrett expects a plethora of community members and alumni to come and support the rivals . <p> Lehigh and other institutions pay for buses and other modes of transportation so students who do n't have cars can get to and from games . Lafayette , which saw its men 's basketball team advance to Sunday 's semifinal at American , arranged buses for students to get to Washington , D.C. <p> There is no sure answer , and winning surely has n't cured it either . Sterrett admitted he 's still searching for a solution . <p> " If you can figure out the answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think we 're going to shame anybody into coming . That 's not the intention . It 's something we take seriously . It 's not something we ignore . " <p> He even said the school might start looking into how it divides tickets for the annual Lehigh-Lafayette football game . Sterrett said it might be based on how much support a student shows the football team during the regular season , since many students only express interest for the regular-season finale . <p> So put down the Xbox controller , step away from Gchat and go out and watch an athletic event . It takes three hours , max . I 'm sure it will be a nice break from studying or playing Call of Duty . <p> I 'm 24 years old , so I 'm part of this " generational thing " too , and quite frankly , I 'd rather not be deemed apathetic when it comes to athletics . Especially since it 's now my job . @ @ @ @ @

 File Photo BILL Toys sit in an alley near the site of a fatal gas explosion in Allentown . <p> Federal officials today called for greater inspections and faster replacement of old cast iron pipelines in light of fatal explosions in Allentown and Philadelphia believed to be linked to natural gas . <p> U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads , Pipelines and Hazardous Materials , said it would likely be up to the ratepayers to pay for the pipe replacements . U.S. Rep. Jim Gerlach , R-Chester County , said he believes federal and state utility organizations should work to oversee private gas company inspectors . <p> Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski said both initiatives are desperately needed in Allentown and other old sections of the Lehigh Valley , which have the majority of UGI Utilities Inc.

UGI 's current plan will take more than 40 years to replace all of its cast iron pipes , while the company last year earned record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stepped up , " he said . " We ca n't take decades to do this while they 're giving out record profits .

Charlie Dent , R-Lehigh Valley , said he also did n't think UGI 's current rate of replacing eight miles of cast iron pipes per year is aggressive enough . UGI currently has about 400 miles of cast iron pipes , about 230 of which are in the Lehigh Valley , 79 specifically in Allentown . <p> " The rate of replacement of eight miles a year is probably not where it needs to be , " Dent said .

Bonnie Watson-Coleman , D-Mercer , announced the cost of the Phillipsburg High School project . He said the total project cost hovers about million , with an estimated completion cost of about million . <p> Superintendent Mark Miller and Assistant Superintendent George Chando , who 've said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shook their heads . District officials say this is a cost they 've already discussed and cleared with the SDA , but Larkins could not speak to the disconnect . <p> " I have to trust our numbers , " Larkins said . " I ca n't speak to where the superintendent gets his numbers from . The fact that they think it 's million and we think it 's million , is a problem . Obviously we 're not on the same page . " <p> Assemblyman Daniel Benson , D-Mercer , urged Larkins to find out how there could be such a big difference in the proposed high school 's cost . <p> " I suggest you look into whether you have some inconsistencies within your own staff , whether with old numbers or new numbers , " Benson said . <p> Larkins said the cost of the Phillipsburg High School project , which according to the authority 's estimates far exceeded any of the projects selected in February , was only one of the factors that pushed it off the list . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with the million ... is that the only way to address the need ? Is there another way to house the student overflow besides building a new school ? " Larkins said . <p> Benson criticized the SDA 's ranking system , which has been an attempt at an objective prioritization of all 110 projects . Phillipsburg High School tied for the highest score on the ranking system at 22.5 points , but did n't make the cut . Meanwhile , the Jersey City P.S. 20 Elementary School only scored 11 points , but was among the 10 projects picked . <p> Authority officials have said another set of more subjective criteria is what pushed some projects ahead and left others shelved , such as how well a building lends itself to standardization . <p> But Benson said the subjective ranking elements muddy what was billed as a transparent and clear review process . <p> " It does seem like there 's no cutoff and it does seem like the whole process became subjective toward the end . If you do have objective criteria , those need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larkins said those subjective items were necessary to address elements of a project that are not easily translated into black and white . <p> The New Jersey Democratic Assembly office presented a video at the beginning of the hearing that showed the empty Lopatcong Township plot where the high school is proposed . District officials , Assemblyman Patrick Diegnan , D-Middlesex , and vocal parent Helene Meissner express their disgust and frustration that the project was shelved yet again . Shots of the aging trailers gave the education committee a glimpse of where many Phillipsburg high school students attend class . <p> " There is absolutely no logical reason why this project has not been approved , " Diegnan said in the video .

Snyder had told Schiavone she was on her way to meet her boyfriend , Rapoport , and that she 'd be spending the night with him , police said . Schiavone also told police Snyder was pregnant , it was Rapoport 's child and he was married and very angry about the pregnancy . She also said Snyder was scheduled to have her first ultrasound at 8 a.m . Thursday . <p> While Schiavone was talking to police , she received a text message from Rapoport , who asked her to have Snyder call him . While Schiavone knew Rapoport , this was the first time she ever received a text from him . <p> Police returned to Independence Drive to search Snyder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and noticed the entire car smelled like bleach .

Rapoport pointed to the trunk and said , " the gun is in there " before opening the trunk and pulling out a black gun case with a Glock Model 17 inside , according to court papers . He also handed over ammunition . <p> Police asked him if there was anything in his car belonging to Snyder , and Rapoport said he did n't know . He then got into his own car and removed a package of baby wipes with suspected blood on the lid . He allegedly told police he bought the wipes at Target and that he forgot to use them to clean the dashboard of his car .

 Eric Ballard , right , admitted to killing ex-girlfriend Denise Merhi , left , her father , grandfather and a neighbor last June . Opening arguments began this morning in his death-penalty trial . <p> As painful as the crime scene photos were for the victim 's families , the autopsy photos of Michael Eric Ballard 's four victims and the description of their deaths showed the misery of their final moments . <p> Forensic pathologist Samuel Land testified all fought off Ballard as he attacked them . <p> But Land described the victim 's numerous stab and slash wounds : Merhi 's voice box was " shredded " in the attack ; Alvin Marsh 's throat was slit and he was breathing in blood when he died ; Dennis Marsh was attacked from behind ; and had a wound that ran from his cheek , opened his jaw , ran down his neck and into his chest . <p> The black and white photographs depicted bodies that were pockmarked from the stabbing ; the most disturbing that drew gasps and groans from the audience was that of Alvin Marsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballard . <p> Earlier this morning jurors viewed photographs of the victims , surrounded by pools of blood . <p> Family members cried , covered their eyes and looked away as the pictures were displayed . Merhi 's mother , Geraldine Dorwart was not in the courtroom for any of the photographic evidence , but Zernhelt 's wife was in the crowd . Merhi 's cousin , the Rev. Jared Stahler , sat hunched over , his head in his hands , averting his eyes from the photographs . <p> The most vocal reactions came when the prosecution showed the photographs of Alvin Marsh , who was stabbed while sitting in his wheelchair watching TV . People gasped and groaned as they first saw a picture of his back , with the television on in front of him , then a picture of his blood-soaked T-shirt . <p> Some family and friends left the courtroom before the photograph 's were shown . " I ca n't sleep now , " said Alvin Marsh 's sister , with tears in her eyes as she walked out of the courtroom . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the murderer does not deserve another chance . <p> " Not one , not two , not three , not four , but five . This case is about the deaths of five innocent people , " Morganelli told the jury . <p> Ballard pleaded guilty last month to the murders . He had been paroled in April 2010 after serving a portion of his to 30-year sentence for the 1991 murder of Donald Richard , of Allentown . <p> Calling the murders " methodical and businesslike , " Morganelli said Ballard plotted Merhi 's murder as a punishment after finding out she was seeing other men . <p> " He put in place a plan to kill her , " he said . <p> But Chief Public Defender Michael Corriere said Ballard and were still in a relationship before her murder and were talking about having a child together . He said they exchanged text messages vowing their love and even had a ceremony and exchanged rings weeks before her death . Indeed , an autopsy photo of Merhi 's left hand showed a band on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtroom , choking back a sob at Corriere 's words . <p> Corriere said Ballard could not deal with the news that Merhi was seeing other men . <p> " It was so devastating that he could n't take it , " he said . <p> He said Ballard 's blood alcohol content was two times the legal limit when he committed the murders . He said his client suffers from " decompensation " when he is under certain stressors and lacks the ability to control his cognitive disorder . <p> Late last week

He also said he plans to appeal the verdict . <p> " I know what I did n't do , " Mensch said . <p> Mensch previously told The Express-Times he did not display the gun , but pulled it out in self-defense because he felt threatened by an aggressive driver who followed him into a gas station . <p> During testimony today Mensch said he felt that another motorist , Brian Salisbury , was following him on the interstate and driving aggressively . Salisbury said that Mensch tailgated him at some point on the interstate near mile marker 15 , then passed and slowed down to get beside him . At that point Sailsbury said he glanced over at the vehicle beside him and saw a gun in Mensch 's hand near his lap . <p> Salisbury said Mensch never pointed the gun at him or waved it in a threatening manner , but he saw a black handgun with a barrel in his hand . <p> Mensch later testified that he did n't have a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead had a cell phone in his hand . <p> Both men stopped at exit 23 and pulled into a gas station .

Goldsmith said it was telling that Salisbury had already called 911 before stopping at the gas station , and said another motorist had a gun . <p> Mensch was stopped several minutes later on I-78 by state police , who found a Glock pistol partially concealed in a day planner , and a second gun , a revolver , in the glove box of Mensch 's state vehicle .

 accused of killing Joe Rountree , defends himself on the stand <p> View full Harris , left , is on trial for allegedly killing Joe Rountree . <p> Clinton " C.J. " Harris took the stand in his own defense today and described an intense few moments during which bullets flew on Northampton Street in Easton and fatally wounded Joe Rountree . <p> Harris , 24 , of Easton , testified for about two hours during the fourth day of his murder trial in Northampton County Court before Judge Craig Dally . Jurors will hear closing arguments Friday morning and will receive instructions from Dally to begin deliberating Harris ' fate . <p> Prosecutors argue that Harris is responsible for killing the 22-year-old Rountree , while Harris ' lawyer , Philip Lauer , contends that any action by Harris was done in self-defense . Harris is charged with homicide , but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty . <p> Harris was calm and collected throughout his time on the witness stand . He told the jury he only fired upon Rountree because Rountree had a gun trained on Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Harris said . <p> Harris said he managed four shots in two separate volleys and heard an unspecified number come from Rountree . Harris said by the second " boom boom , " Rountree was already falling to the sidewalk . The gunfire ceased . <p> " Honestly , I thought I shot him , " Harris said . <p> Harris said all of the shots came while he and Rountree faced each other and no backs were turned . Rountree was killed by a shot through his back , according to testimony . He died on the sidewalk in the arms of his fiancee , who has two children with Rountree . <p> Harris said he did not want to stick around to find out what happened , so he jumped into his green Mustang and reversed down North Ninth Street . <p> " I was scared , I was definitely scared , " Harris said . <p> But before Harris made it out of the area , he said , he saw the barrel of another gun pointed at his windshield . This one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shots were fired . Harris said he did not know the man . <p> Harris said he ditched the gun underneath the tire of a car parked a few streets away . Then he made his way to his grandfather 's home on Easton 's South Side , trading his Mustang for his grandfather 's car , he said . Harris drove back to the West Ward and collected the gun , which he dumped into a river that night in Bethlehem . <p> Harris , who moved to the area in 2006 from Long Beach , Calif. , said he had known Rountree since his move here . A personal animus grew between them in November or December 2009 when Harris began a brief relationship with the now fiancee . At the time , she and Rountree were having relationship problems , but later reconciled , according to testimony . <p> After the fling , Harris said he got what he took as death threats from Rountree . <p> " It was just the word around the street , " Harris said . <p> Harris said he bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to great lengths to avoid a confrontation with Rountree . <p> " I stopped going out ... I just became very unsociable , " Harris said . <p> The situation came to a head the night of March 12 , 2010 , into the early morning hours of March 13 . That night , Harris ' friend Jamel Kelley had been at Drinky 's in Easton 's Centre Square with friends and ran into Rountree , Harris said . Rountree and Kelley , who Harris said were good friends , got into a fight and Rountree " sucker-punched " Kelley , he said . <p> Harris said Kelley called to tell him what happened . The two eventually met and Kelley wanted to fight Rountree , Harris said . Armed with his illegally-purchased handgun , Harris agreed to drive Kelley to look for Rountree . Harris said he brought the gun " just in case " and said he never had any intention of using it . <p> Harris said he and Kelley found Rountree in the West Ward and followed him to North Ninth and Northampton streets . Rountree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mustang . Kelley tried to run , but Rountree put a gun to his head and ordered him to the ground , Harris said . <p> Harris said he retrieved his gun from under the seat and got out of his car . Rountree was dead moments later . <p> She and her 
 head in his hands and shook after the verdict was read . Family and friends on both sides of the packed courtroom cried and moaned . Northampton County sheriff 's deputies cleared the room after the verdict , separating both sides and ushering dozens of people out of the closed courthouse . <p> Friends and family of Rountree and Harris exchanged words outside , and sheriff 's deputies kept the two groups separated . Some of Rountree 's friends and family wore shirts that said , " Justice for Joe Lou . " <p> Rountree 's family declined to comment . <p> Harris ' attorney , Philip Lauer , said he understood the jury 's decision , though he vigorously argued Harris acted in self-defense . <p> " I think the jury worked hard on it , " Lauer said . " Obviously we were hoping for an acquittal . " <p> According to testimony , Harris had a fling with Rountree 's fiancee while she was not with Rountree . Harris testified that Rountree threatened his life . <p> Voluntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 . Lauer said it is too early to say whether Harris will appeal the verdict . <p> In his closing arguments Friday , Lauer claimed Harris illegally purchased a handgun for protection because Rountree had repeatedly threatened his life over a relationship Harris had with Rountree 's fiancee , Errica Pagan , while she and Rountree were having problems . <p> During a large gathering that grew following a fight at Drinky 's bar earlier in the night , Harris has claimed , he shot at Rountree after he saw Rountree raising his own gun in Harris ' direction . <p> " Thank God he did have an illegal firearm , " Lauer told the jury during his closing argument . " He found himself in a situation where he was about to be a dead man . He had an implement in his possession that could prevent that , and he used it . " <p> Harris had not been present for the earlier fight at Drinky 's , allegedly because he wanted to avoid being around Rountree because of past threats . <p> But if that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris could have easily avoided Rountree by not coming to the altercation later . Instead , he came carrying a gun , even though he knew Rountree would be present , was drinking and was angry from the earlier bar fight . That , Obrecht argued , shows Harris premeditated the murder . <p> " I would submit it was in his mind that he decided he was going to take care of this , " Obrecht said . " And that 's exactly what happened . " <h> Out of a 
 have relaxed a bit since Emily Post 's heyday but it 's still a tangled web of dos and don'ts . <p> Stress over wedding etiquette is what keeps Jasmine Mitchell in business . She runs Easton-based Euphoric , a graphics , Web design and invitation specialty business . The invitation is the signal to guests on the formality of the affair and who 's footing the bill , Mitchell says . <p> She 's seen it all in her trade from hosts who took up half the invite listing everyone 's names to feuding families . <p> " I had a bride where the parents did n't want anything to do with it , but the grandparents and the groom 's parents offered to pay , " Mitchell says . But the bride still wanted her parents ' names listed on the invitation but needed to tread carefully so as not to tick off the parties actually paying the bill . <p> Where to start <p> Mitchell tells clients to decide on their colors and the formality of the wedding they want before coming to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of the bride 's dress , " Mitchell says . <p> Brides and grooms need to figure out how formal they want their day to be because that message will be ferried out to their guests through the invitation . <p> " Once you send the invite , it sets the tone for the guests , " she says . <p> The wording usually indicates the wedding 's hosts and starts by saying " Mr. and Mrs. request the presence of your company . " The Mr. and Mrs. can be a combination of names of all the hosts involved but in most cases today is the bride or groom 's parents . <p> Mitchell says clients should talk to their caterer or venue to find out when a final head count is needed . The RSVP deadline should generally be two weeks from when the vendors need that final count . Wedding invites should go out at least a month before that date even further in advance if guests will need to make travel plans or take time off work to attend . <p> A degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wording of the invitation . When addressing the cards , Mitchell says , you should start with the most formal address on the outer envelope and get more casual with succeeding inner envelopes and cards . For example , the outer envelope for a family of five would read " The Mitchell Family , " while the inner envelope would list John , Caroline , Michael , Kate and Susie . That 's where the hosts let the guests know who exactly is invited . <p> Michael McNamara , manager of The London Shop in Easton , an upscale men 's clothing shop , says the wording of the invitation should also clearly tell guests what to wear . If the invitation says " black tie " wear a tux , no ifs , ands or buts , he says . <p> If it says a " tux is optional , " guests can get away with a dark gray or black suit but not a blazer or sport coat . If the wedding is more casual a beach wedding , for instance a linen suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I think it 's common sense , but you should always be overdressed , not underdressed , " McNamara says .

Most brides overestimate the number of invites they 'll need and stress about the cost , Mitchell says . Even if 300 people are invited , you may only need 200 invites when accounting for couples and families . <p> " That 's the first fire you put out , " Mitchell says . <p> Mitchell hates to see invitations sent out with the words " No children allowed . " A more tactful way to say it is to list only the adults ' names on the inner envelope or write " Adult reception following the ceremony . " Mitchell says guests will get the hint . <p> " I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their day , " Mitchell says . " What may seem most traditional or common does n't have to apply to their day . It 's an expression of who they are as a couple . " <p> When it comes to weddings , everyone has an expectation of how things should be done and a list of pet peeves . <p> " A big one for me is not including the postage on RSVPs , " Mitchell says . " If you want people to mail something back , include the postage . That 's just courtesy . " <p> Never put abbreviations or a ZIP code on the actual invitation , she advises . And as much as brides and grooms want their guests to purchase items off their wedding registry , it is rude and presumptuous to include the wedding registry or registry cards with the invitation , Mitchell says . The onus is on the invited guests to call the family or a member of the wedding party to ask where the couple are registered . <p> Plus one <p> The invitation is the place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or groom 's choosing . <p> " It 's quite rude to call someone to ask if you can bring a guest , " Mitchell says . " Had they intended that , they would have put it on the envelope . " <p> As much as guests need to respect the bride and groom 's budget , the couple should respect their guests by following up to find out the names and correct spellings of the actual guests coming to the wedding , to avoid a place card labeled " Guest .

 hold another bear hunt in December , marking the state 's first back-to-back years of bear hunting in more than 40 years , officials said today . <p> Wildlife officials with the state Department of Environmental Protection recently reviewed the black bear management policy adopted last year that included the hunt and left it unchanged , setting in motion a six-day hunt for Dec. 5-10 , DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said . <p> " The fact is that we are going to continue to do bear hunts in New Jersey , " Ragonese said today . <p> The New Jersey Sierra Club blasted the decision , saying the policy is more about recreation than reducing human-bear conflicts . Jeff Tittel , the chapter 's director , said the 2011 bear hunt is moving ahead before data from 2010 can be analyzed . <p> " The hunt is about dropping the overall population , not going after nuisance bears , " Tittel said today .

" We anticipate that we 'll have fewer bears trying to break into homes or cars , or attack wildlife or things of that nature . <p> " The goal is to make it that there are bears in New Jersey , that you occasionally see a bear , that you 're surprised when you do , not that they 're running around like squirrels .

Moon was downstairs in the house when he was shot , and Kimiko Moon was shot afterward upstairs . <p> Although Marqis Moon 's father and 6-year-old brother were in the room , Danser said they were not at risk of death themselves . <p> View full 
 week : Butter Chard <p> Market excursion : On a weekend trip to my local farmers market , I noticed a vendor selling bags of butter chard . George DeVault , owner of Pheasant Hill Farm outside of Emmaus , says butter chard is a nickname for an heirloom variety of Swiss chard called Fordhook giant . <p> " We call it butter chard because of its melt-in-the-mouth taste and texture , " DeVault says . <p> produced a moss-green leaf and told me to take a bite . <p> Flavor : With Swiss chard , a bite of the raw leaf is bitter and astringent , but butter chard is surprisingly sweet .

DeVault says he uses raw butter chard in his salads and the cooked version gets a sprinkling of garlic and olive oil for a tasty side dish .

 recalls historic sinking of the USS St. Lo <p> An hour before sunrise on Oct. 25 , 1944 , the commanding officer aboard the USS St. Lo called general quarters as he did every morning while the carrier steamed toward the Philippines . <p> Express-Times Photo BRUCE Smedberg , 86 , served aboard the USS St. Lo in October 1944 , when it became the first U.S. ship sunk by a kamikaze in World War II . <p> Roy Smedberg , then a 19-year-old signalman , took up his position near the bridge . He watched a pair of submarine hunters and air combat patrol planes take off from the deck of the St. Lo , which was part of an escort group codenamed " Taffy 3 . " <p> The voice of Ensign Bill Brooks , an air combat patrol pilot , crackled over the radio a few minutes later . <p> The first thing he saw was the flak sent up by the Japanese ships at the American planes . <p> " Then you could see the pagoda masts coming up over the horizon , " Smedberg said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Joseph McKenna would order the crew of 889 men to abandon ship as the St. Lo became the first major U.S. warship sunk by a kamikaze pilot . After years of silence , Smedberg is now willing to share his story in honor of Memorial Day and the 126 men who died that day at sea . <p> DECLARATION OF WARIn an address to Congress , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared war against Japan on Dec. 8 , 1941 . <p> " Mr. Vice President , Mr. Speaker , Members of the Senate , and of the House of Representatives : Yesterday , December 7th , 1941 a date which the Empire of Japan . The United States was at peace with that nation and , at the solicitation of Japan , was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific . Indeed , one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent or hint of war or of armed attack . " <p> Smedberg , 86 , grew up in Kearny , N.J. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declared war on Japan in a speech to Congress on Dec. 8 , 1941 , he said about 100 of his classmates stood up and left school to enlist . <p> Smedberg who now lives in Palmer Township was 16 years old at the time and his father would n't grant him permission to enlist . A year later his father relented , and Smedberg enlisted in the Navy . He was sworn in on Jan. 11 , 1943 , at the age of 17 . <p> Smedberg reported to the United States Naval Training Station in Great Lakes , Mich. , for boot camp in February of that year , attended signal school in San Diego in May 1943 for three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was assigned to the USS Midway . The ship would eventually be renamed the St. Lo , after the town in Normandy , France . <p> With the Squadron aboard , the St. Lo would eventually become part of a carrier support group for the 7th Fleet that provided air coverage for the invasion of Saipan in the Mariana Islands , the Battle of Tinian and the invasion of Morotai Island . <p> The St. Lo , which was part of the northernmost escort group in the Philippines , found itself engaged with the Imperial Japanese Navy about 6:30 in the morning in what many consider the largest naval battle in history , the Battle of Leyte Gulf . <p> The Japanese ships were fast compared to the U.S. ships and heavily armed , Smedberg said . <p> " The Japanese had 18-inch guns on the biggest ship in the world , " he said . " We were firing our little 5-inch guns . " <p> The Imperial Navy managed to hem in Taffy 3 's escort carriers , destroyers and destroyer escorts like a horseshoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokescreen and fired torpedoes . <p> " They were just firing at us point-blank , " he said . <p> Smedberg can still vividly recall the different colors left by detonated shells , and the distinct sound they made as the battled raged . <p> " You could hear the shells as they flew by like bullets , " he said . <p> Encountering a greater battle than they had anticipated , the Japanese eventually retreated and the squadron began returning to the St. Lo to refuel and rearm . Smedberg said he remembers heading down to the mess hall for a sandwich and coffee , when the call to general quarters went out again . <p> " I took two steps when it went ' boom ' a big explosion , " Smedberg said . <p> Unbeknownst to him , a kamikaze with a 500-pound bomb strapped to each wing had just slammed into the flight deck , ripping through to the hangar deck below . Smedberg started making his way from the rear mess hall , which was two decks below the flight deck , toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him rendered that exit impassable , so Smedberg headed toward the front of the ship looking for an exit . By the time he made it topside , the St. Lo 's radar tower had toppled and she was listing at about a 30-degree angle , he said . <p> He lowered himself to the water hand-over-hand down a rope off the starboard side . Fellow signalmen Farley Tierney and Brock Short , who suffered injuries to their right hips , knees and ankles , were among the roughly 12 sailors who bunched together and began swimming away from the St. Lo . <p> She went down in 32 minutes . <p> There were reports of sailors on the port side being attacked by sharks . Smedberg said he and his comrades did n't encounter sharks during their four to five hours in the ocean , suggesting the flaming debris floating atop the water kept any sharks at bay . <p> Roy Smedberg , far left , with other survivors of the USS St. Lo in Seattle in 1945 . Brock Short , to Smedberg 's right , attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippine Sea with Smedberg after the St. Lo 's sinking . <p> The men stayed calm , Smedberg said , remembering their training as they kept paddling , reminding each other they 'd be fine so long as they stayed together . He even recalls a little laughter . <p> All remaining ships were ordered to pick up survivors . Smedberg and his group were picked up by a destroyer escort , the USS Dennis , which suffered damages and casualties . <p> After he dropped into the Philippine Sea , Smedberg said he kicked off his shoes so he and the other sailors could start paddling . A fellow signalman aboard the Dennis gave Smedberg his sneakers . <p> " They were a little big , but I wore them anyway , " he said . " There was a lot of blood all over the decks there . " <p> Smedberg remained in the Navy for three years . He 'd kept in touch with a few of the men or their families , but after his service neither saw them nor discussed the attack until a survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port to which the St. Lo never returned . <p> " I cried a lot , " he said . " We all did . " <p> Daughter Sally Carroll , with whom Smedberg has lived since February 2010 , said for years she only knew that her father was in the Navy and that his ship had sunk . <p> " That 's all I knew , " she said . " It was almost casual the way he talked about it . " <p> Smedberg casually replies that simply no one asked him about the war . But Carroll said he never shared details even now he hints at more stories he wo n't share and did n't talk about his box of medals . He did n't open up until he attended the reunion . <p> " I do n't think I realized the magnitude of what really happened , " she said . <p> It 's common for veterans to remain silent for years about their war experiences , according to Bill Nixon , a Vietnam era veteran who 's been organizing trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a process for grieving when you lose a family member .

These days , he finds himself performing taps about 200 times a year , mostly for younger soldiers who fought in the Korea and Vietnam . <p> said he sees his trumpeting as a duty to his fellow veterans and their families . Far fewer trumpeters and buglers are available to perform taps at funerals , and it 's something surviving family members have a right to expect , he said . As a way to compensate for the shortage , the government has created an electronic device that resembles a bugle to play a recording of taps . <p> " I do n't like it , " Deysher said of the contraption .

 Spence , of Palmer Township , was told she had been named Holy Cross Society queen , only to learn later the title would go to Maria Panto . <p> As the Holy Cross Society of Easton prepares for its 100th anniversary festival , the celebration has been dampened by in-fighting and accusations of manipulation over the naming of the festival 's annual queen . <p> Each year , the society chooses a girl to be its queen . She must be able to trace her ancestry back to Santo Stefano di Camastra in Sicily , whose emigrants founded the society . Earlier this year Easton Area High School senior Laura Spence was told it was her time to shine . <p> But shortly afterward , the Spence family was told their daughter was out and that high school junior Maria Panto was being named queen instead . <p> Palmer Township residents Dan and Ezra Spence claim their daughter was rightfully and fairly chosen but lost her crown due to the intervention of the Panto family , which is heavily involved in the Holy Cross Society and the Easton community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panto Jr . <p> " The Panto family flipped out , " Ezra Spence said . " It 's just something that was uncalled for . I just ca n't believe this was done . " <p> Efforts to reach Maria Panto and her father , Paul , were unsuccessful . <p> The Holy Cross Society officers said the Pantos had no influence over their decision and that Spence was announced queen incorrectly and prematurely due to communication errors . <p> " There 's no conspiracy here , there were no secret backroom deals , " said James Palmeri , a trustee with the society . " The truth is , both girls were excellent candidates , but one girl met more of the requirements than the other . " <p> The society paid the Spence family to compensate them for money they spent on Laura 's gown , alterations , photo shoots and other expenses in anticipation of the festival . Palmeri also said they intend to make Laura Spence the queen next year . <p> The Holy Cross Society consists of men and women who migrated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formed in 1911 , the society will hold its 100th anniversary festival in September . <p> In February , a queen selection committee , which included the society 's former ladies ' auxiliary president Sandy Callery , told Laura Spence she had been chosen as queen . <p> Callery was asked by the society to resign from her position , which she held for 12 years , and she did so because she objects to the society 's selection of Maria Panto over Laura Spence . <p> " The Panto family went a little crazy , " Callery said . " They all but said ( Laura ) was dirt . This is not right . It 's immoral . I mean , they broke this girl 's heart . " <p> Holy Cross Society President Anthony S. Tumminello said the decision was not up to Callery or her committee , and that their recommendation should have gone to the society officers , who make the final decision . <p> " We feel terrible for the Spence family , " he said . " We feel terrible , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big miscommunication . " <p> Callery told Spence in February that she would be queen . But in early April , Tumminello met with the Spence family and told them the proper channels were not followed in the decision , and that the society would still have to consider it . <p> Later that month , the Spences were told Maria Panto had been chosen . <p> Callery disputed that the queen selection was handled incorrectly , and claims the process this year was the same as the one the previous year . <p> Callery and Ezra Spence both said during society meetings , Maria 's aunts Pam Panto and Nancy voiced anger that their niece was overlooked and demanded to know what criteria was used to select Laura Spence . <p> " One of them said at the meeting , in front of everyone , that their family had done so much for the society , and she did n't think it was fair that someone coming off the street should get the chance to be the queen , " Ezra Spence said . <p> and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Palmeri did not deny that strong words were exchanged at meetings , but said the Pantos had nothing to do with the selection . However , he did say the Panto family 's contributions to the society were a major factor in their consideration . <p> Callery said Laura Spence was chosen by the committee primarily on the strength of a one-page essay the girls were asked to write . <p> But Tumminello said the essay should not have been weighed so heavily , and that other factors included the girls ' level of involvement with the society . Maria Panto had been in the queen 's court at past festivals for seven years , while Laura Spence was only in it for two years , he said . <p> Laura Spence will have her turn as queen , Tumminello said . <p> " Here 's the big question : Is it important for her family for her to be queen to honor their ancestors , or is it important to her to be the 100th queen ?

 Petey 's 's in Plainfield Township is the end of a long road <p> My creation : Cheesesteak with mushrooms , fried onions and banana peppers . I went with the peppers because it 's part of the " house " offering . <p> What I liked : Good bread . And the peppers offered a nice twist of flavor . Some grill fatigue is involved , making for a messy sandwich , especially for those who insist on sauce . The mushrooms were also good . I 'm beginning to think the meat pulverization seen at a lot of places is the result of the type of beef that is used . It should be sliced and flipped instead of balled up and beaten to death . Nonetheless , this sandwich had good flavor . <p> What I did n't like : Grill fatigue was seen in the meat , but the sandwich was tasty .

You ca n't suddenly change your mind now , " she demanded . So I left my tasty sandwich and forced down another saucy selection . It was n't terrible . <p> Would I go back ? Yes .

The secret to their sandwich ? Head chef Zachary Albrecht , of Wind Gap , says it 's patience . " We 're just freaking awesome and I have the best kitchen crew , " Albrecht says . <p> What I liked : The sandwich is loaded and I mean loaded to the point where I got about two bites before I had to resort to the fork . I liked the bread , a fresh roll that Albrecht says comes in from New York . The banana peppers that are mixed in with the sandwich offer a nice zing to the sandwich . And , oh boy , is this one cheesy . " It 's the best steak , even going back to when Green Acres was around ( 25 years ago ) , " says Joseph Hull , of Plainfield Township . Hull has been a Petey 's regular since they opened the doors in 2009 . " The rolls are perfect . The sauce is perfect . The taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another one . " <p> What I did n't like : The roll gets a little soggy toward the end of the sandwich , but that 's because it 's one stuffed cheesesteak and it comes with plenty of sauce . Bridget DiBetta , 18 , of Plainfield Township , was working behind the counter and said that Alex 's sauce is the key to a great Petey 's steak sandwich . Of course , like many of the chefs on our cheesesteak journey , Alex would n't share his secret recipe . <p> What is the ambience ? Gas spot . This place is great for travelers who want a good bite to eat , or folks looking for a meal after a T-ball game or a bike ride .

 Utopias pushes the boundaries of beer <p> " Bestowed upon him was a glowing chalice , brimming with a heavenly nectar of malt and hops . And when the angels saw what the heavens had reaped , they cast down their voices and said , ' Drink it , and it shall be good . ' " <p> The 2011 release of Samuel Adams Utopias . <p> me after I opened a box on my desk that contained Sam Adams ' latest edition of Utopias <p> Boston Beer Co. first released Utopias ( pronounced with a hard ' s ' ) in 2001 , but its roots stretch back to 1994 and Triple Bock , according to brewer Bert Boyce . <p> In fact , it 's really just an extension of the original Sam Adams lager and what craft beer can be , he says . <p> " It 's been a mission of ( company founder Jim Koch 's ) since day one to redefine people 's perception of not only what beer is but what beer can be , " Boyce says . <p> As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer no matter the flavor , " he says . <p> The brewery releases Utopias only every two years . It 's difficult to make , and the company ca n't make much of it as it takes years to age the vintages that make up any given release , according to Boyce . <p> " We need to build up an inventory , " he says . " We 're mainly trying to keep up with current limited demand . " <p> The base beer is essentially a strong barley wine that contains a heavy dose of maple syrup , according to Boyce . The secret to Utopias is the wood casks in which the beer ages , some of it for up to 18 years . <p> The brewer has used cognac , wine and bourbon whiskey barrels to age Utopias , and the 2011 edition was aged in sherry , port and Madeira barrels . Boyce , who prefers fortified wine barrels himself , says he and his fellow brewers are currently on the lookout for Irish whiskey barrels . <p> This year 's release was limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utopias is a lengthy , expensive process that Boston Brewing undertakes , well , because it can , Boyce says . <p> " We love making it , " he says , adding some people tell him their plans for opening their vintage . " It 's a lot of work . It 's a labor of love definitely . " <p> Beer review : Okay , maybe I should have sampled Utopias before waxing poetic , but I was genuinely excited about trying this beer . <p> It 's the biggest beer available in the states at ( pause for dramatic build up ) a whopping 27 percent ABV , making it illegal in 13 states for Pete 's sake . It is , however , an extravagant extravagance at about a bottle . <p> The lengthy aging process in wooden barrels at ambient temperature also leaves the beer with no carbonation . And for all my harping on trying your beer at cellar temperature , it finally pays off here . It 's specifically recommended you let your one- or two-ounce serving of Utopias poured into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature . <p> Believe me , it 's worth it . <p> The aroma is intoxicating . It does n't at all smell how one would envision a beer smelling , not even any bigger beer you may have tried . It 's sweet , strong , maybe a little nutty with just some vanilla , spice and dried fruit notes to it . <p> Color is actually hard to pin down . It 's dark brown with a reddish hue from one angle then a lighter , more translucent brown from another . <p> It pours like a port or a brandy . Swirl the glass gently and the beer to coat the sides and you 'll see its fingers much like a glass of wine . <p> The aroma alone is worth writing about . It 's full and bold , yet mellow . It does smell a lot like a port wine . Really stick your nose in the glass and take a long , slow sniff and the aroma intensifies and completely fills your nostrils until you can almost taste it in the back of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were to set this in front of someone and did n't tell them it was a beer , they 'd be hard pressed to figure it out . <p> The first sip . <p> Holy cow . Hold on a second . I need a moment . <p> Initially , you 'll get a sweet note as soon as the beer touches your lips . But it really does n't adhere to a strict definition of sweet . It 's sweet in so much as maple syrup is described as sweet ... maple syrup that 's aged for years in a barrel of port . <p> For me , the biggest characteristic to muscle its way forward , in a gentlemanly manner of course , is the port . It 's a kind of spiced presence with fruit notes . You 'll also get some subtle toffee notes in the aroma and flavor . <p> The finish is so very mellow . It just coats your throat , stomach , various extremities . Like a liquor , you 'll get that all encompassing warming feeling just settling in over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow , how strong is this stuff ? <p> It 's almost like a buttery feel on your palate with a body and consistency that is obviously thicker any beer you 've ever tried . <p> As I mentioned earlier , the brewer recommends about two ounces at room temperature . There really is n't any other way to drink it , and at 27 percent ABV it 's simply not recommended to drink much more than that . <p> But more importantly it would be a terrible disservice to do otherwise . Craft beer is not just about gettin ' your buzz on , but rather enjoying what the beer offers , savoring its many characteristics and nuances . <p> Drinking Utopias to get drunk would by a shameful embarrassment .

" <p> By the 1970s , Kline had moved from the Lehigh Valley to Houston and began a habit of volunteerism on behalf of veterans that has continued until this day .

Casey was among the dignitaries who celebrated the sanctuary 's opening in January . <p> " I want to help because I know what they 're going through , " Kline said of his fellow veterans . " I do n't tire from it . It rejuvenates me because I know I 'm doing something and I 'm helping .

He struck out 121 and allowed 25 hits and 35 walks in innings . His opponents batted an anemic .125 against him . <p> The 6-foot-2 ? , 210-pound Keselica was just as formidable at the plate .

He joins Jared Monti ( 2000 ) as the only Voorhees players to capture the award . <p> " I 've seen some very talented players , but I do n't remember anybody that had a season like he did , " Mattson said .

He 's baseball-oriented 12 months a year . " <p> Keselica still found time to play basketball during the winter . He averaged 20 points per game as a forward for coach Sparky Nanni 's Vikings . <p> Keselica even toiled with soccer for a while , but gave it up after his freshman season . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball in my hand around the house , " said Keselica , who lives in Glen Gardner . " By my sophomore year I decided soccer was too much so I focused on baseball and basketball . Baseball was always my favorite sport .

" I do sprints , long distance running , work with the medicine ball , ( elastic ) bands and weights with dumbbells . I do n't do bench presses though because they 're bad for your shoulder . " <p> " The key to being a consistent pitcher is hitting your spots and keeping the batter off-balance , " said Keselica , who has a 90 mph fastball along with a changeup and curve . " You have to move the batters ' eyes . Those are the basics to being successful . " <p> Keselica opened the season with 11 strikeouts in an 11-6 win at Phillipsburg on April 2 .

 District pondering fate of parking pass fees <p> Express-Times Photo BILL are parked in the lot in front of Saucon Valley High School . The reserved spot shown is separate from other reserved spots that are auctioned off to raise money for the Saucon Valley Foundation . <p> It irks Saucon Valley School Director Lanita Lum that students must pay to park in the high school parking lot while everyone else gets to park for free . <p> " I find this personally discriminatory , " Lum said of the auctioned spots . <p> Lum is urging the board to do away with the fee and start using the privilege to park as an incentive for good behavior . The board is set to discuss student parking at its July 26 meeting . <p> " It may seem like peanuts , for a kid to pay for a parking pass , but they do n't charge anybody else , " Lum said . " I know it 's a little issue but I think it makes a huge statement . " <p> The parking fee was instituted about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year and covers the cost of printing for the student handbook . Students who score well on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment exams have the option of waiving the parking fee as a reward . <p> For the past two years , the foundation has auctioned off three marked parking spaces in its silent auction at the parent prom . The spots were just one of many items to bid on at the prom , including student artwork and a week at a lake house , Chairwoman Susan Kennedy said . <p> The auction of the three spaces generated about each year and 100 percent of that money goes back to the students , she said . Kennedy noted they are n't prime spots ; they 're in the fourth row of the lot . <p> The foundation offers educational grants to teachers and funds projects in the schools that the district otherwise might not be able to afford . <p> Lum is quick to mention she is very proud of all that the foundation has accomplished . But she believes raffling off district real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see designated spots in the parking lot for a student of the month . <p> " Do n't make it about money and who 's the richest that can buy the best space for the kids , " Lum said . " That 's just wrong . We have a diverse community here . " <p> But just because the board is discussing parking does n't mean everyone agrees with Lum 's take . <p> Director Edward and board Vice President Susan Baxter do n't take issue with the foundation auctioning off the spots . said he 's surprised parking is an issue . <p> " I think they have managed to accomplish a lot with their fundraising , " said . " I think they 've certainly done a lot of good work in my mind . " <p> While Baxter said she does n't have any strong feelings about the fundraising , she agrees students should be able to park for free . The board considered the parking fee along with a slew of other revenue-generating options , such as pay-to-play . Baxter opposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a parking lot and it 's not because the students are driving to school that we need a parking lot , " Baxter said . <p> Lum thinks if students knew they could lose their parking spot for a week if they were tardy three times , that would be a much better motivator than a detention . <p> " We finally found something the kids would do anything not to lose , " Lum said . " Why are we not using it ? " <p> Director Sandra Miller does n't think that the parking passes are an exorbitant expense , and many school districts also charge . <p> She has a unique perspective on the parking spot auction because her son actually had one of the spots last year . She noted other things being auctioned off included a row at the football stadium and it was all in good fun , she said . <p> The parent prom is open to all parents and the silent auction offers a fun way for parents to direct money back to student programs , Miller said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose husband is a foundation member , said . " There was never any intent of seeing it as being elitist . It all goes to a good cause . It is all going back to the kids and the foundation grants . " <p> Perhaps in the future the auction should be offered online so it is open to parents that ca n't attend the adult prom , she suggested . <p> While the spots are a great advertisement for the foundation , Kennedy said if the district stopped offering them , the foundation would find another fundraising opportunity . <p> Miller hopes it wo n't come to that . <p> " I would hate for the foundation not to have an opportunity to auction off ideas , " Miller said . " I 'd hate for it to be totally given away . "@@4221068 <h> Interview : B.A.

 Easton could be site of whitewater kayak course <p> Express-Times Photo AMY prepares his kayak for a dip at the Sand Island boat launch in Bethlehem . <p> A group of Lehigh Valley kayaking enthusiasts want to see the Lehigh River through the city become home to a world-class whitewater course . <p> Lehigh Valley Whitewater Inc. approached city council Wednesday with its plans to create a kayaking course in concert with plans by the Wildlands Conservancy to remove half the dam on the Lehigh River below Scott Park . <p> Ross McLennan , vice president of Lehigh Valley Whitewater , said fish ladders similar to the one at the confluence of the Delaware and Lehigh rivers simply do n't work . <p> Removing a portion of the dam in Easton is part of an ongoing effort by the Wildlands Conservancy and Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to remove dams along the Lehigh River , he said . <p> The conservancy is scheduled to open bids July 26 to study the feasibility of removing half the dam at the Lehigh and Delaware rivers and the Chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley Whitewater proposes what 's called a rock ramp on the Easton side of the dam . <p> The ramp would be a gradual quarter-mile to third-mile incline with wider , shallower steps than a fish ladder , according to McLennan . <p> " It basically becomes an escalator , " he said . <p> The design not only works better for the shad headed up the Delaware to spawn , but it 's much safer for kayakers than the existing dam , McLennan said . The low-head dam in use now can create turbulence that could trap kayakers , he said . <p> A whitewater course would take advantage of the existing 30-foot drop and stretch roughly from the South Third Street bridge to the dam with other kayaking activities in the " still water areas " from roughly the McDonald 's west , according to McLennan . The Wildlands Conservancy must focus its efforts and resources on improving fish passage along the Lehigh River , but its work runs in close parallel with Lehigh Valley Whitewater 's , he said . <p> But do n't expect to navigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer .

 ex-husband stopped paying child support in August 2009 . <p> The 51-year-old mother was particularly worried because she relied heavily on it to take care of her disabled daughter . <p> " My full-time job is taking care of Heather , " she said of her 24-year-old child , who suffers from epilepsy . <p> Legal Services of Northwest Jersey took on the Phillipsburg woman 's case , and attorneys were able to prove her ex-husband must still pay assistance for two of their children . In February , Servidio received a long-awaited child-support check . <p> For more than 30 years , Legal Services has held the line against slumlords , deadbeat parents , and other dubious characters .

 Carvahlo , left , 16 of Bethlehem , does a jump at the Bethlehem Skate Park in May as Julio Diaz , 15 of Bethlehem , looks on . <p> Easton 's mayor is making a pitch to the Two Rivers Council of Government to develop the city 's proposed skate park as a regional attraction . <p> Mayor Sal Panto Jr . will discuss the project with member municipalities at the council of governments ' quarterly meeting 7 p.m . Wednesday in Wilson Borough . Easton would provide the location and assume all liability and participating municipalities would contribute a percentage of the project 's cost based on population , the mayor said . <p> Wilson Mayor David Perruso and Forks and Palmer township officials have signaled interest in some type of partnership , according to the mayor . Skateboarders make up a small population in each community , but a sizeable group when spread across four or five municipalities , Panto said . <p> If you can spread the cost of a park over a handful of municipalities , it 's far more effective than each community trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't justify what Bethlehem did . I ca n't justify a million dollars , " Panto said , referring to Bethlehem 's million Skateplaza . " They had funding sources . Bethlehem was n't paying for all of it . " <p> The city in early 2010 pledged from its capital budget to match any money raised privately by the Boys and Girls Club of Easton , which has taken the lead in planning for the skate park . The city also earmarked the site of its former in-line skating rink in Lower Hackett Park for the project . <p> In June , the city 's first-ever Skatefest along Larry Holmes Drive attracted more than 100 skateboarders from around the Easton area , signaling to the mayor the potential for a regional skate park . He hopes to have the interested municipalities approve a contribution toward the park as part of 2012 budgets in order to bid the project in the spring . <p> said he supports the concept of a regional skate park , adding that the borough has had ongoing issues with skateboarders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates before taking the idea back to borough council . <p> " If it 's a joint venture , it may not be a minimal cost but an affordable one , " Perruso said . <p> Palmer Township Supervisor Robert Lammi is the township 's liaison to the council .

" For me , it makes no sense for every municipality to build something this expensive when together they can build a larger regional facility .

 Allentown did n't discriminate against a Muslim woman who was employed as a bookkeeper at St. Anthony of Padua 's Catholic Church in Easton , according to a court filing . <p> The diocese is being sued by Forks Township resident Omayma Arafa , who filed the lawsuit in May in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia . She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages along with a permanent injunction barring the diocese from future religious discrimination , records say . <p> The diocese is asking for a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit . <p> Arafa , who is originally from Egypt , worked for St. Anthony 's from October 2007 until January 2009 when she was fired .

 life at Lafayette College reports alcohol violations , unwanted sexual contact <p> Lafayette College has seen five Greek organizations close and has taken formal action almost 60 times against the groups in the last 10 years , according to a report issued by a working group . <p> The report also notes a higher rate of unwanted sexual contact reported by Greek students than non-Greeks . <p> To better understand Greek life 's place at Lafayette College , the college tasked a working group to examine the college 's then active five fraternities and six sororities . After an 18-month review , the final report was submitted to the college 's Board of Trustees in May . <p> Since 2000 , a total of 59 formal actions were taken against Greek organizations and alcohol was a factor in nearly all conduct proceedings for which formal or preemptive action was taken , according to the report . <p> Lafayette spokesman Roger Clow said the report does not identify which Greek groups were the subject of the formal actions , and the report does not detail the infractions . <p> Since 2000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action or action taken by the fraternities ' national organizations and alumni . <p> Closed are Phi Gamma Delta and Theta Chi , and three groups that voluntarily withdrew from campus pending conduct proceedings are Chi Phi , Theta Delta Chi , and Kappa Delta Rho , which closed its chapter in June . <p> Chi Phi recently applied to re-colonize at Lafayette and the application is being considered by the Board of Trustees . <p> Clow said the working group found that the college 's process of dealing with group misconduct is consistent with best practices and the practices employed at other colleges . <p> Out of the college 's almost 2,400 students , about 40 percent of Lafayette 's upper-class population is affiliated with the Greek system . <p> Unwanted sexual contact <p> The working group noted 24 percent of Greek students reported experiencing unwanted sexual contact since coming to college , as compared to 10 percent of non-Greek students . The report does not detail how the group defined unwanted sexual contact . <p> " Greek students were also more likely to report having unprotected and unplanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex , to report alcohol-related sexual contacts , and to have experienced or to know of others who have experienced incidents of sexual assault and harassment , " according to the report . <p> Clow said the data the group cites was from internal surveys conducted by the college . <p> " We feel the findings with respect to unwanted sexual experiences reflect behavior that is troubling , but unfortunately not uncommon at colleges and universities and in the wider society . We take such problems seriously , " Clow said in an e-mail . " That is the reason for proactively undertaking a study of this kind to take steps to better understand where problems lie and then to solve them . " <p> How the report came to be <p> Jim Krivoski , Lafayette 's vice president for student affairs , did not return an e-mail message asking about the report . The college replaced the previous position of adviser to fraternities and sororities with a new position , director of fraternity and sorority life , which is unfilled . <p> The working group was comprised of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , administrators and nine students , five of whom were Greek members , Clow said . <p> The " most contentious issue " faced by the group was the question of group and individual responsibility for violations of the college 's code of conduct . <p> Clow noted Lafayette 's student handbook explicitly holds frats or sororities responsible for violations of the college 's alcohol policy by individuals , including undergraduates and alumni , at events . That includes events off campus . <p> " Individuals who violate these rules will also be held accountable , and , when appropriate , both individuals and organizations will be subject to disciplinary actions , " according to the student handbook . <p> The working group included 31 recommendations in five categories , and Clow said the administration and the board are reviewing the report . <p> " The administration will present a proposed implementation plan to the board at its meeting in October , " said Clow , the college 's director of communications , via e-mail . <p> The group recommended the Greek organizations sponsor alcohol-free events ; help plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chapter of GAMMA ( Greeks Advocating the Mature Management of Alcohol ) . <p> " The college must work with alumni advisers to address the issue of organizations moving their social events to off-campus locations in order to provide alcohol to minors ( their own members and as a recruiting practice ) , " the group said in its recommendations .@@4241172 <h> Stolen moments :

 feeders is high during this time of the year <p> During a recent morning coffee wake-up session on the front porch , I was pleasantly surprised to see so much bird activity in the yard . <p> I should n't have been , though , because it 's the end of July and migrant species , the birds that leave here to spend the winter in warmer climates , are starting to move . This is just the beginning of the annual movement that will go on until the middle of November . <p> A black-and-white warbler was feeding in the trees underneath dead grapevines that I cut but which are still covered with brown leaves after a month . They 're pretty ugly , actually , and it 's to my husband David 's credit that he has n't said anything to me about them . <p> But I 'll wait until fall to slice through others I want to remove . <p> Ruby-throated hummingbird activity at the flowers and feeders has been great this year .

I only bought it to show during programs as an example of the kind of feeder that you do n't need around here . <p> Hummingbird activity is always high at feeders , regardless of how many natural nectar sources available , when it rains , especially during heavy downpour . The rain makes it difficult for them to feed at flowers and cuts their normal supply of insects down to almost nothing . <p> During periods of extreme heat like the horrendously hot days we recently experienced , insects are everywhere . You may not see them but suddenly there 's something buzzing around your ear or landing somewhere on exposed skin , which is usually some kind of fly looking for a blood meal . <p> I 'll bet there is n't anyone around who has n't been aggravated by a fly constantly landing on irritated , cut , or injured skin .

 , initially thought to be a potential suicide by cop , surrendered without incident after a domestic dispute that escalated . <p> It 's not a common threat , but it 's one authorities take seriously : suicide by cop . <p> When reports surfaced that Damon , a 31-year-old Phillipsburg man allegedly involved in a domestic assault July 22 , had issued threats he would not be taken alive , dispatchers emphasized caution to law enforcement who might approach the suspect . <p> " I think it 's more of a spur of the moment type of thing to say . Because if you 're going to do that , are you really going to tell people that you 're going to do that ? " Slattery said . " But if that 's what you 're saying , then that 's what you 're saying , it 's going to be treated as any other threat . " <p> Slattery , a unit supervisor for the state police missing persons unit , was involved in issuing the Amber Alert for the 19-month-old daughter took with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , the girl 's mother . <p> Threats of suicide by cop or warning that the suspect will not be taken alive are made by individuals intending to die in a firefight with authorities , experts say . To provoke the gunfire , these people will often point a weapon at or fire upon law enforcement . <p> Slattery , a coordinator with the state Central Region Critical Incident Negotiation Team covering southern Hunterdon , Burlington and Ocean counties said a suicide-by-cop scenario would only be truly authentic if the weapon was either not real or not loaded . Only in such a case , Slattery said , would that individual truly be intending to die at the hands of law enforcement without inflicting harm . <p> But how would authorities be able to tell the difference between a lifelike or unloaded weapon and one ready to fire ? They would n't , Slattery said . <p> " You have to stop the threat , " he said .

He said those cases are rare but serious . <p> " That creates a whole other dynamic , " Ferguson said . " But you just ca n't generalize these things . " <p> New Jersey State Police Sgt. Stephen Jones said authorities take threats against law enforcement seriously . <p> " Regardless of someone 's intentions if they 're ... holding a knife to their own throats , it 's a lot different than someone who is pointing a gun at police . It 's really not treated any differently than someone who 's trying to harm police , " Jones said . <p> In such a scenario , Jones said , police are trained to eliminate the threat . <p> " That 's the primary goal to end it safely with nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person from hurting other people and if possible prevent them hurting themselves , " Jones said . " But we 're not trained to shoot to wound . If there 's a threat , we 're trained to deal with that threat . " <p> Consequences for officers <p> Although police are trained to eliminate the danger in such a situation , the consequences of firing at , wounding or killing that person can far outlast the incident itself , according to Slattery . <p> His crisis team will respond to suicidal suspects , barricades and hostage scenarios situations where firing a weapon is a real possibility . No two people deal with it identically , Slattery said . <p> " Everybody likes to think they can handle it and it 's not going to bother them , but no one knows until you 're in that situation , " Slattery said .

 K. Barnes after his arrest in October 2008 . <p> The man authorities say is responsible for the 2008 beating and attempted rape of a 69-year-old Phillipsburg woman has been found incompetent to stand trial at least for now . <p> Ronald K. Barnes , 22 , of the 400 block of Watson Place in Phillipsburg , is being kept at the Ann Klein Forensic Center in West Trenton while he awaits trial on second-degree charges of aggravated assault , criminal attempt to commit aggravated sexual assault , robbery and burglary . <p> State Superior Court Judge Ann Bartlett signed an order Monday declaring Barnes mentally unfit to proceed with a trial . <p> Barnes was 19 when he knocked on the door of the woman 's home Oct. 1 , 2008 , at the Village Arms apartments and asked for a glass of water , authorities say . When the 69-year-old tenant tried to close the door on Barnes , he allegedly forced his way in , punching her in the face . <p> Authorities say he took the victim into the bathroom and tried to clean off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to rape her . <p> Police found the woman about noon the next day , badly injured and slipping in and out of consciousness . <p> Court records indicate Barnes admitted to trying to rape the woman in a videotaped confession after his arrest . <p> Bartlett 's finding that Barnes is incompetent to stand trial is the second such determination for the Phillipsburg man .

 progressed when he got the reps and got better and better every week , " head coach Andy Coen said . " What he did at Lafayette ( career-high 16 tackles , including key goal-line stop ) was tremendous ; that was awesome . He 's had a great offseason . I think it 's going to mean a lot to our defense to have Mike out there this year . " <p> Coen continued to say as Groome saw more action , he improved his speed from sideline-to-sideline , as a run stopper and blitzer , to highlight a few . The 2011 co-captain fits right into that mold of gritty linebackers that have led Lehigh over the past few seasons . <p> Diamond , a two-time Patriot League first teamer , led the Mountain Hawks in tackles during his final two seasons ( 2007-08 ) . He topped the league with 104 stops as a senior , was the first Lehigh player since Ian Eason ( 1996-97 ) to register tackles in consecutive seasons . <p> Despite his departure , the Mountain Hawks had Cohen to rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cohen led the Patriot League in sacks ( 6.5 ) and tackles for loss ( 17 ) . He became a more dominant force as a senior , being named the Patriot League Defensive Player of the Year while again leading the league in sacks ( 9 ) and TFL ( 13.5 ) . He was a first team All-American as well . <p> After Cohen , Pierce stepped up . Pierce , who missed most of his freshman season due to injury , ranked second on Lehigh during his senior season with 110 tackles in 2010 only behind Groome but had a team-high 12 tackles for loss . <p> How Groome fairs this fall is still to be determined , but his performances last season turned a lot of heads , so do n't be shocked if No. 43 is dominant again in 2011 . <p> At the Patriot League Media Day on Tuesday morning , he said all of the football talk made him antsy to go hit somebody . So obviously he 's ready to replicate last season 's success . <h> Related <p> Craig 
 File has 112.5 percent of your daily value of Vitamin C in every cup . <p> You can walk out of a grocery store any time of the year with a cantaloupe . But summertime is when that ( thanks Crayola ) melon is at its peak fresh , sweet , fragrant and melt-in-your mouth juicy . <p> Alias : Cantaloupe or muskmelon , or rockmelon ( depending on which part of the world you 're in ) is actually a member of the squash , cucumber and gourd family . Other varieties include Casaba , Crenshaw , Honeydew , Persian , Santa Claus and Sharlyn . <p> History : There are differing stories on how cantaloupe came into existence one version says the melon was discovered in the Middle East , and a second vividly paints the picture of a melon discovered in an Italian papal village in 1700 A.D. and christened with the name of the village , according to , the home of Del Monte . Today the U.S. , Turkey , Iran and Central America are major producers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saturated fat , sodium and cholesterol and are a great source of vitamins A , B6 , potassium , fiber and folate , says .

Apparently that 's wrong . **26;32;TOOLONG advises washing the whole melon in warm , soapy water to get rid of impurities on the rind . Otherwise the knife that cuts through the rind , will contaminate the fruit . Cantaloupe cut and left at room temperature for more than four hours risks salmonella , whfoods.org says . <p> Choose carefully : I feel like a fool holding a melon to my ear in the grocery store , like one would hold a conch to listen for the ocean , but it works .

There 's always the fail-safe or a healthy lunch of sliced cantaloupe with yogurt and mint . <p> FLAGSTAFF , Ariz. 
 of vacant properties <p> The city released an updated " most wanted " vacant property list Thursday that features some prominent buildings , including the armory building , Black Diamond Enterprises on the South Side and the long-vacant Hooper House at Fifth and Northampton streets . <p> Standing among an array of photographs depicting dozens of vacant properties in varying states of disrepair , Mayor Sal Panto Jr . warned owners to repair their buildings , sell them or be prepared to fight the city . <p> " We will no longer allow such blight to go unchallenged , " Panto read from a statement . " We 're done playing and accepting the status quo .

Repeating his continued frustration over the building 's appearance , Santos said the historic commission is scheduled to review another renovation plan at its meeting Monday . <p> " It seems like we 're in footrace with the city right now , " he said . " One side is trying to blight the property and another side is trying to rehab it .

 targets summer learning loss among low-income students <p> Nine-year-old Sophia Marcellus did n't get a traditional summer vacation this year . And she did n't miss it one bit . <p> " I just like this school so much , " Marcellus said , sitting with fellow fourth-graders at Shawnee Elementary School .

While all students tend to lose math skills over the summer , according to the study , students from low-income families lose much more ground in reading and spelling skills than higher-income students . <p> That is why in selecting students for Summer Sizzle , ProJeCt of Easton specifically seeks economically disadvantaged students who are having trouble keeping up with their peers in reading , said Executive Director Janice . <p> " It 's really addressing kids who are at risk of falling behind or who have fallen behind on reading , " she said last week .

She talked about learning synonyms by making a snowman out of construction paper then writing different synonyms for words in each snowball . <p> " We try to make it fun because it is the summer and we do n't want them to hate coming here , but we still engage them so we can avoid that summer slide , " said Lenore Daul , Summer Sizzle program coordinator . <p> The RAND study suggests school districts partner with community-based organizations more often to offer summer enrichment programs they otherwise could not afford . <p> But ProJeCt of Easton has its own financial struggles when it comes to keeping Summer Sizzle going , said . <p> The program 's budget is about , or per student , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program that allows businesses to contribute to education in exchange for tax credits . <p> But funding from the state program has dropped from in 2009 to in 2011 , leaving ProJeCt to depend more heavily on donations , said spokeswoman Meg Dowd .

 is my new favorite ingredient . My husband ca n't understand why I buy two , three boxes at a time . Four words : Sticky buns and cheese Danish . With frozen puff pastry , you can make delicious flaky desserts and breakfast treats quickly and with half the mess than if you attempted to make the buttery dough from scratch . <p> Buy a frozen box and let it defrost for 20 to 30 minutes . Throw down some flour , grab a rolling pin and you 're in business . In the better part of an hour you can turn , cut , stuff and bake Danish , sticky buns , flaky appetizers or even chicken pot pie . <p> In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment , combine 12 Tablespoons butter and 1/3 cup brown sugar .

Hagedorn Psychiatric Hospital in Lebanon Township . <p> The denouncement came in an address to a crowd of more than 50 at a busy intersection near the hospital in Lebanon Township . <p> " Hagedorn has earned the trust and respect of patients , families , professionals and the community at large , " said Leslie Huhn , a registered nurse who is running for Assembly in New Jersey 's 24th Legislative District . <p> The 24th District will cover northern Warren County and Sussex County once the April redistricting plan takes effect following the Nov. 8 general election .

" series of the 70s , sits by a piano at the Deer Head Inn in Delaware Water Gap . <p> Bob Dorough was writing jingles for a New York ad agency in the 1970s when the company 's president approached him for a special project . <p> The man 's son was having a difficult time learning his multiplication tables , but the father noticed the boy knew all the words to his Beatles songs . The president asked Dorough to write rock songs that reviewed his son 's math lessons . <p> Dorough , now of Upper Mount Bethel Township , was an accomplished jazz pianist , but he gave educational music a shot . The result was " Schoolhouse Rock ! , " the series of educational shorts that have taught generations of school children about math , science and history . <p> " It was a bolt of lightning coming down , " Dorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1970s , 80s and 90s . <p> It was a drastic turn of events for the now 89-year-old musician . Dorough had achieved mild fame as a jazz performer in the 1940s and 1950s . He lived in New York City , but he toured the continent and Europe as part of various bands and groups . He was even the musical director for the brief entertainment career of boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson before his dancing act bombed in Paris . <p> Music changed in the 1960s . Rock bands like The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix became mainstream , and the demand for jazz dropped off for anyone who was n't a household name . With the suburbs around New York City too expensive , Dorough moved his family to Upper Mount Bethel , where his daughter , Aralee , started school . Dorough took the job for the ad agency and commuted to New York City as a way to pay the bills . <p> " I was just trying to make a living . My jazz career in the 60s and early 70s was kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inn in Delaware Water Gap , where he 's performed for decades . <p> The idea of Math Rock ! quickly changed that . Recordings of his math songs were presented to ABC to air as a possible educational cartoon . Chuck Jones , the legendary animator who directed Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry , and Michael Eisner , then the head of ABC 's daytime programming , quickly signed off on the project . Parental groups had been storming the networks for years , pressuring them to provide more quality programing for children . The cartoons fit the bill perfectly , Dorough said . <p> It took Dorough two years to write 11 songs about numbers and math . While the songs centered on situations children would recognize , not every song was on the grade school level . The song " Little " tells how an alien with twelve fingers probably counts . The math lesson in the song focuses on Base 12 , a counting system where the numbers 10 and 11 are single digits . Dorough said the agency had to confirm the math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm something of an amateur mathematician , " said Dorough , who took an advanced math course while studying at Colombia University on the GI Bill . <p> Even Aralee got in on the action . Dorough said he was stumped trying to come up with a song for the number four . One day Dorough went on a walk with Aralee and her friend , and the girls suggested a song about a four-legged zoo . <p> " I did n't know quite what that was , but I liked the sound of it , " Dorough said looking back . He ran with the idea , and it became the song " The Four-Legged Zoo , " which names about 70 quadrupeds in three minutes . <p> What 's your favorite " Schoolhouse Rock ! " song ? Math Rock ! caught on , and more cartoons focusing on history , grammar and science were soon ordered under the name " Schoolhouse Rock ! " A team of song writers came on board , and they produced music faster than the animators could draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with to watch the new material air , he said . <p> ABC kept playing the shorts into the 1980s , and a new batch was ordered in the mid-90s . The cartoons have also been put onto DVDs so new generations can learn about sentence structure and the American Revolution , among other topics . <p> These days , Dorough is still going strong . He 's performing at a jazz festival in Norway this weekend and next month he 's the headliner for the Delaware Water Gap 's Celebration of the Arts . Erin Harper , the producer behind the independent film " My Best Day , " is also working on a documentary on Dorough 's career . <p> Dorough said people will still sometimes approach him at performances and ask him why his voice sounds so familiar . When word gets out he 's the man who wrote " Lolly Lolly Lolly Get Your Adverbs Here " and other songs , he usually gets a few " Schoolhouse Rock ! " requests . He enjoys it for the most part , but he admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's at a jazz club . <p> " Sometimes it does grate on my nerves , " he said . <p> Even with those passing moments of aggravation , Dorough said he 's happy to be working the career he chose as a high school student .

In the Civil War , small arms include muskets , rifles , carbines , pistols and revolvers . These weapons are identified by their caliber , their maker and their method of loading . <p> Both the U.S. Army and the Confederates were desperate for weapons in 1861 , at the start of the Civil War . <p> Early volunteers were often issued antique , imported or nearly obsolete weapons .

The breech loading mechanism allowed a mounted trooper to hold the carbine under his arm and against his body while using only one hand to fire up to five shots per minute . The South made copies of the Sharps carbine , which Gen. Robert E Lee described as " so defective as to be demoralizing to our men . " <p> Ambrose Everett Burnside designed and patented a carbine in 1856 at his factory in Rhode Island . With the onset of the Civil War , Burnside enlisted with the Rhode Island Volunteers and was appointed major general .

Wildlife veterinarian Dr. Erica Miller ( left ) and N.J. Dept. of Environmental Projection biologist Kathleen Clark attach a satellite transmitter to one of the two eaglets at Merrill Creek Reservoir earlier this summer . <p> The return of the bald eagle is one of the nation 's greatest conservation success stories . Once on the brink of extinction in the lower 48 states , the bird has rebounded to the point where it is no longer on the endangered species list and populations are doing very well in many locations throughout the United States . <p> And now , thanks to a partnership with Merrill Creek Reservoir , the biologists have a new tool to study young eagles even more closely , which will help to she 'd new light on the birds and their preferred habitat . <p> In mid-June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the nest of the pair of eagles that makes its home on the western shore of the 650-acre Warren County reservoir . The eagles ' offspring , a then eight-week-old male and female chick , were both fitted with Global Positioning System Platform Terminal Transmitters from Microwave Technology Inc. , marking the first time that DEP biologists have used satellite transmitters to monitor eagles in the Garden State . <p> " We 've previously used transmitters on young eagles to track their movements locally but that was very time- and labor-intensive , requiring staff to triangulate the eagle 's position with several locations and all from distances that could pick up the direct signal , " said Kathleen Clark , leader of the Endangered &amp; Nongame Species Program 's Bald Eagle Research &amp; Management Project . " With satellite technology , the data are collected remotely and regularly . For the first time , we 'll see the migration track they take , where they winter , and when and where they move in the years before they are ready to pair up to nest themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the transmitters were made possible thanks to a donation from the Merrill Creek Owners Group . The original plans for the funds were to purchase a camera to observe the eagles and their young in the nest but the nest 's remote location and the fact that the eagles sometimes move nesting locations , made the idea unfeasible . <p> " We were sitting on this money and thought , ' Why do n't we approach the New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection and see if they would be interested in purchasing some satellite transmitters for these two eagles , " Bullis said . " They were actually thrilled , so that 's where it kind of jumped off . " <p> The transmitters , which are attached to the birds with a harness made of Teflon ribbon , have a lifespan of approximately three years . While eagles do n't reach sexual maturity until age 5 , which means biologists wo n't be able to track the birds as they establish their own nests , the information that 's gathered in the coming years will provide an invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of habitat they prefer . <p> " Researchers in the Chesapeake Bay have tracked more than 60 eagles this way , and it has helped identify significant wintering areas that need protection to continue to support the Mid-Atlantic eagle population and maintain the bald eagles ' recovery , " Clark said . <p> According to Bullis , data that is captured include the birds ' latitude and longitude , as well as their speed , elevation and the direction they are traveling . The transmitters send the information to Argos receivers on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites , which then relay the data back to ground receiver stations before being passed on to Argos processing centers . <p> Although the young eagles have not yet dispersed from their nest , Bullis said the satellites have already captured data on the initial flights the birds have made . <p> " We have seen them a number of times already out flying , " Bullis said .

Eventually , the parents will wean them and then they 'll be forced to feed on their own . " <p> While Merrill Creek 's original idea of an eagle cam did n't quite pan out , Bullis said she is thrilled about the transmitters and hopes they will be a great resource , not just for biologists , conservationists and bird enthusiasts , but also the educational community as well . <p> " This use of the funds I think is going to generate so much more information , " she said . " It 's going to be critical to the ultimate protection of these birds and conservation of that critical habitat that they need . " <h> Published byStanford Medicine

Following three hours of testimony , Homanko left the court in recess and said he would not render a decision on the charges today . <p> Beiser and his attorney , Christopher Shipman , declined to comment until Homanko makes a decision . <p> Demko said his only reason for appearing in court was to apologize to the Kidder Township police and to Homanko . Following his guilty plea , Demko said he also wanted to publicly apologize to the Easton Police Department , Easton city administrators and city residents . <p> Demko would not comment any further on the incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said regardless of the outcome , he is focusing on the officers ' off-duty behavior .

Any more than that , Scalzo said , needs to be brought to Easton City Council for approval . Scalzo , citing personnel matters , said the discipline terms would not be made public . <p> Trouble for Beiser and Demko started in June following a wine festival .

 in Bethlehem 's first-ever VegFest , aimed not only at vegetarians and vegans but those interested in healthy eating and the environment . Organizers thought they should expand upon it with a week of restaurant specials , said Samantha Schwartz , manager of the Downtown Bethlehem Association . <p> " Our other goal with this event is to educate the people of Bethlehem and the Lehigh Valley about locations that have great vegetarian and vegan food options , " she said .

The plaintiffs claim township officials adopted the law improperly and with a possible conflict of interest . <p> " We have n't been served the lawsuit at the time of the application , " planning board Chairman Garret Van Vliet said Wednesday , admitting he knew of the lawsuit . " Board attorney Edward Palmer advised continuing with the application . " <p> Palmer did not return several calls seeking comment on the recommendation . <p> Township attorney Michael Lavery was served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served Thursday , according to Dilts . <p> " What was my defense if I do n't hear the application ? " Van Vliet said . " We had 45 days to act or it would automatically be approved . " <p> No notice to school , residents <p> A key component of the lawsuit is the allegation that residents living within 200 feet of the township 's industrial zone received no notice of the ordinance 's public hearing . <p> " Under the municipal land use law , if you are making a change to the classification or boundary of a zoned district , the law requires a notice sent to all property owners within 200 feet , " Dilts said in an e-mail . <p> But the township 's special legal counsel , Jack Carbone , claims the ordinance does n't change the classification or the boundary , just the permitted use . <p> " There is a difference between the classification and the uses within it , " Carbone said Wednesday . <p> As a precaution to try to avoid litigation , Lopatcong Township Council is considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The township plans to send out notices of the new measure . <p> That ordinance passed its first of two readings Oct. 5 , and Dilts said she hopes the notices will be sent out early next week . <p> " Instead of thousands of dollars in legal fees if we did it wrong , we will do it the way they say so the litigation is dropped , " Carbone said . <p> However , the original ordinance and the application approval are already official , according to Van Vliet . <p> Another member of the planning board provided a different explanation of the new ordinance the township claims is a precautionary measure . <p> " I believe it had to do with the solar power fields and the height of silos , " planning Vice Chairman David Lance said , referring to a provision regulating potential solar plant applications . " There was clarification of the original language . " <p> Lopatcong Elementary School is outside the 200-foot area for receiving notice of the ordinance , but it is close to the site of the proposed asphalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , " Pede said Friday . " I do believe the township would inform parents . " <p> Neighboring businesses say they received notice of the asphalt plant hearing two weeks before it was held . <p> " I did n't know it was an asphalt plant , because I heard a solar farm was moving in , " Precast Manufacturing Co. owner Gregory Fisher said , referencing the letter with both industries mentioned in the ordinance . " I did n't read it carefully enough . If it was sent certified , I would have paid closer attention . " <p> The applicant <p> The applicant for the asphalt plant was 189 Stryker 's Road Associates , LLC , which has the identical address 859 Willow Grove St. , Hackettstown and some of the same owners as Intercounty Paving Associates . <p> Intercounty Paving was represented in Alpha by Brian Tipton , a lawyer with Florio Perrucci Steinhardt &amp; Fader LLC , where Steinhardt , the Lopatcong Township mayor , is a principal partner . The Lopatcong applicant , 189 Stryker 's Road Associates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is unaffiliated with Steinhardt 's firm . <p> One of the principal owners of Intercounty Paving is John Perrucci , who is a brother of Michael Perrucci , another principal partner in Florio Perrucci Steinhardt &amp; Fader . <p> This time around , brothers Carl Lizza III and John Lizza are the only principal owners listed in the 189 Stryker 's Road Associates application . They were also founders of Intercounty Paving . <p> Calls for comment to Carl Lizza III and John Lizza were not immediately returned . <p> Steinhardt said previously he contacted Intercounty Paving after an Alpha Borough Council meeting and suggested the company contact Township engineer Paul Sterbenz . <p> Steinhardt has abstained from votes regarding the asphalt ordinance and says he kept out of discussions after the original contact . <p> The lawsuit against the township claims the asphalt ordinance was " tainted by a conflict of interest or appearance of impropriety . " Attorney Jennifer Knarich , who filed the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs , declined to specify in September to whom or what that language refers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same address as 189 Stryker 's Road Associates because it was " not my responsibility . " <p> In talking with a reporter Wednesday , Van Vliet said he thought the applicant 's name was Inc. , which is actually the owner of the property . <p> Fisher , whose company makes underground utility structures near the proposed asphalt plant , said he has hired an attorney of his own to sue the township over the new plant . <p> " How can a business such as an asphalt plant be approved in one meeting and have no input of neighbors next door ?

 a controversial natural gas pipeline expansion runs through a nearly 21-acre Clinton Township property where a developer proposes four of five homes . <p> The attorney for the developer , SNJ Properties LLC , said his client would work with the township planning board to minimize any effect the right-of-way for two existing pipelines would have on the lots . <p> " The ( planning board ) raised this question . We said yes , " said George Dilts , of Flemington-based Dilts and Koester . " It 's been addressed on the application as much as we can .

The home itself would sit as far from the right-of-way as possible , Dilts said . <p> The Clinton Township Planning Board has scheduled a hearing on the development Nov. 7 . <p> The property owner is the Diocese of Metuchen , according to township officials . <p> Township Mayor Kevin said the developer should be concerned about the pipeline expansion proposed by Transcontinental Gas Pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The proposal , in a pre-filing stage before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , is to address what the company calls increased demand . <p> The proposed 6.8-mile pipeline expansion through Clinton , Franklin and Union townships in Hunterdon County would directly affect 90 property owners . The property owners dispute the increased demand and worry the pipe will compromise safety and property values . <p> , who also sits on the township planning board , said the Transco proposal has polarized residents . <p> " You ca n't legislate away " property rights , said . Developers in the past have built along rights-of-way , he said , and people have bought houses near them . <p> Dilts , the developer 's attorney , said , " From what we know , ( the proposed pipeline expansion ) is not expected to further impact our proposal . " <p> " Building more homes on top of this pipeline puts more families in harm 's way , " said Kate Millsaps , the club 's program assistant . " We need to revise our land-use laws to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interstate energy infrastructure . ... We should site these energy projects along other industrial and transportation corridors . " <p> Millsaps said she finds it " very troubling " that there is nothing the planning board can do to limit growth along the pipeline . <p> " You would think the gas companies would prefer less residential development as well so they would not have to worry about people putting sheds up or planting trees on top of their pipe , " she said . <p> Bringing to the

However , some women cut their hair , assumed men 's names and disguised themselves to pass as men .

 members differ on future of Louise Moore Pine 's former home <p> Northampton County Council 's Finance Committee could n't agree Wednesday on what county officials should do about preserving the late Louise Moore Pine 's home , situated in the park that bears her name . <p> Council members heard a presentation from Hemmler Architects about designing renovations to the nearly 190-year-old home to convert it to some type of public use in accordance with Pine 's will . The widow of Dixie Cup Company founder Hugh Moore left the county the couple 's home and a million endowment for its maintenance . <p> Following the firm 's presentation , Councilwoman Ann McHale , who is not a member of the finance committee , said she had reservations about converting the historic home into office space .

 a special day ; he had his game face on , " Terwilliger said . " To see him come down through the sky and see what he did is what he 's all about . He steps up for challenges . Every day is a new day in the life of Denny Douds . " <p> Douds , in his 38th season as head coach with the Warriors , will see his myriad of accomplishments topped with a cherry on Saturday afternoon as he becomes the Division II all-time leader in games coached with 394 as East Stroudsburg hosts Millersville . <p> The 70-year-old Indiana , Pa. native will surpass Jim Malosky 's record of 393 games at Minnesota-Duluth ( 1958-97 ) . <p> " All it means is I 've listened to a lot of different versions of The Star Spangled Banner , " Douds said downplaying the record . " It also means I 've been associated with a lot of great kids and had the opportunity to coach with some fine coaches and got to compete against some fine coaches . <p> " If it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be involved in anything like this . " <p> Douds , the Pennsylvania Conference 's all-time wins leader with 230 , admitted the Golden Knights ' jump came as a surprise , especially when Quimby returned to the office a few days later to go over some of the finer details . The coach said Terwilliger , the offensive coordinator , and Santella , the offensive line/recruiting coordinator , were cracking up in the other room when Douds first became aware of what he was in for . <p> " When my family vacations in Florida and we go to Walt Disney World , I do n't go on the Tower of Terror , I hold the purses , " Douds said . " I do n't even go on the teacups with my grandkids . But I thought , ' Hey it 's something I 've never done . ' <p> " I was n't going to let anyone tell some 69-year-old guy he could n't jump out of an airplane . " <p> Terwilliger , who was recruited by Douds in 1974 to play at ESU and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always open to new ideas football-related or not whether it 's jumping out of planes or creating Twitter accounts and is always there to lend a hand through the school or the community . <p> " I 've spent more time with Denny Douds than with my father , " Terwilliger said . " I 've been a fortunate man to be in that position because of the type of person Coach Douds is . It 's really special . " <p> Douds , who graduated from Slipper Rock University in 1963 with a bachelor 's degree in physical education , joined the Warriors ' staff in 1966 as an assistant coach after completing his master 's degree at West Virginia . After two years at that position , he was named defensive coordinator ( 1968-73 ) before taking over as head coach in ' 74 . <p> File <p> 38th season as ESU head coach <p> Career record of <p> Nine PSAC titles <p> All-time PSAC wins leader ( 230 ) <p> Ranks fourth among active college coaches in career games ( 393 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 394 ) on Saturday <p> has led ESU to nine PSAC titles , four NCAA playoff appearances and the 2005 Northeast Regional title . <p> He still remembers his first game in charge as if it were yesterday . <p> " We played Slippery Rock , my alma mater , " Douds recalled . " After warming up , we went back into the locker room which was in the old gym . On the way down the stairs there was a beehive and somebody stepped on it and 15 kids got stung . That was n't the worst thing that happened to us because they ( Slippery Rock ) went on to destroy us . " <p> That season , the Warriors went 5-5 but proceeded to win back-to-back titles in 1975 ( 10-0 ) and ' 76 ( 9-0-1 co-champs ) with Terwilliger at quarterback . <p> Over the course of his tenure , Douds and his program have evolved and at times have been in the forefront of how the game of football has changed . Douds said in his early years at ESU , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " In the 80s we went to the spread offense and everyone thought we were nuts because they were using tight ends , " he said . " Now the spread offense is a national offense and we still throw it as much . " <p> Despite having been on a football staff since 1963 when he was an assistant coach at McDowell High School ( Erie , Pa. ) , there seems to be no immediate desire to stop doing what he loves . <p> But the question needs and needed to be asked , just in case . <p> Any thoughts of retirement ? <p> " If I do n't get asked that once a week , I think it 's a bad week , " Douds said . " I 'm ready to make CDs and hand them out ( with my answer ) . I 've never given it a second thought right now . I thoroughly enjoy coaching and all aspects of it . " <p> Not only does he value his daily and weekly football routine , Douds said the best part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said his job is to prepare his players for life after school and hopes each of them make a positive impact in their communities . <p> Douds said he cherishes that more than winning a football game , though a victory Saturday would be nice addition since East Stroudsburg has struggled this year , sitting at 1-6 overall and 0-4 in the conference . <p> Win or lose , though , still will receive his honor , a testament to his character and dedication to his players , staff , university and community . <p> " Time has evaluated him as a person and time has evaluated this program , " Terwilliger said .

Center St. had been a nursery for children of the Moravians overseen by unmarried daughters or nurses . <p> Their Moravian parents during the era lived in a different house or picked up and moved on as missionaries . <p> Donald R. Repsher 's edited stories , " Memories of Old Nazareth , " discuss how the children were awakened by footsteps , whispered conversations and groaning in the halls . <p> The next day the people in the house learned a battle had begun the night before and a brother from Bethlehem had arrived to tell them about the destruction by Indians at the mission house in what is now Lehighton , Pa . Several members of the mission family had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe the children heard the sounds of spirits crying after they were attacked . <p> said many of the nursery 's children the majority of 70 buried at the cemetery by the Indian Tower had died while living at the house .

However , prior to the house being transformed strictly into a museum , it also had housed tenants for more than a century in apartments . <p> Tenants of the apartments have their own share of stories , with one visitor telling that whenever his grandmother would wash dishes , the sponge would slip from her hands and sink to the bottom of the water . <p> herself , who served from 1989 to 2008 as executive director of the Moravian Historical Society , said on one occasion she was sure a car had struck the side of the building after hearing a loud bang .

She had a feeling somebody was there , " said . <p> said she had researched the name Henry but came up empty , noting it was a common name of the period . <p> A visitor who was photographed playing an organ after dark at the Whitefield House later told an orb was found in the photo that he believed was a ghost .

One of the constants in the courtroom has been Inspector Matthew Gerould , who called it the biggest case of his career . <p> " It 's been a long endeavor by a lot of different police officers , " Gerould said , citing immediate help from three different New Jersey police departments the day the murders occurred . <p> First Deputy District Attorney Terence Houck said for him it was the most involved , most complicated case that has ever ended so justly . <p> " It ended the way we hoped it would end , " Houck said . <p> Defense attorney Matthew Potts , who represents Edwards , said he would have to discuss a possible appeal with his client . Defense attorney Charles Banta , who represents Hollist , is planning to appeal to the Superior Court . <p> " The evidence was such we thought we could raise reasonable doubt with the judge . Obviously we did not , " Banta said . " We felt we had a more believable story than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in prison without parole , but Potts asked that the sentences be run together , instead of back-to-back . <p> Potts said it could make a difference in the appeals process , but Baratta made the sentences consecutive . <p> In his closing argument to the judge , Houck said Hollist and Edwards were " assassins from Newark . " <p> Referring to the co-defendants by their gang names , Houck said , " They came out of Newark to our town , to this community and they took the lives of three innocent people . " <p> Banta and Potts both claimed inconsistent testimony from eye witnesses could not confirm each of their clients was at the North 13th Street apartment the night of the murders . <p> " Are these witnesses I can trust ? Are these witnesses I can believe ? Are these witnesses I can put my faith in ? " asked Potts . " I suggest you ca n't .

Gray claimed Ali " Lee Hood " Davis handed Hollist the .38-caliber handgun . <p> Davis was previously convicted of the murders , and Gray pleaded guilty to the crime . <p> But as the men left they stopped at the second-floor bathroom . Spring previously testified that Davis kicked open the bathroom door and pointed a .38-caliber handgun at him while Gray pointed a shotgun . <p> " Does it make sense they were passing around the gun back and forth , " Banta asked . <p> Potts focused on Josh Oliver , a key prosecution witness who said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Houck asked why Oliver would n't just claim he saw Hollist . <p> Gray had minute details about the crime that were n't included in police reports , details that were n't important , Houck said . Things such as Gray dropping his shotgun and getting a nasty glare from Edwards , victim Rene holding DVDs in his hand when he was shot and a woman screaming when the shooting begins , Houck said . <p> That last fact is confirmed by two other witnesses , Houck said . <p> " Crimes conceived in hell , your honor , do not have angels as witnesses , " Houck said . " These witnesses were friends of theirs . That does n't mean they should n't be believed .

" <p> The pair opted for a nonjury trial in exchange for prosecutors withdrawing the possibility of the death penalty from the case . <p> Prosecutors claimed the West Ward killings were in retaliation for other gang-related slayings that happened days earlier in New Jersey . <p> took the witness stand in his own defense , reiterating his claim he remained in the car after he and three others drove from Newark to Easton . said the three other men went inside the North 13th Street apartment for what Hollist thought would be a drug deal . <p> But Houck said 's testimony was just one lie after another . <p> said he was in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houck said . Hollist also initially claimed Edwards was n't in the car that night , then said he was n't sure , Houck said . <p> Finally , Hollist denied knowing other people involved in the crime , including Josh Oliver .

 side of sexual expression , BDSM <p> As part of Lehigh 's power and privilege series the Office of Multicultural Affairs hosted a workshop on Tuesday Nov. 8 exploring the seemingly taboo sexual expression of BDSM , an acronym that refers to Bondage , Discipline , Dominance , Submission , Sadomasochism and Masochism . <p> BDSM involves the consensual exchange of power in erotic or sexual situations . Although BDSM has been largely viewed with disapproval in mainstream society , it has become more recognized and popularized by recent media attention , including Rihanna 's hit , " S&amp;M . " <p> The concrete associations with BDSM commonly include whips , chains and handcuffs during erotic situations in order to feel pleasure out of pain . <p> " I did n't know that BDSM was a real thing , or a big deal , or even considered a form of abuse , " said Roshni Desai , ' 15 . <p> BDSM is a unique way of sexual expression , that to some , might seem like sexual abuse . However , focus of the workshop was to put BDSM in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It analyzed how the tenants of BDSM go far past the chains and whips into the concepts of power , privilege , and gender equality . <p> One of the main topics of the workshop was exploring the guiding principles of BDSM . The main principles are safety , to hurt but not harm , to be self-affirming but not self-destructive , to be fully consensual and never under the influence of any form of substance . Along with these principles , BDSM is always negotiated and agreed upon ahead of time , and it can be stopped in any instant for any reason , giving both parties equal control . <p> These principles alone refute any association between BDSM and sexual abuse . Because of these principles , BDSM provides a mental escape to a place where there is equal power and privilege between both partners , regardless of their gender . So , when looking beyond the whips and chains , to the principles and morals of BDSM , it proves to be a healthy form of sexual expression that is merely just misunderstood by society . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshop understanding BDSM as a normal and healthy form of sexual expression , that they will be able to differentiate between BDSM behaviors and sexual abuse and that they will begin to explore some of the power and privilege around gender and sexuality , " said Brooke DeSipio , assistant director of the Women 's Center and host of the event . <h> Nvidia says PC

 Day in Harrisburg the day each year that legislators , judges and the governor and his cabinet receive cost-of-living bumps in their paychecks . Automatic , pay raises . This year the boost is 3 percent . <p> COLA Day is followed by a ritual in which many lawmakers write out checks to charities in the amount of the annual raise . Some return it to the state treasury . Not everyone does this , of course , but it 's easy to see why this " giving " spirit is gaining steam . Elected officials do n't want constituents to think they 're pocketing an automatic cost-of-living adjustment while Social Security recipients were stiffed for two years , many private-sector workers are struggling with wage freezes , and millions ca n't find a job . <p> Before anyone considers this an acceptable tradeoff , consider the salaries .

( Where the cost of living is higher than most of Pennsylvania . ) <p> Legislators will see the increase in their paychecks whether they want it or not . Regardless of whether they donate it to charity , the new salary is used to compute their pensions . Since 1995 , legislators have received a cost-of-living boost of more than 13 percent . Legislators also qualify for dedicated pensions , get great health care coverage , and if they accept them , per diems of just for showing up for work . <p> House members had an opportunity to suspend this year 's raise when Rep.

Repealing it and forcing legislators to vote on any increase in salary and benefits in effect , to make the case to voters that they 've earned it should be a top issue in next year 's campaigns . <p> But the reality is , legislators have the ability to do this every day with the power of their votes and their consciences .

 than on a four-month-long investigation into allegations the Phillipsburg schools superintendent bullied teachers and took district-owned shrubbery for his Northampton County home . <p> Superintendent Mark B. Miller denied allegations of wrongdoing and said he has n't been privy to a final report produced by the investigation , which was conducted by the school district 's law firm , Florio Perrucci Steinhardt &amp; Fader LLC . <p> " I 'm the guy at the top of the ladder and people take shots at me every day , including from the media , " Miller said . " I can hold my head up high . " <p> The school board thus far has taken no action on the report , but a source familiar with the matter said Miller 's job will be the topic of a special closed-door school board meeting Tuesday <p> " We 're moving in a different direction , " said the source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it involves a personnel issue and the source is n't authorized to speak publicly . <p> The school district denied The Express-Times ' requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unlikely the board will move to fire Miller on Tuesday , the source said . The school board could decide to buy out his contract and set forth a plan for finding a new superintendent , according to the source . <p> New state laws would prohibit the district from buying out any more than three months of Miller 's contract , which would mean the soonest he could leave the district under a buyout is in March . The school board bought out the last six months of former Superintendent Gordon Pethick 's contract before Miller joined the district . <p> School board members and district officials involved in the internal investigation declined comment . <p> The allegations <p> At the heart of the allegations are statements from agriculture teachers Greg Babbitt , who remains with the district , and Michael Butler , who is no longer a teacher . <p> The teachers alleged Miller in summer 2009 took several trees and shrubs the district had purchased for from the Warren County Future Farmers of America Association following the conclusion of the Warren County Farmers ' Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund scholarships for students interested in pursuing agriculture-related college degrees . <p> According to Babbitt 's and Butler 's statements , Miller went to Butler 's home in Roseto before the fair 's end and asked to see the list of trees and shrubs the district planned to buy for its landscaping . Miller highlighted several of the best trees on the list and said those trees should be loaded onto a separate truck that would be picked up at the fairgrounds , Babbitt and Butler said . <p> The teachers claimed David Pede , an agriculture teacher in the Newton ( N.J. ) School District , where Miller previously worked as superintendent , showed up at the fairgrounds and informed them he would be picking up the trailer and delivering the plants to Miller 's home . <p> Babbitt said the trailer destined for Miller 's home was overloaded and Pede requested Babbitt use his vehicle to haul the trailer and trees to the superintendent 's Slate Belt home . <p> Babbitt said he agreed , but instead dropped the trailer off at Phillipsburg High School . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining that Miller and Pede went to the school and picked up the trailer with trees and shrubs . Babbitt characterized the message as condescending . <p> In a telephone interview Friday , Pede denied helping to take any trees to Miller 's home and said he was unaware of the allegations against his friend . said he remembers dropping off trailers and equipment at the fairgrounds , but only to help transport trees back to the district . <p> Though Miller denied in an interview Thursday taking any trees from the fairgrounds , Miller reportedly told investigators that he did take and reimburse the district for two 5-foot-tall maples . <p> Miller 's response to the allegations was included in an April 28 memo sent from the law firm to school board members as an update on the investigation . <p> According to the memo , which was viewed by The Express-Times , Miller told investigators he paid cash for the trees more than a year after receiving them , after consulting with Pede about their worth . <p> said he does n't recall a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he may have provided such information if asked in passing . <p> Teachers claim Miller ' bullied , intimidated ' <p> April and May legal memos provided to the school board and viewed by The Express-Times detail other alleged " incidents of abuse of position or bullying and intimidation .

Babbitt details one incident in which he said Miller insisted the agriculture department take up space in the school 's greenhouse to plant seeds for him . <p> School district employees told investigators it was n't uncommon for Miller to request district-owned equipment such as turf edgers and leaf blowers for his personal use , according to the legal memos . <p> Miller , however , told investigators he did n't take any products or services without payment or compensation , and denied taking any equipment for his own use , the memo says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was repeatedly rebuffed when he requested copies of the report and its allegations . <p> " We 've asked for specific allegations in writing and were denied it , " Wilhelm said .

" <p> Besides the teachers ' statements , the investigation included interviews with district administrators , buildings and grounds workers , and at least one other teacher , according to the legal memos . <p> Awaiting a resolution <p> Babbitt said Friday that despite numerous attempts to learn more , the district did not disclose findings with him . <p> " The thing I 'm most disappointed about was how the district handled it .

He said he decided to approach the principal with grievances after he heard Miller was allegedly telling administrators that some agricultural department staff members were replaceable . <p> " That 's when I really got aggravated and said ' enough is enough , ' " Babbitt said .

The only option for these vehicles is to turn right , but the light has a no-turn-on-red restriction from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day . <p> Drivers generally ignore this restriction because it 's an easy right-hand turn with no obstructed view of oncoming traffic . <p> So when the light does turn green on the exit ramp , the ramp 's empty . Meanwhile , everyone traveling on Eighth Avenue that 's caught the corresponding red light sits there yielding to the air . <p> The vast amounts of time spent idling have given me ample opportunity to explore theories about the origin of the light . <p> What I 've come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower . <p> There was a time when hundreds of Cadillacs rolled up that ramp everyday at 8:59 a.m. so Steel execs behind the wheels could go to work . The same cars would leave en masse at 5:01 p.m. , destined to spend the night parked at the end of long driveways on the other side of South Mountain in Saucon Valley . <p> A light at that ramp , right-hand-turn restrictions and all , made sense under that bygone scenario . Maybe it will make sense again if the folks trying to redevelop the tower ever get the job done . But there appears to be no rush . The plans just got targeted for million in state money yet developers Lewis D. Ronca and Norton Herrick apparently do n't know what they want to do with it . <p> " I have n't heard much from them nothing in terms of them moving forward , " Joe Kelly , Bethlehem 's community and economic development director , told reporter Lynn Olanoff last week . <p> I 'd rather see the tower redeveloped so the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city residents and impatient motorists alike ca n't we just cover up the damn thing ? <p> I 've got some old blankets , duct tape , a ladder and a reflective vest that says " PRESS " on the back ( The last item comes with a long story . ) .

 File Dent might be a pain in the neck sometimes , but he 's our pain in the neck . <p> Good morning . It 's Wednesday , Dec. 14 , 2011 , and the weather guy on the newsroom TV says we could have rain by Thursday . Our forecast agrees . And it 's not nearly so cold today as dawn woke up like a shot at 2:30 this morning . Second day in a row . Thank goodness for Hulu and Netflix . Passed the time this morning with a romantic comedy about , of course , the news business . I like romantic comedies , most likely because after some sort of difficulty , they usually have happy endings . I spent parts of Tuesday helping scrape together details of a fire in White Township . Not happy ending there . A died .

If the D 's were in charge , it would be just as scrambled , just in a way to better serve Democratic interests rather than the GOP , which the current gerrymandering idea assists . <p> My concern is if the current plan passes and since it was built in secret and suddenly released just ahead of votes in the Pennsylvania House and Senate , it probably will the interests of the Lehigh Valley wo n't be served . <p> The person who would represent Easton lives in Schuylkill County . I 'm not really sure where Schuylkill County begins and ends , but I know it 's nowhere around here . And Charlie Dent 's allegedly safer district stretches from Williams Township to near Harrisburg , while jumping over the rest of the Easton area . <p> The Lehigh Valley is the third largest metropolitian area in Pennsylvania . It is defined basically as Northampton and Lehigh counties . It has the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for regionalization has been a tough slog , we do have Lehigh Valley International Airport and the Lehigh Valley IronPigs . We are soon to have the Lehigh Valley Phantoms playing hockey in the Queen City . <p> When I was a kid , I knew where my congressman lived , because the evil SOB Francis Walter owned a home across the street from my family on Easton 's College Hill . Fred Rooney was a Bethlehem guy , Don Ritter put his head down at night near Coopersburg and Paul McHale hung out in West Bethlehem . Pat Toomey 's roots were in Allentown and its western suburbs and Dent is from out there somewhere as well . <p> You might not have agreed with them all the time , but they were one of us . They were from the Valley . <p> But , now , if you live in Easton , someone named Timothy Holden would be your congressman . But if you lived up Morgan Hill Road in Williams Township , Dent would still be your guy . <p> Holden 's a Democrat who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's 60-some miles away .

While my grandparents were from Philly and our flagship paper is in Newark , neither place feels like home . Because I 'm from here . And Tim Holden is n't . <p> Now , I probably have more politically in common with Holden than Dent then again , maybe not ; he voted against health care reform but when it comes to the people of the Lehigh Valley , Charlie is one of us . If something were really important to Easton , it likely would become important to Charlie . For Holden , the first question is has he ever been to Easton . <p> We went through this several years ago with the famously mutated starfish state Senate district which gave Easton representation out of the Philadelphia suburbs . Recent changes gave us back to Lisa Boscola , who , for all her bumps in the road , knows us for who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect incumbents , especially those in the party in power , this most-recent radical redrawing never had anything to do with adequate representation . <p> GOP pols , including Dent , were conveniently unavailable for comment on Tuesday . Charlie 's never had a terribly strong spine when it comes to doing the right thing for anyone but a business interest or rich pal , but it would be good for him to stand up and say representing the Lehigh Valley is more important than making the 15th District safer for the GOP . <p> Charlie , you can e-mail me at **25;38;TOOLONG . I 'm sitting at Ext. 3573 this morning . Drop me a note or give me a call and tell me why the Lehigh Valley should n't be kept intact in Congress . Or , better yet , tell me why it should be .

 856th holiday gift guide includes stocking full of knives and a toad purse <p> View full sizePhoto Courtesy of Gregor Lawson/ thin , Spandex morphsuit will make you ( almost ) invisible to the naked eye . It is included as part of the Dave Barry 2011 gift guide . <p> By Dave Barry <p> McClatchy Newspapers <p> The holiday season is a time of traditions . Here in America , the most popular holiday tradition , observed by millions , is to celebrate the birth of Jesus by going to a Wal-Mart at 4 a.m. on the day after Thanksgiving and getting into fistfights over steeply discounted TV sets . <p> But many other nations around the world have equally colorful holiday traditions of their own . For example : <p> In Spain , on Christmas Eve , children traditionally fill their parents ' best shoes with yogurt , then hide in the woods for two to three weeks . <p> In Austria , instead of Santa Claus they have " Father " a man dressed in a duck costume who rides a unicycle around tossing earthworms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you catch one , you will soon wash your hands . <p> During the holiday season in Finland , people get naked and sit around sweating in hot little rooms . They do this the rest of the year also , so it might have nothing to do with the holidays . It could just be that they get hammered a lot in Finland . <p> But the point is , there are many fun holiday-season traditions . And one of the most traditional of all is our annual Holiday Gift Guide , now in its 856th year . The Holiday Gift Guide is a collection of truly unique gifts that we have acquired via a painstaking process of personally visiting a wide range of prestigious locations on the Internet . Every one of these gift items is an actual product that is for sale . We know this because we actually purchased them , although not with our own money because we are not complete idiots . We have , however , picked up each of these items and held it in our own personal hands , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately put it back down . <p> That is why we are able to offer you our Holiday Gift Guide Pledge of Guaranteed Quality Assurance Warranty , as follows : If you purchase one of these items , and you are not completely satisfied with it , simply give it to somebody else , and maybe that person will be completely satisfied with it . Although , quite frankly , we would be surprised . <p> But enough with the legal disclaimers . Let 's get to the items that " made the cut " for this year 's Gift Guide . <p> Ask any dentist after he has had a couple of shots of tequila , and he will tell you that one of the most vital elements of oral hygiene is scraping your tongue . And yet the tragic fact is that only 9.4 percent of Americans even own a tongue scraper , according to a statistic appearing earlier in this sentence . Why is this ? Probably because tongue-scraping is not considered " cool . " <p> But that is about to change , thanks to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of that harnesses the glamour and " star power " of Kim Jong-Il , the supreme ruler of North Korea , often called " Dear Leader " by North Koreans in recognition of the fact that any time he wants , he can have them executed . <p> The Dear Leader Tongue Scraper comes packaged on a cardboard display card featuring an image of a sprightly and smiling Kim Jong-Il running on a beach , holding a tongue scraper in his hand and being pursued by three young women in bathing suits , their arms open wide and their faces expressing the message : " We want you carnally , Dear Leader , because your tongue is devoid of crud ! " <p> For the true wine connoisseur , there is nothing more enjoyable than sucking body-temperature wine from a tube connected to a polyurethane bladder concealed in a woman 's undergarment . <p> That , in a nutshell , is the appeal of the Wine Rack , a sports brassiere equipped with a bladder that holds 25 ounces of wine or other beverages . According to the manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concerts , ball games - anywhere you can imagine " and drink through " a drinking tube long enough to route as you wish . " And here 's a bonus : As your wine rack empties , your bosoms appear to shrink dramatically . <p> You will definitely want to give this product to all the classy women on your holiday list , as well as any men who for whatever reason and far be it from the Gift Guide to judge wear sports brassieres . Remember : This is the only device personally endorsed by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II , who never goes anywhere without it . <p> <p> View full sizePhoto Courtesy of , Best Rest let 's you sleep , just about anywhere . It combines a pillow , blindfold and earmuffs . <p> plus shipping and handling from <p> Suggested by Patrick Cahill of Rockhampton , Queensland , Australia <p> Has this ever happened to you ? Your eyes are closed , and you 're trying to sleep . Just when you start to drift off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You open your eyes and say , " Can you people PLEASE KEEP IT DOWN ? ? " Then you get in trouble because you forgot you were in a staff meeting at work . <p> If that sounds familiar , you need the . This revolutionary product combines , for the first time ever that we know of , a pillow , a blindfold AND earmuffs . You simply wrap it around your head , and suddenly you ca n't see or hear . And the best part is , your boss and co-workers will never even know that you 're wearing the ! We 're assuming here that they are blind . <p> But the is n't just for office workers . It can be used to grab a quick " 40 winks " in many environments museums , funerals , State of the Union Addresses , the cockpits of commercial airliners any place where oblivion is welcome . It is our understanding that the New York Metropolitan Opera sells these babies by the crate . <p> Suggested by Larry Martell of Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif . <p> It 's a known historical fact that the sandwich was invented in 1792 by the Earl of Sandwich , and the can was invented in 1802 by Sir Harvey Can . So both of these inventions have been around for more than two centuries , yet for some reason nobody ever thought to combine them until now . Now we have the Candwich , which combines the convenience and durability of a can with the tasty wholesome goodness of sandwich ingredients that have been stored for some time in a can . <p> The we purchased was a peanut-butter-and-jelly model . When we opened the can , we found a small foil packet of peanut butter , a packet of jelly , a plastic knife for spreading , and a wrapper containing a bun that , according to the Candwich manufacturer , is " made from a special military developed formulation . " Yum ! We 're sure it tastes every bit as good as it sounds . Unfortunately we did not get around to personally assembling and eating the Candwich , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great if you could be invisible ? That 's the idea behind the Morphsuit , which is a one-piece suit made of thin , stretchy Spandex fabric that covers your entire body and head , thus rendering you completely invisible ! <p> We do n't mean " invisible " in the sense of " not visible to others . " We mean it in the sense of , " causing people to avert their eyes in hopes you will go away , because you are wearing a creepy full-body stocking that does a poor job of concealing your various bulges . " <p> According to the manufacturer , you can see through Morphsuits " and drink through them . " However , the manufacturer warns that " they do impair the vision of the wearer , " and " should not be used as protective clothing , near naked flames or whilst driving . " <p> But other than that , the Morphsuit is a superb way to draw attention to yourself . You can wear it to work , school , parties , weddings , sporting events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the risk of getting beat up or arrested . Or you can just wear it around the house , as is the practice of leading fashion sophisticates such as Ralph Lauren . <p> Here is the ultimate gift for the " sports fanatic " on your list who wants to support his team in a way that makes the unmistakable statement : " I 'm a dork ! " <p> The Game On Glove is a piece of soft plastic about the size of a head of lettuce , shaped sort of like a hockey glove and painted in the colors of a sports team . There 's a hole where you stick your hand in , and another hole where you put your beverage , so you can use your Game On Glove to ... hold your beverage ! Of course you could also just hold your beverage in your hand , but that would n't look nearly as dorky . <p> But holding your beverage is only one of the things you can do with your Game On Glove . You can also ... OK , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website . ... <p> OK , it turns out that holding your beverage is pretty much what you do with the Game On Glove . So if you know anybody who would be excited by the prospect of receiving something like this , then this is definitely what you should give that person . <p> Sound too good to be true ? Well it could be a reality for some lucky lady on your holiday gift list , if you give her this toad purse . That 's right : This is a real , functioning purse , made from a real , formerly functioning toad . It has a cord so you can carry it on your shoulder , and there 's a working zipper in the toad 's butt , so you can open it up and put small items inside the toad . Smelling salts , for example . <p> We 're sure this item will make a huge impression on whomever you give it to , based on the reaction of the Holiday Gift Guide staff , Judi Smith , who refused to touch the toad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking directly at it . <p> And finally , that challenge has been met , thanks to the " " brand wrist phone cubby . This is a brightly colored stretchy fabric sleeve with a pocket in it . You wear the sleeve on your wrist and slide the phone into the pocket , and there you have it : a phone attached to your wrist ! It 's incredibly practical and convenient , assuming you do n't mind having a phone attached to your wrist all the time . <p> We 're not going to beat around the bush here : This is one of the most exciting items we at the Holiday Gift Guide have ever encountered . It comes from the folks at Smoky Mountain Knife Works . Apparently they were sitting around one day , wondering , " What can we here at the Smoky Mountain Knife Works do to help people get into the true spirit of the holidays ? " And then somebody let 's call him Bob said , " How about we sell a Christmas stocking filled with knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took away Bob 's crack pipe . <p> No , seriously : They actually did it . We know because we bought this item . What you get is a cheap mesh Christmas stocking with a cardboard picture of a happy ho-ho-ho Santa on it , and this stocking is COMPLETELY FULL OF KNIVES . And these knives are not small , either . A couple of them are the size of Justin Bieber . Talk about the holiday spirit ! <p> If you 're holding one of these babies , and you tell somebody to bring you a figgy pudding , trust us , that person WILL bring you a figgy pudding . <p> Nothing says " Welcome to my home ! " like snakes . And when it comes to choosing an animated snake wreath whether as a gift , or for your own personal use what you 're looking for , above all else , is quality . That 's why we here at the Holiday Gift Guide strongly recommend that you ignore all the cheap " knockoff " animated snake wreaths on the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a beautifully crafted wreath festooned with realistic rubber snakes , which are connected to a battery-powered motor and some kind of electronic thing , so that when visitors approach your door , your snakes vibrate in a menacing rubber manner . Your guests are bound to be delighted , assuming they do not go into cardiac arrest . <p> This is the only animated snake wreath endorsed by both Metallica and the National Council of Churches . <p> The holiday season , above all , is about bringing joy to children . And nothing makes children happier than receiving a truly special and unique gift a gift that none of the " other kids " have . <p> We can guarantee you that this is exactly the kind of gift you will be giving if you give these cow and horse piles . These are tiny but realistic replicas of cow and horse excrement that model railroading enthusiasts place amongst their model cows and horses to add realism to their model railroads . Really , they do this . <p> But children do n't need an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some imagination . And you can join in the fun ! Simply place the piles around the floor and tell your children , " Come on Bobby or Suzy or whatever your name is ! Let 's pretend these are piles of real poop that were excreted by real cows and horses , and there 's a train going around them ! " Then just sit back and watch their little faces light up with excitement , or something very much like it . <p> GIRLFRIEND PILLOW <p> plus shipping and handling from amazon.com <p> Suggested by Rebecca Dill of Scottsdale , Ariz . <p> This is the perfect gift for that " special guy " on your holiday list . ( We are using the term " special guy " in the sense of " loser .

For one thing , the Girlfriend Pillow will never buy shoes , or demand that you share your innermost feelings when you have no innermost feelings more complex than , " I want another beer . " Speaking of which : If you spill your beer , you can use the Girlfriend Pillow to mop it up .

 bring Waldorf education to Parkland School District <p> View full sizeExpress-Times Photo PRECIOUS than 60 people Tuesday attended a Parkland School Board hearing for a proposed charter school . <p> Nicole Antunes said she chose to buy a Lehigh County home seven years ago , knowing her future children would receive a top-notch public education in the Parkland School District . <p> Now the mother of a 3-year-old , said her opinion of Parkland schools has n't changed . But instead of sending her daughter to one of the district 's traditional public schools , she wants the little girl to attend the proposed Circle of Seasons Charter School . <p> " I am so excited to have a school that is able to pick out her strengths and also work with her weaknesses , " said Tuesday night during a public hearing for the charter school . <p> is one of several people who spoke in support of Circle of Seasons before Parkland 's school board . More than 60 people attended the hearing . <p> Founder Phil Arnold said the Waldorf-methods school would ideally renovate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse farm at 2160 N. Cedar Crest Blvd. in South Whitehall Township . <p> He said architectural and engineering firms are lined up to draft an appropriate plan once the charter school 's application is approved . Arnold said the school is looking to open in September , and added that the timing of a board approval could affect where Circle of Seasons makes its debut . <p> Pennsylvania law requires the board to make a decision in 45 to 75 days after the public hearing . <p> The school also is eyeing a Penn State-owned building in the Fogelsville section of Upper Macungie Township , Arnold said , and has reached out to university officials about leasing the property . The Fogelsville location is move-in-ready and could serve as Circle of Seasons ' initial home , he said during testimony before the board . <p> Arnold said a Waldorf education is tailored to each student 's developmental progress and the focus , particularly during a child 's elementary school years , is on creating a classroom community , teaching children to appreciate their natural environment and encouraging artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He said last week , " A Waldorf education is very much built around teaching children with an understanding of where they are developmentally and cognitively , but also socially , emotionally , physically and psychologically . " <p> Eugene Schwartz , a consultant for Circle of Seasons , said Waldorf students sometimes trail their traditionally- educated peers in the early years of elementary school , but catch up and frequently pass them later . <p> " We work slowly , at first , and we gradually accelerate , " he explained . " The methods may be different , but I think we get there among the winners in the race just as well given the right amount of time , which we say is six to eight years . " <p> Arnold said Circle of Seasons would be the East Coast 's first Waldorf charter school . There are roughly 1,000 Waldorf schools worldwide , said Arnold , an Allentown resident who helped establish Seven Generations Charter School in the East Penn School District . Nearly 200 of them are private schools in North America and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> In response to questioning from district Solicitor C. Steven Miller , Arnold said the school ultimately would serve kindergarten through 12th-grade students . Assuming it opens in September , Circle of Seasons would have 110 students 44 kindergartners , 44 first-graders and 22 second-graders , he said last week . <p> The number of students and grades would expand each year , Arnold has said . <p> District Business Director John Vignone asked about the charter school 's proposed budget , adding that an annual 3 percent increase is not in line with recent trends . Thomas Taylor , of Philadelphia-based accounting firm &amp; Taylor , said the budget proposal was built using a template and would be revisited . Proposed administrator and teacher salaries , for example , could be reduced to rein in costs , he said . <p> Northwestern Lehigh School District resident Martha Andrews said she wants her granddaughter to attend Circle of Seasons and wishes it had been around when her daughters where young . Andrews said both of her daughters were ostracized in school one because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disability . <p> " I think that every parent in this area should have a choice of what kind of school to send their children to and this would give them that choice , " she said . <p> Parkland resident Keith Williams questioned the charter school 's mission , explaining that he is troubled by the Waldorf-method emphasis on cooperation rather than competition . Students must learn how to compete if they are to succeed , he said , urging board members to scrutinize Circle of Seasons ' curriculum . <p> North Whitehall Township resident Chris Hertzog , a 1988 Parkland High School graduate who supports Circle of Seasons , urged school board members to maintain the district 's status as a leader in education , and give parents a progressive choice for their children . <p> Eunice Matos said she moved from Allentown to the Cetronia section of South Whitehall Township in order to send her children to Parkland schools . Matos said she is still a believer in the quality of instruction at district schools , but thinks some students would be better served with a Waldorf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an East Penn School District resident and the founder of an Ecuadorian arts education program , asked board members if they 'd taken time to visit Waldorf schools within driving distance of the region . <p> Miller explained that even if a school director had made such a visit , he or she could n't call on that experience in weighing the charter school 's application . That decision must be based solely on the application and testimony supplied at Tuesday 's hearing , he said . <p> Board President Jayne R. Bartlett later responded to Brown , assuring her that Parkland 's school directors have done their due diligence in evaluating the application . <h> A National Education 
 operating , profiting from fake check scheme <p> A dozen people printed and cashed more than 80 fake checks over a six-month stretch in 2010 and into the early part of this year , Bethlehem police said , defrauding stores and agencies of tens of thousands of dollars . <p> One victim was the non-profit Community Action Committee of the Lehigh Valley . <p> The scheme allegedly centered around Patricia Coleman , 49 , of the 300 block of Hanover Avenue in Allentown ; her son , Hason " " Lewis , of the 800 block of Main Street in Bethlehem , and Ernestine Tina Ford , of Allentown . <p> According to police , Ford began printing checks with Coleman in August 2010 and handing the fake checks to Lewis , who employed a friend , John " Jigga " Singletary , of the 500 block of North Fifth Street in Allentown , to have them cashed .

Ford used her home computer , a printer , specialized software and blank checks purchased from office supply stores . <p> Perfecting the checks took several weeks , but by the end of August 2010 , Ford and Coleman had 15 checks ready for Lewis . Ford said she started the scheme with Coleman to help the family the two are related during hard times . <p> Lewis and Singletary allegedly recruited Timothy Carnes , of the first block of West North Street in Bethlehem ; Timothy Carnes Sr. , of Allentown ; Danielle " Baby D " Casteele , of the 300 block of North Ninth Street in Easton ; Julie " Bubbles " Santos , of Allentown ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 block of Vista Drive in Bethlehem ; Amy Kocher , of the 1500 block of Greenview Drive in Bethlehem , and Vargas , of Allentown . <p> Police did not provide a total for the fake checks , but according to court documents , between 81 and 83 checks were produced and most checks were valued between and .

 needs to take over and support big brother when he falters a bit . <p> After the Lehigh Valley Conference went 0-for-6 in championship matches in Thursday night 's final round of the Bethlehem Holiday Wrestling Classic , the Colonial League stepped in and showed how it 's done by batting a perfect 1.000 in its three finals . <p> And not only did Pen Argyl 's Mike Racciato ( 145 pounds ) join senior teammate Dylan Evans ( 182 ) and Saucon Valley junior Ray O'Donnell ( 195 ) atop the podium , the Green Knights junior walked off with the top prize of the night when he won the Frank Gutierrez Award as the tournament 's outstanding wrestler . <p> Racciato , a PIAA Class AA state champ last season , edged Camden Catholic 's 2011 New Jersey champion T.J. Miller 5-4 in the marquee matchup of the tournament in front of a two-thirds full Memorial Gym at Liberty High School . <p> " I 'd never won this tournament and I 'd come so close , third as freshman and second as a sophomore , " said Racciato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Camden Catholic junior just his fifth loss in 92 career bouts . " It feels great . He was very strong and got in deep on shots but I was able to scramble out of them . That 's just how I wrestle . The one time ( in the first period ) I was able to get out of bounds . I could n't really break him down . " <p> Miller rued his missed chances . <p> " I was in on a few deep shots but I could n't finish , " Miller said . " He is very , very good at scrambling and he hit me with a few new moves . " <p> Racciato scored two second-period takedowns one off a scramble to counter Miller , one on a duck-under after a scoreless first period to lead 4-3 after two . Racciato escaped to start the third period and spent most of that period fending off Miller . <p> Racciato was hit with his second stalling call late in the match for a point but held on . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mountain ( where he lost to Juniata 's Jake Beitz , only his eighth loss in 112 scholastic bouts ) , " said Racciato , who smiled and said " kind of " when asked if he was tired and hanging on at the end against Miller . " I 'm getting close to the shape I was in before and it should n't be a problem now . " <p> Being in shape is never a problem for the powerful O'Donnell , who flattened Council Rock South junior P.J. Steinmetz in 3:32 in the final with an arm bar cranked to maximum power . O'Donnell ( 12-0 ) posted three pins and a technical fall en route to his gold and never saw a third period . <p> " The first period was a little frustrating ; I could n't get a takedown and he was slowing down the match , " said O'Donnell , the Panthers ' first champion at this tournament since Joey Killar in 1995 . " I kept pushing the action but I knew I had to be patient and look for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , which I liked , because I do pretty well on top . The arm bar came open , and I slowly cranked him for the fall , which I was very happy with . Winning this tournament was one of my three top goals this season ( along with the Escape the Rock Tournament and a state title ) . " <p> Evans ' win was the closest of the three he defeated Wyoming Seminary senior Conor Wasson 5-1 in sudden victory and remarkably for such a skilled wrestler with 92 career victories , marked his first scholastic tournament title . <p> " I 've been runner-up at districts and regionals , never first , " Evans said . " To win this tournament means a lot to me . Winning against some of the big teams here is good confidence-booster for me . It will help me get ready for districts and regionals . " <p> Actually , what his final match looked like it would prepare Evans for was a Greco-Roman tournament as he and Wasson bear hugged and all over the mat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know if he liked to wrestle upper body but I felt very comfortable in that position , " Evans said .

 are harbingers of spring Nature Watch <p> As the second week of March begins the weather is getting nice , but it still felt like winter just a few days ago . <p> When I put out the suet early Thursday morning the pond was once again frozen , but when the sun hit the yellow winter aconite blossoms along the edge of the yard , it was clear that things were beginning to change . <p> When I went outside , a flock of honking Canada geese was flying north overhead and when I went back toward the house a flock of louder snow geese took the same path . The annual movement of geese to northern breeding areas peaks in mid-March , so it 's not unusual to hear them in the sky right now , even at night . <p> Swans and other kinds of waterfowl are also now moving north . A visit to open bodies of water at this time of the year usually produces varieties of ducks only seen around here when they 're moving through . <p> Unless you know a lot about different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them apart especially the females . However , the adult male long-tailed duck is unmistakable . It is small and colored black and white at various places , and its long tail ca n't be missed . <p> This duck used to be called " oldsquaw , " but some years back its name was changed . Nothing about its behavior has changed , however . It breeds way up north on the tundra , it can dive as deep as 200 feet for food , and it has an elaborate courtship ritual . <p> When the geese are moving north and the snowdrops are blooming in the front yard , it 's always time for me to start some seeds . And when my 25 packets of seeds from the Hardy Plant Society arrived last week , I knew it meant I had a lot of work ahead of me . But I belong to that organization because many of its members are professional or highly respected gardeners , and I constantly learn about nature from them . <p> One of the packets contains seeds of Viola hirsutula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species anywhere in New England above Connecticut , but it is found in rich woods around here and down to Florida . <p> Somewhere along the way I may have seen it locally , but if I did I did n't realize it . It can be very hard differentiating among purple violets . One of its characteristics , though , is that it is acaulescent , meaning the flowers are stemless , so I hope to see that if and when some of those seeds mature . <p> The violet family has many members , including pansies and johnny-jump-ups . Violets vary in color from white to yellow to different shades of blue and purple , and in the wild they almost bloom in early spring . <p> There is one member , however , that looks a lot different .

But the district and parents had to go into emergency mode for a few days , when both sides were actually close to agreement .

 periodically along Easton-area streets with buckets in hand , claiming they need money to help homeless children . <p> But they 'll never tell you who they are or offer specifics about where their money goes . <p> Only after three of them were arrested March 2 were they forced to identify themselves . <p> Their addresses link them to a Tampa , Florida , church with a long history of exploiting the homeless , the addicted and those with nowhere else to go . <p> The three cash collectors arrested in Easton carried buckets on behalf of the New Life Church . But all three live in Tampa , Florida , properties owned by the Deeper Life Christian Church of Tampa . <p> " I have received very serious complaints about Deeper Life , " said Rick Ross , director of the Trenton-based Cult Education Institute . " The people collecting money are often mistreated , abused and exploited . " <p> The church was found guilty of fraud in 1999 when it trafficked food stamps collected from members . A 2003 report in the Tampa Tribune describes a scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them a place to live and a religious calling and sends them out across the country to raise money for the church and its founders , Melvin and Brenda Jefferson . <p> There are 70 Deeper Life churches across the United States and abroad , according to the church website . The church founder calls himself Bishop Melvin Jefferson , although he admitted in published reports he has no formal religious training . <p> " There is no meaningful accountability concerning where the money goes , other than it appears that the Jeffersons benefit greatly from the cash flow , " Ross said . <p> The church did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment . Dennis G. Brewer Sr. is listed as the church attorney in media reports , but a clerk at his former Texas-based law firm said he 's retired and she did n't know of any attorney representing the church . <p> The news accounts are all from a decade ago and Ross admits he has n't had any recent complaints about Deeper Life , possibly because they switched names from the New Life Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active in the Tampa area . She runs Tampa Crossroads , which provides housing and counseling for those in need exactly the same kind of people exploited by Deeper Life . <p> She said the Jeffersons live in a mansion in the posh suburb of Brandon and fly 10 miles via helicopter to periodically tend to the flock at the inner-city church on Nebraska Avenue . <p> County property records list dozens of shabby properties where fund collectors live before they 're sent out by the church . <p> " We refer to them as ' The Church of Deeper Pockets , ' " Romeo said . " They 're just crooks . To me , they 're enslaving people . " <p> She said she has counseled many with ties to the church during her 40-year career . One disabled man she helped six years ago was coerced into turning over his Social Security check every month to the church . He wanted to leave but was afraid . <p> " He was living in a three-bedroom home with nine men . There was no kitchen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romeo sent people from her organization with him to collect his belongings and help embolden him to leave . <p> But the man ended up moving himself back in later that day because he was afraid of what Jefferson might do to his brother , who was also in the church , she said . <p> The church strongly encourages members to marry each other . Jefferson has denied arranging marriages between church members , but arranged marriages are commonplace , according to Romeo . <p> " On the weekend , they pair people up . They find your mate for you , " she said . <p> Romeo said she knows of church members who agreed to marry each other after relatively short courtships . She said they 're usually consummated in a trailer from which church members sell ice cream . <p> " When you get married you get to spend the night in the ice cream wagon , " Romeo said . <p> Shawn Livingston is one of the three church members arrested in Easton . Pennsylvania law allows her to collect donations from motorists , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left the sidewalk and wandered into traffic to collect . <p> She said the church helps people by taking them in , but she refused to elaborate on Romeo 's accusations . <p> " Your best bet is to continue to call the church , " she said . " Those accusations are not true . " <p> Livingston and the two other church members pleaded guilty in Easton to violating the Pennsylvania vehicle code . Each paid a fine plus in court costs on March 18 . They do n't have to register anywhere to collect funds because religious organizations are exempt under Pennsylvania law . <p> Pennsylvania state Sen. Lisa Boscola said she 's reluctant to impose more regulations on donations collections because the law might hamper legitimate religious organizations and nonprofit groups . <p> Secrecy is paramount in the church . Romeo canvasses the Tampa area each January for a point-in-time homeless count . The more homeless people she counts , the more federal aid the area is in line to receive . <p> All agencies in the area cooperate with her except Deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said her staff was threatened by church staffers when they asked questions of homeless people linked to Deeper Life . <p> " They would not allow us to talk to anyone , " she said . " They told their people to stay inside and not talk to us . " <p> Romeo said she tried to buy blighted homes from the church three years ago but the church refused to pick up the phone , let alone negotiate . Court records show at least two citations over the last six years for failing to pick up accumulated debris on church properties . <p> The church has been running for 30 years and shows no signs of slowing down . A clerk with the Tampa Police Department said there are no cases pending against the church , so the department had no comment on it . <p> The church is in the district of Tampa Councilman Mike Suarez . According to his legislative aide , " We are not familiar with the church and had not heard of it until we received this e-mail " from lehighvalleylive.com . " Wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor 's office did n't respond to a request for comment . Nor did members of Hillsborough County Council to questions about church properties in that county . <p> As operator of a nonprofit agency that relies on public aid , Romeo said she has to open her books to the public . Jefferson does n't . Romeo 's properties are inspected about five to six times a year , she said ; Jefferson 's are n't . <p> " I do n't understand , " Romeo said . " I could become a church , I guess , and then I would n't be scrutinized . " <h> F1 legends :

He was taken to the emergency room soon after , had surgery late Friday night and the club announced Saturday he was placed on the disabled list with a fractured jaw . <p> " It really ( stinks ) , " said first baseman Brock Stassi , a close friend of Alonso .

Another infielder close to him got out of the way , but Alonso could not . Coaches and trainers soon surrounded him as he walked off the field with a towel over his face . <p> " You see a lot of close calls ( in batting practice ) , but I 've never seen anybody squared up like that in the face , " Stassi said . " You have to keep your head on a swivel when you 're out there during batting practice . " <p> " He sent me a video of him at the hospital and he was smiling , " Stassi said .

" <p> Last year in Reading , Alonso 's season ended with an ACL tear on April 25 when he was taken out on a dirty slide into second base . <p> After working his way through the rehab process , the University of Delaware product came back and made the Triple-A club , only to hit the DL again . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 bowlers merit spots in hall of fame <p> It 's hard to believe that Donna Kemmerer and Mike Derwinski have never crossed paths during their bowling careers . But both came together to receive Bethlehem 's highest honor as the pair were inducted into the Hall of Fame last Saturday night at The Meadows in Hellertown . <p> Their stories are as different as they are similar . <p> Both grew up in Bethlehem and honed their skills in order to bowl with and against better competitors . Kemmerer branched out and made a name for herself throughout the state while Derwinski stayed around town , crafting a fine career in the area 's many clubs . <p> ' ' I love coaching and giving back to the sport , ' ' said the 68-year-old Kemmerer , who teaches at Jordan Lanes in Allentown .

Kemmerer turned that 150 into a career-best 215 along with a 297 single and 753 set . She 's earned seven Bethlehem titles along with a state team win . <p> At times the game has been therapeutic as Kemmerer lost a son , Michael , in an automobile accident in 1987 . She said she had lost interest in the game but found comfort in coaching and a chance opportunity to meet a coaching legend . <p> ' ' I met Fred Borden and worked with him for three days and received my USA Bronze Coaching Certificate . I went back in 1988 and got my Silver Certification .

 president of the Easton Area School District PTA council , Alexander has provided the district with a fresh look at the meaning of diversity through her own experiences in her neighborhood . <p> Due in part to Alexander 's efforts , the EASD was awarded the National PTA Jan Harp Domene Award , which recognizes PTAs across the country that best demonstrate exceptional work in the area of diversity and inclusion through " committing themselves to outreach to all families within their district . " <p> " Lynn really was the chef in the kitchen who orchestrated everything for this award , " Michelle Robertson , president of EASD PTA council said . <p> The EASD PTA Diversity committee members wanted to deal with diversity broadly . Alexander explained diversity means understanding and including non-traditional and geographically different families in the district 's PTA decisions . This does not mean just addressing typical diversity issues such as racial and economic differences , Alexander said . <p> " EASD is unique in that we 've got a whole lot of everything . We have city schools and people within the suburban community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council , " Alexander said . <p> The diversity committee took a look at representation within the council . In an attempt to address the diversity issues , the committee members set goals to reach out to communities in the district that did not have a large presence . These goals were submitted by Alexander to the National PTA committee . <p> Examples of goals the EASD PTA made include focusing on inclusion advocacy for children with disabilities as well as changing how confidentiality is handled throughout the district , which could vary greatly from family to family . <p> Alexander realized diversity was a huge issue when she moved to the EASD in 2013 . She quickly became involved with the PTA at Paxinosa Elementary School , where her children attended . When she went to the district wide council meetings , there was no representation from Paxinosa . <p> " A lot of people at the area council did n't know much about Paxinosa , " Alexander said . " I was upset because I wanted to know how we could bring our concerns to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence within the area council ? ' " <p> Ideally , the area PTA council should include representatives from each of the 11 schools within the district , she said . Alexander 's questions moved momentum forward in the district to understand how to increase the amount of diversity and inclusion within the district . <p> After noticing African-American boys performed lower on their test scores , the school began to focus on empowering the young men , Hightower said . <p> " In March , the boys attended a school board meeting and got to meet some of the school board members , " Hightower said . " It was a powerful , empowering moment for them , which helped increase the self-worth of students . " <p> EASD Superintendent John Reinhart said the district is currently working on putting the finishing touches on a district-wide equity plan , which also contributes to diversity goals . <p> " I 'm thrilled to see individuals from EASD PTA being honored in a such way , " Reinhart said . " They are a quality group of volunteers and they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Easton . This is really happy moment for all of us .

 and of relief flowed Thursday in the Northampton County Courthouse after a jury convicted a West Easton man of abusing his girlfriend 's corpse . <p> Franklyn P. Hutchison IV knew about the death of 20-year-old Brianne Miles on July 8 but failed to report it to police until July 10 . By then her body had decomposed to the point where an open casket burial was out of the question . <p> It took jurors about two hours to convict him of abuse of corpse , making a false report to police and of possession of drug paraphernalia . <p> Friends and family members of Miles held hands and wept when the verdict came in . <p> Her grandmother was so overcome she had to quickly leave the courtroom . She sat on a stone bench outside the courthouse where she was comforted by Northampton County Assistant District Attorney Patricia Fuentes Mulqueen , who herself started crying . <p> " Obviously I 'm grateful to the jury that they came back with a guilty verdict but I wish more could be done for this family , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hutchison had no reaction to the verdict . His attorney , defense attorney Christopher Shipman , said the did n't abuse the corpse .

" I do n't necessarily agree with it . I do n't think that a single act of omission constitutes abuse of a corpse . " <p> faces a maximum of two to four years in prison when he 's sentenced on the three misdemeanor charges on July 27 . <p> The jury determined Hutchison handled the corpse in a way to " outrage ordinary family sensibilities . " <p> Mulqueen said by the time authorities found Miles ' body , the decomposition process was well underway . <p> " No grandparent should have to endure the knowledge and the horror that their granddaughter was left to decompose like an animal on the side of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her closing argument . " No one should have to endure that . Do n't let him get away with this . " <p> Shipman conceded that Hutchison was guilty of making a false report to police and to possession of drug paraphernalia . Hutchison admitted to police he smoked K2 while he was with Miles ' body in the apartment they shared . He said he was too scared to report her death . <p> Hutchison 's landlord April Huber failed to show up to testify Wednesday but appeared on the witness stand Thursday . <p> She said she and her husband smelled an odor throughout the building they shared with Hutchison and Miles . After more than a day of smelling it , they told Hutchison to do something about it . <p> That 's when he confessed that Miles was dead . An appalled Huber went to the apartment to see for herself . <p> " It was the odor that hit me really hard , " she said . She said Miles ' body had decomposed to the point where , " I was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was black and blown out , " Huber said through tears . " Her tongue was sticking out a little bit .

 Favorite Teams <p> The city was founded by the Moravians in 1741 on 500 acres where the Creek meets the Lehigh River . The settlement thrived on land where there was easy access to water , fertile soil and lots of lumber . Twenty years in the Moravians had built 50 buildings , operated nearly 50 industries and had cleared over 2,000 acres . <p> This industrious and innovative spirit has stayed with Bethlehem over the centuries as it evolved into an industrial powerhouse and reinvented itself with heritage tourism .

Bright orange ditch lilies , which look like daylilies but really are n't , will brighten up just about any area . <p> Some places are filled with white or pink wild sweet peas , and often nearby pink , similar-looking crown vetch flowers are blooming . Our wild sweet peas originated from native wild ones in Italy , and crown vetch , a viney and very invasive legume , comes from Europe , Asia and Africa . <p> Ponds and waterways are alive with tadpoles , adult frogs and toads , and all kinds of insects .

And one morning last week I saw something I had n't seen before . <p> I had walked around the yard that early morning to see how refreshed everything looked because of the previous night 's rain . In the front yard the branches of a tree on which I hang bird feeders were higher than they had been before the rain , and overnight amaryllis flower stalks began pushing up in pots I had put aside and forgotten about . <p> All of the many old-fashioned but incredibly reliable hosta plants that I have were healthier looking , and many that were limping along now had flower spikes . One big one was suddenly covered with white flowers and its cuplike leaves were filled with water . <p> But then , as I wandered around the back yard , I saw something white that appeared to be hanging down from a walnut tree , and as I got closer I saw that it was moving . And when I got real close to it I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small black and white caterpillars . <p> Next I saw that there were several other silky strands covered with caterpillars coming down from the walnut tree branch overhead on which a mass of caterpillars was eating leaves . But whether or not some of the caterpillars were intentionally coming down the silky strands still is n't clear because just as many of them were going back up the strands , crawling over one another as they did so . Perhaps they were blown off and the strands were defensively made . <p> So once again I got out my caterpillar book and found out that they were the first instar phase of the hickory tussock moth . They had apparently just hatched from eggs that adults moths had laid in the walnut leaves and I happened upon this scene by accident . So after finding this out I went out to look at them again , but they were all gone and so were the silky strands . <p> Neighbours helped rescue

 in the way Pete Rose allegedly did with the Reds . But after his Nazareth Legion baseball team won the first game of Sunday 's doubleheader against Wanderers in the Legion best-of-three semifinals , Brown had a decision to make . <p> Cam Farmer and Cade Stoneback both needed another day 's rest before taking the mound . Nazareth was already thin on pitching . If it had lost the first game , Brown said he might have had to push it and send Farmer out there , but Kevin Wagner saved him from making that decision with a walkoff single in the eighth inning . <p> For Game Two , Brown rolled the dice and went with other pitchers , seeing if they could hold Wanderers at bay . They could n't , as Wanderers won 15-1 in five innings . <p> " It came up snake eyes on us , but hey , not every move you make always works , " Brown said .

The broadside is felt deeply by public school officials and supporters , considering Pennsylvania 's charter schools are funded by taxpayer money funneled through district budgets . Public school boards have a say in approving charters within their boundaries , but the state 's enabling law has generated a flurry of charters , which compete with public districts for students . <p> With no one stepping up , we 're left to consider the underlying details : Developer Abe Atiyeh , who has leased other buildings for charter schools in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new school in Catasauqua .

 Route 611 between Downtown Easton and the Forks Township line is n't your average state road . A good portion of it is held up by a retaining wall repaired more than 30 years ago . The curvy two-lane road takes a pummeling from two forces the cars and heavy trucks that roll over it daily , and the Delaware River , which at times of high flow tests the foundation . <p> None of this obvious to the people who use the road , but the support system is showing its age . Cracked , sinking sidewalks and broken guide rails are symptoms of more serious future problems , according to Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. , who outlined some of the city 's more pressing capital improvement needs in his 2017 budget message . <p> " The replacement value of the retaining wall holding up Route 611 could be as high as $2 million , " Panto said , adding that the city will also be making emergency repairs to retaining walls near the Third Street bridge and at Heil Park on South Side . <p> When to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share the cost is a point of contention between Panto and the state Department of Transportation . PennDOT spokesman Ron Young Jr . said this week the state is responsible for the roadway , while the sidewalks , guide rails and retaining walls are the city 's obligation . The state is keeping tabs on the situation , he added , and is n't convinced the retaining wall poses an immediate threat to the road . <p> Panto is right , though , to call out this situation before it becomes an emergency repair or worse , a washout and to make the case that PennDOT should share in some of the retaining wall repair cost . The primary role of the wall is not to provide a scenic pedestrian way , but to hold up the thousands of vehicles that use Route 611 each day . Losing access to this road would put an huge strain on other crowded corridors -- Cattell Street , Sullivan Trail , Bushkill Drive and Lafayette Street , to name a few . <p> Young said a get-together has been scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower-cost suggestions for maintaining the wall . <p> That 's fine , but if it has n't been done already , PennDOT which has the benefit of a 2012 gas-tax increase to help with construction projects should be conducting an engineering study on this stretch of Route 611 to determine its life expectancy , and see if the river wall needs a pre-emptive rebuilding .@@14770080 <h> City is seeking

Star student athletes and college professors alike are vulnerable to its allure . <p> " It really was n't seen to be a mainstream America problem in years past , " Wescoe said . " But now , in the community it is a crisis showing up everywhere . We find that a lot of people do n't know about it or are comfortable talking about . " <p> The school 's Students Against Destructive Decisions chapter along with officer Dean Wilson , who organizes the " Every 15 Minutes ' drunken driving program , are trying to put local faces to the Lehigh Valley 's heroin crisis . <p> " We do n't have a problem anymore . We have an epidemic , " Wilson said . " There are lives being lost because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdoses have become the leading cause of accidental death in the United States , Wilson said . The epidemic is fueled by easy access to heroin and prescription opioids . <p> " Heroin is addictive and so dangerous and it has become one of the worst drug epidemics to ever hit the Lehigh Valley , " said Wilson , a cop for 29 years . " It does n't care where you came from , it does n't care about the community where you live in , about the color of your skin , about how smart you or are or if you are male or female . " <p> He hopes the forum shows attendees that the speakers were living average lives before addiction crashed into their homes . They went on family vacations , attended church and had family dinners . <p> " This is a tough subject because it hits homes for a lot of people in our community , " Wescoe said . <p> The 7 p.m. event in the auditorium will feature a speech from a local parent who lost a child to drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brianna Brodt , a recovering addict who began drinking at 13 then started taking pills and , finally , heroin , will share her story . <p> Communities across the Lehigh Valley have been holding sessions warning of the risks of abusing prescription drugs and heroin , but many are sparsely attended , Wilson said . <p> Organizers hope to spark honest conversations about addiction and help lessen the stigma associated with it . Many students have confided in Wescoe about close family members struggling with drug addiction and some are in jail . <p> " It is still on the hush , hush , " Wescoe said . " A behind-closed-doors thing , because people are embarrassed and think people will judge them . " <p> Wilson noted that heroin is never the first drug someone uses .

 certainly changed from the highs in the 80s of last week to lows at freezing or below as this week moves along . <p> But Thursday morning if you 're in the northern tiers of the Lehigh Valley and northwest New Jersey , you 're likely to see a short blast of snow or sleet before it becomes all rain once the sun creeps up , experts say . <p> " It 's kind of a different weather pattern , " meteorologist Mark Miller said Monday morning from the forecasting company WeatherWorks in Hackettstown . " There 's a strong northwest flow out of Canada , which is more typical this time of year . " <p> The National Weather Service is predicting lows of 29 overnight Tuesday and 32 overnight Wednesday in Easton . So , those susceptible plants you were supposed to take in a couple of weeks ago really need your attention now . <p> But the true nastiness of Thursday 's morning rush should be limited to the Interstate 80 corridor and near where Route 33 cuts through the top of Northampton County . <p> " Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The normal high is about 60 and the low about 38 , so it will be several degrees below on both sides of the scale . <p> " A storm system is approaching on Thursday , " he said . " The higher elevations could be cold enough to get a rain , snow and sleet mix . It will be a pretty quick shot before it changes completely over to rain . " <p> The weather service forecasts for Bangor , Hardwick Township and Stroudsburg all show the possibility , but only the Poconos prediction warns of " icy spots on roads and walkways . " <p> Eastern PA Weather Authority owner Bobby Martrich said the only real chance of accumulation up to an inch will be along the New York-Pennsylvania border , with areas of the Poconos above 1,500 feet also at some risk . <p> " Only if it gets here early enough , " he said . Much of the Lehigh Valley will just be rain , he said . <p> The angle of the sun is still strong enough that by midmorning this danger dissipates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely if anything sticks that it sticks to grass , Miller said . <p> Such cold shots and the resulting frozen precipitation are not abnormal at higher elevations , Miller said . <p> But when you get down to Lehigh Valley International Airport in Hanover Township , Lehigh County , you 'll find the Oct. 27 record for snow is a trace in 1957 . The record low is 25 in 2006 and the lowest high is 42 in 1976 . So it should n't be a record-breaker unless the snow line moves suddenly south . <p> And it almost was nothing at all , Miller said . As of Sunday , it looked like the storm would show up Thursday afternoon , well after the sun would have ruled out any sort of snow , Miller said . <p> " It 's more about the timing , " Miller said .

 defamation verdict in favor of former Penn State assistant football coach Mike McQueary is shocking for its size and for the jury 's unambiguous finding that McQueary 's name and reputation had been maligned for playing the role of whistleblower in the Jerry Sandusky child abuse scandal . <p> McQueary 's life became hell , he testified , after Sandusky was arrested and Coach Joe Paterno was abruptly fired in 2012 . McQueary was suspended from his job . Instead of being credited for trying to alert university officials to Sandusky 's behavior , he said , he became an outcast in his hometown , vilified by Penn State fans who blamed him for Paterno 's downfall . Later , when Penn State hired a new head coach , his contract was n't renewed and he found himself unemployable . <p> The university argued that it was McQueary 's own job performance and new coach Bill O'Brien 's decision to bring on his own staff -- that led to McQueary 's joblessness , not anything Penn State officials did to him in connection with the scandal . <p> Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory is likely to extend the narrative of disagreement over his role , as well as that of Paterno and three former Penn State administrators facing criminal charges . <p> After years of public discord and payouts of more than $100 million by the university this kernel of truth remains : McQueary did the right thing in reporting Sandusky 's suspected crimes , as others turned a deaf ear or failed to act on reports of child sexual assault . <p> The jury 's verdict affirms this , and it 's certain to give McQueary a measure of relief along with a large monetary award for his grievances . <p> Specifically , the jury agreed the university defamed McQueary in 2012 when then-Penn State President Graham Spanier defended the actions of former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Vice President Gary Schultz . ( In the criminal case , charges of perjury against Curley and Schultz have been dropped ; all three still face charges of failing to report suspected child abuse and endangering the welfare of children . ) <p> Also , the jury found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McQueary , after he reported seeing Sandusky showering with a boy in a university locker room , saying they would take care of it . <p> A third issue whether the university retaliated against McQueary is still to be decided by the judge overseeing the defamation case , and could result in additional penalties . <p> Civil trials sometimes shed a light upon the limits of criminal proceedings , and that is what we 're seeing here . The benchmark of this long-playing tragedy is the conviction of Sandusky , who is serving 30 to 60 years in prison for sexually assaulting 10 boys . The pending criminal trial of the three administrators is expected to determine the responsibility for , and hopefully the extent of , an alleged coverup at Old Main . <p> The McQueary case does n't answer all the questions .

 the wide-eyed kind Nature Watch <p> One day last week as the afternoon was drawing to a close , I walked around the edge of the yard just to look around . <p> It 's been so cold that I have n't been out walking as much as I normally do and I was feeling caged-in . The sky was mostly clear but there were a few clouds and contrails turning pink from late day light reflection . <p> I was hoping to see a short-eared owl flying somewhere over the valley fields , although I really did n't expect to . The number of these owls that visit this part of the country in the winter has dropped dramatically through the years because of all the development . <p> A few winters ago when snow and ice covered the ground for a long time , I found one completely unexpectedly . I turned on the outside light by the kitchen door , pulled back the curtains there , and looked out to see a short-eared owl sitting just a few feet away on a post that we grab for balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard at that time was a shoveled border along the kitchen walkway , and apparently the birdseed I was throwing on the ground there was luring in nighttime rodents . And , ironically , earlier that season I had seen a northern saw-whet owl on that very same post . <p> Accidentally finding any kind of owl , especially in the winter , is something every birder I know hopes for . So for that reason later that night I went out onto the front porch with a flashlight to look into the front yard trees . <p> Just like on my afternoon walk , I was n't really expecting to see an owl , so I was taken aback to see a pair of eyes looking at me from a branch above some bird feeders . The eyes belonged to a gray phase screech owl , the common small one , and they got bigger as the light shone on them . But otherwise the owl did n't move , and so as not to disturb it for long , I quickly went back inside . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered where that owl was . I knew though that it was probably in its cavity somewhere in the bowels of the woods . <p> I did n't stop thinking about owls that day until I checked the pantry to see what I needed to bake some cookies . And I forgot about them when I realized I was completely out of cinnamon . <p> I had no idea where cinnamon came from until my interest in nature got me to the point where I began scouring nursery catalogs on long winter nights . They taught me that cinnamon is made from the inner bark of certain trees , and also that vanilla comes from the seed of an orchid . <p> Nursery catalogs also taught me about cashew nuts . They 're the seed that grows at the end of a soft fruit , but they ca n't be eaten until they 're roasted to get rid of a poisonous substance that irritates the skin like poison ivy . <p> Fiduciary Group LLC

 <p> For Melissa Hough , an impromptu purchase at a flea market provides insight into the experiences of a Jewish girl as the world changed around her in the 1930s . <p> Hough , president of the Slate Belt Heritage Center , said she has been translating and researching a handwritten notation book that appears to have belonged to girl who lived in Vienna before and after Germany annexed Austria in the lead-up to World War II . <p> Hough said she saw the book five years ago at a Philadelphia flea market . It was nestled among various other knick-knacks and the man selling it said it was a diary written in German . <p> When Hough examined the book , she said she realized it was actually a friendship book or what is also known as an autograph book . The book had drawings , poems and well-wishes from friends mostly directed at someone named Nitti . <p> Hough , who briefly lived in Vienna while in college and speaks some German , began to translate the words written by Nitti and her friends . <p> Hough estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1934 . The inscriptions are initially happy and upbeat , such as " Life is a dream/ sweet dreams/ To memories/ of your schoolmate . " <p> However , a few years later , those happy words and pictures are replaced with sentiments of a much darker tone , Hough said . <p> German troops marched into Austria in March 1938 , and soon after , Jewish children in Vienna were banned from attending regular schools . The fear and gloom that many felt at that time are reflected in Nitti 's book . <p> " Friendship in despair/ friendship in death/ friendship in the midst of that makes three lasting bridges ... , " reads one of the later passages . <p> " It was clear she was responding to the political changes that were taking place , " Hough said . <p> The German inscriptions seem to stop at about the time of Kristallnacht , which was a wave of anti-Jewish violence that took place in Germany , annexed Austria and other German-occupied territory on November 9 and 10 , 1938 . <p> Hough said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hough discovered Nitti 's full name , Anita Schiller , lightly pressed in the soft leather cover of the book . <p> There were two English inscriptions dated 1940 from a place called Cockley Cley . <p> " Nitti had escaped to England , " Hough said . <p> Through research , Hough said she found a picture on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum website of Anita Schiller and other children who migrated to Great Britain through a program called Kindertransport , which transported about 10,000 Jewish refugee children from Germany and German-annexed territories from 1938 to 1940 . <p> Hough also found an online interview of one of the Kindertransport children who mentions Schiller . <p> She is determined to find out what became of Schiller after she arrived in England and how the book found its way to America , Hough said . <p> " I want to find out how her book came to be in Pennsylvania , " Hough said . " Did she emigrate to America ? " <p> Hough said she would like to discover the outcomes of Schiller and her friends and eventually donate the book to an appropriate museum .

" Andy " Borghesani talks with Whitehall High School students before they take the stage April 1 , 2014 , for a dress rehearsal of that spring 's musical , " South Pacific . " His resignation was accepted Monday , Feb. 3 , 2017 , by the Whitehall-Coplay School Board over allegations of inappropriate communications with two students . ( Chris Post file photo Lehighvalleylive.com contributor ) <p> The school board in the Whitehall-Coplay School District accepted the 29-year-old 's resignation Monday night . It is effective Feb. 7 . <p> A criminal investigation remains open into the allegations , Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said after the board 's 5-0 vote . <p> District officials learned of the allegations last October from the parents of one of the students , then learned another student claimed to have been receiving the communications as well , district solicitor Jeffrey Sultanik said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of behavioral expectation that we would want of any professional employee in the district , " Sultanik told reporters after the board meeting , clarifying later that there were no allegations physically assaulted any student . <p> " There were inappropriate communications " sent electronically , the attorney said . " There were texts , there were emails , there was SnapChat . " <p> The alleged communications were said to have occurred both during and outside school hours , Sultanik said . <p> The district immediately suspended , first with pay then as of last month without pay , and he has not taught since the allegations came to light , officials said . The move to accept his resignation came after authorities failed as of last month to bring criminal charges , district officials said . <p> A district investigation opened in January included interviews with the two students , Sultanik said . <p> " We did not have all of the evidence and we were awaiting information from the district attorney 's office , " Sultanik said to explain the three-month gap before the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities have been covered . At one point with the district , in addition to teaching music , Borghesani was director of the high school pep band and choral director , adviser of the stage design club and producer , stage director , music director , art director and rehearsal accompanist for the Zephyrs ' spring musical . <p> He could not be reached for comment Monday because no phone number could be found for him . The district has not spoken with him but has instead dealt with counsel for the Pennsylvania State Education Association union , Sultanik said . <p> School board member Tina Koren said she wanted to push to terminate rather than accept his resignation , but was swayed by Sultanik 's advice that accepting a resignation would be better for the district . <p> " I never want to see this guy teach in any school district ever again , " Koren said during Monday night 's meeting . <p> Prior to the allegations , Superintendent Lorie Hackett said , Borghesani was well-liked and respected . It was not immediately clear how long he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2006 graduate of Nazareth Area High School . <p> Koren commended the district administration for going outside the school community to share the allegations with a local church at which Borghesani had been teaching . <p> Sultanik explained that the benefits of accepting a resignation versus termination include avoiding having to pay unemployment compensation . The attorney also referenced Pennsylvania Act 168 that requires the district to share that Borghesani resigned while under investigation , should he apply to work at another school district in the state . <p> The district also avoids a fight with the teachers union , he said . <p> " In my opinion this is the best possible result from the district 's perspective and given the protections that exist under Act 168 , " Sultanik said .

 <p> As the final Blue Eagle to take the mat in the 2016-17 season -- one in which Nazareth swept state team honors , went 20-1 overall , crowned five District 11 champs , six Northeast Regional champs , and six state medalists including a state champion in Sammy Sasso -- Stefanik delivered the close in a way no one who saw it will ever forget . <p> The Nazareth senior scored a takedown with 25 seconds left to complete a comeback 4-3 win over previously unbeaten Bethel Park senior Nino Bonaccorsi , ranked No. 2 in the nation by Intermat , in the 182-pound final of the PIAA 3A tournament at the Giant Center in Hershey . <p> Stefanik ( 37-2 ) trailed 3-2 late in the third period and was running out of time but , as it turned out , Bonaccorsi ( 39-1 ) was running out of gas . <p> " I could tell he was getting tired , and I was pushing the pace , my morning running was paying off , " Stefanik said . " He had a stall warning which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he took a bad shot and I was able to re-shot it and get the takedown . " <p> That may have been the takedown of the season for Nazareth , and on any other Saturday night of 3A finals in Hershey it might have marked the best final of the night . <p> But , sharing the bill with Austin DeSanto of Exeter 's pulling off the greatest upset in PIAA history with a last-second takedown to upset 144-0 three-time state champion Spencer Lee of Franklin Regional 6-5 at 126 , had to settle for the second-best final . It was like being the second-best art work in the room to the Mona Lisa still pretty darned good . <p> It was made even better but the wonderful , spontaneous reaction of Nazareth head coach Dave Crowell that combined thrilled , happy and overwhelmed into a face that told the story and led to another . <p> " Coach Crowell 's reaction was the best , " Stefanik said .

And he gave Crowell his 20th state champ as a coach , third-best all-time in the state to two retired legends , Clearfield 's Art Weiss ( 31 ) and North Allegheny 's Gus DeAugustino ( 21 ) . The win gave the Princeton-bound Stefanik a career record of 154-34 ; his 188 career matches are the most in Nazareth history , breaking Andrew Flegler 's record of 186 , and the 154 wins leaves him third all-time behind Zach Horan and Tim Darling , both at 169 . <p> But Bonaccorsi almost made sure one of this happened .

 <h> Our pal ' Charlie ' the pheasant finds a friend of his own Nature Watch <p> After dinner on Thursday , knowing that we were going to get overnight snow even though at that time it was 55 degrees , I picked as many fully daffodils as I could find and brought them into the house . <p> The plants they came off of were prostrate from previous cold nights , but they will rebound and be fine . However , most of their flowers were already droopy or bent over and soft in the bend crease , so snow and ice would probably kill a lot of them . <p> It did n't take long , though , for the flowers to open up in the warmth of the house . And by the next morning the kitchen windowsill was covered in yellow . <p> It wo n't officially be spring for another week , and we 're still on a weather roller coaster . But plants react to weather conditions regardless of what our calendars say . <p> So in spite of some very cold recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , willows are beginning to sprout leaves , crocuses are breaking ground , and the invasive but very pretty dark blue flowers of low-growing speedwell ( veronica sp. ) are blooming on banks and other untended areas . <p> When I was outside picking the daffodils I heard the crowing of the ring-necked pheasant that we call Charlie coming from the corner of the yard . He frequents that spot all the time and often crows from a nearby compost pile while flapping his wings in a territorial display , so we think it 's always the same bird . <p> But considering that ring-necked pheasants do n't typically live very long in the wild and they all basically look alike , we 're just guessing it 's the same bird that 's been around for years . <p> And while we 're not sure about Charlie 's age , it was n't hard to immediately realize that a companion bird walking with Charlie a few weeks ago was a pheasant I had never seen here before . Its neck was blue with no ring around it , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green pheasant , a species that at one time was bred in the states with the hope that it would bolster the population of these game birds . But according to a longtime birding acquaintance who helped officially raise them in the state , they never caught on . And he said that although he did this more than 20 years ago , since then he has never seen one in the wild . <p> Worldwide there are many kinds of pheasants , most of which , unlike ring-necked 's , prefer woodland habitat . The green pheasant is the national bird of Japan , but interestingly when ring-necked pheasants were introduced into that country , that effort was n't very successful either . <p> I only saw this pheasant that day and both birds disappeared into the fields . And while Charlie eventually returned , I have no idea where the green pheasant went or where it came from . 
 <p> Morganelli said the number of assistant DA 's has been reduced due to former personnel accepting jobs in the U.S. Attorney 's Office , FBI and private practices . Another assistant has been out since October due to illness . <p> Morganelli submitted a memo to council on Jan. 25 asking for the new full-time positions . At the time he wrote the memo , the county had three murder cases in progress all of which were successfully prosecuted . Since the memo , there have been three homicides in Palmer Township and one in Bethlehem . <p> " Quite frankly , our office has been inundated with very serious cases over the last couple of months , " Morganelli said . <p> Morganelli said he plans to promote two current part-time assistant district attorneys to handle the full-time roles in the DUI unit and the drug and violent crime division . <p> The full-time position pays a salary of $118,168 .

 <p> It appeared Saturday 's predicted snow the last of the winter season would fall short of projections , ushering in a pleasant if cool first week of spring . However another bout of freezing precipitation could be in store next weekend , forecasters say . <p> Cooler weather than normal will greet the start of spring . ( AccuWeather ) <p> Predictions of an inch or two of snow overnight Saturday into Sunday were downgraded to some wet , slushy snow " garbage stuff , " National Weather Service meteorologist Walter Drag called it -- clearing the way for a mix of sun and clouds Sunday , the last day of winter . <p> A broad look at the week ahead shows highs in the 40s , with maybe a chance of rain Monday night into Tuesday . <p> AccuWeather which also calls for cooler-than-average temperatures in the coming week says a wintry mix is possible next weekend , though it depends on shifting weather patterns and if they keep cold air on top of the Northeast or if warmer air is ushered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a melting rainfall could present a flood risk if the storm does n't weaken , AccuWeather says . <p> It 's a lot of speculation that far out , but there may be a little bit more winter weather yet . 
 <p> The greater Lehigh Valley region is home to nearly half of the 16 new research projects announced this week to explore the potential of industrial hemp . <p> To Geoffrey Whaling , president and founder of the Pennsylvania Industrial Hemp Council , this new look to the plant 's future strikes him as a bit of an anachronism . <p> Pennsylvania , after all , was home to commercial cultivation of hemp through the World War II era , before it was outlawed in the 1950s and ' 60s as part of federal regulation of marijuana , according to the state Department of Agriculture . <p> " We really do n't need a lot of research , " said Whaling , though he acknowledges the idea of growing hemp seems like a foreign concept to a lot of people : " They do n't think about it being the paper on which the first two drafts of the Declaration of Independence were written , that the very first American flag was made of . <p> " We do n't have to reach too far to see how Pennsylvania has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research projects , however , are not your grandfather 's hempen rope . <p> For example , the Pennsylvania Industrial Hemp Council last week received state approval to work with Lehigh University on exploring the possibilities of hemp " in bio-manufacturing nanosheets as a matrix for quantum dots , " according to Thursday 's announcement by state Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding . <p> Another project of the council and Lehigh will evaluate the use of hemp for erosion control and phytoremediation , which entails using the plant to draw out heavy metals and toxins from contaminated soil . Lehigh has a prime test site right in Upper Saucon Township : an arsenic-contaminated , former zinc mine owned by the university near the Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley , Whaling said . <p> His council and Lehigh University are partnering on a third project " to isolate and identify hemp components with antimicrobial activity under laboratory conditions . " <p> Other research projects to gain state approval are planned by GenCanna Global Inc. in Berks , Lehigh and Montgomery counties ; Lehigh and Cheyney universities in Schuylkill and Bedford counties ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucks County . <p> " The level of thought that went into these proposals , along with the ingenuity and range of the underlying research questions , is impressive , " Redding , the agriculture secretary , said in a statement . " It is energizing to see the alliances that already have been created among academic , civic , farm and industry organizations . It is a reminder of the vibrant and resourceful agricultural community at the heart of our commonwealth . <p> " We are grateful to these researchers for their commitment to build an industrial hemp industry in Pennsylvania , and we thank them for choosing to work with us as we take the first steps in that direction , " Redding continued . " We are committed to working with growers to further refine and improve the program and to encourage and foster additional research that will lead to future opportunities for Pennsylvania agriculture . " <p> Hemp has the potential to become a billion-dollar industry in Pennsylvania , Whaling said . <p> It 's sustainable , grows to maturity in 100 days and requires no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercedes-Benz and BMW already use hemp in manufacturing . Hemp seeds are edible , and are sold today in Pennsylvania in a sterilized form and in products ; the seeds are 100 percent digestible protein and contain as much beneficial Omega 3,6 , and 9 fatty acids as fish oil , according to the Pennsylvania Industrial Hemp Council . <p> " It 's a super crop and a super food , " Whaling said . " It could touch every single part of our lives , and we just need to get through this first phase of research to prove it to be possible . " <p> A 2015 report from the Congressional Research Service found that hemp is used in more than 25,000 products worldwide , including automotive interiors , textiles , paper , foods , beverages and nutritional supplements among others . China and Canada dominate hemp production today , with the United States being the world 's largest importer of the cash crop . It is estimated to be a nearly $600 million industry today in the U.S. , the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture says <p> Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of research , Whaling said , and hurdles remain before the first seed can even be planted for use in the 16 approved research projects . <p> For one , the seed has to come from Europe or Canada , under the federal 2014 Farm Bill that opened the door to hemp research , Whaling said . The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has yet to release the permits for Pennsylvania to obtain the seed . <p> " We absolutely have to have seed by May " to be planted by June for research to begin this year , Whaling said . <p> Statewide , 75 acres of hemp will be grown as part of the research products , compared to 8,000 acres in industry leader Kentucky , Whaling said . His Industrial Hemp Council is looking to grow 20 acres , divided among three 5-acre plots and two 2 1/2-acre plots . <p> Whaling works out of Fleetwood in Berks County and said he envisions the greater Lehigh Valley and Berks County region as an " epicenter for the resurgence of industrial hemp . " He ticked off local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Products . <p> " We just need to start this research so we can prove to them that there are benefits out there and can start building an industry , " Whaling said . <p> Unlike its sister plant marijuana , hemp wo n't get anyone high . Industrial hemp is grown for fiber and seed , and must maintain a concentration of the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC , below the 0.3 percent legal threshold , according to the state Agriculture Department . <p> Pennsylvania , of course , is embarking on a marijuana experiment , as well , with creation of a new medical cannabis program . <p> The state Department of Health is accepting permits postmarked by Monday for 25 grower/processor permits , five of which will also be issued a permit to dispense medical cannabis products starting sometime in 2018 . <p> Those permits are expected to be awarded after a 90-day review , Health Department spokeswoman April Hutcheson said Friday . <h> 16 hemp research projects approved <p> Following is the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture 's full list of the 16 approved research projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each : <p> County , Commonwealth Alternative Medicinal Options ( CAMO ) , to track seed and stalk yield , plant nutrients and general development under Pennsylvania growing conditions . <p> Armstrong County , Academic Sciences of Pennsylvania LLC , to compare seed quality and yield under different growing conditions ( planting and harvest dates , nutrients , irrigation and spacing ) . <p> Berks County , Rodale Institute , to evaluate potential benefits of industrial hemp as a cash or cover crop for weed control and soil health . <p> Dauphin County , Royal Beverage LLC doing business as Corp. , to compare at least four cultivars growing under Pennsylvania conditions . <p> Franklin County , Destiny 's Agro Farm Inc. , to compare at least four cultivars for visual qualities , fiber content , and seed yields . <p> Lehigh County , Pennsylvania Hemp Industry Council ( Lehigh University ) , to isolate and identify hemp components with antimicrobial activity under laboratory conditions . <p> County , Pennsylvania Hemp Industry Council ( Lehigh University ) , to evaluate use of hemp for erosion control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contaminants within the plant . <p> Lehigh County , Pennsylvania Hemp Industry Council ( Lehigh University ) , to test plant material for use in biomanufacturing nanosheets as a matrix for quantum dots . <p> Lycoming County , Global Industry Standard LLC , to measure invasive potential to spread to areas where it was not planted .

( lehighvalleylive.com file photo ) <p> When Jack Panella set out on a project 10 years ago to write a book guiding judges in sexual violence cases , he was n't surprised to find there was n't much out there . <p> Sexual assault is an issue that is n't easy to talk about . <p> " It is the most unreported crime , " said Panella , a Pennsylvania Superior Court judge from Palmer Township . " Victims are embarrassed , and they get revictimized through the system . " <p> Panella 's 2008 book , " The Sexual Violence Benchbook , " is in its third edition now and is required reading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys and public defenders . <p> Besides the book , Panella presides over about eight training sessions and webinars per year for members of the judiciary and district court . <p> For his efforts , he has earned national recognition from the nation 's preeminent advocacy group in ending sexual violence . <p> The National Sexual Violence Resource Center named Panella one of 32 recipients nationwide of its 2017 Visionary Voice Awards . Other winners included a sexual assault survivor who speaks to collegiate athletic programs and a state representative in Louisiana who championed legislation for equal pay and sexual and reproductive health . <p> Panella , 61 , received the award April 1 during the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape 's annual dinner . <p> The coalition nominated Panella for the honor the same group that enlisted his help more than 10 years ago in compiling the first-of-its kind training guide for judges . <p> " He 's been a real leader in the judiciary , " said Kristen Houser , a spokeswoman for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center who also works with the Pennsylvania Coaition Against Rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual assault , this is one that very few people have expert understanding , " she said . <p> " Many of the things that we as a culture believe to be true are actually myths . So it 's incredibly important that your judges are well-trained . You end up with a better-operating judicial system . His work just really stands out . " <p> Panella , a former Lehigh Valley attorney and Northampton County Court judge for 12 years , presided over many sexual assault cases . But he said it was n't until he launched into the book project that he began to understand the scarcity of resources available . <p> He teamed up with his former law clerk , the late Teresa Scalzo , to complete the book 's first edition . Scalzo , a 1986 Easton Area High School graduate , worked as a Northampton County prosecutor and a U.S. Navy civilian attorney as a sex crimes prosecution expert . She died of cancer in 2016 . <p> For Panella , the book was a springboard to the training sessions he runs with a colleague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court justice . <p> He also has produced a new resource , a quick-reference bench card for judges on the Sex Offender Registration or Notification Act , or Megan 's Law . <p> Panella said he was humbled by the national award and gaining recognition from those who work to shine light on the difficult area of criminal justice . <p> The National Sexual Violence Resource Center has given the Visionary Voice Awards since 2003 . <p> Said Houser : " It 's an opportunity to say thank you to people who have stepped up and gone the extra mile . Hopefully it 's something that can inspire others to be part of the solution . " 
 <h> Sign in <h> Awaiting the 1st hummingbird of the season Nature Watch <p> About a week ago I put out three hummingbird feeders , even though I knew I 'd probably not see one for a few weeks . <p> Late April is the earliest time a ruby-throat has stopped by my place for a sugar/water fix on its way farther North . And that 's usually when old-fashioned bleeding heart plants in the front yard are blooming . <p> But according to the www.hummingbirds.net web site , ruby-throated hummingbirds have already been sighted as far north as Maine . I 'm only guessing at this , of course , but perhaps a few of those extremely early northern migrants are the same ones reported days earlier from our area of the country . <p> It 's a little too early in the season for them to be a common sight , but ruby-throated hummingbirds have already been spotted as far north as Maine . ( AP file photo ) <p> All kinds of birds are now coming back North as the weather turns warm and insects and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what most people think , hummingbirds eat lots of insects . <p> They need both protein and carbohydrates to live . So whenever I do a hummingbird lecture I always say that if you want hummingbirds around , do n't get rid of the spider webs or insect swarms in your yard . <p> But while I have n't as yet seen a hummingbird , I am seeing lots of ephemeral spring wildflowers . They only exist for a short period of time and then disappear when the leaves come out on trees and shrubs . <p> Currently the western part of our yard is bright yellow from blooming wood poppies interspersed with Virginia bluebells and violets . Elsewhere in the yard and fields , there are violets colored blue and white together and others that are pure white . Later in the season yellow violets will bloom , but they 're not open yet . And , of course , in our yard there are lots of yellow dandelion flowers . We like them . <p> These days the common dandelion is reviled by most homeowners to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , going back to the time of the Romans , dandelion has been valued and used for all kinds of medicinal purposes because it 's full of chemical compounds . <p> When I was young my sister and I would pick dandelion leaves for which my mother would make bacon dressing . I now know that these leaves have diuretic properties but at that time it did n't matter and was n't an issue for any of us . <p> The day I wrote this column my husband David and I drove up to the woods to see what wildflowers were blooming there . But , other than a few white bloodroot blossoms and blue common violets , it was still mostly devoid of color . <p> We did , however , see a Norway maple covered with clusters of yellowish-green flowers , and several oaks in the tree canopy were covered with dangling catkins . I ca n't , however , tell you what kind of oaks they were because I could only see their tops from a distance and the flowers of all oak species basically look alike .

 <h> ' He was terrified , ' cop says of victim in cellphone store robbery <p> The Verizon store employee had his hands tied behind his back with zip ties . He was held at gunpoint , ordered to provide the combination to the store 's safe and left for about 23 minutes in a dark restroom during a February snowstorm robbery , a Slate Belt Regional police officer testified Monday . <p> The accused robbers -- Gregory Lewis Jr. , 26 , of the first block of South 17th Street in Wilson Borough , and John Felix , 26 , of the 1400 block of Spring Garden Street in Easton -- then made off with more than $38,651 worth of goods and $1,235 in cash from the Wind Gap store . <p> Both face charges of robbery , kidnapping , theft , false imprisonment , possession of a weapon and several other related offenses .

Dressed in a blue prison jumpsuit , blue sneakers , handcuffs and shackles , Lewis did n't speak during the hearing and showed no emotion during testimony . Felix , dressed in a red prison jumpsuit , black sneakers , shackles and handcuffs , also did n't speak during his appearance . <p> Felix and Lewis were the first suspects to be charged in a larger series of five cellphone store robberies across Lehigh , Northampton and Warren counties dating to October . A task force led by Northampton County Assistant District Attorney Patricia Mulqueen is investigating the crimes . <p> Authorities prior to Monday 's hearing had sealed the affidavit of probable cause in the Wind Gap robbery , citing the ongoing investigation . The documents were unsealed after the preliminary hearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , the judge determined there was enough evidence to send the case onto Northampton County Court , where Lewis could face trial . A formal arraignment has been set for July 6 . <p> After the court appearances , Mulqueen said no plea arrangements have been discussed . <p> Slate Belt Detective Eric Donaldson testified the victim , only referred to a " HW , " is in constant fear of the robbers . <p> So much so that when the victim identified Lewis -- dressed in a sweatshirt matching the suspect in Verizon store surveillance video during an arrest for a separate crime -- he would only initial the photograph with an " H. " <p> The victim , the store 's assistant manager , is in fear for himself and his family , Donaldson told the court . <p> " ( He ) was very scared , terrified of what happened to him that day , " Donaldson said . <p> Investigators have calculated the entire robbery to have occurred within about 14 minutes at the store at 1001 South Broadway . The victim was sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he stood up to greet him , Donaldson said . <p> The victim quickly realized the men had masks covering their faces , and when he spotted a silver handgun in the waistband of one of the robbers , he sat back down . The robbers then asked if the victim was alone and he replied that he was , Donaldson said . <p> The victim was ordered to place his hands behind his back , and the bandits used zip ties to secure him . One of the robbers took the victim 's cellphone and forced him into a back room , ordering the combination to the safe , Donaldson said . <p> " He stated he was very afraid at that point , " Donaldson said of the victim . <p> Another robber used the victim 's thumbprint to access the combination on his cellphone , he said .

The clerk then cut off the zip ties to break the victim free , he said . <p> $38K worth of items <p> Surveillance video from the store and two neighboring businesses shows the pair loading up three garbage bags totaling more than $38,651 worth of cellphones and accessories from the store , as well as stealing $1,235 in cash , according to Donaldson . <p> An authorized receipt of a cellphone tower dump from four major wireless phone companies showed cellphone transactions between Felix and Lewis during the time of the robbery . <p> Police on March 3 then obtained search warrants for Lewis ' home and Felix 's home and raided the Easton-area houses .

Both were stolen from the Verizon store in Wind Gap , authorities said . <p> Attorney James Brose , representing Lewis , questioned Donaldson on how could he be sure the victim was left in the restroom for 23 minutes . Donaldson said it was calculated based on store surveillance footage and the cellphone records between the robbers . <p> " The victim ... was not injured at all ? " Brose asked . <p> " No , just scared , " Donaldson said . <p> Other arrests : <p> Several additional arrests have been made in the string of cellphone store robberies : <p> Eric Quentin Watson , 25 , of Easton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from robberies in Bethlehem and Forks townships through an online marketplace .

" You guys are spoiled . We used to have cow piles in the outfield in minor leagues . " <p> The four-time Cy Young Award winner did n't have to spend much time as a minor leaguer , though -- only parts of three seasons after he was signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure bet in the first place . <p> The way Carlton tells it , the Cardinals flew him from North Miami to St. Louis to throw with the big-league team in front of manager Johnny Keane and pitching coach Howie Pullet . They watched him pitch , as did another future Hall of Fame pitcher , Bob Gibson . Carlton wrapped up his showing , took a shower and went up to the press box where he says he saw the final hit of Stan Musial 's career , a double of the right field wall . <p> After not hearing anything from the Cardinals about a deal , Carlton went back to junior college at Miami Dade North . Soon though , after Pullet told the Cardinals he 'd take the money out of his own pocket to ink the lefty , Carlton eventually signed for $5,000 . <p> " My first year in the big leagues ( 1965 ) , the whole year was a $6,000 salary , " Carlton said .

" These guys do n't know anything but pitch counts . I would balk at it because I do n't agree with it , but they ca n't go up against it because that 's all they know . Philosophically I do n't agree with it because I think these guys are not really in shape because they do n't throw enough . <p> " You need to throw so much so the tendons , ligaments , the muscle and bone get bigger , denser , stronger to be able to handle the stress of throwing .

 <p> The investigation may have taken 10 months , but officials in the Warren County borough where a municipal clerk is accused of stealing almost $100,000 over five years say they took action immediately when the allegations arose . <p> Last summer , the Mayor and Council became aware of alarming allegations with regard to Ms. Blanchard 's conduct in carrying out her sworn duties as the Municipal Clerk and Manager for the Borough of Washington . <p> While there has been speculation that the Borough and its Borough officials were not acting expeditiously in response to the claims , the simple fact of the matter is that it took swift and immediate action aimed at determining the veracity of the claims . Through the process , Borough officials remained cognizant of their own responsibilities in protecting the process which had to include Ms. Blanchard 's rights pending the outcome of the investigation . The Borough was painstakingly careful not to compromise the progression of the Borough , local authority and Warren County Prosecutor 's Office investigations by engaging in public commentary . Transparency is the mainstay of public trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speculation take precedence over fact . <p> So the record is clear , Borough officials took immediate action the very day the allegations surfaced . The authorities were contacted , all relevant evidence was preserved and Ms. Blanchard was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation . The Borough engaged its own professionals as well as independent professionals to investigate the allegations . Further , officials likewise worked diligently in order to make sure that the State agency overseeing the public office of municipal clerk was apprised of and sanctioned the actions taken by the borough with regard to Ms. Blanchard 's employment status . <p> Borough officials are dismayed and saddened by the alleged actions of Ms. Blanchard , and believe that the public is owed a full accounting of what happened , but at this time the legal system must be allowed to run its course . <p> She is charged with one count each of official misconduct , pattern of official misconduct and theft . Each is a second-degree charge carrying a sentence of five to 10 years , or a fine up to $150,000 if convicted .

Another hearing was scheduled June 22 . <p> Hackettstown police said the pastor 's alleged violations were reported June 27 . <p> The church 's interim pastor , the Rev.

Each crime carries a potential 10-year state prison sentence . <p> One year later to the day , the board of examiners used the indictment as justification to suspend Martino 's teaching certifications , which date to 1997 . <p> According to the board 's order , Martino argued in a letter that the suspension was premature and should not be issued until the criminal case is resolved . It noted that Martino has left his teaching position . <p> The board , however , said the state wants to " protect public school pupils from contact with individuals whom it deemed to be dangerous .

 <p> In fact , after visiting briefly with his students , he ducked out before the broadcast even began -- something he has done every year . <p> To him , students who participated in Wilson Area High School 's " Little Shop of Horrors " already were a source of pride , just like those who came before them in the many plays he directed since becoming involved in the Wilson theater program years ago . <p> While the establishment of the Freddy Awards program in 2003 did n't change the way he directed or taught students , he does credit the program for changing the way the public views high school theater programs . And that 's a good thing , he said . <p> " I think the Freddys have shown audiences in the Lehigh Valley that high school students are capable of doing tremendous work , " he says . <p> But as it has been for every production since his first " The Odd Couple , " to his last " Little Shop of Horrors , " it 's always about the students -- what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way . <p> Kaye this spring retired from a program he has built for many years at Wilson Area High School , where he has been active since 1975 . <p> As an English teacher , he served the school district in many roles , even as an assistant football coach at one point , but the person directing plays at the school resigned and the chairman of the department asked him if he would be interested . With his family background in theater and acting , he jumped at the chance to take on the new duties . <p> When he retired from teaching in 2005 , he retired from directing , too , but only for two years . An open position translated into another opportunity , so in 2007 he returned and , in his words , " had a ball ! " <p> Directing plays for some 40 years , you might expect a lot of changes . But Kaye says that 's not really the case . " Everything is cyclical , " he says . " Sometimes you get a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as many . Another year later , and you might get a huge amount of interest . " <p> A kid who wants to be in drama is one devoted to the arts , he says , adding " that has n't changed at all . " <p> Retiring director Dan Kaye with some of the cast of the last play he directed , " Little Shop of Horrors . " ( KJ Frantz For lehighvalleylive.com ) <p> For Kaye , every play holds " a special place in my heart , " he says as he recalls the year that the school performed " The Mikado , " a comic opera written by Gilbert and Sullivan . Kaye relays a story of a student who graduated from Wilson and , in college , decided to audition for a play . " When she told the college director she did ' The Mikado ' in high school , he did n't believe her so she proceeded to sing an entire number to prove it . " <p> Seemingly loving a challenge , he also cites " The Secret Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays that Wilson tackled . Wilson , he says proudly , was the first high school in the entire Northeast to perform " Les Mis . " <p> He is most proud of the fact that at Wilson , showtime means students are in charge . " The kids take the responsibility and run with it . They are treated like adults and they act like adults , " he says , adding that when the curtain goes up on opening night , he and other adults involved take a step back . <p> " The kids design the lighting , move the lights , design the sound . They do it all . We teach them and they go for it , " he says . <p> And because they are so involved , there 's smooth transition from year to year as they learn from and teach one another . <p> After the final show in March , Kaye handed over the reins to his assistant and former student , Lacy Browne . She also is an English teacher at the high school who has served under Kaye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Wilson in 2000 , took part in the theater program during her sophomore , junior and senior years . But her fondest memory was in 1998 when she was a part of her first play , " The Secret Garden . " <p> " To this day this is one of my favorite plays and that 's a piece I would like to come back to , " she says , adding quickly " but not next year . " <p> Browne is reviewing several scripts for next year 's play but likely wo n't make her decision known until September . <p> It 's her first time making the selection , so she 's taking her time , she says , even though students keep prodding her . Last year 's play was announced in June because Kaye knew it would be his last , but she says the start of the school year is a more realistic timeline . <p> Knowing it was Kaye 's last play , she hired an assistant this year to take care of her responsibilities for " Little Shop " so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she learned from him and make it her own . <p> " I really liked watching how he worked with kids on scene work with two three actors at a time .

 <h> The time of year when shorebirds pay a visit Nature Watch <p> It was dreary and rainy when I wrote this , but the rain was n't heavy or part of a strong thunderstorm . At times , of course , rain spoils outside activities , but where would we be without it ? <p> Birders look forward to rain in late spring because it often causes northbound migrating shorebirds to temporarily put down in local rivers , lakes and field puddles . <p> During the previous week 's rains , a solitary sandpiper -- a species that nests in Canada -- spent four days in a wet area of our bottom fields . And some solitary sandpipers even go as far north as the Canadian tundra to nest . <p> Earlier that morning , although I did n't know about them until they left , there were 16 whimbrels in a muddy area of Minsi Lake above Bangor . That lake is being drained so the dam can be repaired , and its muddy shores are what shorebirds poke around in for food . You almost never find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Whimbrels are large shorebirds with 17-inch bodies , a 30-inch wingspan and a downward tapering bill . They 're rare migrants around here that nest in northern Alaska and along the Hudson Bay , although they 're common in Scandinavia , Scotland , Iceland and western Russia . <p> However , if you 're not a birder you probably do n't care much about shorebirds . But if you saw one like a whimbrel you 'd almost certainly take notice . And even though most people do n't like the swampy or muddy habitats shorebirds feed in , that ground containing all kinds of wet creatures is essential to keeping bodies of water healthy . <p> We 're also at a time in spring when a lot of trees have already bloomed and are covered with leaves , while other species are just now blooming after the leaves are out . And there are several such blooming hickories in one of our fencerows and along the stream right now , both shagbark hickories and pignuts . <p> Hickories are members of the walnut family and there are 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most easily identified species due to their aptly named bark , but others can be easily identified by looking at their hanging male flowers . <p> But while shagbark hickory nuts are tasty , the same ca n't be said of the pignuts . They 're a very important food source for all kinds of small mammals and some birds , but they 're bitter . Many years ago I somehow got a pignut in with a bowl of shagbark nuts my husband David and I were collecting , and I still remember how my mouth immediately puckered up . <p> Also growing along that same stream are several large tulip poplars whose tops are covered with pretty greenish-yellow and orange flowers . But interestingly , tulip poplars are n't poplars at all , but rather members of the magnolia family .

Now officials are urging the thief to return it , no questions asked . <p> The computer and other belongings were taken from a car parked in Easton between 9 p.m . Friday and about 9 a.m . Saturday . <p> It 's not the retail value of the black , Dell laptop that has community center officials distressed , so much as what it contains . The laptop holds files for grants that have been written and submitted , as well as photographs and human resources records . <p> The records are part of what helps the West Ward nonprofit agency operate . <p> " If anyone knows of anything , all we ask is that it be returned , " said Executive Director Brooke Mitman . <p> The community center at Ninth and Washington streets provides after-school programs , meals , resources and mentors for hundreds of Easton-area kids .

The cafeteria was converted into an international food court with dishes from more than 20 countries . <p> " It was just a phenomenal , phenomenal night , " she said . <p> Robertson said families from the countries represented donated costumes , paid for them or helped make them .

 <p> The Lions led undefeated Egg Harbor 1-0 in the sixth inning of the NJSIAA Group 4 final on Saturday night at Kean University in Union . <p> North Hunterdon ace Maggie Swan was pitching a three-hitter and retired the first two batters in the top of the sixth inning . <p> Then things changed . <p> Tori Szrom had a single , which was followed by an RBI triple by Ella Glenn down the right-field line to tie the game . After an error on a ball put in play by Marissa Varela , Egg Harbor scored to take a 2-1 lead . <p> The Lions got two runners on each the sixth and seventh innings , but they could n't work a run across to tie the game . Egg Harbor clinched the 2-1 victory and the group championship on a close force-out play at second base . <p> " Close play . It could 've gone either way . I thought maybe she was safe . We did n't lose the game because of that play though . That 's a tough call . Bang-bang play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt off to try to get there and keep the inning going , " North Hunterdon coach Anthony Rotondo said . <p> Things started great for the Lions as senior center fielder Meghan Graham led off the bottom of the first inning with a triple off the wall in right field . After senior catcher Melissa Meiners was hit by a pitch , freshman shortstop Eliza Filus had an RBI single to give North Hunterdon a 1-0 lead . <p> Swan was then hit by a pitch to load the bases in the first inning . But Egg Harbor recorded outs on the next three batters to end the inning and avoid any more damage . The Lions would n't score in the final six innings , leaving five runners on base . <p> " I just think , honestly , big stage . I think we were a little tight .

I think if we really broke it open in the first inning , it would 've helped us a lot more , " Graham said . <p> Graham , who will continue her career at George Mason University , went 3-for-4 with a triple in the first inning , a single in the second and a double in the fifth . <p> went 2-for-4 with an RBI single in the first inning and two-out single in the seventh . <p> Swan reached base twice and held Egg Harbor to seven hits .

" The group of girls here is just amazing . It 's definitely a positive vibe leaving North Hunterdon High School . It 's something I 'm never going to forget . I 'll always remember it . It really set me up for college . Made me realize what potential I have . " <p> " I 'm going to miss the seniors , " Rotondo said . " They 're a special group . I 'm going to miss them . And I would 've given anything for them to win today , but it was n't in the cards . " 
 <p> Buckingham and McVie started collaborating as a duo after McVie rejoined Fleetwood Mac in 2014 . The pair is set to release a studio album on Friday , June 9 called " Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie , " featuring 10 new songs written by the duo . The record is currently available to stream via NPR . <p> Though it 's not a proper Fleetwood Mac album , the group 's bassist John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood both contribute instrumentation to the record . <p> First started in 1968 , Fleetwood Mac originally featured neither Buckingham nor McVie . But the group saw its greatest run of success when founding members John McVie and Mick Fleetwood were joined by Christine McVie , Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks for classic albums like " Fleetwood Mac , " " Rumours " and " Tusk . " <p> The group has been touring with its classic lineup since 2014 , and is expected to launch a " farewell tour " in 2018 . <p> The duo joins a Sands Event Center summer lineup that features the superstar magician David Blaine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulaney , and the hitmaker Diana Ross . 
 <p> No flames were visible when firefighters arrived , but there was heavy smoke coming from the kitchen vents and the roof line , Johnson said . It took about an hour to get the fire under control and then out , Johnson said . Firefighters remained on site until after 4 a.m. , he added . <p> The restaurant 's owners arrived as the the effort was underway , Johnson said . The restaurant wo n't be able to immediately reopen , he added . <p> The owners posted on Facebook that the restaurant will be closed until further notice . Already on Thursday , a contractor had been to the site and begun to shore up some of the damage . <p> A woman who answered the phone Thursday morning at building owner Gus ' home in Bethlehem Township said she could n't speak about the restaurant . <p> The former Gus 's Crossroads was gutted in 1983 in a fire that destroyed most of the inn . Thirteen years later , an electrical fire on the top floor virtually destroyed the building and caused extensive fire , smoke and water damage . 
 <p> " It makes me feel pretty good , " he said last week inside his , where he teaches apprentices his art . " It actually makes me feel like I worked and accomplished something . <p> " I love what I do so it 's never really been a job for me . It 's just been something that I love to do . It 's never really been , you wake up in the morning and you 've got to go to work . I never had that feeling . " <p> But back to those roots to his career : Pistilli grew up in Bernardsville , in Somerset County , his parents the owners of a busy restaurant . He got his first horse at age 19 , in 1959 , and within a decade was placing high showing his quarter horses . <p> Ireland native Seamus Brady helped shoe his horses , and Pistilli called on him to come by toward the end of the 1968 season , ahead of a show . <p> " He said to me , ' Sure , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . And when I went to the horse show , there was a shoe that was loose and when I put him in the trailer that morning , apparently he must have gotten it caught in something because the shoe was off when I got to the horse show . <p> " In those days you had to have four shoes on the horse to go into the horse show , into the ring . And the judge said to me , ' I 'm sorry , I ca n't check your horse , your horse is excused . ' " <p> Even a fourth-place showing that day would have earned enough points on the season to win a saddle worth about $3,500 . <p> " And I lost that year by two points . That 's all I had to do was have my horse in that show that day , " he said . " So I did n't get nothing . And I wound up losing . " <p> He called Brady . <p> " ' You 've got to take me with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , ' Why ? ' And I says , ' I 've got to learn to do this . I 've really got to learn to do this , so if I get a loose shoe I can fix it . ' " <p> The blacksmith <p> On one wall inside Pistilli 's garage hang horseshoes handmade by his apprentices . He 's been teaching people to become farriers since around 1984 , beginning at his Far Hills Forge School in New Jersey . On the floor nearby rests a chest freezer , for the horse cadaver feet . <p> " And I know a lot of schools do n't even do that , but I 'd rather have a cadaver foot for a guy that 's first starting to drive nails , " Pistilli said . <p> His anvils are ringed with the tools of the trade , many handmade by . He hand-built the cabinets to outfit a trailer , parked outside , as a mobile blacksmith shop . He goes where the horses are , including these days to New York and Freehold , N.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 1,200 degrees to convert the steel concave stock he imports from Europe in straight beams . The molten metal is hammered into the custom shoes that are the lifeblood of his work . <p> " What my field is , I really go out and do a lot of lame horses , horses that are not functional anymore , " Pistilli said . " I get a hold of the vet , I find out what 's bothering them . " <p> He 'll rely a bit on modern technology , like an infrared camera to reveal hot spots of inflammation . The solutions often come from pre-1900s books that Pistilli consults . <p> " Those books , horses were a way of life like cars are today , " he said . " I mean , the cars today are so sophisticated that you ca n't work on them . You 've got to bring them to an expert . Well back in those days they brought them to experts -- so they could get to the grocery store , so they could get to the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing . <p> " So those guys really had to be able to get their horses , to get out of the barn and go where they 're going to go . And those people really had to know about horses . " <p> points out the defects in a horse 's cadaver legs , cut into a cross section , that hang under glass in a wooden frame in his shop . He 'll tell you the kind of shoe it needs to keep going and to keep the condition from worsening . <p> " You 've got to know your stuff , " he said . " You 've got to balance that foot so he 's landing proper . I just , I have been doing it a long time and I 've got a very good reputation in my business . " <p> The teacher <p> Pistilli closed his school in Far Hills , where he lived for 27 years , and moved in November 2006 to Lower Saucon Township , where he lives with his wife , Elli . <p> He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and his son Danny , a working farrier himself for 12 years now . has three more children in Florida . <p> When he 's with a student , he can be making a shoe of his own , carefully measuring out the dimensions on his anvil for nail holes using a speed square . But his attention is always on his student , even when entertaining a visitor to his shop . <p> " Many years ago , " he began Thursday morning , " the blacksmiths when they made chain or if they made anything they -- drop your left hand now , Ralph . You got , you got it . " <p> With him was Ralph , a schoolteacher from Jefferson Township , New Jersey , hoping to make a second career out of becoming a farrier . He found Pistilli just by searching on the Internet for a good place to learn . <p> " All leads point to Sonny , " said . " I did n't want to learn how to nail a shoe on , I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake on a horse , how to help a horse . And it starts from the feet up . That 's what led me here to Sonny . " <p> Pistilli will take on an apprentice for anywhere from three months to a year . <p> " The only thing I find that really is hard is under the horse , " he said . <p> That 's where the psychology comes in : A horse senses fear , nervousness instantly . A farrier has to recognize that and learn to become comfortable with a 1,200-pound animal that has its own way of thinking . <p> " If you do it the right way , nothing bothers them , " Pistilli said . " If you hurt them you 'll know immediately you did something you should n't have done . " <p> It 's not about sitting in a classroom with . <p> " They got to meet the customers . They got to meet the horses in the flesh , " Pistilli said Thursday in the blacksmith shop . " And -- now when you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? What you got to do now is you got to knock that through . What you got to do is hit that as hard as you can . You got it , it 's through . " <p> The hall of famer <p> Pistilli traveled to Georgia in April for the Farriers Hall of Fame induction ceremony , what he calls " a big shindig . " A poster celebrating the achievement hangs front and center in his garage , just above a plaque he was awarded recognizing his work as a certified master farrier , master educator and tester . <p> He does n't own horses anymore himself , not since 2000 . <p> " I was tied to them from the time I was 17 or 18 years old , " Pistilli said . " I had to have a little life . It 's like having a family , another part of a family . They 've got to be fed twice a day , they 've got to be cleaned , they 've got to be washed . I took very good care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful animal . " <p> Today , Pistilli is an avid golfer on the side , and shot a 73 this spring . He ca n't tell you how many horses he 's shod in 49 years : " I 'd like to have a dime for every one I 've done over the years , a dime right now . A lot . " <p> He still wields a hammer with authority , his hands quickly becoming blackened each time he fires up the forge . <p> " I 'm going to keep doing this because I love doing it and I love helping people , " he said . 
 <h> These vintage postcards tell the story of Slate Belt history ( PHOTOS ) <p> Tucked away in a white binder at the Slate Belt Heritage Center in Bangor is a treasure trove of history -- a collection of postcards that gives a glimpse into Bangor and surrounding communities in their heyday . <p> It was a time when the Slate Belt earned its name as the center of slate production for the United States . <p> The postcards have come from a variety of sources and have grown in number over the years since the heritage center opened in 1999 , said Melissa Hough , president of board of trustees and curator at the Slate Belt Heritage Center . <p> Scenes depicted represent the growth of boroughs such as Bangor , Pen Argyl , Roseto and Wind Gap . <p> " This was a booming area , " Hough said . <p> Slate extracted from the many mines was used in construction for slate shingles , blackboards , mantles and other fireplace fixtures . <p> Most of the postcards show scenes from 1900 through the middle part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local economy and made the towns hubs for commerce . <p> " The downtown areas were big retail and service-providing areas , " Hough said . " There were multiple furniture stores , druggists , doctors ' offices and lawyers . " That 's what 's represented in many of these photographs . " <p> Aside from scenes , the postcards show people -- often wealthy folks who built fine houses that still stand today . <p> From today 's vantange point , the popularity and use of postcards could be considered the Facebook of that era . <p> Besides the scenes , an inspection of the cards gives a look into the thoughts and messages of the senders : " Thinking of you " and " Here I 'm in this place but still thinking of you . " <p> " They were short messages sometimes sent to family members and not very far away , " Hough said . " From the Slate Belt you 'd send to your cousins in Easton or Stroudsburg . They were meant as friendship sorts of things . " <p> Other postcards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architecture and scenic sites . A number of cards in the collection show the remains of a massive fire that struck S. Flory Manufacturing in Bangor on Aug. 1 , 1913 . <p> The postcards were made by different printers , with some adding color to the images before the proliferation of color prints . <p> The Slate Belt Heritage Center is at 30 N. First St. in Bangor . It 's open noon to 3 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays from April through October ; and noon to 3 p.m . Sundays from November through March . <p> Admission is free and special visits and tours can be arranged upon request . <p> Monthly presentations are held 7 p.m. the second Thursday of each month from April through November , and at 2 p.m. the second Sunday of each month from December through March . 
 <p> Council is scheduled to discuss the measure at a 6 p.m. committee-of-the-whole meeting Monday . <p> Council President J. William Reynolds , who supports tackling ethics reform in separate ordinances , invited Tuesday to review the draft proposal and outline the ways he keeps a check on government ethics , conflicts of interest and other violations . <p> Morganelli said he did not mean to disparage anyone 's efforts on the ordinance , but it tried to do too much in one law and much of it just repeats Pennsylvania 's existing ethics law . Under that law , local municipalities can pass their own ethics plans to supplement the state code , but it can not do less . <p> One of the centerpieces of the Negron-Colon proposal , which was drafted with substantial citizen input over a year , is an independent city ethics board . The board would offer training , conduct investigations and offer advisory opinions . <p> Morganelli said he found this puzzling and potentially very expensive due to the number of lawyers the board would need to hire for a complaint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this when we have a state board for free , " he said . <p> The state ethics commission does a great job and is quite independent and objective because it does not know the local officials it investigates , Morganelli said . <p> He also wondered why council would delegate so much of its power to an outside board and allow independent groups to appoint members to the board . <p> " This thing is really giving away power to a board that is really very narrow , " Morganelli said . <p> He suggested council decide what it is trying to solve through ethics rules and focus on that in separate laws , such as no-bid contracts , nepotism and campaign finance limits . <p> " You 've certainly given us a lot to think about , " Reynolds said . <p> Morganelli employs seven county detectives , who investigate complaints of wrongdoing by elected officials , police and other public servants . And citizens can file their own criminal complaint , which his office will prosecute if they are legitimate , he said . <p> He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he used during the ethics investigation of former Bethlehem Councilwoman Karen Dolan , who resigned as a result of the probe into her ties to the environmental center she led at Illick 's Mil . <p> When investigating local officials , Morganelli said his office weighs whether it was a technical violation or done for financial gain -- and that is when they prosecute . <p> He noted that the FBI , the state attorney general and state auditor general are all watching as well . He pointed to the corruption investigation in Allentown as an example . <p> And then there 's the existing state ethics act , which he characterized as comprehensive and carrying various penalties . He pointed to the Bonusgate scandal in Harrisburg in which Democrats gave staffer bonuses for campaign work and the prosecution of Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams as signs that it works . <p> " So it does have teeth in it and it has an ethics commission that can make findings and referrals , " Morganelli said . <p> Council Vice President Adam Waldron asked if he thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working , " Morganelli said . <p> Negron said she appreciated Morganelli 's feedback and liked his suggestion to incorporate the state ethics law into the ordinance , but noted even members of the commission think it could go further . She emphasized her proposal was a draft . 
 <p> On Wednesday , she was reunited with the prized , possession -- thanks to persistence and no small measure of sympathy on the part of a Phillipsburg police officer and staff at St. Luke 's Hospital in Phillipsburg , its trash hauler and Covanta Energy Corp . <p> " They found it and I almost wanted to drop to my knees crying , " she said . <p> It was an employee named Steve Acierno at the Covanta trash-to-energy plant in Oxford Township who finally pulled the necklace from some 15 tons worth of trash bags searched Wednesday morning . <p> " We all picked through it by hand , " said Herman Love , Covanta facility manager . " We spent about two hours searching through it to find what she had lost . <p> " She was super-excited to have it back . Just a great start to our day . We were all really happy for her . " <p> Sam LaRochelle had been taken unconscious to St. Luke 's on Saturday night due to a medical condition . She never takes the necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black T-shirt they cut off her . <p> One of the pendants is an impression , in 14-karat gold , of LaRochelle 's mother 's thumbprint . Shirley Ann Teeter died in 2011 . The other is an image of Jesus Christ that Teeter had bought for LaRochelle 's grandfather , Charles S. Teeter . Upon his death in 1983 , the icon was returned to his daughter , who passed it along to LaRochelle . The chain was made just for her by Audrey , Sam 's partner of 23 years . <p> The old chain Sam wore used to snag her hair . <p> " It 's been longer than we 've been together that it 's been on my neck , " Sam said of the pendants together . <p> At St. Luke 's , the necklace went into a cup , a lid went onto the cup and the cup with the T-shirt ended up in the trash . <p> That should have never happened , St. Luke 's University Health Network said in a statement : <p> " St. Luke 's is pleased that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's staff and others . We have processes in place to ensure the safekeeping of our patients ' belongings . In this case , we regret that during the patient 's visit we inadvertently misplaced her necklace . We are reviewing our processes and will learn from this experience to ensure something like this does not happen again . " <p> No one might have ever known the necklace had been trashed were it not for Phillipsburg police officer Steven Fielding . <p> On Monday , Fielding watched St. Luke 's surveillance footage from the nine hours Sam was hospitalized , and he noticed items taken from her room and thrown into a trash can by a central desk . <p> That was enough for Sam . <p> On Monday night , she went to the hospital and took down the name of the trash hauler : Harmony Township-based Sanico Inc . An employee there put Sam in touch with Marsha James , in charge of waste disposal at St. Luke 's , and learned the St. Luke 's trash winds up at Covanta . <p> On Wednesday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incinerator and she followed behind the truck in her car . <p> Audrey at first insisted Sam was crazy to try to find the necklace . <p> " You 're really going to dig through bags and bags of the garbage ? " she asked . <p> Covanta would n't allow Sam to do it herself , but the employees were up for it , Love said . <p> " That 's something that we do , " he said . " We would n't want to expose anybody else to it . " <p> The hospital waste is nonhazardous and complies with the limits on what Covanta can burn , Love said . <p> But that does n't mean it was easy . Wielding pitchforks and other tools , the searchers were toward the end of the bags when Acierno found Sam 's black , cut-up T-shirt and the cup , the necklace peeking out through a dent beneath the lid . <p> Covanta is now three-for-three in about the last six months on finding belongings tossed in the trash and brought in for disposal . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's always at the very end , " Love said . " You never find it at the very beginning . You always find it when you 're ready to give up . " <p> The on Thursday brought lunch and cake to the Covanta crew to thank them for their trouble . 
 <h> In search of the highest-quality trout streams in Pa . <p> Pennsylvania has about 86,000 miles of flowing waters , and a state program has been working to determine which are home to wild trout populations . <p> In 2010 , the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission launched the Unassessed Waters Initiative , which involves state officials , conservation groups and citizens attempting to study the rivers , streams and creeks statewide that support wild trout . <p> So far , more than 3,000 streams totaling over 21,000 miles have been surveyed by the fish and boat commission . <p> Streams with large numbers of wild trout are a sign of excellent water quality , according to Trout Unlimited Mid-Atlantic Policy Director David Kinney . They 're also popular with anglers . <p> Trout Unlimited is a national conservation group that has been helping the state survey streams . <p> " The water has to be exceptionally clean for there to be a naturally producing population of trout , " Kinney said . <p> The waters receive different classifications based on the size and number of trout counted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Class A trout waters -- those that support a significant population of naturally produced trout -- receive special protections from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection during permitting processes . Nearby wetlands and associated tributaries also are eligible for increased protections . <p> " Whatever work you do around that water , you need to make sure that water remains to be high quality , " Kinney said . <p> Trout are measured and counted by using a method called electrofishing . A surveyor will typically go into a stream wearing a backpack containing a 40-pound battery- or gas-powered generator connected to a large " wand . " The wand emits a low voltage current in the water , which stuns and immobilizes the fish so they can be more easily collected and counted . <p> The fish are then released back into the water . <p> While wild brown trout and even rarer wild rainbow trout populations have been found , 95 percent of the wild population counted are wild brook trout , according to a state report . <p> Northampton County currently has 14 stream sections considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to 16 of the same designation . One designated section of Monocacy Creek runs through both counties . <p> Next month , the fish and boat commission will consider designating an unnamed tributary of the Little Bushkill Creek as a wild trout water . <p> Terry Kleintop , who is on the Plainfield Township Planning Commission , Environmental Advisory Council and is a Bushkill Stream Conservancy member , said the wild trout designation for the tributary that runs through Plainfield Township would be a good thing . <p> " The program could be a benefit to many municipalities so they can see what is going on in their streams , " Kleintop said . <p> Here 's a rundown of the Lehigh Valley stream sections given Class A designation : <p> NORTHAMPTON Creek from Tatamy 's southern border to a private bridge off Route 2019 ; Bushkill Creek from the dam at Binney &amp; Smith to the 13th Street bridge in Easton ; Frys Run ; Martins Creek from its headwaters to the Bangor sewage treatment plant ; Martins Creek from the dam 0.6 km upstream from intersection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Monocacy Creek from the Route 987 bridge to the Route 248 bridge ; Monocacy Creek from the upstream boundary of Gertrude Fox Conservation Area to Illick 's Mill dam ; Monocacy Creek from the Illick 's Mill dam to the Schoenersville Road bridge ; Nancy Run ; Saucon Creek ; Unnamed tributary to the Delaware River ; Unnamed tributary to the Lehigh Canal ; Unnamed tributary to the Lehigh River ; Waltz Creek 
 <p> The attraction has a different name and an updated design , but Resort promises the thrill 's still going to be the same as it was when children of the ' 80s and ' 90s rode it . <p> The Poconos resort in Tannersville has brought back the Alpine Slide . For those who remember , the slide put riders on a wheeled sled and sent them soaring down a curvy concrete track meant to mimic the experience of bobsledding . It opened in 1977 as one of Camelback 's early efforts to transform itself from a winter ski resort into a year-round destination . The Alpine Slide closed in 2003 . <p> On Saturday , Camelback is debuting The Pocono Pipeline , which the resort is billing as a modern take on the Alpine Slide with enhancements aimed at providing today 's riders with a more exciting and safer experience than the riders of yesteryear . <p> At least a dozen ski resorts and amusement parks operated similar rides decades ago , but many closed in part because of safety issues . Camelback successfully defended a 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Alpine Slide that seriously injured a rider , The Pocono Record previously reported . <p> Camelback in a news release says the Pocono Pipeline design emphasizes safety first . Gone is the concrete track . The new " non-abrasive fiberglass track offers a smooth surface that heightens the sensations of speed and improves control over the older , poured concrete models , " the release says . <p> There will be two tracks , each running 2,800 feet through mountain dips , high G turns and tunnels . Like the Alpine Slide , riders will still go down the track in a wheeled car that they can control by a hand brake , but " a patented speed restrictor increases guest safety without negatively impacting rider enjoyment , " according to the news release . <p> This photo provided by Camelback Resort shows a young rider enjoying the Pocono Pipeline , a new ride that is opening to the public on June 24 , 2017 . It 's inspired by the resort 's Alpine Slide of 1980s and 1990s fame . ( Courtesy photo ) <p> " Recent advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and rider experience over the original version , " Camelback co-owner Ken Ellis says in a statement . <p> Fellow co-owner Arthur Berry III says nostalgia will play a role in drawing riders . <p> " The Alpine Slide has real sentiment among those guests who grew up coming to the Pocono Mountains and Camelback Resort , " he says . <p> The new Pocono Pipeline is priced at $10 per rider , but can also be bundled with other attractions at the resort . Those include the 4,000-foot Soaring Camel Zip-Flyer , the 4,500-foot steel track Appalachian Express Mountain Coaster and obstacle adventure courses .

 <p> A New is accused of stealing the identity of a New Jersey woman and ringing up more than $3,100 worth of goods at stores across the Lehigh Valley . <p> Charged is Yulonda Ruth Bowens , 22 , of Brooklyn . <p> Palmer Township police on March 30 received information from the Evesham Township Police Department in New Jersey about possible identity theft and credit card fraud that needed to be referred to Pennsylvania police departments for prosecution . Bowens allegedly rang up $3,117 in purchases on three stolen credit cards . <p> The timeline of the Lehigh Valley incidents , according to police , included : <p> On Feb. 13 , the Evesham Police Department received a report from Susan Thorton of New Jersey , claiming purchases were made at Kohl 's in Lower Nazareth Township and Dick 's Sporting Goods in Bethlehem Township she never made . Bowens gained a Kohl 's credit account using Thorton 's maiden name and made purchases with it on Feb. 7 . <p> An additional account using Thorton 's name was then opened by Bowens at Home Depot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A township detective later gained a description of Bowens through store surveillance photos at the Home Depot .

 <h> Pa. school districts worry bill puts millions of dollars in jeopardy <p> On Wednesday , the state House passed an amended version of a bill aimed at curtailing the ability of local taxing bodies to appeal under-assessed properties . <p> The original version of the bill had Pennsylvania school leaders worried they stood to lose millions of dollars , causing the Pennsylvania School Boards Association to come out against it . <p> The amendment brought forward by Rep. Kate Harper , R-Montgomery , means that the restrictions would only apply to homes and farms , preserving local government 's ability to file reverse tax appeals against large commercial properties . <p> So , if you bought a home for more than its property assessment , you do n't have to worry about moving in and getting a tax appeal filed by your local school district or municipality . But if you buy an apartment complex , spruce it up and rent them all out that may be another story . <p> The Harper amendment passed in a vote of , causing state Rep. Steve Samuelson , D-Northampton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals to be able to generate $10,000 or more of increased revenue for a local government . <p> " The approach Rep. Harper took basically accomplished the same thing , " Samuelson said Wednesday afternoon . <p> But then the supporters of the original bill filed a motion to reconsider , putting it on hold , Samuelson explained . A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate , but is still in committee , he said . <p> " They could try to do that vote over again , " Samuelson said of the House bill . " They 'd have to have about 11 people change their minds . " <p> State Rep. Warren Kampf , , is the main sponsor of the original proposed bill . It bars local governments from filing assessment appeals based on the sale of a property ; a financing or refinancing ; or investments to improve safety or that are required by fair housing or disability regulations or laws . <p> Taxing bodies could only file appeals during county wide reassessments ; when land is subdivided or when there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kampf wrote in a memo in support of the bill that many school districts file " spot appeals " to boost the bottom line of their budget . <p> " If one of those commercial properties is paying less than their fair share than the average homeowner is paying more than their fair share , " Samuelson said . <p> If Kampf 's measure is enacted , his district stands to lose out on millions of new tax payments on pending appeals , he said . <p> " This is a way of evening out the playing field , " Roy said of the reverse appeals . <p> Filing reverse municipal tax appeals has already netted Roy 's district $1 million a year in new revenue . And the district is now negotiating several tax assessment settlements expected to bring in the district $3 million to $4 million a year . <p> On Monday night , the school board authorized the filing of a slew of more commercial appeals . The district only files an appeal if it believes a property is underpaying its real estate taxes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School officials support both the Harper and Samuelson amendments , because they preserve local government 's ability to file reverse appeals while protecting homeowners , Roy said . <p> If Kampf 's bill was enacted and , for example , the Martin Tower property is redeveloped or sold , Bethlehem would be stuck with the property 's current assessment , which has been dropped through appeals filed by its owners . <p> Some of the settlements are for $35,000 to $45,000 a year , but some have been $200,000 , Roy said . <p> " It tells you how under assessed some of these properties are , " Roy said . " To take the tools away from the district puts the burden on the ( residential ) taxpayers . " <p> Roy said that large commercial property owners , particularly apartment complex owners , have been lobbying for years to get such a bill passed . <p> " It is pure interest group politics , " he said . <p> Several speakers on the floor Wednesday noted that the House is awaiting a September report from a commission studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because the amendment passed , it does n't mean the original bill is dead . <p> A bill in a similar situation lost by four votes last week and passed Wednesday with three , he said . <p> " They did the same maneuver , " Samuelson said . <p> The Lehigh Valley delegation voted as follows on the Harper Amendment :

 <h> New hybrid private school is the 1st of its kind in the Lehigh Valley <p> A new private school opening this fall is the first of its kind in the region . <p> Providence Hybrid Academy merges homeschooling with two days of teacher instruction at the new academy located at Christ Lutheran Church on Easton Road , on the border of Lower Saucon Township and Bethlehem . <p> " It is kind of geared to families that would consider homeschooling , but for one reason or another might want extra support , " said school co-founder Angie Wakeman , a former Liberty High School English teacher . <p> The idea for the academy was born out of conversations between Wakeman and a friend about how none of the region 's school options fit their families . <p> In her research , Wakeman stumbled on the idea of hybrid schools , a model popular in other states . There are few in Pennsylvania and none in the Lehigh Valley , she said . <p> " It meets people halfway , " said Wakeman , of Fountain Hill . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The academy is starting small this fall with a goal of enrolling 20 students in kindergarten through second grade . Organizers hope to be able to hire two teachers . Tuition is $2,300 a year . <p> In the eyes of the state , the academy is not officially a school , but rather a support program for families who homeschool their children . So , it does not require Pennsylvania Department of Education approval , Wakeman said . <p> The academy is rooted in a non-denominational faith-based program . Families that join the school will commit to using the school 's curriculum , which is inspired by the teaching philosophies of the Charlotte Mason method . Wakeman noted there are some parallels to the Waldorf method of teaching . <p> " She is really big on **27;103;TOOLONG practices , keeping lessons short for kids , like 15 to 20 minutes , " Wakeman explained . " She believes in the power of children 's observations and what they can bring to the subject . " <p> The curriculum will cover a broad range of subjects , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students will spend an hour outside each day exploring nature , no matter the weather . <p> School co-founder Rebecca Foley , of Coopersburg , introduced Wakeman to Mason , who believed that a child is a person and the whole person should be educated . <p> " It 's a holistic system of understanding the kid and how they learn , " said Foley , who has a master 's degree in educational leadership . <p> Foley said she has been a fan of Mason 's philosophies since she was a teenager . In a Mason lesson on the Civil War , instead of just testing students after a lesson , the teacher would ask students to share what they had learned , Foley explained . With students narrating what they learned , teachers can see what resonated and any gaps in their knowledge . <p> The church building offers the perfect amount of indoor and outdoor space to implement the Mason method , organizers said . Wakeman is excited about getting the students outdoors because she feels the traditional school day ties kids to their desks for too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid to be able to move and it is good for their souls , " she said . <p> Foley is relishing the idea of getting to play a major role in her kids learning , while not being their primary school teacher . <p> She thinks the hybrid model is a perfect balance for her family after experiencing how nicely her daughter 's preschool worked for her family . It afforded the mom of three a break and her daughter benefited from the lessons and socialization . <p> At home , Foley got to help her daughter learn at her own pace , teaching her to read at age 4 . Those lessons only lasted about 20 minutes . The rest of the the time was reserved for her daughter to play , she said . 
 <h> New slogan touts the City of Easton 's independence <p> Easton City Council adopted the city 's new tagline at Wednesday 's meeting . <p> The phrase " Independent at Heart " will appear on promotional materials for the city . The tagline was selected over the runner-up , " A revolution in the making . " <p> The tagline was developed through Easton firm Kudu Creative , which was tasked with designing a new city logo and formulating a city marketing campaign . <p> Council voted 5-2 in favor of " Independent at Heart " with Mayor Sal Panto Jr . and councilman Roger Ruggles voting against the phrase . They felt the city should scrap both choices and go with Ruggles ' alternative , " Discover the Independent Spirit . " <p> Kudu presented three " brand ideas " for the city : independence , confluence and creativity . City council adopted " independence , " which then led to a discussion about 15 tagline that was whittled down to the final two .

 <h> Do n't regulate Airbnbs out of business Editorial <p> Communities such as Easton and Bethlehem should resist the urge to overtax , over-regulate and potentially kill Airbnb rentals . <p> It 's a good sign that visitors to the Lehigh Valley are signing up for short-term lodging provided by property owners , which can vary from a long-term house rental to a weekend bedroom to an overnight stay . It 's a reflection of a healthy tourism and visitor economy . <p> But that 's not to say Airbnbs should n't be taxed or regulated . Far from it . <p> Complaints about Airbnb come from several quarters -- notably hoteliers and bed-and-breakfast owners who say in-home rentals allow hosts and customers to avoid paying hotel , sales and business privilege taxes . <p> What about the neighbors ? In some places , weekend rentals lead to loud parties . On-street parking can dry up with more vehicles per dwelling . <p> Homeowners have a reasonable expectation that their residential blocks wo n't " go commercial " without having a say through planning and zoning hearings . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentals can reduce the availability of apartments . <p> Some cities have reacted by banning Airbnbs outright . That 's an overreaction . Bethlehem has n't gone that far , but city officials ordered the owners of home in a historic district to cease Airbnb bookings while the city tries to sort things out . <p> Easton is on alert , too . Panto has asked the planning director and chief codes officer to investigate to see what other municipalities are doing and make recommendations to city council . <p> This much seems certain : Just as Uber and Lyft changed the landscape of taxi service , Airbnb is tapping into popular demand and ease of online access . It 's here to stay , in one form or another . <p> Uniform tax collection is a start . Municipalities will need registries to keep up with regulation , and that might depend on state laws still in the formation stages . <p> The New Jersey Legislature , for example , is entertaining two bills -- one that would subject to state sales tax , along with hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own fees . Another bill would prohibit rentals of fewer than 30 days and let municipalities ban Airbnbs outright . Reasonable local control is needed ; prohibitions are short-sighted . <p> In Pennsylvania , Airbnb is paying the 6 percent hotel occupancy tax . It should also pay county and municipal hotel taxes , and fees that apply to similar businesses . <p> A balance must be struck . State legislators should give towns the go-ahead to regulate , but not stifle , a grassroots industry that shows a lot of promise . Cities such as Bethlehem and Easton should look to integrate new laws into their codes and ordinances with an eye to create a fair business climate and keep the peace on residential blocks . 
 <p> A mother of two might have missed out on the opportunity to have her children and watch them grow had it not been for Planned Parenthood . In her early 20s , a routine pap smear at the clinic turned up an early , treatable cervical cancer . <p> One of the biggest issues plaguing the area is the high rate of STIs . According to the report , there was a spike in newly diagnosed chlamydia infections between 2009 and 2012 - with Northampton County going from 169 to 287 and Lehigh County going from 333 to 441 . <p> The percentage of women who are receiving mammography screenings has also decreased from 2012 to 2015 . In Northampton County , there was a slight decline from 69 to 66 . Lehigh County experienced a larger dip , however , going from 66 to 61.3 . <p> It 's important to note , as the report points out , that these numbers coincide with a change in screening guidelines which now recommend less frequent screenings . <p> Pennsylvania also has significantly more pregnant women with late or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . In the U.S. , 17.35 percent of mothers have late or no prenatal care . In Pennsylvania , that percentage spikes to 26.79 . <p> Supporters and patients of Planned Parenthood take part in a " Pink the Night Out " rally at City Hall , which is part of a nationwide series of actions in support of the organization and in opposition to the health care proposal , in Los Angeles , CA on June 21 , 2017 . File photo <p> Planned Parenthood Keystone CEO Melissa Reed said the organization provides these services to 90,000 across the state . <p> Of those 90,000 patients , at least one third rely on Medicaid -- meaning they would have difficulty finding other affordable places to get their care if Planned Parenthood was n't around , she said . <p> In 24 percent of Pennsylvania counties , Planned Parenthood served the majority of patients receiving publicly funded family planning in 2010 . Although Planned Parenthood health centers comprised 15 percent of Pennsylvania 's safety net centers that offered family planning care in 2010 , they served 38 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest misconceptions is that community health centers can absorb the patients , Reed said . In Pennsylvania , there are four counties that do n't even have federally qualified health centers . There are n't enough other providers to account for all the patients who would need new care , she said . <p> Planned Parenthoods across the country have been -- and will continue to be -- shut down as a result of proposed legislation from the Trump administration . <p> Although the government does not directly fund the nonprofit , they are reimbursed for preventative services such as STI/STD testing and treatment , well visits , birth control and cancer screenings . <p> Opponents of Planned Parenthood often say taxpayers should not have to pay for services that they do n't believe in , such as abortions . <p> But none of the federal funding goes toward abortions , Reed said , which is another widespread misconception . <p> However , those rallying to defund the organization still attest to the fact that by receiving funding for other services , Planned Parenthood has more of their own funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP repeal of the Affordable Care Act , the goal to " defund " Planned Parenthood would prevent the clinic from providing services to at least 60 percent of its patients -- specifically those who use public programs like Medicaid and Title X. Although an earlier bill never got a vote , the new Senate bill would also defund Planned Parenthood for a year . <p> " In Indiana -- when Mike Pence was Governor -- he defunded Planned Parenthood ( in Scott County ) . The county experienced an HIV epidemic soon afterward . That 's the real-world impact that we face when we lose access to STI screenings , " she said . " It 's vital that people have early detection and education on safe sex . " <p> Planned Parenthood is doing everything it can to stay open , but it need the public 's help , Reed said . She emphasized the importance of those in support attending rallies , calling their congressmen and writing letters to their senators . <p> They can also sign up to be a Planned Parenthood defender , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever there is a need for phone calls or a rally in the area . <p> Senate Republicans are now torn on " defunding " Planned Parenthood in their bill . <p> In the meantime , the organization will continue its fight to keep clinics open . <p> " We 're doing everything we can to make sure our doors stay open , " Reed said , reiterating that their goal is to defeat the Republican 's new health-care bill . " If unsuccessful , we will litigate . Our patients deserve nothing less . They rely on us. "

 <h> Surprisingly , Game of Thrones fans in Pa. connect with this house , but why ? <p> Do the " Game of Thrones " lovers of Pennsylvania side with the Stark family ? Or do their alliances lie with the Lannisters ? <p> Turns out , the answer is neither -- at least based on search results . <p> Decluttr.com put together a map portraying which house was searched for most often in each state from the popular show , which released the first episode of its highly anticipated seventh season on July 16 . The results were based on Google Search data , according to the site . <p> The results show that Pennsylvania -- along with two other states -- searched most often for House Tyrell . <p> Do these results represent the popularity of the family among Pennsylvanians ? Or perhaps some loyalty to the flower sigil ? <p> Jared Blumberg , manager and co-owner of Portal Comics &amp; Gaming in Bethlehem , fell in with the Pennsylvania masses . <p> " Personally , it 's my favorite house , " Blumberg said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ended with a huge event involving the ( Tyrell ) house and many of the major figures were wiped out . People might be looking to see who survived last season . " <p> Another explanation could be geography and climate . The Tyrells live in the south where it 's warmer . This might be something that appeals to Pennsylvanians , he said . <p> " Maybe because Pennsylvania people really seem to hate the winter , " Blumberg said with a laugh . <p> Emily Russo , 21 , of Bethlehem , had a similar thought . <p> " Perhaps ( the Tyrells ) words ' Growing Strong ' resonate with PA 's residents , who are surrounded by farmland in many areas of the state , " Russo speculated . <p> " The Stark family was searched in other parts of the northeast , which makes sense as they are -- or were -- some of the main characters of the series , and perhaps the cold northern winter did n't appeal to those who live in Pennsylvania as much as it resonates with residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it could simply be that Pennsylvanians admire the attitudes and tricks of the Tyrell family . Although conniving , they plot in order to ensure their own survival , Blumberg said . So they remain pretty well-liked . <p> Russo made a similar observation , saying that the temperament of the major characters in the family might resonate with Pennsylvanians . <p> " Maybe ( the Tyrells ) represent hope for the good guys playing by the bad guy 's rules , " Blumberg said .

 <p> While other high school students spend their summer at the beach or by the pool , rising senior Jaspreet Kaur spends four to five days a week inside St. Luke 's Hospital in Warren County . <p> The 17-year-old received the Presidential Volunteer Service Award in May from the Easton Area School District . She accumulated 720 volunteer hours at the hospital over two years . <p> Ever since she was in fifth grade , Kaur knew she wanted to be a cardiovascular surgeon . Her passion began when she saw her grandfather struggling with heart problems and her fascination grew stronger with every medical book she read . <p> " Since I want to be a doctor , I really wanted to volunteer in a hospital because I believed it would help shape my future career , " Kaur said . <p> She works at the information desk , interacts with patients and helps with labs . <p> Once she started volunteering , she loved it too much to stop .

 <p> McConnell did not describe precisely what version of the GOP legislation senators would be voting on , though No. 2 House GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas said later that Republicans would discuss that at a private lunch before the vote . <p> Meeting with reporters Monday in Chester County , Toomey said he expected to learn sometime during the afternoon whether the measure up for a vote is the Senate 's proposal health-care overhaul or a repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act with no immediate alternative . <p> As of 8 p.m .

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said various versions of the legislation would mean more than 20 million Americans would become uninsured by 2026 . <p> But Trump focused many of his remarks on GOP senators .

( AP Photo For lehighvalleylive.com ) <p> Toomey said he does n't view this week as the Senate 's last chance to reform health care " because it 's too important . <p> " The Obamacare exchanges are collapsing , the individual market has failed , Pennsylvanians have seen their premiums go up by over 130 percent since 2013 , 40 percent of Pennsylvanians have a grand total of one choice in the individual market , " the senator from Lehigh County said . " People have lost the health-care plans they wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's likely to accelerate in its downward spiral , so we ca n't just ignore it and walk away from it . That 's part of why it 's so important that we take that first step . " <p> Toomey acknowledged one of the sticking points of the Senate proposal is the change in funding for Medicaid 's expansion under Obama . <p> Medicaid covers nearly 2.9 million Pennsylvanians , or almost one in four residents . Pennsylvania also is a Medicaid expansion state , and the bills ' contemplation of paring back the 2010 law 's commitments is anticipated to shift billions of dollars in health care costs to the state . <p> When the president talks about " letting " the #ACA fail , what he 's really doing is undermining it in an attempt to make it fail . **26;127;TOOLONG <p> Gov . Tom Wolf has voiced strong opposition to the Medicaid shift , but Toomey said continuing to provide the expanded Medicaid coverage should be a state decision . <p> " It 's up to Gov . Wolf . if he wants to disallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that . If he could persuade the Legislature to do so , also , " he said . " But the federal government is going to continue to allow this new category of people to qualify for Medicaid , the federal government will gradually transition from paying 90 percent to paying in Pennsylvania 's case 52 percent of it . <p> " So I know Gov . Wolf likes this expansion when it costs him 10 cents on the dollar to buy it . If he does n't think it 's worth it at 48 cents on the dollar , which is the most it would ever cost Pennsylvania , then he 's free to make the decision to discontinue it . But that would be his decision . " <p> Toomey called Obamacare with expanded Medicaid unsustainable , and noted he has n't seen a better proposal than the one he helped draft . <p> At least a dozen Republican senators have publicly opposed or criticized the legislation , more than enough to kill it . That 's forced McConnell to step back twice from anticipated votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderates and conservatives . <p> Toomey said he sees his role this week in Washington as helping to shore up votes for the replacement . <p> " There 's a few colleagues that I think are genuinely undecided and I might be able to play a constructive role , " he said . " But you know , there 's 100 senators and each one got elected in his or her own election in their own states , and they 'll reach their own decisions . This has been something that has been very , very debated and litigated . So it 's hard to change minds . I 'm not going to speculate on that . "

" We are all connected with your light and you are divine . " <p> A little deep for a fun musical night out , sure , but it was sincere and it helped shape the 2 hour and 15 minute set of songs that Santana brought with them to christen the first of the nightly headlining acts to take the Sands Steel Stage over the next 10 days . <p> The songs were really what it was all about .

In a strange way , by the time they got to " Smooth , " the monster hit off 1999 's 15-times platinum album " Supernatural , " it kind of snuck up on everyone . There was a bit of a delayed reaction from the crowd before it reached it 's peak on that one . <p> " Smooth " could very well go down as Santana 's most-enduring recording .
