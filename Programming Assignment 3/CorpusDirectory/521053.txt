It is non-rust but only the pole is aluminium , the baskets are plastic and so are the clips to fix it to the pole . Once fixed these are almost impossible to remove or adjust , the plastic can easily break , so get your positioning right first time . The poles are fixed in sections and you have to choose the right combination to get the height you want in order to get enough tension on the spring to keep everything in place . Like the baskets , once the poles are pushed together they can be very difficult to pull apart . Once it 's up it looks quite nice , but I would not overload the shelves as the weight is all carried by the small fixing at the back of the triangular shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having said all that I bought another one after the Wenko cracked because I ca n't find anything better and I do n't want to drill the wall .
