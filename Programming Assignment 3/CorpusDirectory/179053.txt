It 's complex in that it features state of the art technology such as a 2.4 GHz signal . In contrast , the AX-3 is simple in that it 's intended for use by users of all experience levels . Its operation is designed to be easy to understand . <p> Steering Wheel The use and function of this component is pretty obvious , but what many people fail to realize and take advantage of is that the steering wheel and associated radio system provides fully proportional control " just like a real vehicle . Unlike typical RC toys , when you turn the AX-3 's steering wheel a little the model 's wheels turn a little . Even drivers who realize the controls are proportional tend to forget once the transmitter is in their hands . One of the keys to becoming a skilled RC driver is taking advantage of the proportional controls . <p> Throttle Trigger Like the steering control , Axial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throttle trigger and the steering wheel is that the later performs more than one function . Squeezing the trigger operates the throttle , but pushing the trigger applies brakes and reverse ( also proportional ) . On the Wraith and SCX10 vehicles equipped with the brushed AE-2 speed control , the default setting is to have full forward , brakes and full reverse . This is fully programmable . The brushless powered EXO Terra Buggy 's default setting is slightly different in that reverse is only activated after a two second delay . <p> Battery Strength Indicator If the battery voltage becomes too low , control can be compromised . Axial Racing 's electronics systems have a built in fail safe , so if you lose signal , your vehicle will not be out of control . If signal is interrupted , the vehicle will coast to a stop as the speed control instantly goes to neutral . Even though the system is engineered for safety , for optimized performance , you should use transmitter batteries with sufficient charge . Full power delivers the best range . <p> Trims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trim is used to adjust the center point of the servos . Steering trim is often used to get the vehicle to track straight with no steering input . These dials should always be set to zero when installing a new servo and/or servo horn or installing a new speed control or recalibrating the speed control . <p> Dual Rate The dual rate dial on the AX-3 is a feature many RTR radios do n't include . Dual rate reduces steering throw . This can be used to keep the servo from straining against the steering system 's physical stops . <p> On the EXO Terra Buggy , dual rate can be useful to tame the steering at high speeds or when traction is limited . New drivers will also benefit from reduced dual rate when driving a fast vehicle such as the EXO Terra Buggy . <p> Binding Make sure the Axial Racing AR-3 receiver is properly installed and an adequately charged batter is in the vehicle .

The competitions range from mild trail runs with gates , to full on " Top Truck Challenge " style events . No matter which style event you are into , there is probably going to be one common obstacle at most of these scale eventswater . As most people know water and electric R/Cs do n't  really mix well together . Most electronic R/Cs can be very sensitive to moisture , let alone splashing water and/or snow . But , with some care and a little preventive maintenance driving your SCX10 in wet conditions can be done with no consequences to your electronics , or your wallet . This article is geared towards keeping your electronics dry , even if you completely submerse your SCX10 in water . There is something about driving scale R/C trucks in water , mud and snow that is unbelievably fun . I cant really put my finger on it , but for some reason it is an absolute blast . So , here are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local creek , instead of at the work bench replacing ruined electronics . <p> For this article I will use a stock SCX10 TR Honcho , that has been modified to run 2.2 wheels and tires . here 's how it looks before I got started . <p> here 's how it looked after I removed the battery tray . Next I took the cover off the receiver box , then peeled the ESC off the box as well . <p> I started with the receiver and simple LED kit . First , I used a little double stick tape to attach the LED controller to the side of the receiver . With it configured like this I will still be able to put everything back inside the electronics box after the balloon treatment . Make sure your wires are somewhat organized too , and are all on one side of the receiver . The wires will exit the balloon through the opening . <p> Now grab a balloon and stretch the open end up using both hands . <p> While holding the balloon open , use your left over fingers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is how it will look after installing the first balloon . <p> Now we will move onto the ESC . I marked the power switch on the ESC with a Sharpee , so I know where the " on " position is . We will be inserting the ESC inside another balloon , and access to the power switch may no longer be available . I personally would cut the switch off and solder the positive and negative leads together . So when you plug your battery in the ESC kicks on automatically . But , there are ways around that if you do n't  want to solder . <p> To avoid soldering the power switch leads , I just used a Ziptie to ensure the ESC remains on at all times . Depending on how its set-up , you may be able to access the power switch right through the balloon . <p> After prepping the power switch , I used a little double stick tape on it as well , and attached it to the side of the ESC . <p> Here you can see the ESC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stretch the balloon over the ESC just like you did for the receiver . <p> Now grab a second set of hands to help with this next step . Have your second set of hands hold the ballooned electronics at the base of the ESC/receiver and at the end of the balloon . While you grab the neck of the balloon in the center , pull up , and wrap it around itself as many times as you can . <p> Now use a Ziptie to hold the neck of the balloon in its wrapped state . <p> Add a couple more Zipties to either side of the first after , just for piece of mind . Also , we will be installing a second balloon over both the ESC and receiver , so try to keep the first set of Zipties that hold the neck of the balloon close to the actual ESC/receiver . Because the second balloon will be installed over the whole assembly , and you will have to wrap the neck of the second balloon just like you did the first . <p> Now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receiver using the same method . It may seem redundant to wrap the electronics in a second balloon . But , I will gladly spend the extra few minutes and .5 cents it takes to ensure my electronics are 100% safe from moisture . Please keep in mind that you will want to monitor your ESC temps for the first few runs to make sure nothing is going to overheat . If you are geared right , temps should n't be a problem at all . But , if your ESC gets hot under normal driving conditions , you may want to install a smaller pinion on the motor to help eliminate heat . <p> You can see the receiver fits nicely back into the stock location , after I installed the second balloon . <p> Here you can see everything is back together just like the stock set-up . I used double stick tape to re-attach the ESC to the radio box , then added a Ziptie around them both , just to make sure the ESC does n't  go anywhere . <p> Now its time to prep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servo from the axle . <p> Now remove the 4 screws from the bottom of the servo . <p> Remove the top and bottom caps . <p> For this step we will use some dielectric grease to stop water from entering the servo through the hole in the top cap . <p> Add some of the dielectric grease around the servos splined output shaft , on top of the bushing/bearing . <p> I also added a little more dielectric grease to the gears just to re-lube them . <p> Then reassemble the servo , you should see the grease starting to push out around the servos output shaft . Now reinstall the servo on the front axle . <p> For an extra measure of protection you can dip the whole servo in Plasti-Dip . Its a liquid rubber compound that will coat the outside of the servo , and help stop water from penetrating the working internals . While no one here at the Axial headquarters has used this method , or can endorse the use of this product . There are video tutorials on YouTube that show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind if you plan on submersing your SCX10 in water deeper then the center of your headlights , you should install a high quality snorkel first . <p> One last thing we should mention is that running your SCX10 in water will rust anything that is steel on your truck . Bearings , steel gears , axles shafts , etc will all develop rust if exposed to water . Proper maintenance will be required to keep rust down to a minimum . <h> 71 Comments : <p> Josh McClain Posted on 2011-02-09 15:49:34 <p> Flat out awesome I 've wanted to do this since I bought my SCX10 and you 've made it seem easier than I was planning on . <p> Thanks guys . <p> Ryan Gerrish Posted on 2011-02-13 09:05:35 <p> Great writeup Bender ! There 's nothing quite as fun as plowing through mud and water .

For example all of MaxAmps lipo batteries are 100% waterproof . You will have to check with the manufacturer to see for sure if you are running something else . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:05:47 <p> Not sure of an actual degree reading , but you should be able to touch the ESC at any time with your bare hand . Usually they get very warm to the touch . But , if you cant leave your finger on the heat sink for more then a second or two , it is running too hot . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:07:38 <p> Spraying your rig down with WD-40 can help stop rust from taking over after you have run in the water . Usually , I just blow the truck off with an air hose , or rinse it with a garden hose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little WD-40 to keep the rust at bay . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:08:49 <p> Not exactly sure what you are asking . Installing the ESC in a balloon will not harm it , as long as it does n't  overheat . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:10:09 <p> I would check with Novak on the motor , I have never had one of them in water . For batteries , the MaxAmps lipos are all waterproof . Just depends on the manufacturer . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:11:00 <p> Thanks Ryan , I learned from the best in the northwest . lol ! <p> Todd Posted on 2011-03-21 15:24:22 <p> Just wanted to let you know that i myself used the plastidip spray on my stering servo and on my reciever and i used liquid electrical tape on all the electronics and i have and i have submersed my honcho several times the stuff works great . <p> sicsrt4 Posted on 2011-03-23 15:41:58 <p> Another thing you can try is taking the axles apart and filling them with marine grade grease , it will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep dirt out , do n't  want to sand blast them gears . <p> Brian Posted on 2011-03-29 13:34:56 <p> hello axial ! ive got my trail honcho assembled and was wondering what motor/ esc i should get for my rig . i plan on driving it mostly in water no deeper than the center of the wheels , and drive it up and down steep rugged mixed terrain . <p> Chase Posted on 2011-04-08 12:24:11 <p> Hey I was wondering how the dielectric grease seals the servo . Because it seems like water would seep into the cracks/openings on the bottom &amp; top of the servo . So would that mean plasti-dip would be better ? Lol . Just wonder . Well anyway thanks for the very detailed instructions . I have been longing to find a good way to do it and now I did . THANKS ( : <p> Shawn Posted on 2011-04-10 07:38:25 <p> Wont this overheat the ESC ? <p> Bender Posted on 2011-04-11 07:14:48 <p> I personally run a Tekin FXR ESC , and a 45t motor in my Honcho . It has great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail runs . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-04-11 07:16:02 <p> Most servos have an o-ring that seals the seams of the servo case . I used grease on the top cap because that is the most likely spot that water will be able to enter into the servo case . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-04-11 07:18:07 <p> It shouldnt . If you are geared too tall , and have a lot of top speed , the ESC may get hot . But , for general scale bashing your ESC should never get too hot to touch , especially if you are geared right . <p> Steven Posted on 2011-04-17 03:42:12 <p> Well what happens if the ESC get hot and melts the baloon ? <p> tanner Posted on 2011-04-24 11:40:50 <p> very cool guys . i 'm planing on buying a scx10 trail honcho and i will most sertainly be doin this to mine . thanx guys <p> Bender Posted on 2011-04-25 07:41:24 <p> The ESC shouldnt get hot enough to melt the balloons , if it does then the vehicle is geared too high .

Most people cut the switch off and solder the leads together , to eliminate the switch . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-05-31 08:12:23 <p> It shouldnt , most crawlers do n't  generate very much heat , unless the gearing is way off . Stock set-us will be fine with this mod . <p> Rich Posted on 2011-06-16 10:08:13 <p> How long with this waterpoofing last ? Will I have to replace the balloons ever ? <p> Bender Posted on 2011-06-28 06:52:55 <p> It should last a while , as long as the balloon is n't exposed to moving parts . <p> Adeak Posted on 2011-06-30 06:15:58 <p> So , the stock motor runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you using ? <p> Bender Posted on 2011-07-01 09:16:17 <p> Correct , the stock motor will be fine running in water . Dirty/sandy water will decrease the life of your motor though , without proper maintenance . <p> I run MaxAmps batteries , which are all waterproof . I run 3s 1800mah packs in my Honcho . <p> Andy Fern Posted on 2011-07-22 04:16:06 <p> What sort of maintenance do you need for the motor ?

And everything is going fine . here 's a glimpse at the result . Many thanks . <p> The pinion and spur gear on the transmission . Going to a smaller pinion gear , or a bigger spur gear will help cool things off if your current set-up gets too hot . <p> dayne500 Posted on 2011-10-18 17:33:12 <p> OK , If I put 2.2 tires on it will I have to change the gears or anything else ? If I waterproof everything like you said to my stock scx10 will it run hot or have any other problems ? <p> Bender Posted on 2011-10-19 07:30:25 <p> If the gearing is stock , I would switch to a smaller pinion . The Honcho comes stock with a 20t pinion , dropping down to a 14-15t pinion will help offset the extra height of your 2.2 tires and wheels . After the gear change you should be ok to waterproof . Just monitor your temps while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of driving . If the motor or ESC is really hot to the touch , gear it down some more . <p> dayne500 Posted on 2011-10-21 17:11:46 <p> OK where can I buy those gears ? <p> Bender Posted on 2011-10-24 07:38:13 <p> here 's a link to the small pinions we make , anyone that carries Axial products can get them for you . <p> Will this work good for the wraith rtr as well ?

It will work , even with submersion but only for so long . The wires can allow water to travel inside the insulation and right through your balloon or liquid tape . Use potting ( also called encapsulating ) epoxy , create a mold and seal your electronics . Its permanent and voids warranties , but so does water damage . This is how RC manufacturers waterproof electronics , look at any waterproof ESC from a major RC company ( I wo n't mention competitors names on here ) you will find it has been encapsulated with epoxy . <p> ryan Posted on 2013-01-21 05:35:15 <p> hey bender i hink your team should tell axial to make all their electronics waterproof stock we 've all been waiting for it so why not do it for us ? <p> Bud Posted on 2013-01-23 02:05:18 <p> First off I 'm impressed to see how many times you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question and was polite each time lol , my question is I took off all the wheels and packed the bearings with grease lubricated all the joints with bearing grease on the driveshafts .. Will that help keep the water out of the joints and bearings also how should I proof the transmission thanks <p> Bender Posted on 2013-01-23 16:34:32 <p> Packing gears and bearings with grease will help keep water out . The grease in the transmission will help keep water at bay too . But , you could always pack some extra grease in there , for a little added protection . <p> Brad Posted on 2013-01-27 18:16:40 <p> What about waterproofing the stock axles . <p> Hamlisch Brown Posted on 2013-02-01 00:35:44 <p> I came up with the idea of putting some drainage holes in the reciever box , works good so it does n't  get all mouldy and Bad .

@@36018793 @5018793/ <h> Gearing for Speed <p> The Yeti , Yeti XL and EXO Terra Buggy all have one thing in common . All three are built to be able to go fast , and the thing about speed is you always want more . Many factors contribute to how fast a vehicle goes . The main factors include , but are not limited to , the motor , battery , and gearing . While upgrading the motor and battery are common ways to increase speed , gearing also makes a big difference but does so at a fraction of the cost of other modifications . The other thing to know is gearing changes are often needed- when making the previously mentioned motor and battery changes . <p> Gearing is primarily influenced by what are often called the primary gears , which are the pinion and spur . The pinion is the small gear that attaches directly to the motors output shaft . <p> The spur gear is much larger and is spun by the moving spur gear . The pinion gear is most often metal and spur gears are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available in the radio control hobby . As such plastic pinions are available , but should never be used for Axial vehicles . Metal spur gears are available and are , in fact stock , on both the kit and RTR Yeti XL vehicles . <p> The most common question after purchasing an RC vehicle is " how do I make it faster ? " As previously mentioned , motors and batteries make a big difference , but gearing is a significant part . The key part is installing a larger tooth count pinion gear will make a vehicle faster . It will also decrease runtime and increase the heat in components such as the motor , speed control and even battery . Installing a smaller tooth-count spur gear will provide the same results . Again , bigger pinion , more speed . Smaller spur , more speed . Speed comes at the expense of more heat and excessive heat will ruin components . <p> When installing a new motor , gearing has to be addressed . The stock gearing has been optimized for the stock motor and expected battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be addressed . Often , a smaller pinion is needed to keep temperatures in check . If a battery change is made from NiMH to a 2-cell LiPo or further to a 3-cell LiPo , a significant gearing change may be needed . Often the best high performance setup is a high voltage battery with a mild motor and gearing . <p> In the end , what most people are confused about is how changing gearing impacts speed . The bottom line is a larger pinion gear will make your Axial vehicle faster . A smaller spur gear will have the same effect .

@@36018801 @5018801/ <h> Axle and Suspension Designs Explained <p> Axial Racing vehicles are patterned after full-size off-road vehicles , and at Axial , scale realism is more than skin deep . That means that Axial 's RC models are more than just realistic bodies on top of universal or generic platforms . The SCX10 , for example , features solid axles and a linked suspension . The EXO Terra Buggy , on the other hand , has what is called independent suspension , front and rear . The Yeti has independent front suspension and a solid rear axle . In addition to axle types , there are different suspension types found on the same axle designs . Here are the basics of axle and suspension designs and what they are generally best for . <p> Solid Axle <p> The solid axle gets its name from the solid axle housing that goes from one side to the other , not the axle shafts inside . The internal axle shafts are n't actually a single solid piece going all the way across . Inside the housing , there is an axle shaft on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with Axial axles . Axial 's design is extremely similar to a real solid axle . The AX10 , SCX10 and Wraith all feature solid axles front and rear . The SCX10 features a narrower axle design ; the Wraith platform and the current AX10 feature Axial 's wider AR60 axle that is the RC equivalent of a full floating 1-ton design . <p> Often the terms live axle and solid axle are used interchangeably . Most solid axles are live axles , but they are n't the same thing . A live axle is any axle that is powered and not free rolling . When rock crawling , the solid axle is often the preferred design . In addition to the durability solid axles are known for , they also do n't lose ground clearance as a tire is pushed up during suspension articulation . The easiest way to visualize this to grab a pen or pencil and imagine it is a solid axle . Tilt one end up and over an obstacle and you can see how by driving tires up and over obstacles makes maintaining ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why it 's often best to place tires on rocks in the trail instead of trying to straddle them . <p> Independent Suspension <p> Independent suspension means the two opposing sides work independently from each other . If the right front tire hits a bump , the left front tire is not impacted . When speed is involved , the independent suspension is a better choice as it provides a much smoother ride . Keep in mind that when a tire on an independent setup encounters an obstacle , the tire and suspension components travel up , but the vehicle typically does n't . This allows the vehicle to go over rough terrain at a fast rate and remain stable . Picture all of the wheels moving up and down independently as a truck races across a desert terrain . The downside is when traversing rocks , the center section of the chassis will stay low to the ground as the tires move up and over rocks . Many full-size trucks have independent front suspensions ( IFS ) paired with a solid rear axle . This used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard for the majority of factory trucks . There are many SUVs that have front and rear independent suspensions . <p> 3-link <p> A solid axle can be attached to the frame or chassis of the vehicle in a number of ways . Probably the oldest and simplest way is via a leaf spring setup . Vehicles that are engineered for better ride quality and articulation ( suspension movement ) now use coil springs . Using coil springs , however , requires the axle to be held in proper position ( and still articulate or move ) . This is done via links . There are a variety of link setups . A 3-link setup , as the name implies , uses three links to connect the axle to the chassis . Take the SCX10 , for example , the front suspension setup has two bottom links and a single upper Y-shaped link . Since the upper Y-shaped link attaches to the axle at one spot , this is called a traditional three link setup . To add a degree of confusion , the name a suspension design gets is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is because some suspension designs , even in R/C , will have a pan hard bar ( or track bar ) that helps locate the axle under the vehicle and keeps the axle housing from moving from side to side . So , someone may say they have a 3-link setup with a pan hard bar . This is a total of four links . It 's worth noting that a link design that is properly triangulated will not need a pan hard bar . <p> 4-link <p> The Wraith uses a traditional triangulated 4-link suspension design . A close look reveals that at the axle the lower links are mounted far apart and then closer together at the chassis . The opposite is the case for the upper links , which have an even more pronounced triangulation . This design properly positions the axle , allows for plenty of articulation and is very strong . The previously mentioned Wraith has a 4-link setup front and rear . Depending of the particular version , you are most likely to find a 4-link rear suspension on the SCX10 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current AX10 platform , Ridgecrest and Deadbolt , use 4-links front and rear . The XR10 competition crawler also uses a 4-link design front and rear . 
@@36018802 @5018802/ <h> RC Support Equipment How to Complete Your Axial RTR or Kit <p> One of the most significant differences between RC toys and hobby-grade products like Axial Racings line of vehicles is that the latter are modular in design and function . All of the components in a hobby-grade RC vehicle are separate units . A single circuit board does n't  control all functions and you are n't  limited to a slow wall charger . This goes for the transmitter , battery and other items as well . Being able to select these items means you have to choose which ones you want . Below are the typical components needed to complete Axial RTRs and kits . <p> RTRs ( Ready to Runs ) Axial Racing RTR vehicles are not only pre-essembled , but include many high quality components are ready installed . Below are the few items needed to get your Axial RTR ready for adventure . <p> Fast Charger . A fast charger or peak detection charger differs from a " wall charger " in that it can charge at a higher rate . These means less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different models offer different features ) , so they can charge many different size and type batteries . If you are using a LiPo battery , you must only use a charger that is LiPo compatible with a selectable LiPo mode . A balance charger is also highly recommended for LiPo use . <p> Battery . There are many battery chemistries , but the two most common in RC are now NiMH and LiPo . NiMH are generally less expensive and require less understanding of the battery charging and care process , but there many advantages . The higher the capacity , the more runtime the battery will provide . Think of capacity as the size of the gas tank . <p> If your vehicle is equipped with Axial AE-2 ESC , limit your battery choice to 6-cell NiMH or 2S LiPo . You will also need a battery with a Tamiya connector . <p> If your vehicle has an Axial AE-3 ESC , you can run an 8-cell NiMH or 3S LiPo battery , and the battery will need to have a Deans Ultra Plug . <p> Kits Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electronics choices up to the end user . This is good for more advanced users who have specific needs . To learn more about building a kit , click here . <p> Fast Charger . See description above . If you do n't  already have a charger or are looking to upgrade at the same time as outfitting a kit , choose a charger that you are not likely to quickly outgrow . Typically , experienced users look for chargers that can deliver enough power to charge large packs quickly , so consider a charger that can charge at 10 amps or more . <p> Battery . See description above . While NiMH packs fit some budgets better than LiPo packs , one of the best ways to maximum performance of your Axial kit is to use a LiPo battery . To learn more about LiPo batteries and the advantages they offer , click here . <p> Speed Control ( ESC ) . The speed control electronically regulates the speed of the vehicle . Some ESCs are waterproof , so look for that feature if it is needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AE-3 brushless speed control is a high quality component and an excellent choice for high speed applications . Its also very versatile and can be programmed to control brushed motors . This means it can be used for a fast machine such as the EXO Terra Buggy as a sensorless brushless setup or in SCX10 as a brushed system . Fast and fun or slow and precise , its your choice . Learn more about motors below . <p> Motor . Electric motors used in RC are either brushed or brushless in design . Axial offers both , and each design type has its advantages . Brushed motors are inexpensive and offer precise low-speed control . Do n't  think that brushed motors are only for small budgets . Many competitors , even at the highest levels , use brushed motors . If you want precise control for technical situations , go with a brushed motor . The cost savings is just an added bonus . Axial offers 55- and 27- and 20-turn brushed motors . The fewer number of turns , the faster the motor will be . That speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brushless motors bring new technology to RC . For vehicles such as the EXO Terra Buggy , a sensorless brushless system really brings out the fun . Brushless motors such as Axials Vanguard 2900 Kv also require very little maintenance . When shopping for a brushless motor , its important to know the the higher the Kv number , the faster the motor will be . <p> Radio System ( Transmitter and Receiver ) . The transmitter , in the most basic sense , function as your steering wheel and gas and brake pedals . Whether you call it a radio or a transmitter , this is how you control your model . Axials AX-3 transmitter uses 2.4GHz technology which means you do n't  need to worry about potential interference from other RC transmitters . The receiver , as the name implies , receives signals from the transmitter . The electronic speed control and servo ( see below ) plug into the receiver . <p> Servo . A servo is a simple device that turns the electronic signal ( your command ) from the receiver ( which originated at transmitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function . In the case of Axial vehicles , the function needed is steering . Advanced hobbyists use servos for all sorts of functions such as moving the steering wheel and rotating a driver figures head . Servos are rated on two significant performance characteristics : speed and torque . Generally , rock crawlers and scale vehicles require torque over speed , but you should never compromise too much on speed or performance will suffer . For fast vehicles like the EXO Terra Buggy , servo speed is even more important . When building a kit or upgrading a RTR , a metal gear servo is always recommended for durability . For the ultimate in steering durability , install one of Axials metal servo horns . <p> Paint . Lexan bodies require special paint specifically made to bond to the flexible material . Make sure you only use this type of paint . If only a one color paint job is desired , one can of spray paint is usually adequate . While it would take an entire post to cover all aspects of painting , the process is simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light coats . <p> Glue . Unless your Axial model is equipped with beadlock wheels , you will need hobby-specific CA glue to bond the tires to the wheels . Ordinary " super glues " will not work for this application . Duratrax Pit Tech brand in medium thickness is easy to work with , strong and inexpensive .

@@36018805 @5018805/ <h> Understanding and Maximizing the AE-5 ESC <p> Wouldnt it be great if ease of use did n't  mean a sacrifice in sophistication and performance ? When it comes to electronics , there is often an unfortunate connection there . Axial purposely made the AE-5 ESC an exception . It is waterproofa huge plusand features two must have adjustments : LiPo cutoff and drag brake . An addition plus is that the AE-5 retails for only $45 . <p> The AE-5 is a brushed motor electronic speed control , or ESC . It can only control brushed motors . While intended for crawling applications mainly , it is not limited to high-turn motors . When paired with a 2S LiPo battery , it can handle as much as a 12-turn motor . On 3S , 18-turn is the maximum . Note that the lower the number of turns , the more amps a motor draws and the faster it is . Vehicles built for climbing and crawling generally need more torque or power than speed and go with higher turn motors such as Axials 55-turn motor ( AX24007 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3S LiPo batteries . It can also be used with NiMH batteries . Its worth noting that the AE-5 can handle up to a 9-cell NiMH ( 10.8 volts ) . Since NiMH packs are heavier than LiPo , if this was matched with the above mentioned 55-turn motor , the truck it was installed in would be a very capable puller . <p> We have all heard that water and electronics do n't  mix , so the fact that the AE-5 is waterproof from the factory is an obviously huge benefit . This feature will allow you to tackle a wide variety of terrain and obstacles with confidence . Always make sure the rest of your electronics ( and the vehicle ) are well protected . You can learn more about waterproofing in this post . <p> The LiPo cutoff feature allows you to safely run LiPo cells . LiPo batteries absolutely must be run in this mode . This feature can also be switch to NiMH to allow maximum power out of those cells . This is n't new to Axial ESCs , but what is new is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a series of steps performed via the transmitter or a computer , the AE-5 is adjusted via simple plugs , called jumpers . It literally takes seconds and is just about foolproof . To switch from the default LiPo mode , remove the plug and move it over slightly and reinstall . It couldnt be easier . <p> While correctly matching a setting for the type of battery you are using is pretty straightforward , the drag brake feature might be a little bit more enigmatic . Drag brake is the opposite of coasting . If you have no drag brake , when you went to neutral ( no throttle or brake inout via the transmitters trigger ) , the vehicle would coast or free roll and slow to a stop . Drag brake automatically applies braking force at neutral . When rock crawling , this is essential for control on hills and around gates or technical sections where precision is required . Without drag brakes , a crawler would be next to impossible to control at slow speeds . It would roll on hills , off ledges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakes as the default setting . There is an optional 50% drag brake setting on the AE-5 . This is just as easy to adjust as the LiPo setting . Just move the plug and the setting is changed . So , if drag brakes are so good , why would you want only 50% strength ? High speed applications such as rock racing will benefit from lower strength drag brakes . Lower strength drake brakes will allow to coast through turns faster . A far more noticeable difference will be when jumping . This is because drag brakes in the air will cause the nose of the vehicle to drop . Review this post on jumping to better understand this concept . So , if you 're rock racing and may encounter jumps , try reducing the drag brakes setting to 50% . And since rock racing is more about speed than finesse , you wont have to worry about precise control around gates or on hills .

@@36018813 @5018813/ <h> Axial Tire Guide <p> There 's a reason why tires are the number one modification full-size off-road vehicle owners make . While the reason most people change tires is for a better look , tires have a profound impact on performance . In the world of RC , it 's no different . In fact , nothing delivers more bang for your buck performance improvement than new tires . Whether you want pure performance or scale replicas or tires that offer the best of both worlds , Axial Racing has you covered . <p> Size There are two primary tire sizes for rock crawlers and scale vehicles . These are 1.9 and 2.2 . In both cases , the numerical value refers to the size of the wheel the tires are designed to fit . More specifically the 1.9 or 2.2 refers to the diameter of the wheel and , of course , the corresponding inner diameter of the tire . While the difference sounds small , 2.2 tires are generally larger in overall size than most 1.9 tires . Vehicles like the SCX10 platform come equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alterations . Since the body posts on the SCX10 are adjustable , it 's like having a built-in body lift . The shocks are also adjustable , so fitting larger tires is pretty easy . You can go the opposite way with the Ridgecrest and Wraith vehicles that come with 2.2 tires , but more substantial modifications are needed to achieve a scale look . The tires will bolt right on , but will look out of proportion . In addition to the 1.9 and 2.2 tires described above , Axial offers a 2.2/3.0 sized tire designed to fit the EXO Terra Buggy . The 2.2/30 is the industry standard short course tire and wheel size . Since Axial is committed to scale , the officially licensed Hankook Dynapro MT tires come in a 34 mm wide front version and a wider 41 mm rear version . <p> The other aspect of size , other than the size classification it fits into that was described above , is its dimensions " height ( diameter ) and width . Just like real tires , the RC versions come in different sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can increase the contact patch ( part of the tire that actually touches/grips the ground ) , bigger is n't always better . Big changes in tire size will require setup in suspension and body mounting . Big tires place more wear and tear on steering and drivetrain components . Your motor , battery and speed control have to work much harder to cope with bigger heavier tires . Changes in gearing may also be in order . Click here to see for a post on gearing for larger tires . <p> Tread Axial offers fully licensed tires with treads just like the full-size tires they are meticulously modeled after and RC-only treads . The ideal tread for you is determined by the terrain you expect you 'll encounter the most . Treads with large voids between the lugs work best in mud and loose dirt . Conversely , tires with smaller voids between lugs handle better than other tires on pavement or other high speed applications. - Directional tires work exceptionally well when combined vehicles with good wheel speed as the design of the tread allows the tire to sling mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directional tires want to pull a vehicle forward . Mounted backwards , the directional tire will want to dig down , so only mount them in the intended direction if unless you 're running only on solid rock . <p> Compound The material the tire is molded in is called the compound . Some rubber compounds are firm and long last and some are soft and pliable . Axial offers its tires in two compounds . The softer and stickier compound is called R35 ( white dot ) . While a softer compound will wear out faster , it will grip better on most terrain . <p> Foam Inserts Axial tires come with standard foam inserts that last a long time and provide consistent , predictable performance on a variety of terrain . If you run your Axial vehicle on dirt , rocks , sand , pavement , etc. , standard foam may be the ideal choice . If you are running exclusively on rocks or are competing , you may want to consider memory foam inserts . Memory foam is heavier ( denser too ) and conforms to rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foam and memory foam . <p> Additional Features There are a lot of subtle traits found in Axial tires . Tires with interior ribbing along the sidewall ( on the inside ) offer more support without sacrificing the overall flexibility of the tire .

Many Axial Racing tires feature siping , thin slits in the tread , just like the real tires they are modeled after . <p> 1.9 Ripsaw While not a licensed scale replica , the Ripsaw tire is still a very realistic tire and suitable for use on any scale vehicle .

@@36018817 @5018817/ <h> Pick the Right Battery Charger <p> A charger is one of the most important purchases you can make . As such , picking the right charger takes careful consideration . Price is important , but ca n't be the only deciding factor . <p> Chemistry/Compatibility There are charges that can charge a variety of battery chemestries , but the two most critical for use in RC are LiPo and NiMH . LiPo packs are currently the most popular and high performance technology . NiMH packs are older and heavier technology , but are less expensive . Both chemestries are still widely used , so it is recommended that you select a charger that can charge both chemestries . It is essential that you only use the specific mode for the battery type you wish to charge . A LiPo pack must only be charged in LiPo modeno exceptions . Also , confirm that the charger uses the CC/CV style of charging for LiPo . CC/CV means the charger charges at a constant current , say 5 amps , until a nearly fully charged voltage level is reached and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CC/CV is the only charging method Axial recommends for LiPo packs . Same for NiMH . Even if you do n't  own any LiPo packs , it is recommended that you purchase a LiPo capatable charger , so that you do n't  have to purchase another charger when you do upgrade packs . Many people start off with NiMH packs to save money , but spend more money in the long run when they have to purchase a second charger . NiMH chargers do not command a strong resell value . It is also recommended that only a balance charger is used and that the pack ( regardless of chemestry ) is charged in a charging pouch . <p> Power Source Chargers can be powered by either AC ( house current ) , DC ( 12V battery or outlet ) or both ( AC/DC ) . Obviously , the latter is the most versatile , but is often bulkier and more expensive . While there are a few AC-only chargers , most are either DC-only or AC/DC . DC-only chargers can be powered at home via a 12-volt power supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bench or RC work area . The main advantages of DC-only chargers is that they tend to be compact and are less expensive . The specifications of the power supply correlate to the charge rate specifications of the charger ( see below ) . <p> Screens Not all chargers have LED screens , but if your budget allows , a screen is highly recommended . The larger the screen the better as it allows for far more clear display of information with fewer cryptic abbreviations for data . Backlit screens are n't  essential , but make outdoor viewing especially better . Backlit displays are generally easier to read in all lighting conditions , but if you only plan to use your charger in a darker basement or garage type work area , it is a feature you could live without if need be . <p> Rates Charge rate refers to the amperage ( amps ) , a measurement of electrical current , a charger can deliver to a battery . The higher the amps , the less time it takes to charge . You can not simply charge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be charged at 5 amps or less . LiPo packs are recommended to be charged at 1C or 2C and to always be charged in balance mode with the battery in a charging bag/sack for safety . 1C is one times the battery 's capacity , which would equal 5 amps for a common 5000 mAh battery pack , 4 amps for a 4000 mAh pack , 3.2 amps for a 3200 mAh pack , etc. 2C is two times the capacity , and thus , a 10 amp charge rate for a 5000 mAh pack . <p> Knowing what size batteries you plan to charge most often will make picking the right charger much easier . The key ( and sometimes harder information to find ) is understanding how much power ( watts ) a charger 's power supply can deliver . This is especially important if you have an Axial Yeti , EXO Terra Buggy or an SCX10 equipped with the 3S-capable AE-5 speed control and you 're using , or plan to use , 3S LiPo packs , which are 11.1 volt packs and require significantly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same rate used for a 2S ( 7.4V ) pack . If a charger does n't have enough power ( watts ) it wo n't be able to charge at the amperage level you want . This really is n't a significant concern if you 're charging a few LiPo packs for a day 's worth of rock crawling , but if you are rock racing your Yeti and need to charge a 3S pack between rounds , it can be critical . If you have a charger with a 50W built-in power supply , it wo n't be able to charge a 3S 5000 mAh LiPo pack at 5 amps . To calculate how many watts are needed , multiply the charge rate by the pack 's voltage . In the 3S 5000 mAh example , the equation is 5 amps multiplied by 11.1V for a wattage requirement of 55.5 watts ( 5+11.1=55.5 ) . Technically , 11.1 is the nominal voltage and 12.6 is the fully charged voltage , so if 12.6 is used , the maximum wattage requirement is 63 watts .

A great example is replacing the primary gears , the pinion and spur . On Axial Racing vehicles , replacing these gears is extremely easy . Just follow these steps and you 'll be well on your way to mastering an essential RC skill . <p> Clean It may not be glamorous , but the first step is to get the area your going to be working clean . Axials rock crawlers are equipped with a gear cover that protects the gears and keeps them clean , but you do n't  want to let that debris in when you start the dissasembly . Using either compressed air or brushes ( tooth brush and stiff paintbrush ) , get the entire transmission clean . May special attention to the gear cover and the area around it . A rag with a mild cleaner may also be needed . The bottom line is the cleaner the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gears ( especially the pinion ) in an SCX10 or Ridgecrest without removing the transmission completely , dropping the transmission makes the process much easier . Removing the transmission from the SCX10 platform is easy . Using a 1.5 mm wrench , remove the set screws retaining the drive shafts to the transmission output shafts . Next , use a 2 mm wrench to remove the four screws on the bottom of the skid plate . You also have to unplug the two motor leads . The transmission and motor should now easily come right out . The Wraith is similar , but the entire skid plates needs to be dropped down . This requires only the extra step of removing the four screws on each side of the skid plate . On either Axial Racing platform , the process of removing the transmission only takes a few minutes . <p> Remove the Gear Cover The gear cover is retained by three small screws . It is easy to remove using a 1.5 mm wrench . When the cover is off , wipe it out to make sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  get lost . <p> Replacing the Pinion You will need the 1.5 mm wrench again to remove the pinion . Do not completely remove the small set screw . Just loosen the screw and slide the pinion off of the motors output shaft . If you 're replacing the pinion with the exact same size pinion , you do not technically have to loosen the two 2.5 mm motor mount screws , which adjust the motor position and gear mesh . If you wish to change the pinion size ( tooth count ) , you will need to loosen ( not remove ) , the two 2.5 mm motor mount screws . When installing a pinion there are two adjustments that need attentionpinion depth and gear mesh . Pinion depth is the position of the pinion of the motor shaft . The pinion must be position to have full , even engagement with the spur gear . Simply adjust how far down the pinion is on the motor shaft so that it perfectly matched with the spur . <p> Gear mesh is easy to do yet often done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small piece of paper between the gears while tightening the motor up against the spur . The paper is n't needed as the amount of free play or backlash between the gears can be set by a mix of feel and eye . The gears should n't be too tightfully engagedor too looseonly the tips touching . Whatever method you use to set gear mesh , you need to check the mesh on more than one spot on the spur . Set the mesh and then rotate the spur a few times checking mesh as you go . <p> When you 're done , double check that the motor and pinion screws are properly tightened . Do not over tighten the pinions set screw . <p> Replacing the Spur Gear The first step in removing the spur gear is to remove the 7 mm nut that holds the slipper adjustment spring in place . The 7 mm nut must be removed while the spur gears retaining screws are attached or the spur gear will just spin as you try to grip it to remove the 7 mm nut . With the 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two washers ( the washers are slightly different sizes ) . The spur gear is attached to the slipper mechanism via three 2.5 mm screws . Removing the three screws and then the spur gear is easyjust do n't  lose the small washers on each screw . With the three screws removed , the spur gear will slide off the motors input shaft . <p> When installing a new spur gear make sure it is fully and evenly seated against the mounting plate . Tighten the three 2.5 mm bolts a little at a time . Next , install the larger of the two washers and then the spring over the input shaft . Next , install the smaller washer and tighten down the 7 mm nut . To reiterate , its large washer , spring , small washer and then retaining nut .

While this gearing yields a healthy amount of run time on both 2S and 3S ( perfect for extended outdoor adventures ) , as customers , we are always looking for MORE SPEED . This is likely due to the fact that once people experience just how capable a Yeti Trophy Truck is in the wild , the tendency to want more speed becomes an overwhelming thought . Truth is it can handle more , although more than what Axial offers with regard to available pinion gears . <p> After extensive testing with a variety of battery / pinion / spur gear combinations , we came to the following conclusion for best run time and speed on 2S and 3S :

They were able to get out and find Axial Geocache #3-2012 <p> Hans and family found the Geocache on Nov. 24th on their way back from Tucson , AZ . They decided to make the stop and enlist the use of a friends boat to get them there . Here is what Hans had to say about their adventure . <p> " My wife , daughter and I were headed to Tucson for Thanksgiving with family . We heard about the geocache from Hot Rock Hobbies in Lake Havasu City and figured it was probably gone , so we went to Tucson first . While in Tucson , we kept an eye on the comment board expecting the cache to show as found . When we left Tucson Saturday morning , I checked one more time and still noticed the cache was showing not found . We decided to take a side trip and hunt for the cache before returning home to California . We met up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site . The boat ride was about 20 minutes south of the city and worth every minute of it even if it was a bust . Once we found the right location , we beached the boat and headed for some rock crawling . We scoured the entire area before attempting to climb the rock itself . As I was passing a small outcropping , I looked down and spotted the cache . I called my wife and daughter to come see the site . We began uncovering the end and werent aware of how large the box was until it kept getting bigger . Eventually , we uncovered the entire box and secured the crawler . We then had to climb down the rock to get back to the boat ( almost as hard as getting to the rock , but definitely worth the effort ) .

These are fully licensed replicas of the custom 1 ton axles Currie Enterprises makes for 1:1 rock crawlers and King of the Hammers style vehicles . The 1:1 axles feature a high pinion center differential housing , which helps move your driveshafts up out of harms way . This feature also rotates the differential cover up to help avoid hitting the cover on rocks , and possibly damaging a ring gear . These new Vanquish axle housings have the same features as their 1:1 counter parts , and are fully machined from billet aluminum . Every part in this kit is a work of art . For those that are n't  familiar with my background , I was a machinist for about 15 years before coming to work for Axial . So I really appreciate the effort Vanquish put into these , as it had to be very time consuming . Especially since these housings are compatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure ! The machine work is executed perfectly too , with no sharp edges or burrs to be found on any of the parts . Great quality control is key , and Vanquish has it down ! ! Let 's get started on the conversion ! <p> A shot of the front and rear axles , as well as the link kit for the axle install . <p> We will be performing surgery on my old Dingo which I converted into the new Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon . <p> I started with the rear axle first . A shot of all the components included with the axle kit . <p> I am going to install a few upgrades while I am making the conversion too . First up is a set of HD under drive ring and pinion gears . These gears are made from hardened steel , and are helical cut for strength and durability . <p> Remove the rear axle lockouts , and slide the inner axles out of the housing . I also removed the outer 5x11mm bearings as well . <p> Unbolt the rear axle housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring and pinion gears . <p> Pull the ring and pinion out of the housing and remove the ring gear from the locker assembly . Take care not to rip the gasket between the ring gear and case , as we will need to re-use it . <p> After installing the new ring gear , grab the rear center section of the housing . <p> Slide one of the 5x11mm bearings onto the pinion shaft and insert it into place in the new housing . Then install the second 5x11mm bearing to support the drivesahft side of the pinion gear . <p> Insert the ring gear assembly into the housing next , and install the supplied bearing caps over the bearings . <p> A close-up photo of the bearing caps . Notice they can only be installed one way , the bigger diameter supports the bearings on each side of the ring gear assembly . <p> You will need a set of snap ring pliers to complete this step . They can be found at any hardware or auto parts stores . Keep in mind there are specific tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you get will work . This set of snap ring pliers can pull double duty and works for either style snap ring , which is nice . <p> Compress the snap ring and insert it into place in the end of the axle tube . <p> A shot of the snap ring installed . The ring comes very close to rubbing the axle shaft , but it does clear when fully supported by all bearings . <p> Once both axle shafts and snap rings are in place you can install the drive pins and hexes . <p> Grab some blue thread lock for the next step , which is installing the tubes into the center section . <p> Add a dab of thread lock to the supplied M3 set screws , and insert them per the instructions to temporarily hold the tubes in place . <p> Both axle tubes in place , ready for the next step . <p> Locate the supplied axle truss and hardware . <p> Install the axle truss to locate/time the two axle tubes to the center section . Then , per the instructions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes to the center section . Make sure the tops of the set screws are flush , or just below flush with the center sections outer lip . The screws will go in a little tight , but they will go in . <p> Once the tubes are secured , remove the axle truss , and install the differential cover . Do n't  forget to grease the ring and pinion gears before bolting the differential cover into place . <p> Now re-install the axle truss using blue thread lock . You can also install the link mounts at this time too . <p> Screw the supplied plastic differential skid to the center section of the axle housing . This piece will let the axles slide over obstacles easier than if it was just the aluminum . <p> You will notice there are holes in the axle tubes that are n't  utilized at this time . I installed some small M3 set screws into these holes , with a dab of blue thread lock , to keep debris out of the housings . <p> Now we can install the axle truss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the axle around and install the link mounts next . <p> Attach the center differential skid plate with the supplied screws . <p> Next I installed the servo mount for the steering servo . <p> Locate your front knuckle/axle assemblies . <p> One mod I did have to make was to my aluminum c-hubs . The Axial c-hubs are threaded for use with set screws in the stock plastic housing . But , the Vanquish housing is threaded aluminum too , which just wont work together as the threads will never be timed properly . Keep in mind the stock plastic c-hubs will bolt right up with zero issues . To fix the issue I ran into I drilled the c-hub holes out to an 1/8 ? diameter to clear the M3 screws . You will need to drill the bottom hole out in front and the top hole out in back . You can also drill all four out too without any issues . They will still bolt back up to plastic housings if need be . <p> A shot of the complete front axle . I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these housings .

@@36018844 @5018844/ <h> Understanding Gearing <p> Moving your rig is a pretty simple process ; when you apply throttle from your radio , the ESC draws juice from the battery and directs it to the motor . As the motor spins , it rotates a series of gears that ultimately drives your vehicle forward . <h> CHANGING THE GEARING <p> Let 's say you want to increase the speed or torque of the vehicle ; this can be done by simply changing the gearing . There are two gears that we work with to modify this ; the pinion gear and the spur gear . The pinion gear is attached to the motors output shaft while the spur gear is attached to an output shaft on the transmission . <p> Changing these gears alters the gear ratio ; a higher ratio equals more torque and acceleration but less top speed while a lower ratio equals less torque and a higher top speed . It is also good to note that a lower ratio can also build more heat , so its a good idea to monitor after changing the gearing . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a gear ; the lower the number , the bigger the teeth . For example , most Axial rigs come with 32P ( 32 Pitch ) gears . These gears have large , strong teeth on them , perfect for high-torque applications . Then there 's 48P , a slightly smaller tooth that is a good combination of efficiency and strength . Finally , there 's 64P . These gears find their way into extremely fast onroad cars that are made for speed instead of torque . Its safe to say you 'll never find these delicate gears in a crawing rig ! <h> MOTOR CHANGES <p> If you decide to upgrade your motor from stock to something a little faster , you 'll need to adjust your gearing as well . Gearing is usually calculated for a specific motor ( especially in an RTR ) for a good combination of speed and torque .

This 2.2 Ripsaw offers an aggressive tread design , greater ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The VWS wheels include black aluminum rings , but I swapped those out for our Grey beadlock rings , part number AX08133 , just to match the grey colored suspension links . 
@@36018851 @5018851/ <h> Convert Your AX10 to an SCX10 <p> I decided to see how hard it would be to convert an AX10 to an SCX10 . The transformation was relatively simple by just changing out some hardware here and there . Most of the stock AX10 M3 hardware can be used in the conversion to the more realistic SCX10 chassis . But , you will need to purchase a few screws and some new links depending on the direction you go and the wheelbase you are looking for . You can also make your own links as well . I decided to use Axials new Trail Ranger body ( Part #AX4009 ) for this build which has about an 11 5/8 ? wheelbase . Its important to decide what body you want to use before you get too far into the build . That way you can set your wheelbase and link lengths accordingly . <p> Getting started : First thing I did was assemble the SCX10 frame . Start by bolting all the plastic cross members to one chassis rail then bolt the 2nd chassis rail up after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much weight on the front wheels as possible . This will help when climbing steep obstacles . <p> SCX10 Chassis <p> Optional front battery mount <p> The Tear Down : Start by removing the axles , transmission and links from the AX10 kit . I usually keep a bowl or small parts tray handy to drop all the hardware in as I remove it from the various components . This will help keep your hardware in one place instead of it being scattered around your workbench . <p> Heres what I started with , a fairly bone stock AX10 kit . <p> Transmission : Installing the transmission was the first step in the conversion process . You can use the 2 long stock transmission screws in the holes closest to the right chassis rail , looking at the chassis from the back end . But , you 'll need longer screws for the holes near the center of the skid plate . I used M3X12 screws ( Part #AXA146 ) for this . <p> Rear Axle : In order to maintain a relatively scale look to this build I installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with Axials plastic lockouts ( Part #AX80020 ) . <p> Remove the aluminum hexes , knuckles , outer axles , short tie rods , C hubs , and inner axles . Make sure you take the bearing out of the ends of the axle housing too , these bearings will now be installed into the ends of the plastic lockouts . <p> Now slide the new longer straight axles into the housing making sure the flats of the axles seat properly into the locker . Drop the bearings you removed earlier into the ends of the lockouts , and install the lockouts onto the axle housing . If you try to use the M3X8 screws you removed from the stock C hubs in the lockouts theyll hit the inner straight axles because they are a bit too long . I had to use shorter M3X6 screws ( Part #AXA863 ) to remedy this problem . <p> Front Axle : I decided to go with grey links throughout on this build , instead of the standard Axial green . I picked up the short steering link in grey ( Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey ( Part #AX30516 ) as well . Start by removing the upper 3 link mount from the axle housing , and remove the steering links too if you decide to change them out like I did . <p> Install the old rod ends onto the new steering links , and bolt them back up to the front axle . <p> Lower Links : Now remove all the rod ends from the old lower links . I decided to go with two packages of grey 98mm lower links ( Part #AX30518 ) on this build because the wheelbase on the Trail Ranger body is slightly longer then the stock SCX10 body which uses 91mm lower links . <p> Using the supplied hardware that comes with the SCX10 chassis kit install the lower links to the chassis and axles . Then install the upper links as well . I used the grey 65mm threaded posts ( Part #AXA1430 ) as upper links . I also had to use some small grey 6mm spacers ( Part #AXA1418 ) at the upper 3 link mount on the axle to adjust the pinion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package , the remaining 4 can be used as upper shock mount spacers to move the top of the shocks away from the plastic shock hoops . I used the stock upper 3 link screws that tie the upper links to the chassis in the plastic 3 link connector on the axle side . Because of the extra 6mm spacers used , you 'll need longer screws for that now . <p> Shocks : I grabbed a set of our scale shocks ( Part #AX30090 ) and installed them onto the axles and chassis next , using the 6mm grey spacers on all 4 upper shock mounts . I used M3X18 Binder head screws ( Part #AXA668 ) for the upper shock mounts on the chassis . <p> Tires , wheels and body : I swapped the stock green AX10 rock rings out on the Rockster wheels for the gun metal colored rings ( Part #AX8112 ) . if you are converting an RTR you already have these beadlock rings as standard equipment . Then dropped the body posts into their mounts with the supplied body clips and set the orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a chance to paint another TR body specifically for this build . As you can see the conversion is fairly simple and its an easy way to get a more realistic/scale appearance out of your AX10 . <p> For a more scale appearance you can also go with Axials 1.9 beadlock wheels and Pro-Line 1.9 Flatiron tires. <h> 18 Comments : <p> charlie greenberg Posted on 2009-06-23 13:10:08 <p> it looked wered with the iriginal tiers on . <p> charlie greenberg Posted on 2009-06-23 13:11:30 <p> my spelling stinks i now <p> scott Posted on 2009-10-19 10:45:09 <p> its nice to see what it takes to make a scale looking truck .

I was looking to do a build with the new Proline Jeep Rubicon body . Also when you measure the wheelbase of the body what is the best place to measure it from ? I was thinking center to center of the wheel wells . Thanks <p> Ralph Posted on 2011-03-20 19:25:25 <p> I can use the AX10 RTR stock links ? <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-22 07:37:28 <p> You might be able too , just depends on the wheelbase you want , and if the links clear the chassis . <p> canadian coffin Posted on 2011-08-23 10:44:53 <p> i am deff doin this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to buy new <p> manny Posted on 2012-12-18 03:27:23 <p> it their any way u can put the Honcho ax4025 body on to the stock ax10 Ridgcrest with out changing the frame ? <p> Bender Posted on 2012-12-19 18:19:20 <p> It is n't a direct fit .

@@36018854 @5018854/ <h> Project Wroncho Wraith axles under an SCX10 chassis <p> Ever since I saw the first prototype Wraith axles , I have wanted to bolt them up to an SCX10 frame with a Honcho body for that " full width " one ton axle look . Well , I finally had a chance to try and it , and so far it seems like its going to be a fun vehicle . The extra width of the Wraith axles make this SCX10 extremely stable at speeds , especially when cornering on any high traction surface . The axles should make this SCX10 a great TTC style rig too , because of the extra width/beef of these new axles . I also have a feeling it would do well in G6 style events too . I havent had a chance to take the " Wroncho " off-road yet , but here are a few photos of my set-up . Keep an eye out for action shots and video in the near future . <p> The overall stance .. wheelbase is right at 13 1/2 ? . <p> The suspension set-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve the stance and wheelbase I wanted . I will probably machine new rear lower links to eliminate the extra spacers at the axle . <p> I tried using straight rod ends at first , but the triangulation of the links was too much , and it caused binding . The curved XR10 rod ends are a perfect fit though . <p> For the initial mock-up I ran the link/shock mounts on the axle the standard way they arrive in the RTR Wraith . But , my ride height ended up a little too tall for my liking . So , I flipped the link/shock mounts upside down which lowered the overall height just enough for me . <p> Its tough to see , but in order for the driveshafts to clear the upper links as the suspension cycles , I had to put a slight bend in them front and rear . <p> The rear clearance at full compression of the suspension . <p> The front at full compression . <p> Mandatory flex shot . <p> So far I am really excited about how this build is shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for some action shots and video very soon . <h> 17 Comments : <p> How about a detailed parts list or some where you can find it .

@@36018883 @5018883/ <h> Fitting 2.2 Ripsaw tires on your SCX10 <p> Ever since we posted the sneak peek video of our new 2.2 Ripsaw tires , we 've been getting a lot of questions on fitting 2.2 tires onto our SCX10 line of trucks . Bolting the 2.2 tires and wheels up to the truck is n't all that difficult , but you will have issues with tires rubbing the bumpers and body . A little trim job to the bumpers and body will fix that though , and give your scale truck a little more aggressive look . For this article I am going to use our RTR SCX10 Honcho . I chose the Honcho because it has a little longer wheelbase then the Dingo TR , which will fit the 2.2 tires and wheels better . The Honcho will be the easiest to modify too , because you will only have to modify the front bumper and body . <p> here 's how the Honcho looked before I got started : <p> here 's a few side by side pictures of the two tires : <p> Here you can see this same Honcho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started cutting : <p> Here are a few more photos highlighting the problem areas . Notice the 2.2 tire hitting the body and front bumper way before the suspension bottoms out : <p> First thing we are going to do is remove the front bumper and cut it back so the tires clear it as the suspension cycles . Start by removing the center skid plate from the front bumper : <p> Now remove the lights from the front bumper , and pull it off your truck : <p> After removing the bumper , take the remaining 2 skid plates out of the bumper as well . Here you can see that I will cut along the edge of the bumper in the area highlighted by my hex driver : <p> After I cut the wings off I used an X-acto knife to smooth everything out : <p> Reinstall the bumper , lights and center skid : <p> Here you can see the tires clear the bumper with ease now , even when the suspension cycles : <p> Now , with the body on the chassis , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tires : <p> Next , I laid the cut line out on the body with a black marker , so its easier to visualize the final cut : <p> Cut the body a little less then you think you 'll need , and recheck to see if anything is still rubbing : <p> Here you can see the tire is still hitting the body just a little : <p> This is how it will looks after the final trim is done : <p> Now repeat the last few steps for the other side of the body : <p> And you 're done and ready for fun ! <p> Overall stance after being chopped : <p> While this Honcho may not look as scale as it used to , the capabilities gained will far outweigh the slight loss in scale appearance . <h> 43 Comments : <p> Patrick Posted on 2011-02-24 13:05:14 <p> This looks so awesome .

For better low speed crawling though , you could go to a smaller pinion . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:15:22 <p> They are already out . These wheels are Axials 8 hole beadlock wheels . It still works great with the stock gearing too . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:17:00 <p> Part number is AX12015 , they are available now . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-03-21 14:18:01 <p> I could have moved it forward , but the tires would still hit .

With the motor loose , insert a piece of paper between your spur gear and pinion , then tighten up the gear mesh and snug up the motor screws . 
@@36018887 @5018887/ <h> 1.9 Axial Wraith <p> We know a lot of you own an Axial- Wraith or have come across them at some point . Like any other R/C , we are sure there are things you would like to change , and maybe you already have ! I- personally like to keep it scale and in proportion as best possible . The Axial Wraith is a- beast and just eats up terrain ! But how to make it more scale and add a little challenge to the driving experience ? I am doing a 1.9 version . This will consist of swapping in some Axial SCX10 Axles , cut down Axial WB8 drive shafts , - SCX10 shocks , and some custom links . <p> Your Axial Wraith may look like this , or did at some point and time . Axial AR60 Axles , 2.2 wheels , tires and big bore shocks . <p> One cool thing about the Wraith is you can put all kinds of bodies on it and change the look . I am using the Axial Deadbolt ( AX04039 ) as it fits perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2.2 set up , the wheelbase is off a little too much for this build . Longer wheelbase helps with climbing and performance without a doubt . So I am sacrificing the 2.2 performance for the scale look with the 1.9 swap . <p> Here is the standard 13 1/2 ? - wheel base on the Axial Wraith Kit version ( AX90056 ) , I am sure its the same on RTR ( AX90018 ) . <p> This is a pretty simple and quick change over in my opinion . You should have 4-links and 2-shocks per axle . Do n't  forget to undo your servo ! <p> Starting with the lower links seems to be easily accessible , so I am just starting with these . <p> Next you can move on- to the- upper links , because I am switching to Scx10 shocks I just removed shocks from cage . Now the Axial AR60 axles are complete with shocks and now- ready for your WRONCHO build or something else . You- can re-use the bigger shocks , but because I am after a scale look , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something like this . If you are going to buy a cage , this is all you would really need . The donor parts will be Axial SCX10 axles and shocks . <p> Here you can see difference between the AR60 axles and SCX10 axles ( technically the SCX10 axles are AX10 axles as that is their origin ) . If you really wanted too , you could even use the Axial AR44 axles for even more scale looks . The- only part of this project that is not quick is the custom links . You can use All-Thread from your local DIY store . Cut them to appropriate lengths- and thread them right into the rod ends , I use a Dremel and cut off wheel for this.There is 1/4 ? or 1/8 ? - option . - Plastic drain hose from the landscaping department will slide over the all thread giving it a finished look.There are many ways to make links , Delrin is a popular choices as well . <p> There are a few ways to do this swap . If you dont- want really short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- back- one screw- hole , this will lengthen the fronts and shorten the rears. - Rough diagram pictured below , RED lines show sliding the skid plate back , YELLOW lines are showing you the front links will need to be longer and rears will need to be shorter . <p> I know EVERYONE is wanting to know measurements . So the front lowers are 55.88 millimeters or 2.2 inches . Keep in mind this is not an eye to eye measurement , this is just for the link portion you will have to make . The eye to eye measurement is 3.36 inches or 85.5 millimeters . <p> The rear lowers are 66.36 millimeters or 2.6 inches . Again this is just length of link you need to make , not an eye to eye measurement . The eye to eye measurement is 4.05 inches or 103.6 millimeters . Be sure to use a bent rod end so it moves freely . <p> The upper rear link is 85.14 millimeters eye to eye or 3.35 inches . The type of rod end you choose to use will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link is 82.31 millimeters eye to eye or 3.24 inches . Again the type of rod end you choose to use will affect this length . <p> Once you have upper and lower links installed you can mount up your shocks , it should now be close to an operating 1.9 Wraith . <p> Close , meaning it still needs drivelines , I am a fan of just cutting down the Axial WB8 driveshafts ( AX30794 ) because the are very easy to work with and reliable . If your running big power there is no doubt your blowing through moving parts , these are plastic so take this into consideration in your build . The driveline centers are cut down to 39 millimeters- or 1.5 inches . They need to telescope for suspension movement , but not fall out . Depending on shocks you will need to experiment with this . I use a Dremel and cut off wheel , shaving millimeters at a time . <p> You will need to cut the female ends on both sides of- drivelines as well . The front pictured above is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rear pictured below is longer . If you want more to work with on the front , you can cheat and slide the skid back one hole as I showed earlier . <p> Front and rear drivelines installed and ready to test , do n't  forget to plug your servo in . This build is with servo on axle , you can get creative and do a CMS ( Chassis mounted servo ) if you are up to it . <p> Axial SCX10 axles now under a Wraith cage with SCX10 shocks . <p> When this project started it was AR60 axles and a wheelbase of 13.5 inches . Now with custom links and SCX10 axles , it is now sitting at 11.75 inches . <p> At this point you can mount your body and start all the scale building . <p> At the beginning I mentioned I cut the interior out of a an Axial Deadbolt body ( AX04039 ) , I am now going to use the rear section as part of the build . <p> A little fuel tube and a body reamer is all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in snug , you can use shoe goo or some adhesive of your choosing as insurance to make sure it stays in place . <p> You can add a spare tire , light bar or anything you can dream up at this point . <p> Hopefully this blog has shown you how to create something new to you , or perhaps inspiration for something you wanted to do by mixing and matching Axial parts , cars , and kits to achieve that one-off custom built look . SAVE ALL YOUR PARTS AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN THE BOX ! You never know what you can do until you try , so keep building and coming up with new ways to use parts .

That maybe some of the appeal- for us locals. - Its always nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the terrain . <p> We are on the edge of town , - I should- mention that you will not- see many trees where we are headed . <p> That 's our sign , about 2 minutes after- hitting the edge of town . You will want to make sure you have brought- plenty of water by this point . <p> Ran into Josh Harris , - one of the- RECON G6 crew members . He is far from home ; Arkansas is about 1500 miles away . I- am willing to- bet he does n't  miss the humidity of the south though . <p> This is our path- the rest of the way . A car will easily make it out here , typical washboards and tons of dust . <p> Oh did I mention dust ? - 95% of the time its extremely dry out here . Its always worth the drive- though. - Its under 10 miles from the paved road to our destination . <p> This is our spot , epic rock and more lines than you know what to do with . <p> Very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I imagine a lot of canopies will be up , not much in the way of shade out here . <p> Its the day before the event and I have heard there- are some people already out here . So I have come to check it out . This group had people come out from Canada . <p> Arve and Jens flew in all the way from Norway for this event . <p> Pennsylvania was represented here as well . <p> . <p> Its Friday morning , Worlds 2015 will begin today . It also looks like its going to get pretty warm too . <p> . <p> As people start to gather for the drivers meeting , I am thinking I may go scope out some of the rigs . <p> One of the first things I notice about the 2.2 Shafty class is 99% of them run Axial AR60 axles or the Axial Sxc10 axles . <p> This is an Axial Wraith replica build , built by Charlie , a Las Vegas local . <p> I am seeing some scalers are present . I hope to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am getting anxious to see the scalers out on course . <p> John Rob Holmes has some words for the drivers before turning them loose on the comp courses . <p> After the drivers meeting its time to go out and hit the rocks . The drivers seem very eager to get this event underway . So let 's check out some of the action . <p> The 2.2 Shafty class is- running- on this first day of competition. - If you 're new to the hobby , " shafty " refers to how the axles are driven . In this class , motors put power to the transmission , and that puts power to drivelines that turn the axles . <p> The Axial SCX10 axles- and the AR60 's are 50/50 split for shafty class . <p> California driver Jake Wright out on the rocks navigating- a path through these gates . AR60 's giving this comp rig a nice wide stance . <p> I was able to check out rigs as people set them in line . This ones reppin RECON G6 . <p> As it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool down . <p> Some took out the go fast cars like the Axial Yeti and began making some bombing runs across the desert . <p> Mr. Holmes even got in on the desert runs with his Holmes powered Axial Wraith . <p> Not only did drivers have to concentrate on gates and lines , but also staying hydrated . <p> Looking down the trail I am seeing some Scale trucks heading my way . <p> The lead trucks- body is permanently representing AXIALFEST 2015 . I have heard people are already reserving spots for AXIALFEST 2016 . The super clean SCX10 based Toyota and- older Ford truggy draw you in . <p> Although there- was plenty of sand and a Dingo with- surfboards , there was no water to be found . <p> There were a few breaks on the trail , but it did n't  stop anyone form having a few laughs and a good time on this course . <p> I was really digging this Scx10 based Toyota , check out the axles under this rig . It performed well out on these rocks . The driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its not to be a shelf queen . " <p> The 1.9 Poison Spyder Axial Wraith putting the hammer down through this rock section . <p> There is noticeable difference between a 1.9 and 2.2 Wraith . The 1.9 conversion really seems to be picking up steam among the RC community . <p> That 's some of the action from the scale trail . Nice work Josh Harris on- setting this trail , all those hikes to set trails with Parker and your previous experience came into play here . Day 2 would bring out- the 2.2 Pro class MOA ( motor over axle ) and an unlimited class . <p> Some of you may- know the Axial XR10 body and axles . <p> A pleasant surprise from RCP Crawlers was- a variety of- ice cream on day 2 . When its 104 out , this hits the spot . Thank you- for this ! <p> If you are just getting into scale trucks , you may or may not know about their origin . In short , 2.2 pro class is some insanely placed axial gates on the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time limit . <p> The same can be said for the 2.2 Shafty class . The Unlimited class brought out something I have never seen before- in this type of event and I started crawling in 2007 ! This next rig is in the Unlimited class . <p> This rig has a motor at each wheel , with four wheel steering . Making for insane low COG ( center of gravity ) and with a 3D printed body , its light weight , weighing in at just- 4.3 pounds . <p> These custom gear boxes at each wheel are also 3D printed . <p> So here is the tricky part . The silver screen is actually there for- a purpose . This has a fan that is controlled on command from the drivers remote . Putting out over a pound of thrust , helps this rig stay planted on the rocks . <p> It was nice to meet the- Canada crew who made- the trip out to comp . Congratulations to- Paul Mikolajewski pictured here in the Canadian- flag shirt , for winning the 2.2 Shafty class with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear . Maybe he is onto something . <p> It was a pleasure to meet the Washington guys who made the journey to comp . <p> It was- great- to meet the enthusiastic- Arizona guys who came to play as you can see here . <p> Just a few of Las Vegas locals who came out ; 4 to run comp and everyone came- to scale . These brave souls even camped out , while- a majority stayed in hotels . <p> Congratulations to Matt Wolfe and Jim Rowe of Las Vegas for RECON Ready and Driver of the Day awards .

@@36018895 @5018895/ <h> Axial MAX-D SMT10 Monster Truck Full Option Build <p> Ive been looking forward to getting one of Axial Racings SMT10 Monster Trucks , so when the MAX-D landed on my doorstep ( thanks UPS guy ) , it was literally a matter of seconds before the box was open and the truck was out . I was even more stoked , however , when I found a big ol box of Axials aftermarket goodies included so I could do an upgrade article . <p> Below is a step-by-step guide , walking you through the disassembly and re-assembly of the SMT10 with all of these parts . <p> STEP 1 <p> here 's a overview shot of all the parts I 'll be installing on the MAX-D . A list is included at the end of the article complete with part numbers and links . <p> STEP 2 <p> Ill be splitting the build up into three sections ; front , rear and mid . here 's a pic of the parts I 'll be using for the front end rebuild ; steering parts , upper and lower link plates , link mounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> STEP 3 <p> Since the SMT10 is modular in design , I need to remove anything that will keep the front from coming off easily that being the front tires and servo . Once the servo has been disconnected , you can let it dangle down and under the center transmission . <p> STEP 4 <p> To remove the front clip , simply unscrew at the three attachment points designated by the red arrows . Do this on both sides and the front end will drop right off . Pay close attention to the WB8 center driveshaft coupler ; it fits between the front and center driveshaft sections and , once the front clip is removed , this piece can fall out . <p> The AX31432 Axial AR60 Machined Servo Plate and Mount Set is up next for install , but before you do that , assemble it and attach the servo to it . This ensures the two side upright pieces line up with the servo . I would also suggest using a dab of blue threadlocker on the two screws going up and into the aluminum side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> STEP 7 <p> Remove the stock plastic servo mount and replace with the aluminum assembly from STEP 6 . <p> Before moving on , I suggest paying close attention to the orientation of the steering blocks in relation to the lower link mounts . The upgrade C-hubs I 'll be using have more adjustability than the stock plastic ones , so if you just throw them on and clock the C-hub like the original ( red arrow ) , your caster will be WAY off . So , my suggestion is not to assemble to match the C-hub ( red arrow ) , but to assemble to match the top kingpin screw ( orange line ) . <p> STEP 10 <p> But first , remove the steering system . Four screws will do it . <p> STEP 11 <p> I 'm also going to replace the diff gears while I 'm at this point . Remove the four screws holding on the diff cover and the four screws holding the diff in place . You 'll need to pull the axles out a bit to disengage them from the diff . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock diff gear and replace with the AX30395 Axial Heavy Duty Diff Gear . Make sure the gasket is in place and not still attached to the original diff gear . A keen eye will notice the planetary diff design instead of a locked unit . This type of differential is actually a better fit for Monster Trucks . <p> STEP 13 <p> You 'll need to replace the stock input gear as well ; that can be done on the opposite side of the axle . Replace with the AX30395 Axial Heavy Duty Input Gear , re-install the differential and slide the axles back into the housing . You may need to rotate the axles to key them into the differenial . <p> Ok , now its time for the steering . On one side at a time , pull the plastic parts off , keeping the bearings and hat bushings handy . Re-assemble the the AX30762 Axial XR10 Aluminum C-Hub Carrier and AX31434 Axial AR60 Machined Steering Knuckles . Note the orientation of the parts ; if you get confused , look at the opposite side of the steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I suggest removing only one side at a time ) . <p> STEP 16 <p> The AX31428 Axial AR60 Steering Upgrade Kit comes with a small build sheet in it . Use that to assemble the steering links , then attach them to your steering knuckles . The final assembly should look like this . <p> STEP 17 <p> Using STEP 9 as a guide , slide one C-hub onto the axle and secure . Now slide the other C-hub onto the axle and secure . <p> STEP 18 <p> At first , I thought the shocks were going to be a pain ; replacing oil , bleeding , etc . However , if you complete this step carefully , you wont have to do any of that ! <p> Start by inserting the rubber o-ring into the AX31430 Axial King Shocks Aluminum Collars ; set aside . Grab your shocks and remove the lower spring retainer and spring . Carefully remove the shock cap and set the shock off to the side in some sort of stand . Pull the bladder out of the shock cap ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AX31430 Axial King Shocks Aluminum Cap ; set aside . Grab your shock again and spin the plastic collar off ; it can only be removed from the top . Spin the King Aluminum Collar on followed by the King Aluminum Shock Cap . Install the spring from the bottom and the AX31431 Axial Aluminum Shock Spring Retainer . These retainers utilize a small screw to keep them from popping off in the event of an crash . These are , after all , Monster Trucks there will be plenty of crashing . <p> STEP 19 <p> Re-attach the shocks to the lower links and , wah-lah . Your completed from clip should look like this ! Ai n't  she pretty ? <p> STEP 20 <p> Attach your front end to the chassis ; if you 're unsure , use STEP 4 and the three red arrows to remind you . This is also the time to re-attach the servo and servo horn . Use a dab of blue threadlocker on the four screws that attach the servo to the aluminum mounts to make sure they stay put . <p> STEP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAX-D , installing the parts shown here . The procedure will be pretty much the same as the front end ; the only minor difference will be the lockouts . Be sure to pay attention to the WB8 center driveshaft coupler as well . <p> STEP 22 <p> Remove the rear clip ; STEP 4 and the red arrows will help you out here . You 'll need to remove the anti-roll bar connections that attach at the lower link mount . <p> I replaced the plastic bits with the aluminum upgrades like I did with the front shocks . <p> STEP 28 <p> Boom the rear clip is done ! Your final assembly should look like this . <p> STEP 29 <p> Re-attach the rear clip and connect the anti-roll bar . Since we replaced the plastic link mounts with aluminum , you 'll want to add a small drop of blue threadlocker to help keep the anti-roll bar links in place . <p> STEP 30 <p> Alright on to my favorite portion of the build , the electronics ! Now , this is MAX-D MAXIMUM DESTRUCTION so I 'm going big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mojo ; something Tom Meents would be proud of . Ill be dropping in an AX24260 Axial AE-3 Vanguard Brushless ESC and AX31047 Axial Brushless 3150kV Motor . Since this is a pretty healthy upgrade , I see it only fitting to upgrade a couple other parts as well . <p> STEP 31 <p> To make this part of the build easier , I started by removing the top part of the roll cage and interior . <p> STEP 32 <p> here 's a better look at the ESC tray . Well get to it in a minute . <p> STEP 33 <p> Flip the MAX-D over and remove the four screws that hold the transmission in place . Axial uses two different screw lengths here so to make sure I get them back in the correct holes , I 've added a little L ( for Longer ) . Once the screws are out , unplug the motor and pull the whole transmission assembly out . Its actually alot easier than it looks . <p> Before attaching the spur gear , make sure you attach the AX31068 Axial Slipper Pads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add new ones to our AX31163 Axial Steel Spur Gear 32P 56T . Re-assemble the slipper clutch . I would suggest tightening down the slipper nut quite a bit ; the added power needs a tighter slipper . <p> The only drawback with the AX31047 Axial Brushless 3150kV Motor is the fact that it uses a 5mm output shaft ; the stock motor uses a 3mm . This means you 'll need a new pinion gear . I did n't  want the MAX-D to just have more power , I wanted it to be fast as well , so I 'm starting with a AX30839 13T 32P Pinion Gear . MO POWA ARH ARH ARH <p> STEP 37 <p> Now that I have a new heart for the MAX-D , its time to transplant it back in the truck . Remember to install the screws in the correct holes . <p> STEP 38 <p> Flip the SMT10 back over and remove the top to the receiver box . Carefully pull the stock ESC power lead out of the receiver and remove it from the truck . <p> STEP 39 <p> Apply some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanguard Brushless ESC and attach it to the ESC platform . Route the ESC power lead through the waterproof seal and into the receiver box as shown . Re-attach the receiver box lid . <p> Finally , plug the brushless motor wires into the ESC , matching the A-wire to the A-plug , the B-wire to the B-plug and the C-wire to the C-plug . <p> STEP 40 <p> The final step is to re-attach both the interior and top of the roll cage . Looks super tough just sitting there ! Time to go see what she can do ! 
@@36018899 @5018899/ <h> Yeti SCORE Trophy Truck Full Option Build <p> Whenever I get a new vehicle , I like to take the first couple weeks to just drive it in box-stock form to learn about its traits ; how it handles , any quirky nuances , etc . During this time I also take some time to review any hop ups that might become available , giving me an idea on how my long-term upgrade process is going to play out . Thankfully , the SCORE Trophy Truck shares the same platform as the Yeti Rock Racer , which means that there are a slew of performance goodies already available . Armed with a bag of aluminum bits , I decided it was time to install them prior to getting this rig all dirty . Not only did that make it a lot easier to deal with ( read : no dirt ! ) , it also looks much prettier in pictures . Time for an Axial Yeti SCORE Trophy Truck Full Option Build ! <h> Step 1 <p> Here are the parts I 'll be installing in this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; shocks , gears , machined parts and turnbuckles . A full list of the parts I installed is included at the bottom of this article . <h> Step 2 <p> Since I 'm going to need to remove the center transmission for upgrades , I disconnected the motor wires from the ESC . Pay attention to how the wires connect ; if you have a photographic memory , you 're good to go . If not ( like me ) , you can mark them to keep things straight . I put one silver mark for the A wire , 2 for the B and 3 for the C. <h> Step 3 <p> I 'm going to be working on the front end of the SCORE TT first . I started by removing the top deck support brace . It requires the removal of 10 screws in two different lengths so , to keep things organized , I put them back in the holes after removal . <h> Step 4 <p> Once the top deck support brace has been lifted off , removal of the front clip is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hinge pin screws . I also disconnected the fixed-length steering turnbuckles as well " I 'm replacing them with adjustable ones . <h> Step 5 <p> Separate the gearbox from the shock tower by removing the 4 screws holding them together . I 'm only working with the differential at this time so I set the rest of the front clip assembly aside . Note the orientation of the diff in the gearbox . You 'll want to make sure you re-install it the same way . <h> Step 6 <p> Next , I removed the differential and bevel gear assemblies from the gearbox . I 'm replacing them with the AX30395 Heavy Duty Bevel Gear Set shown in the picture . One thing to notice is that the assemblies have straight cut gears ; this design is pretty strong and easy to machine . The new HD versions are helical cut , or machined with a slight angle in them . These are great for high-torque applications like crawlers or , in this case , hardcore trophy trucks ! To replace , remove the 4 screws on the diff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and re-install the 4 screws . If you 're the tinkering type , you might think about adding some optional fluid to the diff prior to putting it back together ( I did , 1000wt ) . The HD bevel gear is a one-piece unit so replacing the stock part is a simple pull-and-replace operation . One final step I performed was to remove the rubber stops that are installed in each diff outdrive . If you hold the diff on its side , you 'll see them down inside there . These are used to keep the dogbones tight and prevent them from ejecting during a hard crash , however they hinder the up and down suspension movement slightly . Since I 'll be replacing the dogbones with universals , they 're not needed anymore . <h> Step 10 <p> I 'm ditching the stock dogbone setup for a set of Axial 's AX31135 94mm Universal Axle Set . These come as a pair , are pre-assembled and slide right into place . <h> Step 11 <p> I re-assembled the front clip " the new shock tower to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left the shocks off for now since I was replacing them with a full set of Axials Icons . You can also see the aluminum upper shock mounts that are included with the aluminum shock tower . <h> Step 12 <p> For strength and additional tuning , I 'm adding a full set of front adjustable turnbuckles ( AX31249 Yeti Turnbuckle Set ) . This kit includes an excellent build sheet , so assembly is very easy . Just build the turnbuckles to the appropriate lengths and you 're good to go . I would suggest keeping them separate during the build so you do n't mix up the steering links with the camber links ; the two are different . <h> Step 13 <p> Before attaching the front clip back on the TT , I need to do a little work on the transmission . I pulled it from the TT and removed the gear cover , motor , plastic backing plate and plastic motor mount . <h> Step 14 <p> I installed Axial 's AX31156 Machined Adjustable Motor Mount , a 2-piece unit that includes the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaches to the motor . The motor mount part swivels to adjust the gear mesh and uses an upper clamp to keep it securely in place . Because it 's aluminum , this system is SUPER strong and helps pull unwanted heat away from the motor . I re-attached the plastic backing plate followed by the spur gear assembly ( I used Axial 's AX31161 32P 64T Steel Spur Gear and AX31164 Machined Slipper Plates in place of the stock parts ) . These upgrades look awesome and should make the gearbox virtually bulletproof . After I tightened everything up , I went ahead and re-installed the gearbox into the TT . <h> Step 15 <p> Time to get the front back together , so I started by sliding the front clip onto the chassis and securing with the 4 screws from underneath as well as the two hinge pins . I made sure to key the center universal into the outdrive located under the transmission . It 's a little tricky , so I would suggest rotating the transmission gears ( using the back tires ) until you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to key the universal . Next , I slid the front axles through the steering blocks , attaching the wheel hexes to keep them in place . I installed the steering and camber links , making sure to key the axle bones into the outdrives . A little care has to be taken here to make sure the axle bones stay inside the outdrive . <h> Step 16 <p> Now that the front is back on and looking good , it was time to move on to the rear clip and the installation of a lot of performance parts . The first thing I needed to do is separate the rear clip from the rest of the chassis ; front cage screws , rear cage screws and the 4-link mounts . If you did it right , this is what you should be left with . <h> Step 17 <p> My first plan of attack is the rear differential . To extract it , I needed to remove the diff cover , the straight axle hub carriers and the axles ( just pull them out slightly ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diff in place . Note the orientation of the diff gear inside the housing . <h> Step 18 <p> Replacement of the diff gear and bevel gear is the same as the front . Once completed , re-assemble by inserting the diff gear , diff-capture plates and axles ( key and slide back into place ) . I installed the optional AX30789 AR60 OCP Aluminum Straight Axle Hub Carrier . <h> Step 20 <p> I also installed Axial 's AX31245 Lower Link Plate Set . These also bolt right on using existing holes in the plastic links . I would suggest installing and tightening the two end screws while leaving the centermost pair loose . They can be tightened up when you re-install the shocks and anti-roll bar . <h> Step 21 <p> Here is the rear clip assembled with all of the aluminum parts installed . You can see I 've also added the AX31166 Machined Shock Mount Plates , AX30830 AR60 OCP Machined Link Mounts and AX31167 Machined Sway Bar Clamps . The Machined Sway Bar Clamps are a little hard to see , but I 've added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install . When re-attaching the rear clip back to the chassis , add some threadlocker to the screws that secure the aluminum 4-link mounts . This will help prevent the screws from backing out when you 're out having a good time . <h> Step 22 <p> While I loved the look of the King shocks , I could n't pass up installing a full set of Axials Icons . Per the included instructions , I built a set of front and rears and installed them in place of the Kings . I have an additional set of shocks to create a dual-shock setup , but I 'm going to give it a whirl with the single shocks first . The dual-shock install ( and tuning ) will be for a later article . As you can see from the pictures , the aluminum parts look awesome and will provide additional strength as well as give the truck a bit more of a factory ' look .

We also offer just the replacement clear Jeep bodies as well , part number AX04033 . <p> First option we will cover is Axials simple LED kit , part number AX24257 . The simple LED kit comes with 4 white and 2 red LED lights to keep you running long after the sun goes down . I used two small light buckets from Axials Light Bucket Set , part number AX80045 , and attached them to the front bumper mount with long M3 screws . I used Axials LED lens set , part number AX80049 , to cover the LEDs front and rear for a more realistic look . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give users a couple options . Need even more light ? Add our NVS system , part number AX24251 , for the ultimate scale light system . <p> A couple shots of the rear LEDs with the clear lens covers in place . <p> Next option added was our new fully licensed Icon shocks , part number AX30103 . These come standard in the Jeep kit , but are an option part for the RTR . These shocks feature a new and improved CNC machined shock piston for smoother action through the range of travel . The new Icon shocks also feature clear coated polished aluminum bodies , complete with aluminum faux reservoirs . The main body of the shock is threaded for quick ride height adjustments and pre-load tuning ability . Like their full size counterparts these shocks are completely rebuildable , tunable and offer consistent handling all while adding some of that Icon bling to your SCX10G chassis . <p> Axials aluminum link kit , part number AX30550 , for the SCX10G was the next upgrade we added . Upgrade your stock plastic links to high quality aluminum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links which helps your vehicle track straighter in all conditions . This link kit includes aluminum suspension and steering links , as well as all hardware and rod ends required to complete the conversion . <p> A shot of the steering links . If you just want to upgrade your steering links only Axial offers a steering upgrade kit , part number AX30426 , as well . Upgrading your steering links to aluminum with improve steering response in all conditions , especially in hard binds associated with rock crawling . Another option part that can be seen here is Axials HD 25t aluminum servo horn , part number AX30836 . Axials HD aluminum servo horn provides more responsive steering with less chance of stripping the internal splines over the stock plastic servo horn . Clamping style head for secure mounting in high stress applications . Available in 23 , 24 and 25 tooth spline counts . <p> In this photo you can see a handful of upgrades to improve steering performance and increase the strength of the front axle .

Another option part installed here is Axials CVDs , part number AX30464 , for the SCX10G axles . The CVDs provide more steering throw that the stock dog bone set-up which is great for tight , technical trail runs . CVDs also have less slop than the stock set-up for increased efficiency . <p> Moving on to the rear axle we installed our aluminum axle lockouts , part number AX30494 . Axial 's aluminum axle lockouts are more rigid than the stock plastic lockouts , which will allow the vehicle to track better in all situations . <p> Axials HD motor plate was our next upgrade , part number AX30860 . Our heavy duty motor plate is for any vehicle running our AX10 transmission . CNC machined from 4.5mm thick billet aluminum , with integrated heatsink fins to help motors run cooler on those all day expeditions . A must have for any R/C overland adventurist ! Axial also offers 13T , 14T and 15T steel pinion gears and an 80T spur gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from . Add more torque for low speed crawling to your SCX10G by installing Axials 55T motor . Or if more speed is your thing , add Axials 20T motor for higher top speeds . Another option part that we installed here is Axials dig system for the Wraith transmission , part number AX30793 . This conversion also requires use of our Wraith Dig Transmission Case , part number AX80051 . Axials dig system allows you to lock the rear wheels , while powering the front wheels only for a tighter turning radius . Shift servo sold separately . <p> Next option part installed is Axials black 1.9 beadlock wheels . Beadlock wheels allow users to tune foam set-ups and change tires at will for varying terrain and conditions . We also added our 1.9 internal weight rings , part number AX30547 , for some added weight up front which will help us on steep vertical climbs . You can adjust how much weight is in the front wheels by using our 1.9 wheel weight inserts , part number AX30548 . <p> For tires we went with our 1.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully licensed by Maxxis and are molded in Axials sticky R35 compound for the ultimate traction in any conditions .

@@36018914 @5018914/ <h> Suspension 101 Understanding Suspension Links Lengths <p> The Axial Wraith , Ridgecrest , SCX10 and XR10 all use linked suspension designs . This means the axles are attached to the chassis via links , be it a 3- or 4-link setup . The links hold the axles in position and allow for an impressive amount of smooth terrain conquering articulation . Links also allow for a certain amount of setup tuning . <p> Pinion Angle If you have a full-size off-road vehicle such as a Jeep Wrangler , you are probably aware of pinion angle . For those unclear , pinion angle refers , not to the motor 's pinion gear , but to the angle of the input gear in the axle when viewed from the side . The combo of gears in a solid axle is called the ring and pinion , and if the pinion angle is too shallow , the drive shaft can bind . Pinion angle is n't often referred to by an actual measurement or even measured . Sometimes full-size vehicles will be fitted with a tapered shim between the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be measured in degrees such as two or three degrees . Full-size vehicles such as the late-model Jeep Wrangler uses coil springs front and rear with links called control arms . Aftermarket companies offer adjustable control arms that allow the pinion angle to be adjusted . A longer upper link increases pinion angle ( tilts it up ) . <p> Adjusting the length of the upper links on the front axle also changes caster . Caster is the angle of the front axle 's hubs . Again , this is best viewed from the side . Take a look at the C-hub on the end of the axle . This is where the steering pivots . A vertical line can be drawn from the top pivot point on the C down through the bottom pivot point . The top pivot is further back than the lower pivot . This is positive caster . As you lengthen the upper link(s) , the caster angle is decreased . On a rock crawler , too little caster can cause poor steering as the inefficient steering geometry will cause the tire to somewhat push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheelbase The upper links help position the axle and the lower links do the same , but in reverse " longer lower links decrease pinion angle . The lower link length is really properly used to adjust wheelbase . After the desired wheelbase is achieved , pinion angle is adjusted with the correct upper link length . A longer wheelbase will help increase stability when climbing , which is very handy but less maneuverable " longer vehicles need more room to turn . Stretching the wheelbase a small amount is a good adjustment to experiment with , but you definitely do n't want an overly stretched wheelbase combined with negative caster . If you are often attempting a lot of difficult climbs , a longer wheelbase may be in order , but obviously there is a point of diminishing return . Remember to adjust the wheelbase you will need to lengthen both the lower and upper links . Adjust the upper links for proper pinion and caster angles . <p> You can also change weight distribution by lengthening rear links more than the front . This will create more forward weight bias and increase climbing performance .

After doing so , install the 3rd 16mm set screw into the curved rod end . Slide the lower link into the sleeve and thread it onto the 16mm set screw until its tight . Now install the rod ends to both sides of the lower links and install the flange balls . The straight rod ends go on the shock mount side of the links and the curved go on the opposite end . Heres what the finished front lower links look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see all the parts required for one rear lower link . <p> Thread the long 20mm set screw into a curved rod end . Slide the lower link into the link sleeve and install the curved rod end to pinch the sleeve between the rod end and link . Now thread the 16mm set screw into a second curved rod end and install it on the opposite end of the link . Then install the flange balls into the rod ends as required . <p> Time to make the upper links . Here are all the parts required for this step . <p> To install the plastic rod ends into the plastic links I like to run an M3X.5 tap into the ends and links to get the threads started straight . If you do n't  have access to a tap , you can just use one of the 16mm threaded studs and an Allen wrench to start the threads . Then thread the rod ends onto the links , and install the flange balls as needed . Here you can see the finished links ready to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridges . Here you can see all the parts required to make a complete cartridge . <p> First apply a little grease to your cartridge o-rings . Put a dab of grease on your finger and work the grease all over the o-rings before dropping them into your shock cartridges . This will help prevent tearing the o-ring during assembly . <p> Then install the first o-ring into the shock cartridge . <p> Now set the plastic spacer ( part #AX80035 ) into place on top of the first o-ring . <p> Lube up the second o-ring and install it on top of the plastic spacer . <p> Now snap the top cap of the shock cartridge into place . <p> Once the shock cartridges are assembled , you can install the o-ring that goes over the cartridge . <p> Now its time to install the shock shafts into the shock cartridges . Slide the piston side of the shock shaft in through the hex side of the shock cartridge . You can slide the shaft through from either side , but installing the end with smaller threads first lessens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease off the shock shafts after installing them into the cartridges . <p> Next we can install the shock pistons . I personally use the two-holed Delrin pistons that come with the kit . Install one flat washer onto the shock shaft , slide the shock piston into place , install the second flat washer and tighten the Nylock nut down until it stops . <p> Now you can install the rubber bump stop and rod end onto the shaft . <p> Thread the plastic spring pre-load adjuster onto the shock body . <p> Here you can see all the components before filling the body with shock oil . <p> Install the shock bladder in the top cap . <p> Make sure you seat the bladder down into the cap as best you can before threading it onto the shock body . This will help eliminate the bladder from distorting as you tighten the shock cap . <p> Now we can fill the shock body with oil . I am going to bleed the shocks through the shock cartridge over the shock cap , because the plastic shock caps do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body with oil until the oil just touches the shock cartridge threads inside the shock body . <p> Now , with the shock shaft fully extended , set the cartridge assembly in place , and thread the cartridge into the body a turn or two only . <p> Compress the shock shaft until it bottoms out to allow any air bubbles and excess oil to escape . You can do this by holding the shock shaft in the compressed position and thread the shock cartridge all the way into the body as tight as you can with your fingers . Now grab a 10mm box wrench and tighten the cartridge down all the way . Cycle the shock a few times at this point and look for leaks between the cartridge and shock body . If you still see a little oil bleeding out , tighten the cartridge up more . <p> Investing in a 10mm wrench for the shocks is key in my opinion , itll make rebuilding your shocks so much easier . I spent $7 on this wrench with a ratcheting box end at Ace Hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4 . <p> The last thing we need to do is install the springs and lower spring retainers to finish this step off . <p> That does it for the link and shock assembly .

When I got there several people were already there including Wayne from CORVA . It turned out to be a really fun event that had a laid back competitive touch . I threw down enough gates to run 3 courses that were fun enough for the variety of rigs we had on hand . I got to meet some great Axial fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The weather was windy and chilly at times but nothing the jacket could n't handle .

@@36018919 @5018919/ <h> Upgrades for the SCX10 , XR10 and RTC <p> We receive numerous questions from people asking what option parts they should upgrade to first . Half the fun of this hobby , to me , is wrenching and upgrading components . But , it can be tough to sort through information to see what upgrades are necessary . Some R/C upgrades in general are purely for looks , some are for better performance and a lot are for improved durability . Performance and durability are the two biggest reasons I upgrade my personal R/Cs , and I know there are a lot of people out there that have the same approach I do . So , I decided to come up with an upgrade list for each of our vehicles in order from most important to least important from my vantage point .

If you plan to do a lot of crawling you can use an overdrive gear set in the front axle . If you want more of an all around use , high speed vehicle , use the same gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i use 55 t motor instead of 27t. i mean if i keep the same upgrades as you . thanks <p> Jamie Posted on 2013-02-05 08:59:58 <p> You may want to try your 55T motor with the stock 20 tooth pinion . Using a 55T motor with the reduced gearing of the 14 tooth pinion will realy slow the vehicle down . It will crawl well , but may be too slow .

Well , I happened to have the day off , and said what the heck if all else fails at least I can get some crawling in . So I loaded up my Axial crawlers programed the coordinates into my GPS and started the 40 minute drive to Reno , NV . I was able to drive to within 300 ft of the coordinates . So I put my garmin in pedestrian mode and started walking . I got to the top of the hill and got the GPS to say I was 4 ft from it , but just could n't seem to find it . So I put the gps down and just started looking under all the rocks . Spent about 10 minutes looking on the wrong side of the hill , as soon as I climbed back over the hill , the first rock I looked under I saw something green .

@@36018931 @5018931/ <h> Axial XR10 Rear Axle Assembly Tips and Precautions <p> With the XR10 's starting to arrive in the hands of our loyal consumers , I figured it would be a good time to share some tips , tricks , and precautions on the rear axle assembly . <p> The most important thing to take note of is the specific hardware and length used on the rear axle . Not following the instructions exactly can cause failure of the final gears . The most critical are steps 20 &amp; 23 . Specifically the location of AXA466 and AXA465 . <p> Step 20 <p> Step 23 <p> Installing AXA466 at the location circled in Green . Note the 12mm Length <p> Installing AXA465 at the location circled in Green . Note the 10mm Length <p> Installing AXA466 at the location circled in Green . Note the 12mm Length <p> Installing the AXA466 M3x12 Flathead at the incorrect location will actually puncture through the inside of the AX80065 " 1 ? upper rear axle housing . This is pictured below , the AXA466 has been installed at the incorrect location that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential issue . <p> Everything looks " ok " from the outside . <p> Note that the screw is now going to interfere with the 15+21 bearings ( AXA1243 ) and the 36T Final Gear ( AX30552 ) . <p> This can cause a few issues : <p> The most critical one being the center-to-center distance on the gears . When this distance increases , you decrease the contact on the teeth . The less teeth in contact , the higher the load will be on these gears . <p> Another issue is the 15+21 outer bearing race- being smashed by using the incorrect hardware . This can cause the bearing to fail by creating a lot of strain on the entire rear axle. - Hopefully these pictures will help you guys prevent this from happening . <p> The other important thing to check during the rear axle assembly is the clamping hardware on the back of the housing . Make sure to get these as tight as possible without stripping the upper plastic that holds the 3mm locking nut . If these are not fully tightened the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gears increase this causes a decrease in the contact of the teeth . <p> Just to clarify , here is a diagram of the " center-to-center " distance on the final gears that I mentioned above . As you can see , when this distance increases , the gears are not as effective at transferring the torque of the motors . <p> This is the ideal center to center distance with the correct tooth contact . <p> Here is the potential danger if the gears are allowed to separate . Notice the minimal tooth contact . <p> UPDATE ! 9-17-10 : - Please be sure to always install AX30559 XR10 Rear axle plate. - It plays a crucial part of the strength of the rear axle. - The screws holding this plate on are the main clamping bearings on the 5+8 bearing on the end of the AX30196 5+58 Gear Shaft. - You must run this plate and the correct screws. - Instant gear failure will occur without this plate installed . <p> I hope this helps clarify the above steps and shows the importance of using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask questions . <h> 3 Comments : <p> RJD Posted on 2010-08-17 11:34:29 <p> Could you please tell us with how many Newton Meters we have to tighten those screws ? <p> RJD Posted on 2010-09-02 10:22:25 <p> Hello Axial Engineers .

After last years success , the promoters loved us so much that they moved the track to the middle of the pit party . Grandstands were erected so people could watch and a Monster Jam Snack Bar was set up for those that wanted some refreshments during our races . In the three days we were there , we staged three segments ; each had a qualifying run , main event race and a freestyle event . <p> To further promote our time at the event , we grabbed our trucks and walked out into the crowd after each segment to chat with the crowd . FELD , the management used to regulate the show , said we were a huge hit and probably the best part of the pit party .

Once a day the camera crew would stop by and talk to Bari on how he got started , and of course he would talk about Axial . <p> The track was a dirt base with painted wooden ramps and a fully detailed Sam Boyd Stadium scoreboard .

So it has some miles on it for sure . I have had a servo horn screw back out and then in the month of- May it took a 10-foot drop breaking the first part . So it has seen seven months of total abuse. - If you drive hard or abuse your trucks , parts will break and you may get away with it once or twice , but its flirting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to be abused so they should n't break Umm , I disagree and agree While I do agree this rig is designed for abuse , I do n't  agree that it shouldnt break . That would mean that some parts are going to be way too soft . Breakage is something that is going to happen . Its all a sliding scale as you do n't  want it too hard or too soft . This truck has been driven pretty hard by lots of people and it stayed together beyond my initial expectation . Its taken a lot of abuse and It took a big drop to break it . <p> So here it sits at AXIALFEST- 2016 . This truck has never had any maintenance done . I do not recommend this at all , but I am going for a true longevity test . The wheels have never even been taken off. - Zero upgrades and none of the parts have ever been changed out . <p> While at AXIALFEST2016 Johnathan Schultz said it was dirty , I said its never been worked on . He took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Transmission dropped out along with a few debris and about to be opened for the very first time . <p> Everything still looks good !

The control arms and pan tell the stories of all the good times this rig has given . <p> Again I am shocked , the front diff still has grease . <p> There is no visible damage when the front end is opened . <p> The internals of the rear diff still look really good . If you only knew how many hours of drive time this drivetrain has seen . <p> " It might be a racer thing , " Johnathan stated as- he took apart- every nut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rumor I once heard about Johnathans father taking apart ScottGs rig in the middle of a race to help him .

I want this rig up and running to continue this long term test . <p> Its down to the floor pan . Now comes the cleaning . <p> Some simple green , brush , and lots of elbow grease . This little venture has worked well into the night . Since we are- at AXIALFEST2016 as part of the early crew setting up , we have a downtime in the evenings and we are just R/C 247'ing up ! <p> Looks so much better than from when we started . <p> The rear axle is cleaned and put back together . <p> Transmission looks like knew , its hard to believe it looks this good after all its been through .

Put shocks back in same position as stock , and I have added some 30 weight oil to the shocks , not full , just enough to lube them . <p> My thoughts on the Axial Yeti Trophy Truck . I 've really truly enjoyed driving this thing ! - It reacts and moves how I imagine a real SCORE Trophy Truck would . But hey , that 's the fun of R/C ! The rear suspension drop is awesome to watch in action ! It handles well out of the box , I- couldnt recommend this as a track truck , but I am not- a track racer . The rear locker is fantastic off road , not sure if- that 's beneficial on a track . I would recommend a higher pinion for a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , 3S is the way to go . I have heard people are ripping the lexan bodies after a while , I had a wrap done on mine from SOR.Racing and you can see mine has not ripped or torn . Axial also has the Retro Bodies available . I have owned other trucks and you can only go fast so many times and jump so many things before you get bored. - This is so scale I run it all over and do n't  lose interest . Its- still fun because of how it runs and reacts as a whole . <p> It was definitely the " reset button " on 1/10 scale off road trucks in my opinion ! When " short course " trucks came into the market there has been two groups of people who were attracted to the segment , but things change and transition as a natural progression . One group has almost transitioned back to what racing was prior to the short course trucks . <p> The other group are those who saw this as inspiration for the next step in scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big desert racing machines called TROPHY TRUCKS ! A Trophy Truck is NOT a short course truck ! So thank you AXIAL for recognizing the difference and containing to appeal to the scale enthusiast ! <p> While it took Axial a while to get here , it was a risky move as a business in the public face of R/C short course racing . Its been funny to watch as most want to categorize the Yeti TT as a short course truck , that it is NOT ! This rig offers everyone that same chance to hit the " RESTART BUTTON " on FUN ! This is just like what short course trucks did when they came onto the market . For the scale community , this is our truck and the Yeti SCORE Trophy Truck is a MUST OWN- truck !

@@36018941 @5018941/ <p> The original AX10G Scorpion hit the market in April of 2007 .

Since then , Axial has made numerous advancements through a variety of chassis designs which developed new categories within the crawling segment . <p> AXIAL AX10G RIDGECRESTGWhile the shaft-driven AX10G chassis made crawling available to the masses , the market was split into two categories ; scale and competition . Axial answered both with the development of the SCX10G realistic metal c-channel frame which became the de-facto chassis for the scale scene , while the XR10G answered the call for a motor-on-axle competition rig and claimed the national title .

@@36018946 @5018946/ <h> Tire Modification <p> Im- sure most of you have a few old tires laying around . Maybe there are some that you ran a few times , but they did n't  perform how you wanted them too . Tires are one of those things that are really a preference for most . Some guys swear by their tires . I think it has a lot to do with foams , set up , compound , - and your terrain . <p> Well if you have some tires that you are not using for whatever the reason or if you just want to do something different , this may give you some ideas . I am a fan of the Axial Maxxis Trepadors and I have a couple of sets , so I am going to experiment with them and show you this modification process . <p> Tools and parts you will need : <p> - Tires ( any will work ) <p> - Dremel with cut off wheel <p> - Wheels <p> - Wheel weights ( optional ) <p> A dremel and a cut off wheel is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really clear out the groove quick and clean . <p> One pass and I opened the pattern up considerably . You can go smaller or bigger , - that is one of the cool things about this. - I will also run a- factory set of Axial Maxxis Trepadors as well as- my modified set . I will record this and give you my opinion of if it really helped or if it just looks cool . <p> Another pass and I am going to open the other side . You can do something simple like this and stop . Just run it and see what you think . You can immediately see the difference in the picture below . <p> I am going to open the center cuts in the- middle of the tires . You can compare my cuts to the stock factory- version and see how much I am opening the tread pattern . <p> I have gone this- far , so I am going to open the horizontal grooves on the small lugs . Just a quick hit with the dremel on these and- you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory version . It looks more aggressive for sure , but I am not sure if that translates into better performance . If I had to offer a tip on this , it would be take your time . Its not hard , but its not quick either . This is 15 to 30 minutes a tire , depending on your skill level . You can squeeze the tire to see your work better , while you are cutting . <p> To make this a fair comparison I am running 3 oz aluminum wheels , with tape weights on the fronts . Here in Las Vegas this is common because we have some close to vertical climbs . I am going to use the stock Axial foams that come in these tires . <p> If you have never done weights on your wheels , I can tell you these are just tape weights from a local tire store . Some local Hobby stores actually carry these . Simply peel the backing and- wrap it around your wheel . This works on plastic wheels as well . <p> If you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't  want it to interfere with the beadlocks or anything . <p> So here- is the cut version all mounted up . They look like a new tire at first glance . <p> Here is the factory version all mounted up . <p> Now to take these out on some terrain and see how they work . I am going to take them to Logandale and see how they do- on sandstone and a little sand . I chose this area to see- how they- grab onto loose terrain . We will see- if modification- helped or just changed the look . <p> So here is the first run out at Logandale . I am going to run each line 5 times , I am posting the best run on- video for you to check out . Its not about the set up ; I want the tires to do all the work . <p> After the first run , I think its fair to say the modified tires grabbed the rock more quickly than the factory tires . Though I should tell you that with momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am crawling it to see how the tires work . <p> On this second run I will go up an uneven climb , and some loose sandstone , almost like shale . <p> After the second run I feel the modified tire was again able to grab the rock a little better in some situations . These are the best of 5 runs . I am running an Axial 55T motor , Axial AE-5 , - with a- 2S lipo- to ensure smooth steady power at low speeds . On the loose- terrain , the very first run was the best pass for the factory tire . As the track- wore down it slipped more . Although the modified tire slipped as well , it consistently drove the same in deteriorating conditions. - Next I will run in some deep sand with a slight incline . <p> After running in the sand , I can say when I buried the tires to the point of no more forward progress , both tires were able to reverse and get themselves out . I feel the factory tire did better consistently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand better . The modified tire almost had the differentials on the sand every run . With lower power , the modified tires wanted to dig . With big power I am sure that maybe its fine , but this was with a 55T motor , so advantage factory tire . On this last little run I am going to the rocks of Lone Mountain Park here in Las Vegas . <p> So after this run I think the negative spacing and cross cuts on the lugs helped out . The factory tires wanted to spin a lot on the vertical flat climb- and- the modified tires went up easier . The last climb was a vertical climb just so I could see what the modified tires would do . I was impressed . <p> So what can you take away from this ? Maybe you need to break out those old tires and see what you can create . I hope this inspired you to try something new , create your version , and just enjoy what you have . This technique would work great on Axial RTR tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working custom tires.

@@36018960 @5018960/ <h> Rock Racing Setup Key Elements <p> Rock racing combines rock crawling with off-road racing , and yet , its so incredibly different than either . Its more brash and intense than technical rock crawling and its more about sudden bursts of speed than wide-open off-road racing . As such , setting up a vehicle for competitive rock racing can be a little tricky . Whether you 're brand new or already experienced , used this guide to make sure your Axial Racing rig is properly prepared for the ultra-demanding world of rock racing . <p> Tires Rock racing calls for true dual purpose tires . The tires must deliver high speed performance on dirt and also provide rock grabbing traction " two very different tasks . And , the amount of each type of terrain " dirt versus rocks " is n't likely to be equal . Depending on where you are rock racing , it may make more sense to concentrate on the high speed portions and go with tires that work best on dirt , or vise versa . No matter what , you will most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in the form of the foam inserts . Soft foam inserts will help tires conform to rocks , while firmer foam inserts will improve high speed performance . The track you 're racing on will determine which way to go . When selecting tires for competition , go with a soft compound such as Axial Racing 's R35 ( white dot ) . These will provide the best traction on dirt and rocks . <p> Its also worth noting that if your vehicle is hard to control on the fast section and wants to spin out , you can try a harder compound tire up front and/or a less aggressive tread pattern on the front tires . Another secret to know is a larger pinion gear can also cure spinning out as it eases acceleration and the ability for the tires to break traction . <p> Center of Gravity In rock crawling there is no such thing as too low of a center of gravity . This still hold true for rock racing . A low center of gravity will improve your vehicles ability to climb without tipping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle stable in high-speed corners . Depending on the class you 're running how you can lower the center of gravity easily varies . If you 're running a full Lexan body , lower it as much as possible and open up the wheel wells to allow room for the tires to move as the suspension cycles . Bodies weigh more than most people realize and you can see a huge performance improvement by simply lowering . Unless rules require it , lose unneeded accessories such as spare tires . While light buckets only weigh a few grams , for the best possible performance , you may consider removing or moving light buckets . <p> Weight Distribution Since rock racing involves jumps , weight distribution ( also known as weight bias ) is very important and a little more complicated compared to a pure rock crawling setup . More weight up front is best for rock crawling , it is n't that simple for rock racing . A neutral or slightly weight forward weight distribution is preferred as it will not overly compromise rock crawling performance , but too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose diving off jumps . You simply have to test on the track your racing or on jumps of similar size at the speeds you 'll be hitting the jumps . While not a weight distribution issue , the first thing to check when experiencing chronic nose diving is your ESC 's drag brake setting . While drag brake is essential for rock crawling , it can cause nose diving by automatically applying brakes when you let the throttle go to neutral in the air . Less drag brake is more when it comes to rock racing . Just be sure to maintain control on the downhill sections many tracks have . <p> Durability Most people think racing is all about speed " all about being the fastest . In rock racing , durability is far more important than speed . In real racing and in RC , no racing competition is as hard on a vehicle as rock racing . Rock racing is an incredible challenge " one that 's very hard on the vehicle . In full-size rock racing , at events such as the King of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often the same if vehicles are properly prepared for the rigors of racing . Aluminum parts are they way to go for rock racing . They increase durability without adding too much weight . Titanium , if your budget allows , is an even better choice . Be warned , titanium does n't bend and rebound like aluminum . It 's stronger , but it snaps instead of bends when stressed to its limits . Start with an aluminum servo horn . This is an absolute must . Axial 's Universal Axle Set is also an item to have at the top of your list . Other aluminum upgrade parts can be added as parts fail or show excessive wear . <p> Ground Clearance Optimal ground clearance will vary depending on the track , but you will want to get your rock racer as low as you can without making it impossible to navigate the rock portions . Scraping and dragging is okay . A lower will vehicle is more stable and less likely to roll in corners , on rocks and when taking jumps . Few crashes means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Speed The fastest car is n't guaranteed to win in rock racing . While you do n't want purposely make your vehicle slow , do n't worry too much about having the fastest vehicle on the track . Stability and durability are far more valuable in rock racing than speed . Axial 's brushless setup are more than fast enough for rock racing . Some classes allow 3S LiPo batteries , which will provide a significant speed increase . If the track has a good amount of high-speed sections , running a faster 3S setup may be ideal . <p> Suspension Axial vehicles all have highly adjustable suspensions . While you can change internal shock components such as pistons and oil viscosity , a lot can be done to dial in handling by simply changing shock springs . Axial offers a wide variety of springs in both firm and soft rates . The goal is to have a plush suspension . Most rock racers are setup with overly stiff suspensions that do n't absorb impacts well . You can see these vehicles reacting to everything they hit as both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Setup up your vehicle so that it lands from a one-foot-tall test drop with no bounce . It should land as if there were a pillow under it . This may require experimenting with oil and pistons to get just right . Thicker oil will absorb more energy and keep the springs from acting like pogos and smaller holes in the piston will slow down how quickly the oil can travel through the piston and slow down how quickly the suspension compresses . This will help keep the chassis from slapping the ground . A little chassis slap is n't a bad thing . You just do n't want hard hits . Use sway bars to compensate for this soft suspension . The sway bars will keep the vehicle from rolling over in the corners . <p> You The biggest factor in how successful you will be at rock racing is you . Of course , you provide the driving skill , but what is really at stake is how well you take care of the vehicle on the track . There 's an old saying in racing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These words could n't be more true than they are for rock racing . Do n't let the other vehicles determine how fast you go . Know what your vehicle can handle without breaking or crashing and stick to that pace . If a vehicle passes you , do not chase it down . Pretend you 're the only vehicle out there and concentrate on nothing other than consistent , crash-free laps .

I recently built up one of these kits and took photos of each and every step . Over the next few days you will see this build progress , step by step , with photos and descriptions . I will also show a few different option/upgrade parts as well with this particular build . For the first step in this build we will go over what 's inside the box , then start with the construction of the axles . <p> Prepping my desk for the build . <p> A peak inside the box shows all the goodies ! <p> Here you can see the contents of the kit laid out . <p> The decals and instruction manual . <p> Step 1 in the manual says locate bag A. <p> Find the hardware bag , which contains all the metal parts required for this build . Open it up and look for bag A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Here are all the parts required to build both differentials . <p> Start off with what you need to build the first ring gear assembly . <p> First thing well do is install the locker in the plastic differential case , and place the differential gasket over the ring gear . <p> Now mate the differential case to the ring gear and attach using the supplied 2mm screws . Then slide the bearings over the bosses on each side of the differential . Repeat these steps for both assemblies . <p> Assembling the pinion gear is next . Insert the 2mm pin through the pinion shaft hole closest to the end of the shaft with the E-clip groove cut into it , and slide the pinion gear into place over the pin . Then snap the E-clip into place with a pair of needle nose pliers . <p> Locate the AR60 axle housings and snap the plastic tabs off . <p> Trim any excess plastic away from the housing with an X-acto . <p> Find the differential cover parts tree . <p> Here are all the parts required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts needed for assembly . <p> Insert the first 5+11 bearing into the backside of the AR60 housing . <p> Slide the 2nd 5+11 bearing into place on the pinion shaft . <p> Press the pinion gear into the housing . <p> Insert the differential assembly into the housing next . Make sure you note the direction the ring gear is suppose to be facing too . The teeth of the ring gear should be facing the short side of the housing for the front axle . <p> Install the bearing caps with the supplied self tapping screws . <p> Apply a little grease to the ring and pinion gears . Do n't  go overboard with the grease either , a light coat that fully covers the gears is more then enough . <p> Grab your differential cover and four 2mm screws . <p> Install the diff cover with the supplied hardware . Also note the direction of the diff cover placement too . <p> Now repeat the above steps for the rear axle . Again note the direction of the ring gear , the teeth should be facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would be a good time to mark the axles so you know which one is for the front and rear . I marked the front axle with an " F " underneath the differential on the outside of the housing with a marker . Otherwise its easy to get the 2 axles confused during the build . <p> That completes step 2 . <p> For step 3 I will be adding a few option parts , like aluminum C-hubs , knuckles and 3x10mm M3 screws , instead of the self tapping plastic screws . When you upgrade to the aluminum C-hubs the self tapping screws can no longer be used , since the Cs are tapped for M3 hardware . <p> Slide the axle Cs into place , again note the direction in the manual . <p> Insert the self tapping screws into the C-hubs . <p> Install the 5+11 bearings into the ends of the axle tubes . <p> Next step may seem off , but squirt a dab of Loctite on the flats of the axle shafts before installing them in the housing . This is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Slide the CVD axles into place . <p> Now its time to prep the aluminum knuckles . <p> Install the required bearings . <p> Insert the flange pipes into the knuckles , slide the knuckles over the outer stub axles and install the 3x10mm M3 screws . <p> Repeat the last few steps for the opposite side of the front axle . and Step 3 is done . <p> Onto the rear housing , everything needed laid out for ease of assembly . <p> Again add a dab of Loctite to the axle shaft flats before installing them . Slide the two 5+11 bearings into place and insert the rear straight axles into the housing . <p> Slide the plastic lockouts into place and attach using the supplied hardware . <p> Moving on to step 5 , and the front axle . First thing I did was install the M3 set screws into the bottom of the axle housing . <p> Grab the proper plastic axle truss and set it into place on top of the front housing . <p> Attach the truss with the supplied hardware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this step I found the best way to get the Nylock nuts seated into the link/shock mounts was to use a small pick tool . Slide the Nylock nut onto the end of the pick , insert the nut into the link/shock mount , then twist and pull the pick out . The nut should stay seated in place . <p> Attach the link/shock mounts with the supplied M3X16mm screws . Note the direction of these as well , they can be bolted on upside down by accident with ease . <p> Repeat the last couple steps to finish off the rear axle . Both axles completed . <p> That takes care of the first few steps in this build covering the axles . Next step will be shock build up and tuning .

You should be able to remove any dust , or clumps of dried mud without much drama . I would like to stress that safety glasses are a must for this method . Last thing you want to happen is to start blowing off your rig , only to get blasted in the eyes with dirt and debris . Not fun !

All preregistered drivers will receive a driver 's bag containing a limited edition AXIALFEST 2015 t-shirt and trucker cap , stickers , itinerary , and swag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street is the swag will be extra special this year , so make sure you preregister now if you have n't already . <p> You may also register in person at AXIALFEST , but will not receive the driver 's bag . Extra shirts will be available for purchase at G-Central , but the driver 's bags are limited to only those who preregister . It is highly recommend that you preregister , so you do n't miss out on any of the limited edition swag from Axial and the official sponsors of AXIALFEST . <p> Step 2 : Get a place to stay <p> Luckily , AXIALFEST is at a campground , a huge campground . Do n't be scared if you 've heard all the camp sites are gone . They are not , but you may have to walk a little farther to get to G-Central as the veterans have probably already reserved their camp spots from last year that are closest to G-Central . Call Cisco Grove to reserve your spot ASAP . <p> Cisco Grove Campground <p> 48415 Hampshire Rocks Rd. , Cisco Grove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an hour from Reno , NV and about an hour and a half from Sacramento , CA . Camp sites are about $30 per night and include water and electrical hookups . There are bathroom and showers available at the campground . Multiple people can share the spots to help divide the cost among several people . <p> Step 3 : Start Packing RC Stuff <p> Your kits ( SCX10 , Wraith , - AX10 , - Exo , Yeti ) . Since this is AXIALFEST , the thing to remember is to pack Axial vehicles . You can leave your other RCs at home , as this is an Axial appreciation event . Before you arrive at AXIALFEST , make sure you do a once over on your kits . Clean , rebuild , and replace worn components to reduce chances of failure . <p> Do n't  let something little stop you from finishing. - I found this broken axle housing while cleaning up Skeeno Jrs Axialfest rig just yesterday . <p> Also , be prepared for mud and water . Chances are high that you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory , but highly recommended . <p> Transmitter , charger , and all of your batteries . You will be driving your kits probably more than you ever have , so you want to make sure you have enough mah to complete each G6 stage . A good rule of thumb is 10,000 mah , but more is always better . You will be able to charge your batteries at your camp sites with the available electricity at each camp site . Make sure to bring a power strip , so you can have multiple chargers going at once . <p> Spare Parts . Bring all the spare parts and electronics you have . Driving for three hours straight can tax even the most stoutly built drivetrains . If you do n't have many spare parts , that 's OK . Most veterans will have something to help you out on the trail . Vendors will also be selling parts on site , so bring some spare cash . <p> Tools . Chances that you will need to make a repair or adjustment are high . Bring all your tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soldering irons . <p> Hydration pack/Camelbak . It will be July and most likely very warm . You will be walking long distances for many hours . Bring a backpack or pack hydration to carry water , trail snacks , and tools and spare parts . There is no shame in stopping on the trail to rest , eat , or fix your kit because the goal is to finish . For more info on what to bring out on the trail , check this blog : - Make Your Own RC Vehicle Field Tool Pack <p> Camping Equipment <p> Lots of people bring RVs and campers . Others rough it in tents . Some people sleep in their cars . A good night sleep makes for a happy AXIALFESTer . Bring the stuff that will get you the best sleep . Tent , Mattress , Sleeping bag , pillow , and extra blankets are highly recommended . <p> Canopy/EzUp . It 's nice to have protection from the sun or rain while cooking or wrenching . If you have walls for your canopy , bring those as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp site has water and power . Make sure you have enough outlets for all your chargers , soldering irons , lights , etc . Some sights have the RV outlets , not the standard 110 outlets you see at your house . Have no fear , the camp store has adapters for sale for cheap . I think I paid $5 last year . <p> Lighting/Lantern . You want to be able to see at camp if you have to have a late night wrenching session . <p> Alarm clock . Events start early in the morning . You do n't want to be late or miss anything , so bring an alarm that will wake you up , especially if you are a night owl participating in after event revelries . <p> Flashlight and Headlamp . There will be a night stage for the G6 . You will need to be able to see in the dark . Do n't skimp . Get a headlamp with a high lumen output . <p> Shampoo/soap/quarters . Showers are available , if you can find time , so you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned by the high elevation . <p> Food and Beverages <p> Water/beverages . A hydrated G6er is a happy G6er . <p> Meals . Hungry equals grumpy . Be prepared for the breakfasts , lunches , and dinners for each day you will be there . There are no restaurants close by and the camp store has a very limited selection of edibles . That 's 3 breakfasts , 3 lunches , and 3 dinners , if you are planning on being there from Thursday until Sunday . Plan accordingly . <p> Snacks . Trail mix and power bars are good to have in case you need extra nutrition in between meals while out on a G6 . <p> Stove/BBQ . You got ta cook that food on something , right ? <p> Regular kitchen supplies . **29;75;TOOLONG . Think about what you need for each meal and make sure you bring it . <p> Coffee maker and coffee cups . A nice cup of coffee gets me ready for each long day . I like mine with a little cream and sugar . <p> Toothbrush/toothpaste . Fresh breath makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . No one likes morning breath . <p> Ibuprofen/Aspirin/Advil . Bring the pain reliever of your choice . Your feet and legs will be sore if you are not used to extended hours of being on your feet . 1000 trail markers can equal several miles hiking around the campground . <p> Clothing <p> Shoes- bring sturdy shoes for mountain hiking . Hiking boots are recommended . It 's also a good idea to bring some spare shoes for relaxing at camp and flip flops for the showers . I 'd also plan on extra socks . After 1000 trail markers and several miles , your feet will most likely be sore . <p> **39;106;TOOLONG . You never can tell what Sierra weather will be like . Temps can vary from in the 90s during the day to in the 30s at night . One year it rained . Last year the nights were very cold .

There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter makes sure we hit it every year . <p> Step 4 : Arrive <p> The first stop is at the camp store at the front of the campground . Pick up your campsite and vehicle tags , then go find your campsite . Get set up , so you can start the fun . <p> After you have camp set up , go find G-Central . G-Central is the central hub of Axialfest where all the activities begin . G-Central is located in the pavilion . There will be signs posted to point you in the proper direction . It is easily spotted , because you will see lots of large green Axial banners as well as the RECON G6 canopy , truck and trailer . There are usually other vendor booths also set up at G-Central . If you are not sure , ask someone . Everyone is friendly and helpful . <p> At G-Central you will pick up your t-shirts , hats , driver 's bag , and any other instructions . Inside your driver 's bag you will find the Axialfest itinerary , sponsor information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the official Axialfest sponsors . Make sure you preregister , so you qualify for all the driver bag goodies . <p> Do n't forget to check out the camp sites . Assorted vendors will also have their booths set up with their wares displayed and items for sale . <p> Trail markers will be everywhere ! Do n't be surprised to see trail markers on the side of the road , next to your camp , in G-Central , pretty much everywhere . There are over 1,000 trail markers for the G6 , so please do not disturb them . They will be needed for the entire event . Do not be tempted to take the one with your favorite number and risk the next G6er getting lost . Also , feel free to play with your kits , but please stay off marked obstacles . You 'll know because there will be colorful ribbon on certain sections . <p> What class are you in ? RECON G6 . Most AXIALFESTers come for the RECON G6 . The RECON G6 is a scale trail run . At Axialfest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of 1,000 trail markers is set . Drivers start from G-Central and follow all 1,000 trail markers out , around , and through the Cisco Grove Campground , ultimately returning back to G-Central to finish . The general rule of the RECON G6 is No HOG , which means No Hand of God . That means you should not touch your rig . No flipping over or repositioning it if stuck . Use a tow strap or winch to make a scale recovery . Also remember to travel in the proper direction . The red trail marker is always on the right . Red on Right , get it ? <p> Out on the RECON G6 trail , drivers will encounter a varied selection of terrain from dirt to rocks to mud to water to trees to whatever is out there . Have fun using your scale accessories like tow straps , winches and sand ramps to conquer the terrain . And here 's a little secret , if you see something that looks out of the ordinary on the trail , it might be a trail treasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G-Central for a possible bonus . <p> Drivers have the freedom to drive as fast or slow as they feel . Most drive in small groups assisting each other when the trail gets difficult . Drivers during a RECON G6 are always happy to help out other drivers by loaning a strap , winch line , parts , or tools . Whatever it takes to help their fellow G6ers continue on the adventure . At Axialfest , the RECON G6 trail is often many miles long , that 's why being prepared is so important . Drivers and their kits need to be prepared to endure a long day of scale fun . And remember , Finishing a RECON G6 is like Winning a RECON G6 . <p> There are several RECON G6 classes to choose from . Here 's a break down : <p> Every G6er falls into one of these four classes . 1.9 and 2.2 denote size of your rigs wheels , not tires . <p> 1.9 and 2.2 Adventurist- this is the largest class . It 's very relaxed and about having a good time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably your class . <p> 1.9 and 2.2 Ultra- this is a competitive class . It 's a race . These drivers run . Also known as Cardio RC . Bring your trail running shoes if you choose this class . This class also has more than the standard 1000 trail markers . If you encounter them of the trail it is courteous to pull over and let them pass . Bonus classes . You will be in the both the above and below classes if you fit into one of the categories below . <p> Concourse Show &amp; Shine Trailer queens that spit shine and show it off , minus the cobwebs please ! Once you are settled in , get ready to have a great time . Do n't expect much downtime . Once the action begins , it 's likely that you will be busy the entire weekend . Axialfest 2015 has set a tentative schedule below . Remember , times are subject to change , so be sure to check at G-Central for updates and LISTEN during the driver 's meetings . 
@@36018973 @5018973/ <h> How To Glue Tires <p> Most steps in building an RC kit such as the Axial Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon are pretty straightforward . If you follow the instructions and use the correct parts , most building steps are fairly hard to get wrong . A few other steps seem simply , but are , in contrast , pretty easy to get wrong if you are n't familiar with how to properly do the task . Gluing tires is one such step . No need to worry . Follow these tips and you 'll get your tires glued up perfectly . <p> CLEAN START As part of the manufacturing process , molded parts are coated with a mold release agent that is used to facilitate the removal of the part from the mold . The mold release can inhibit the ability of the glue to do its job . The easy solution is to quickly clean the bead areas of the tires and wheels before gluing . Remove the foam inserts from the tires before cleaning . Do not use ordinary household cleaners such as window cleaner as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from properly adhering . Denatured alcohol and rubbing alcohol work best , but RC motor spray ( make sure it 's plastic safe ) can also work well . Follow all safety precautions on the label of the cleaning product you choose . Saturating a paper towel with cleaner and rubbing the bead area of the parts until no residue shows on the paper towel is all that is needed . You may have to use a clean area of the towel frequently and reapply cleaner . When the parts are clean , let them dry before gluing . <p> TEST FIT Quickly check the bead areas of the tires for any extra material , called flashing . Axial Racing tires are high quality and precision molded , but it is still good to check . Remove any extra material with scissors . Next , reinstall the foams and make sure the foams are perfectly centered in the tires . Slide each tire over a wheel and make sure the tire is seated down completely on the wheel and that there are no gaps or bulges . <p> RUBBER BAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stronger the bond will be . The end result will also look better and perform better . Place two large wide rubber bands over each tire " one on each side firmly holding the tire to the wheel . The rubber band trick will work on smaller 1.9-inch tires as found on the Axial SCX10 to larger 2.2-inch tires found on the Axial Wraith . <p> THE RIGHT GLUE Use only hobby specific CA glue when gluing RC tires such as Duratrax Pit Tech Tire Glue . Medium viscosity glue is the easiest to work with . In contrast , thin CA glue is too likely to run and it 's too easy to over apply . The thick CA takes too long to set . <p> GLUEING The key to a good glue job " one that looks good and is strong " is taking your time . Pull back the tire just enough to add a single small drop of glue . Start in the 12 o'clock position and move to the 6 o'clock position . Do this on one side of one tire and wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do all of your tire and wheels " just one side . Let the glue dry for a few minutes and then check the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions of each tire . Add a single small drop as needed . Let the tires dry completely and then do the other side in the same manner . Keep in mind the two biggest mistakes made are using too much glue and going too fast . After all of the tires are glued , check for any loose spots and after adding small drops of CA glue as needed , let them dry completely before using . <p> DAMAGE CONTROL We all make mistakes . If you have a gluing mishap such as a runaway drop of glue dripping down the side of the tire , it can be fixed if you act quickly . Find a lint free rag and soak a small section in rubbing alcohol or denatured alcohol . If a drop of glue runs , you can quickly swipe it with your rag and minimize the unsightly mark it leaves on the outside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rag you 've selected on a piece of scrap material with glue on it . This will make sure the rag does n't leave behind a residue .

Start off by finding bag B. <p> Another upgrade I am going to use on this build is metal flange balls . I will be using these in all the rod ends on this kit . They have a little smoother action then the plastic flange balls , and are a lot more durable over time . <p> First step will be prepping the shock cartridges . Here you can see all the parts required to make a complete cartridge . <p> Install the bigger clear o-ring over the shock cartridge body . <p> Apply a little grease to your cartridge o-rings . Put a dab of grease on your finger and work the grease all over the o-rings before dropping them into your shock cartridges . This will help prevent tearing the o-ring during assembly . <p> Install the first o-ring into the shock cartridge . <p> Now set the plastic spacer ( Part #AX80035-4 ) into place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second o-ring and install it on top of the plastic spacer . <p> Now snap the top cap of the shock cartridge into place . <p> Grab your shock shafts , washers , pistons and Nylock nuts . I used the three-holed pistons for this build , to speed up the action of the shocks a little . <p> Install one flat washer onto the shock shaft , slide the shock piston into place , install the second flat washer and tighten the Nylock nut down until it stops . <p> Insert the shock shaft into the shock cartridge from the top cap side , and wipe away any excess grease from the shock shaft threads . <p> Slide the rubber bump stop over the shock shaft . <p> Snap the metal flange ball into the shock rod ends , and thread them onto the shock shafts . <p> Install the shock bladders into the shock caps . Make sure the bladder is properly seated down into the cap before threading it onto the shock body . This will help keep the bladder from distorting as you tighten the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Install the threaded pre-load collar onto the shock body , then install the cap . <p> Fill the shock body up with oil until it touches the threads inside the shock body . Make sure you let all air bubbles rise to the top of the oil and dissipate before starting assembly . <p> Thread the shock cartridge/shaft assembly a couple turns into the shock body , oil should start overflowing at this point . If no oil seeps out , fill the shock body with a little more oil . <p> Compress the shock shaft until it bottoms out to allow any air bubbles and excess oil to escape . You can do this by holding the shock shaft in the compressed position and thread the shock cartridge all the way into the body as tight as you can with your fingers . The shaft will rebound a bit when you let go of it , which is normal . Now grab a 10mm box wrench and tighten the cartridge down all the way . Cycle the shock a few times at this point and look for leaks between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little oil bleeding out , tighten the cartridge up more . <p> Investing in a 10mm wrench for the shock cartridges is key in my opinion , it++-+-+G++-+-+G+++-ll make rebuilding your shocks so much easier . I spent $7 on this wrench with a ratcheting box end at Ace Hardware . You can also just buy a standard 10mm wrench for about $4 . Pliers can be used to tighten the cartridges too . But , over time the pliers can ruin the hex on the plastic cartridges , especially if the pliers slip off the hex while you are tightening everything up .

Just as we have seen in the use of retro designs in the auto industry , with cars like the Dodge- Challenger , we have also seen off-roaders use classic trucks in modern builds . To implement this idea , our Design and Marketing teams brainstormed and discussed some of our favorite trucks and SUVs from the late-70s and early-80s . Taking those vehicles into consideration , the Design team then studied the iconic styling cues of these vehicles and began sketching ideas . As a result , we developed those ideas and created a unique retro styled Axial SUV body - the Spawn . <p> FEATURES <p> 2.2 MAXXIS TREPADOR TIRESThese fully licensed tires are molded in our performance proven S30 compound for excellent grip on any off-road surface .

@@36018979 @5018979/ <h> Venting Tires <p> Axial RC vehicles closely mimic real world high performance vehicles in many ways . They both look and function just like what they are modeled after . One exception is how the tires work . Of course , Axial 's tires look extremely realistic . They also are known for providing high performance just like the real tires they replicate . The difference between RC and real tires is what supports the tire . Modern RC high performance tires are supported by foam inserts , as opposed to compressed air . There 's no valve stem on an Axial wheel . <p> The foams used in Axial tires have been selected to mimic a full-size tire that has been aired down . A full-size tire that has been aired down is able to conform around obstacles and provide a lot more traction than a tire properly inflated for highway use . The firmness of the foam Axial uses provides proper support while still allowing the tires to conform just like real tires . <p> Besides the use of foam inserts in place of compressed air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely important . If RC tires were sealed , they would n't be able to form around and grip obstacles such as rocks , but even worse , especially with high-speed vehicles such as the Yeti , the tires would act like inflated basket balls and bounce when a vehicle landed . Vent holes allow air to escape and return when a tire impacts the ground . Without breather holes , a sealed tire would bounce like a pogo jumps off . <p> There are two ways a tire can be vented . One is to vent the wheel and the other is to actually vent the tire . <p> Some wheels come with holes already in the wheel . For additional venting , the stock holes can be enlarged with a body reamer or additional holes can be added . <p> Axial also offers adjustable venting on some wheels such as the Walker Evans and Method wheels used with the Yeti RTR and kit , respectively . <p> These are extremely handy as increasing venting by opening more breather holes is not permanent . Take advantage of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on running in mostly wet conditions , you can seal up all of the holes to help prevent water from entering and getting trapped inside the tire and wheel . It is always best to take your bead lock wheels apart after driving through water so that the foams can dry out . <p> Many racers prefer to vent the tires . Do not attempt to do this with a hobby knife . The best way to vent tires is to use a hole punch tool typically used for leather . These tools can be found as cheaply as $5 . Typically , these tools can be adjusted for a variety of sized holes . Two holes using the smallest option are usually perfect for RC use . One of the believed benefits of venting the tires is that dirt can get flung out the hole as the tire spins . <p> If you notice your vehicle bouncing when landing or that the tires do n't  conform around obstacles , you should try increasing the venting .

@@36018981 @5018981/ <h> Scale Detailing Your RTR <p> I am pretty sure you all have some old bodies sitting around . It seems like everyone who gets an Axial RTR tends to take the body off and change it out , just to be different . Hopefully this will help give you ideas to make- your RTR body- different . This is not really about being precise , its more about a complete look , so do n't  be afraid to mess up . <p> I put on different stickers to make mine look different , then I cut the rear cage just to change it up a bit . Now I am going to go back to running this body as I have always been a fan of the Axial Honcho . <p> This is pretty stock other- than a cut rear cage , a few stickers , and plenty of scratches . <p> There are definitely a few ways- do this . You can use a- heat gun , a hair dryer , a wood burning tool , and so on . Here I am going to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to make- huge dents . You will see that lexan- gets glass smooth when its hot . I just used the back of a wooden paint- brush to create the dent below . Try not to use round objects ; there are not too many dents with perfect shapes , so keep that in mind . <p> You can see where I dented the pillar . Its not a crushing blow , but a noticeable dent . <p> While looking at this I am going to do away with some of the scratches on the windshield . I cut along the black molding on the sticker and under windshield banner . You can also remove windshield banner if you like . You can use- an exacto knife or razor blade . <p> Simply peel away the clear sticker on windshield and here is what you get . <p> Some of the scratches are deep and went through the sticker , but thats- fine . You can incorporate those scratches in this next step . <p> Take your exacto knife and start scratching some cracks in the lexan to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hit the same spot twice . I started a small and tight pattern before going into the bigger cracks . <p> Pictured above is small pattern I started with , picture below is how it looks finished . <p> Going- back to the dents , I am going to scratch off paint from the inside . Again , there are several ways to do this and there really is n't a wrong way to do this . Here I used a body reamer to start . try to leave some of your existing paint in the dented area . <p> I am using some silver model paint . It may not look like it shows up too well , but after the next step you should be able to see it better . Try not to paint all of the scratched surface silver , you will need to add some brown- for- rust . <p> It may not look noticeable yet , but it will . You can also scratch the surface again if you feel like you want to add more . <p> After the silver , I added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all with brown paint . <p> Now maybe you can see it a little better . <p> I added another dent , I went over this one with a Dremel . Same as before , I will add some silver , then cover it in brown . If you do not like- how it looks- do n't  be afraid to go back and hit it again . <p> I am happy with the dents , - but- I do n't  think the window would look fine after hits like those . Time to put the cutting wheel on the dremel. - You can also cut the windows with a body reamer and body scissors . <p> If you want you can use a scrap piece and make a template of your window . You can use the template to set it how you want the glass to look . I start by cutting it to the height I want . <p> I always just rough cut it to start and will clean it all up at the end . <p> I want the window like its off the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a template . Set the template next to the body like its your window so- you can get that scale look and keep the right shape . <p> I clean it all up with a sanding wheel on a dremel and- an- exacto knife . <p> Do n't  forget to peel away the sticker on the side window . <p> Here is the body reamer method of removing windows . <p> Ream- a- hole and then use your body scissors to cut it out . Again I will clean it up with a dremel , exacto , or- razor blade . <p> After looking at this , I feel it needs some dents showing what that would break out this window . <p> I dent it with the lighter and the handle of wooden paint brush . Then I Dremel some paint off like before , add silver paint , and then the brown . <p> Now I get some duct tape and cut a corner off of a trash bag . <p> Rough cut the bag to the size of back window frame . <p> I cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out for the look I want . This works- on any body , so be creative and create the look you want . <p> Now for the cage . I cut my cage down ; I have this spare Axial Dingo cage so I am going to use it make a rear section for this Honcho . <p> I start by cutting it down . I left the plastic gusset section for aesthetics . <p> I drill some holes so I can attach this cage to my existing cage . <p> Once I attach the front section , I simply drill on the underside to attach the rear . I missed my mark the first time , but I do n't  think you will notice it when its done . <p> Once I attach the rear section , I am looking at the parts I have left from the Dingo cage . I have an idea <p> I like the look of this section so I am cutting it to use it . <p> Looks good to me so I will just keep trimming it to fit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have drilled a hole through the tubing to attach the new piece I will use . <p> If you counter sink the screw , it will not stick out and it almost looks like its made this way . <p> Here is a tip for you . Its very hard to drill into a round tube , so start it with a body reamer and you will find its much easier . <p> So I have my new piece in , held in place by screws in the bottom . I am not digging the old spare tire placement though . Maybe its overland meets racing . <p> I like this look a lot better . On your build feel free to try new and different things . That is one of the great things about this hobby . <p> Even though I changed the cage and the way the spare tire sits , I feel it still needs more to be different . <p> I break out the dremel once again . I am going to remove all the paint from one fender . I want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this with sand paper , or I know some people use chemicals like Nitro fuel or store bought products , but I want a rough look . <p> Once I have my paint removed , I will mask it off and paint it . Make sure you mask the windows too . <p> So here I have my black fender . It looks like its a flat black , almost like a replacement fender before the primer . You can do this on any body in any color . Pick any body panel or panels you want . <p> Looking at it more , I want to fill the voids under the bed towards the cab , so I 'll put a couple of scale items there to fill it in . <p> A scale propane tank and an old plug will work . <p> To secure it the propane tank , I drill a hole in the tank and run a screw through the top of the bed . You can use a spacer between the tank and bed for height adjustment . <p> You can see the screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug off the plug and use Shoe Goo to hold together each end of the wire . I used the body reamer to put a hole in the bed for the propane wire to feed through . <p> Next , I will put dual batteries in the other side to fill the void . This is a short light bar mount- from an Axial parts tree . <p> I heated the plastic and bent it . I will attach this the same way as- the propane tank . <p> I want an expedition style look . I went to a local fabric store and bought this Tan cloth for a couple of dollars . I also bought some black elastic square chords . <p> I pinch the fabric between the body and cab . <p> Simply remove the screw that attaches the body to the cage and you can pull the cage away enough to get fabric in . Just put the screw through the fabric and back into plastic . <p> Pinch the fabric on all four points of the cab , just as the first one . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear portion of the new cage I added and the bed . I like the flat side look of the canvas , but I want the driver side to be different . <p> I simply cut the side so it looks rolled up . <p> I am not going to sew this or anything . Ill just Shoe Goo the fabric together around the rear roll bar . <p> I trimmed off the access pieces from the rear to clean it up . Again , I used Shoe Goo to glue the fabric to itself . <p> I am just screwing the fabric down on the rear , I am adding the flat elastic cord and pinching it down with a screw . <p> I drilled two holes and attached the elastic cords to the top . This does nothing ; its purely for looks . <p> For the open side I am tying a knot to the roll bar on the bottom . <p> Next , I drill a hole ( using a body reamer first ) in the top roll bar for the elastic cords to attach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off access . <p> I 'm satisfied with the overall look , but I need- some contrast with the spare . <p> I have this mount I got from JRC ( Judd Rummage Concepts ) and I bought some red ribbon . I used this set up on my Axial SCX10 Chevy Baja build . <p> I like it . The spare is pinched in by the cage and its pretty snug . <p> I can add some scale items or do whatever I want with this side . <p> here 's another tip -- if you use a sharpie to make the body lines , you know its sometimes hard to stay exactly on the lines . Do n't  worry though , you can easily fix this . You can see where I went off the lines . Pictured above and below . <p> Now its gone . Use some rubbing alcohol and a Q tip or rag and you can wipe it off . You can wipe it completely clean and try again or just remove the line- you want gone . <p> The lines just add to the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . When its all done you should end up with a transformed body . <p> On Part 2 of this blog I will do a simple interior , driver , and some lights to complete this truck . Hopefully it was helpful or at least gives you some ideas . Do n't  be afraid- to try new things . We all start somewhere . If you 're new to the hobby or customizing , then you should know this is all about being creative and using anything that- helps create what you envision . 
@@36018983 @5018983/ <p> We are starting to get extremely excited about Project " SCX10JK " . We have been at Rebel Off Road almost every day checking out the progress of the build . Those guys really make quick work of the parts install . Standing there watching them in action is pretty cool , it is like a well oiled machine . Every person there has a job to do , and they all seem to work really well together . Yesterdays progress included adding some much needed armor to the side of the Jeep in between fenders . The rocker panels are one of the most vulnerable parts of the vehicle when out on the trail . Just because the Jeep can climb over something , does n't mean it should . For those moments when Jeff is faced with climbing over a huge rock , we needed some rocker protection for when it comes down on the other side . I know from experience with my SCX10 , that the sliders are very important , same goes for the full size action . Unlike my Lexan bodied SCX10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will result in very expensive damage . To handle protection of this vital area of the vehicle we once again turn to the Jeep masterminds over at Poison Spyder . This time we will be installing the Aluminum Rocker Armor ( found here ) and the Rocker Knockers or sliders ( found here ) . <p> Of course we need to stick with the same theme that we started with , so Rebel sent both components out for powder coating . We decided to make the Aluminum rocker protection match the corners in that silver powder coat , and do the Rocker Knockers in black . That way any protection bolted to the body surface will match the silver paint , and the Rocker Knockers will look great with the Crusher Flares previously installed . <p> The first part of this process involves stripping the stock rocker panels down to bare metal <p> This would be another one of those moments where you cringe seeing the drill hit the fresh paint , but I imagine after the corner install , this would be a little easier to swallow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it requires the drilling of several holes in which you install threaded inserts to bolt the parts on . <p> After all the holes are drilled , the threaded inserts are installed . These threaded inserts also known as " Riv-Nuts " and are just like rivets in how they are installed . I need one of these tools ! <p> After all the threaded inserts are installed , it is as simple as bolting the parts in place . The fitment of the Poison Spyder parts is spot on , that or Rebel Off Road really makes it look easy <p> All of the hardware is countersunk , so the result is a completely smooth surface , very clean ! <p> Once the rocker protection is in place the crew at Rebel got to work installing the Rocker Knockers Rock Sliders . These are really cool , and look very similar to the sliders that come as standard equipment on the SCX10 line of vehicles , so they definitely fit the theme of this build ! <p> We are very pleased with the result of the Poison Spyder Rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with confidence with these bad boys installed ! <p> The next step is the front bumper and rear bumper with tire carrier .

@@36018984 @5018984/ <h> Wraith Tuning Tips <p> The Wraith is a very capable rig out of the box . But , as usual , there are ways to improve its performance to make it even better . Here are a few tips to get the most out of your Wraith with minimal cash out of pocket , and a little time/effort spent at the workbench . <p> Soften up the suspension : <p> The Wraiths suspension is a little stiff out of the box , if you plan on just bashing with it as is . If you add scale accessories , a driver figure , spare tire , use a standard 6 cell stick pack , etc. it is probably about right . I left my Wraith pretty much stock , and found myself wanting a little bit softer suspension for those high speed rocky sections of trail . First thing I did was grab two packages of our " black " super soft comp shock springs , Part# AX30223 x 2 . I rebuilt all four shocks using our 30wt oil , our 3 hole shock pistons and soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can drill the existing holes out in the standard 2 hole pistons so they are just a tad bigger . Making this modification almost converts the Wraith to a " droop " suspension set-up , meaning there is very little " up " travel to the shocks , its almost all " down " travel . Under the its own weight sitting on a shelf , my shocks sit about mid-way into their overall stroke . How is that better you ask ? This made my Wraith a lot more stable at speeds , as it lowered the overall center of gravity . This mod also helps it floats over rocks at full speed a lot better too , because the shocks can cycle through their travel more efficiently . As the tires come off the ground at speed the shocks extend under the weight of the axles , which will help absorb that next bump in the trail . If I had to suggest only one modification to a fellow Wraith owner , this would be the tip I give them . It makes a huge difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The springs . <p> The shock ride height after making this mod . <p> Aluminum servo horn : <p> Another great mod is going to an aluminum servo horn on the steering servo , that is compatible with Futaba servos . Using an aluminum arm instead of plastic is a lot more durable , and helps your steering track a little straighter in the rough stuff at speeds . The plastic steering linkage will still flex enough in hard crashes to protect your servo . Plus , the stock Wraith servo has metal gears which most RTRs do n't  have . <p> Steel ball studs : <p> For performance reasons , I like to replace any plastic ball studs with steel . Ball studs are the pivot points that allow your links to cycle through their travel . The steel ball studs will smooth out the motion on your suspension and steering links . Over time dirt will work its way into either set-up and wear parts out . But , with steel ball studs the dirt is less likely to hinder link movement . This mod works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned earlier . All you will need is 4 packages of our steel ball studs/flanged balls , Part# AXA1331 x 4 . I do n't  have a link for these , but your local hobby shop or online retailer can get the correct parts with that number . <p> The ball studs/flange balls . <p> Taking time to make these few adjustments will make a pretty big difference in how a Wraith performs , especially at speed on rough terrain . Happy Trails ! !

We will cover more on the VMS wheels later on in this article . <p> Body off shot ! <p> Next option part we installed is a 25t aluminum servo horn , part number AX30836 . Axials HD aluminum servo horn provides more responsive steering with less chance of stripping the internal splines over the stock plastic servo horn . Clamping style head for secure mounting in high stress applications . Available in 23 , 24 and 25 tooth spline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AX30829 . HD diff covers protect ring and pinion gears from being damaged by rocks , just like their 1:1 counterparts , all while adding a little bling to your ride . <p> Aluminum axle lockouts are another available option , part number AX30789 . Axials aluminum axle lockouts are more rigid than the stock plastic lockouts , which will allow the vehicle to track better in all situations . <p> Another great upgrade is Axials aluminum shocks , part number AX30092 . Aluminum shocks provide better dampening than the stock plastic shocks , especially when mated with our Delrin shock pistons . Aluminum shock bodies also dissipate heat better than the stock plastic bodies . Oversize 3.5mm shock shafts for rigidity . Great for high power applications and long run times . Axial also offer a complete line of various springs to fine tune your suspension as needed , see the complete parts list below for more info . <p> Another option part that is hiding behind the HD diff cover is Axials HD ring and pinion gears , part number AX30395 . HD ring and pinion gears are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNC machined for precision . Hardened steel for durability . Great for high power applications . Axial also offers hardened steel overdrive ring and pinion gear sets , part number AX30401 , for a little extra wheel speed .

First option is the aluminum knuckles , part number AX30760 . Aluminum knuckles provide more responsive steering and help your vehicle track better at speeds and in the rocks . Another option shown is the Axial Aluminum C-hubs , part number AX30762 . Aluminum C-hubs also help your vehicle track more consistently in all situations , especailly when used in conjunction with our aluminum knuckles . Also notice the AR60 universal axles , part number AX30780 . Axial universal joint axles increase steering angle to 50 degrees , that 's 60% over the stock dogbone/drive cup setup . These universals provide smoother action for a higher performing , efficient drivetrain . The universal is oversized ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so its capable of handling extreme power . <p> Our intention with this project was to build a solid axled basher that can handle a lot of power .

I will be adding a set of their DH wheels and titanium steering links to this build . So , let 's get started ! ! <p> The first hop-up I started with is the under drive ring and pinion for the rear axle .

Remember that I moved the battery tray from the back to the front during Stage 1 . <p> Lay the chassis on its side and remove the four screws that hold the transmission into place . <p> With the transmission out of the chassis , you can remove the spur gear cover to access the motor mount screws . <p> Using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor from the transmission . <p> Now we can pull the pinion off the motors output shaft . <p> While I have the transmission out on the bench I am going to swap the stock motor plate for our new HD motor plate . The newer plate has integrated heatsinks machined into it to help dissipate heat . <p> In order to install the new motor plate we will have to remove the slipper clutch/spur gear assembly . Using a 7mm nut driver remove the slipper nut , spring and washers . <p> Slide the spur gear off the shaft , and remove the drive pin . <p> Using a 2.5mm driver remove the motor plate from the transmission . <p> Set the new motor plate in place and attach with the existing 3mm screws . <p> Next we can bolt the spur gear assembly back into place , do n't  forget to install the cross pin first . <p> Now we can install the new 55t motor . I already installed the pinion gear onto the motor shaft . We just need to set the proper gear mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear mesh is by inserting a small piece of paper between the spur gear and the pinion gear . Hold the two gears together with the paper in between and tighten your motor mount screws . Remove the paper and you should have a little bit of play between the two gears , which means you are good to go . <p> Re-install the spur gear cover next . Now you can bolt the transmission back into the chassis , and re-attach the driveshafts . <p> Next I will be swapping out the stock plastic shocks for our aluminum competition shocks . The aluminum shocks have a lot more consistent feel to them , and are smooth as silk when properly built . <p> One change I made here was to use the rubber bushings that come with the new aluminum shocks in the shock cap , instead of the plastic ball studs . In order to keep the bushings in good working order , and free to move back and forth a little , I swapped the self tapping plastic screws for machined M3 flathead screws . The finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushing like the stock self tapper would over time . I also went with a flathead screw over a buttonhead to let the upper shock cap pivot better as the suspension cycles . <p> Remove the four screws that hold the c-hub and knuckle assembly on the axle housing . <p> Next we need to remove the inner axles . But , to get them out of the housing you will need to remove one screw from each lower shock/link mount . Removing those will allow the flange on the inner axles to slide out with out hanging up on the link mount screws . <p> Slide the new aluminum c-hubs into place . I clocked them back just a little to help with tight turns . Make sure the c-hubs are oriented correctly , the longer ear on the hubs should be on the bottom of the axle . <p> Here you can see they are slightly clocked , but not to the most extreme point . <p> Install the c-hub screws top and bottom for both sides . <p> Grab the universals next . <p> Slide the universals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now you can re-install the two screws we removed from the lower link mounts to get the stock inner axles out of the housing . <p> You will need the bearings , king pin sleeves and kingpin screws from the old knuckle/c-hub assembly . So , pull them apart and grab what you need to build the new knuckles up and bolt them into place on the c-hubs . <p> If you are struggling with installing the new bearings , use the old outer axle to line them up properly and press them into place . <p> Install the kingpin sleeves into the new knuckles and slide them over the c-hubs . Make sure the kingpins sleeves stay in place . <p> You will need to replace the old self tapping knuckle screws with 10mm long machined M3 screws . The stock knuckles were held in place by plastic self tapping screws , but you cant use those screws in the new c-hubs as the hubs have a machined M3 thread in them . So , you will need some M3X10MM machined screws to complete this step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws per package , so one pack is enough to do the job . <p> Next we need to bolt the tie rod arms onto the knuckles . But , you will need to swap the stock plastic self tappers for machined screws again . Luckily they are the same length as the kingpin screws from the previous step , and you will have some leftover to use here as well . <p> Now we will assemble the Vanquish tie rod and drag link . Pretty straight forward , thread the rod ends onto the linkage and pop the ball studs into place . You will have to fine tune the lengths of both the tie rod and the drag link once they are bolted up , in order to ensure the tires are straight and the servo horn has even throw to both sides . <p> Next I installed my Vanquish DH comp wheels . They are machined aluminum , and the weight of them alone should be sufficient in most situations . If I find the front is too light I will add some weighted slugs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig as it sits now . <p> Mandatory flex shots . <p> That wraps up Stage 3 of this Ridgecrest crawler build . I am going to try and shoot some video of this stage too , just to see/show the difference in performance over Stage 2 .

Then , drilled the holes out using an 1/8 ? drill bit by hand . <p> 4 . With the holes in place on the plastic lid I then used my marker again to transfer the hole pattern from the lid onto the suspension links . <p> 5 . I removed the links and drilled two small .099 holes in each link over the needed hole pattern . Then , using a little lube , I ran an M3x.5 tap through all four holes in the links . <p> 6 .

Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot video looking from the front or back of the truck . Which is easily removable and also adjustable by sliding the links in or out of the rock slider mounts .

My question is , does the camera weight effect the performance of your truck ? Ground clearance or does it tilt ? If it does check out the little 19 gram mini waterproof POV camera that I offer it is called the SPARK and I think it would work well here .

So , we 've come up with a little guide identifying all the fun little scale parts Axial has fabricated for us . <p> Sit back , scroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battery Straps <p> The first part were going look at is Axials EXO Battery Straps . The two long pieces are the actual straps , but do you know what the other four are ? Well , I was n't aware either until I did a little snooping and found that the four pieces are used for Nitro engines ; carb covers and an exhaust pipe stop . All are made from a rubbery material that wo n't melt and have the Axial logo on them . Good parts to keep your Nitro engine safe from the elements . <h> AX31049 Axial Helmet Set ( Black ) <p> If you have an Axial Yeti or RR10 , youve probably seen these helmets . Included are three different styles motocross style with goggles and visor , open design with scary skeleton face and fully enclosed race helmet . A sticker sheet is enclosed with designs to spruce up whichever helmet you choose . I love that the skeleton has goggles . Safety first . <h> AX31125 Axial Yeti Fuel Cell <p> The Yeti Fuel Cell tree is a direct replacement for the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with a little tweaking could definitely be used in other vehicles . The tree includes the top and bottom of the cell , an additional top mount hose adapter , long and short fuel fillers and a mounting cage for the cell itself . This is a cool piece that I 'm sure some of you crafty builders would love to install in your rigs ! <h> AX31186 Axial M4 Rod End Set <p> The M4 Rod End Set parts tree includes a selection of different rod ends , washers and wire looms , but did you know there are also two cool parts attached to the tree as well ; a 3-piece ammo can that has a opening lid and a set of Texas Longhorns , you know , the kind that would make Boss Hog proud . <h> AX31317 Axial RR10 AR60 Axle Component Set <p> Axials RR10 AR60 Axle Components Set does n't  have any bazookas or barbed wire , but it does have a great looking differential cap that you could use on an AR60-equipped rigs . There 's some great detail there and , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> AX80037 Axial Interior Detail Parts ( Black ) <p> here 's one of the parts trees that 's got a little bit of everything ; some window cranks , arm rests , a variety of shift knobs , a couple gun racks and , of course , a shotgun and hunting rifle ( or sniper rifle depending on what you 're going to do with it ) . There 's also a pair of large , old school steering wheels and one that looks oddly similar to a GT model I had in my 1969 Ford Cortina . <h> AX80038 Axial Exterior Detail Parts ( Black ) <p> Another parts tree chock full of scale goodies , the AX80038 is all about the exterior ; windshield wipers , three sets of mirrors , a fire extinguisher and a large selection of spacers and mounting backplates , something that might be useful with other scale parts you might be mounting up . There 's also a small bag of mounting hardware and a chrome sticker sheet for the mirrors so you can check your hair while out on the trails . <h> AX80047 Axial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detail Parts is the same as the AX80037 black parts except , well , chrome . These are great for detailing out an older ride , or projects where bling is better than blackor where you just got ta have a chrome shotgun ! <h> AX80048 Axial Exterior Detail Parts ( Chrome ) <p> Like the interior set , the AX80048 Exterior Detail Parts are chrome versions of the AX80037 parts set . Mirrors , wipers , and a chrome fire extinguisher are included as is the vast selection of chrome spacers and mounting backplates . <h> AX80085 Axial Universal 5 Bucket Light Bar ( Black ) <p> Ready for some night crawling ? Axials AX80085 has everything you need in this universal set to create a roof-mounted 5-bucket setup . The mounting system allows you to angle the lights and mounts to fit a wide selection of bodies , and spacers and clamps keep everything nice and tidy . Just add one of Axials lighting systems and you 'll be ready to do it in the dark ! <h> AX80092 Axial EXO Linkage Set <p> Axial pulled a sneaky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paint it , detail it and set it on the seat in your scale rig just be ready to show a permit if you get pulled over . <h> AX80100 Axial EXO Chassis and Toe Block Insert Set <p> The AX80100 parts tree has some toe blocks , toe block inserts , a skid plate AND an AR15 rifle . Seeing this makes me want to buy 20 of these trees and build some sort of SWAT vehicle based on a SCX10 . No stealing my idea . <h> AX80105 Axial EXO Chassis Component Mounts <p> The next EXO parts tree is the AX80105 , containing some component mounts , a gear protector and an AK47 rifle . I cant wait to see some super scaler detail on the wood areas on this one ! <h> AX80112 Axial EXO Cage Lower Center <p> The AX80112 comes with a couple cage parts for the EXO Terra , but also a 2-piece , folding sand ramp . These can be painted silver , folded and strapped to the roof or side of your rig , allowing you to get out of sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allowed . This package has only one ramp so you 'll need to purchase two of these to get a matching set . <h> AX80119 Axial EXO RTR Links Parts Tree <p> The AX80119 EXO Links Parts Tree comes with six molded links , a pair of braces and the final rifle to our list of cool parts . This AR-10 is nicely detailed and would look great in a diorama or propped up next to Big Jim in his SCX10 Ram Power Wagon . Beer cans optional . <h> AX80125 Axial SCX10 Poison Spyder JK Brawler Lite Front Bumper <p> Clinging tight to the Poison Spyder brand , Axial has modeled up this replica JK Brawler bumper complete with mounting bracket and D-ring recovery hooks . A pair of buckets are molded in and ready for lights , and if you 're a crafty one , additional lights or even a winch can be mounted on the top flat area . <h> AX80129 Axial Roll Cage Top <p> Axials AX80129 Roll Cage comes with a pair of unexpected treats . The first is a nice racing steering wheel with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous racing orientation marker at the top .

@@36019009 @5019009/ <h> Brushed vs . Brushless Motors <p> Axial Racing RTR vehicles come with either two types of motors , brushed or brushless . To better understand why Axial offers the two different types , its helpful to- know the key differences between the two designs . As you 'd expect , both designs have their key differences and their advantages . <p> Brushed Brushed motors are the older technology of the motor world , but that does n't  mean they do n't  have their advantages . The biggest advantage is low cost . Brushed motors simply deliver a lot of bang for very little buck . Brushed motors come in many versions ; Axial uses a sealed end bell design with bronze bushings ( as opposed to ball bearings ) . This setup is highly robust . So , what makes a brushed motor brushed ? In simplest terms , brushes are hard conductors ( one positive and one negative ) that brush up against the spinning commutator in the center of the motor with positive and negative magnets on the inside of the can . These brushes are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin at an extremely high rate , but if the motor is kept dry and clean , it will last a very long time . Best of all , Axials brushed motors list for only $16 to $19 , depending on the turn selected . Another advantage of brushed motors is its throttle response . Brushed motors provide excellent slow speed control making them a great choice for rock crawlers where precise driving is key . <p> Brushless Brushless motors are basically built in the opposite manner of brushed motors . If you have a good understanding of brushed motors , think of brushless motors as the inside out version . The magnets spin and the coils of wire are inside the wall of the motors can or main casing . They do n't  require brushes , and are thus appropriately known as brushless. - An advantage of brushless motors is that they have a much longer lifespan since the main wear components have been eliminated . Brushless motors , such as the Vanguard 3150KV , are also more efficient , so they can provide best use of power ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers two brushless motors . One is 2900KV and the other is 3150KV . The higher the KV rating , the faster the motor . This is the opposite of how brushed motors are labeled .

@@36019011 @5019011/ <h> Maintaining Your Vehicle <p> Your Axial Racing vehicle is designed to handle a lot of abuse . It is amazing what the SCX10 , Wraith , Ridgecrest and other Axial machines can handle . As with a full-size vehicle , maintenance is key . With proper maintenance , your Axial Racing vehicle will be highly reliable each and every time you use it . Below are some suggestions to properly maintain your Axial vehicle . <p> Cleaning Clean your Axial Racing vehicle after each adventure . A few rags and brushes are all you need for most cleanings . A thorough cleaning will allow you to spot any damage and address . Your Axial vehicle will also perform better when it is clean . Electronics will run cooler , parts will spin smoother and faster and the vehicle will generally perform better when clean . Moving parts will also last longer when clean as dirt and grime between parts increases wear and friction . You can use easy to find WD-40 for most cleaning. - The WD-40 will not only clean the parts , but it will protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also look new . <p> Bent or Broken Parts You will be amazed with the amount of abuse your Axial Racing vehicle can withstand , but off-roading is tough on equipment and parts can be damaged . Before and after runs , visually inspect your vehicle . Look for any bent of broken parts . Inspecting your vehicle often will allow you to obtain parts before your next adventure and it will allow you to service parts that need attention before they fail and damage other components . <p> Wheel Nuts Your Axial rigs wheel nuts have a high quality nylon locking material built in and a lot of surface area to grab on the wheel . The nuts do a great job of staying secure , but should be checked and properly tightened before each run . The wheel nuts will also eventually need to be replaced . <p> Driveshafts The driveshafts are attached to the transmission and axles with set screws that pass through the driveshaft and through the shaft it is attached to . The design is extremely strong and reliable , but the set screw should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread locking compound ( use only medium strength thread locking compound ) should added to the threads on the set screw . If the end of the driveshafts is at all loose on the plastic main body of the driveshaft , the driveshaft should be disassembled so that the screws inside the driveshaft tubes can be tightened . <p> Drivetrain The drivetrain should spin freely with no binding . The best way properly test the drivetrain is to periodically remove the pinion gear from the motor and roll your Axial Vehicle by hand . There should be very little resistance and it should roll smoothly . If you suspect there may be a problem , disconnect the driveshafts and spins each axle by hand . This will allow you to isolate different parts of the drivetrain and identify if something is wrong and wheere the problem is . <p> Spur and Pinion Gears Carefully inspect each tooth on the spur and pinion gears . Remove any dirt and debris trapped between teeth . If any teeth are visibly damaged , the gear should be placed . Proper gear mesh should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesh is to place a small piece of notebook paper between the gears sliding the motor into position and then tightening down the two motor screws . Double check the teeth are making full contact and are not too tight or loose . <p> Slipper Clutch A loose slipper will wear out prematurely , so listen carefully when crawling . If you hear the slipper squeal when the truck is n't binding , it may be too loose . If the slipper never slips even when the truck is caught in an obstacle , it may be too tight and not protecting the drivetrain as its designed to . Longterm maintain of the slipper may require the slipper pad to be replaced . If the pad appears to be glazed or otherwise damaged , it should be replaced with part number AX30412 . <p> Steering and Suspension Links The steering on any off-road vehicle gets subjected to a lot of abuse . Its often the first to take a hit . Check the ball joints and brush away all dirt found in and around the joints . If the parts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly cleaned . If the ball joints are noticeably loose , they should be replaced . Parts tree AX80018 contains 16 inner part of the ball joints . Check and maintain the suspension links in the same manner as the steering links . <p> Tires Tires should be cleaned between runs . One of the best products for cleaning and refreshing your Axial Racing tires is Simple Green . Spray the tires with a generous amount of Simple Green on each tire and scrub each tire a wide handheld scrubbing brush . Lightly and carefully rinse each tire . Make sure not get water inside the tire . It is essential that you do not soak the tires. - After the tires are dry , if the tires are glued to the rims , check the bond all around the bead on each side of each tire and wheel combo . Check the entire circumference . <p> Shocks The cleaner your Axial shocks are kept the longer they will lastspecifically the seals . Dirt will accumulate under the shock body right where the shaft enters and at the bottom spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Check that the mounting hardware is snug and cycle each shock to make sure the operate smoothly . Listen to each shock . If you can hear air passing through the internal piston ( a squishing sound ) , the shocks should be rebuilt . Pay attention to how the shocks feels . The shocks should n't bind at all , but they also shouldnt have a noticeably lack of resistancea sign the shock is low on silicone fluid . <p> Hardware Screws can loosen over time . Checking the hardware now will go a long way towards preventing problems next time you hit the trail . It does n't take long to go through all of the hardware on any Axial Racing vehicle. - Make sure the screw heads are completely clean and free of dirt . This allows your wrenches fit and not strip out of the hardware . <p> Wiring Between runs , check all of the wiring . This includes the motor wires , battery wires and the speed control and steering servo wires . Inspect the insulation for damage . Any damaged should be repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires under the insulation should be exposed as uninsulated wires can short and cause severe damage . <p> Antenna The condition of the antenna will greatly impact the range capabilities and overall functionality of your radio system . Confirm that the antenna is not damaged and make sure the antenna is not in a position that it could be damaged . <p> Steering Check With a fully charged battery installed , turn on the radio and then the vehicle . Prop the vehicle up so that the tires are off the ground . Check the steering works smoothly in both directions . Make sure the steering does n't  bind in either direction and easily returns to center . <p> Transmitter Batteries Axial Racing 2.4GHz transmitters use four AA batteries .

The second method involves the far less obvious trick of scoring and snapping off the unwanted material . <p> When using scissors , two types of scissors are recommended , one set of traditional straight blade scissors and a pair of RC-specific body scissors with short curved blades . <p> Duratrax makes both the curved short bladed and straight short bladed scissors . The perfect setup is actually three total pairs . Add to the pair of previously described Duratrax scissors a pair of long straight bladed scissors . These are very handy for cutting long , perfectly straight lines such as the rocker panel area between wheel wells . The key is to avoid scissors with the fine serrations . Using the scissors is pretty straightforward . Just take your time and use longer blade scissors for long cuts so- you get a straight edge . <p> The second method of trimming a body requires a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the #11 blade . Revell , the model company , offers a high-quality knife that includes five #11 blades . <p> You may have seen glass cut by it being first scored with a sharp device and then snapped at the score line . Lexan RC bodies can be trimmed the same way . If you score the trim lines and then bend the excess material back and forth , the body should snap apart at the score line . Do not peel the Lexan extra material away from the body . This can go wrong and result in a tear across your expensive body . Overall , this technique takes some practice , but the end result can be very impressive . <p> While using these techniques can , with some practice , yield some great looking smooth results , you can still touch up areas occasionally . The best tool for the job is a rotary tool with a sanding drum . While you 'll find dozens of uses for a rotary tool , even if you only used it for finishing up a body , you 'll find its worth every penny .

@@36019026 @5019026/ <h> Build The Perfect Kit <p> The availability of ready-to-run products has had an incredibly positive impact on the RC hobby . Those looking to get into RC can do so quickly and easily thanks to preassembled vehicles such as the Honcho , Wraith , Ridgecrest and others . There is no denying that RTR vehicles have their place in this hobby . Axial , however , knows many enthusiasts want to experience building their own models . These are , after all , RC models . And , models and building go hand and hand . <p> THE RIGHT TOOLS As any carpenter can tell you , having the right tools can make all the difference . You do not need an entire tool kit or expensive collection to build an Axial kit as Axial includes the basics with its kits . Investing in quality tools is just that , an investment . To make assemble and maintenance go a lot faster and be a lot easier , hex drivers are highly recommended . Not only do hex drivers make the work easier , but they last significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Axial 's and Duratrax ) and hex drivers are far less likely to strip out hex screws . Buying a complete set of hex drivers such as Axial 's metric set ( includes five drivers ) will get you all of the drivers you 're likely to ever need . If you want to buy the wrenches one at a time , start with a 2 mm , followed the by 1.5 mm and 2.5 mm drivers . <p> AX20008 Axial Metric Hex Driver Set <p> Since a majority of the parts you have to assemble on RC kit come attached to a molded plastic parts tree , another valuable tool is a plastic cutter .

That works , but an even better idea is to get a workspace that can be left undisturbed for the duration of the build . The more space you have the better . Also make sure you have plenty of light . <p> The best way to keep a build organized is to use small paper bowels for the different parts bags .

@@36019027 @5019027/ <h> How to Properly Perform Repairs <p> You broke it . Now what ? You could do what most people do with their full-size vehicles when something goes wrong and pay someone to repair it , but where 's the fun in that ? Plus , you 're the one that hit that tree or drove off that ledge , so you might as well be the one that fixes your rig . Fixing broken parts may seem simple and , in general , it is , but there is a right way to go about it . Doing repairs correctly will save you time and money and who does n't like the sound of that ? <p> Clean It Odds are if you broke your Axial Racing vehicle you were using it in a way that also got it dirty . Step one in the repair process is to clean the vehicle . It does n't have to be spotless , but get all the loose dirt off and clean out the screw heads . This will make working on it easier and make the mess created on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with air gun nozzle is the best way to make quick work of a messy RC vehicle . If you do n't have a compressor , a cleaning brush and a few paintbrushes will get the job done . <p> Sort Parts Now that your RC car is clean do n't start just removing parts and tossing them on the bench . Before reaching for a wrench , get a bunch of small parts trays . They sell these at hobby shops , full-size tool and auto parts stores , but paper plates and small plastic bowls work just as well . Having a number of trays to put parts in helps you keep hardware with the component it came with and will making putting your Axial Racing vehicle back together much easier .. <p> I 'd the Damage With every separated and well organized , it 's time to access the damage . This will be easy to see with the vehicle clean and with all the parts separated . Grab a piece of paper and a pen and take notes of all the parts that need to be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but check all hardware on or near the clearly broken parts and the parts they attach to . For example , you break a steering hub on your SCX10 , also check the C-hub on the end of the axle , the steel axle and all of the hardware for damage . Having a complete list now will prevent the frustration of thinking you have everything you need only to have to return to the hobby store or wait for another order . <p> Replace Now , we 're finally at the parts-replacement stage ( the part most people jump right into ) . Even though you cleaned your vehicle before , make sure you thoroughly clean the parts that the new parts are being mounted to . Use a toothbrush and a product like WD40 to really get every piece of dirt off . Also , make sure you have thread-locking compound and grease for the hardware and parts that will need it . The thing to remember is to take your time . Install the parts carefully making sure properly seat each part and tighten each screw " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fixed , do n't just grab the throttle and go . This may seem like common sense , but most people do just that . If the repair was to the steering or drivetrain , place the vehicle on a stand , make sure it 's secure and slowly apply throttle . Performing a quick bench test will allow you to see and hear if everything is working properly . If the suspension was repaired , keep the vehicle off and slowly articulate the suspension . Again , this close and personal test will allow you to make sure nothing is loose , binding or otherwise still broken . Blasting down the street or across the lawn will not give you the viewpoint you need . <p> Resources Keep your Axial Racing manual handy because it 's one of the best resources you will have for your vehicle . Individual parts are listed in the back of each manual , but it can be hard to identify the correct part by name alone , so look in the manual at the exploded diagrams and on the pages that show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sold on what are called a parts tree . After you have identified the part(s) you need , check out the front of your manual , which shows all of the different parts trees . The parts tree number you need to order is in bold and also molded into a tab on the parts tree . The back of the manual also lists many option parts , so make sure you check if a heavy-duty version of the part you 're replacing is available . <p> Another great resource is the Axial Racing website you 're on right now . The website is the most update source of information on option parts for your Axial Racing vehicle . Also , all of the instruction manuals are online for easy access , which allows you to easily cross reference vehicles . You can find manuals for Axial Racing products under the SUPPORT menu button . To find all of the latest option parts from Axial Racing , click on PRODUCTS and then select option parts from the drop down menu .

@@36019034 @5019034/ <h> Proper Shock Care <p> Maintenance Axial shocks are built in a similar fashion to high performance off-road shocks and are engineered for extreme use on a variety of terrains . Being built to take abuse , you do not have to service them between runs . If your last run , however , included conditions such as fine dirt such as silt , sand or mud , it may be a good idea to remove the shocks , one at a time , from the vehicle . <p> After the shock is removed , clean the mounting hardware and mounting locations , on the chassis and shock , with a rag or paper towel soaked in WD-40 . A non-abrasive pipe cleaner is useful for cleaning the shock ends . While they do n't move a lot , these are moving parts and the cleaner they are , the longer they will last . <p> Remove the springs to make cleaning the shock easier and to easily judge how the shock 's condition . <p> A cheap toothbrush is a great tool to have in your collection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between runs , use the toothbrush to clean the dirt that can accumulate at the bottom of the shock bottom and on top of the lower shock mount . Carefully brush dirt away from these parts . You especially do n't want to inadvertently force dirt in the shock or even closer to the seals . The brush is also perfect for cleaning threaded shock bodies . <p> After cleaning the exterior of the shock , check that the screw-on cap and lower body cap are properly tightened . Next , slowly cycle the shock by hand . If the shock does not feel smooth , if it catches or feel like it gets stuck , you should rebuild all four shocks . There should be smooth , consistent resistance . Inside the shock , a flat piston with tiny holes in it is moving through silicone shock fluid , so you should feel some resistance when compressing the shock . If there is no resistance , you should rebuild all four shocks . <p> Rebuilding Tips Axials manuals outline exactly how to build shocks , but the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly build shocks . <p> Use a clean work surface . Clean your work area and then cover small area with paper towels . <p> Make sure the pistons are free of burrs . Check each piston carefully and remove any burrs or extra material with a sharp hobby knife . <p> Use new O-rings in the lower part of the shock body and use O-rings specifically made for RC shocks and make sure you use the correct size O-rings . You can use silicone shock fluid to coat the O-rings , but RC specific O-ring lubricant is highly recommended . Use generous amount and make sure the O-rings are completely coated . Muchmore Racing 's Shock Slime ( MMRC3523 ) is perfect for Axial shocks . <p> If you 're rebuilding the shocks , you should n't need to remove the lower shock end , but if you do , great care must be taken to not scratch the shaft 's surface . Duratrax has a solid brass tool ( DTXR1140 ) that allows you to tightly grip shock shafts with pliers without scratching the shafts . <p> Fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . To help trapped air escape from under the piston , cycle the shock slowly and without the piston breaking the surface of the fluid . Let the shocks sit upright for a few minutes to further allow air bubbles to rise and escape . Top off the fluid so that it just slightly domes . <p> Push the piston to the top and tighten down the top shock cap . If you place the cap in position and slightly rotate it counterclockwise , as if you were loosening it , this will let it drop onto the threads of the shock body and help prevent cross threading the cap . After this , slowly thread the cap on . Fluid should leak out as the cap is tightened , so have a paper towel wrapped around the shock . <p> A rag soaked with rubbing alcohol or denatured alcohol can be used to remove fluid from the shock body . <p> When reinstalling the shocks , make sure you do not over tighten the mounting hardware or the shocks will bind and not function properly .

@@36019036 @5019036/ <h> Suspension Tuning 101 , Part 1 <p> Most non-enthusiasts have no idea how well engineered hobby-grade RC vehicles are . Take , for example , the Axial Racing EXO Terra Buggy , which has a remarkably sophisticated suspension. - To take full advantage of the suspension design , you must understand the key elements . <p> Camber Modern RC vehicles ( and full-size ones too ) with independent suspensions most frequently use a design that employs a lower A-arm with an upper camber link . The RTR EXO uses a fixed camber link and can be upgraded with Axial option parts . The kit version includes an adjustable camber link . Camber is a measurement of how the top of the tire tilts toward or away from the vehicle . Camber is most easily viewed from the front of the vehicle . Camber is measured in degrees and when the top of the tire leans in toward the vehicle it has negative camber . When the top of the tire leans out it is positive camber . Zero degrees of camber is when the tire sits perfectly straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction during corning . As a vehicle leans to the outside going through a turn , negative with help the tire have a larger contact patch as the tire leans over . As with just about every suspension adjustment , there is a point of diminishing return , so do n't go overboard and dial in 5 degrees of camber . Adding negative camber to the front suspension will make the vehicle less aggressive and easier to drive . Adding negative camber to the front and rear helps keep the vehicle stable when sliding through rutted surfaces as the edges of the tires will be less likely to grab a rut and roll the vehicle over . <p> Front Toe Toe is a steering alignment term that describes how the tires , when viewed from above point in or out . When the front tires point in , the vehicle is said to have toe in . When the tires point out , the vehicle is appropriately said to have toe out . If both front tires are completely parallel to each other , when viewed from above , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helps a vehicle track straight . The vehicle wont drift as it 's driven straight without steering input . Toe out usually helps a vehicle with initial turn in . A vehicle with toe out will have quick reacting steering and dive into corners better . Too much toe " in or out " will scrub speed . <p> Rear Toe Like front toe , rear toe can be viewed from above and is a measurement of how the tires point in relation to the centerline of the vehicle . Like front toe , rear toe in will help a vehicle track straight and makes it easier to drive . While rear toe out is never used , less rear toe does help a vehicle rotate better in the corners . <p> Caster Caster is a measurement of how the front tire 's vertical steering pivot point or axis leans forward or back . Positive caster ( negative is n't used ) described how the steering point leans back , so that it is n't actually perfectly vertical . <p> Increasing caster helps a vehicle track straight as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves . Adding caster does , however , cause a vehicle to track wide when existing a corner . <p> Axial 's AR60 axles such as used on the Wraith and Ridgecrest feature an innovative C-hub design that allows for caster adjustments . <p> Ride Height Ride height is probably the simplest suspension adjustment to conceptualize . Ride height is a measurement of how high the vehicle sits . Front and rear ride height are separate measurements because they are often set to differently to achieve desired handling . <p> Ride height obviously impacts ground clearance and increased ride height allows a vehicle to more easily travel over rough terrain . What most people do n't realize is that ride height can influence traction and it does so in a somewhat counterintuitive manner . Increasing ride height raises the vehicle 's center of gravity and actually increases traction because there is more weight transfer . So , if more steering is desired , slightly raising the frontend of the vehicle will increase steering . <p> Camber Link Position If you look closely at an EXO you will notice that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer hub ( two on the front hubs and three on the rear hubs ) and on the shock tower ( four , front and rear ) . - The different holes allow you to run longer or shorter camber links ( adjustable links needed ) and to change the overall position of the link . It 's working that Axial 's aluminum shock towers offer six mounting positions . <p> Link length influences what is known as camber change ( sometimes called camber rise ) . To see camber change in action , carefully watch the tires as you compress the suspension by hand . You should notice your camber setting changing as the suspension is compressed . If you shorten the link , camber will increase as the suspension compresses . Longer front links will provide more overall steering . Shorter rear links will help the EXO drive rough , bumpy terrain . <p> At the shock tower of the EXO , you can raise or lower the link mounting point . This changes the vehicles roll center . The vehicles roll center impacts how much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often called body roll . Lowering the inner link mounting locations increases body roll .

@@36019042 @5019042/ <h> XR10 Build Part 5 Beadlocks <p> For this last installment of our XR10 build , I will cover the assembly of the beadlock wheels . This wheel is a completely new design . It is a true beadlock wheel , but it only requires the removal of 6 screws to change your tires . You can tune your foam or change the weight inside your wheels fast and easy . It is a real time saver when you are playing with different set-ups . <p> First thing we need to do is grab Bag " J " and our wheels . <p> Here is a break down of the parts required for each wheel . <p> Starting with the front wheels , we will install the internal weight rings first . <p> I attached the 2 halves of the rings together with one screw , inserted the weights into the center slot of the ring halves , and wrapped the ring around the wheels . Its time to install the second weight ring screw and lock nut . <p> For tires we will use Pro-Line G8 Chisels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the beads out over the front and back of the wheels . <p> Now flip the wheel 180 degrees , grab the second half of the wheel , and slide it into place . There are grooves molded into both halves to keep everything lined up . <p> Slide the second half of the wheel all the way in until it stops . <p> Now flip the wheel over and set your beadlock ring into place . Line up the holes in the rings with the holes in the wheels . <p> You can attach the rings by hand with a 1.5mm Allen wrench . But , I suggest investing in a decent cordless driver/drill , with some small metric hex attachments . It just makes assembling the wheels so much easier and faster . I personally use Hitachis DB 3DL . <p> I set the torque on the clutch to 9 , removed , and reinstalled my rock rings several times without stripping anything . <p> I usually start with 3 screws and insert them into the ring holes that do n't  have the weight retainer ring relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring almost bottoms out on the wheel . <p> Flip the wheel over and make sure the backside bead is seated properly . <p> If the backside of the tire is seated properly , flip the wheel over again and tighten each screw down a few turns until all 3 screws are tight . If you try to tighten 1 screw all the way up at a time you will run the risk of stripping out your screw holes or the hex in the head of the screw . <p> Now insert your last 3 screws and tighten them down as needed . <p> The total weight of the stock wheel with the weight rings and tires installed is 12.3 ounces , a perfect starting point . <p> Next we will install the wheels on our freshly built XR10 . Grab the four small M3 set screws , drive pins , and hexes . <p> Insert the drive pins into the outer axles . <p> Install the small M3 set screw about half way into the drive hex with a 1.5mm driver . <p> Next , slide the hex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set screw . The set screws do n't  have to be tightened down with much pressure , just snug them up to hold the hex in place . Now is not the time to practice your Hulk impersonation people . <p> Slide the wheel over the hex and outer axles . Then tighten them down with the supplied 4mm lock nut . <p> There you have it . The finished product : <p> Well , that wraps up our box stock XR10 build , minus painting the body and installing the electronics . We will go into more detail on those aspects soon too . Only thing I changed from the manual is the rear shock ears . I moved them down one hole from what the manual suggests to level out my ride height . <h> 6 Comments : <p> autry hailey Posted on 2010-09-08 17:22:05 <p> I 'd like to thank Brandon for helping me put on my rear stear for my ax10 i wish there was some way i could send u guys a picture by the way great write up .

@@36019048 @5019048/ <h> Vanquish " Currie Rock Jock Axle Install Wraith <p> As some of you may have seen , I recently wrote an article about swapping stock SCX10 housings out for the aluminum Currie Rock Jock axle housings from Vanquish Products . Vanquish has now taken these axle housings a step further by offering them for the Wraith as well . The assembly on these axles is very similar to the SCX10 version , which is fairly simple . The two biggest differences between the axles is the SCX10 ring and pinion assembly is centered on the axle , and the axle tubes are equal lengths . The Wraith version has the offset ring and pinion assembly with one short axle tube and one long . <p> I came back from lunch a few days ago to find that the " Vanquish Fairy " had left some parts on my desk for me . One quick look and I knew exactly what was in the package . Time to install some bling on my custom Wroncho build . Let 's get busy ! <p> A shot of the front and rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here you can see all the parts are sealed in separate bags to prevent damage during shipping . <p> Once you have your old axles torn down , grab the pinion gear and the two bearings used to support it . <p> Install a bearing on the pinion shaft and press it into the axle housing by hand . <p> Now set your ring gear assembly into place . <p> Use the supplied M3 hardware to secure the bearing caps that hold the ring gear assembly . <p> Time for the axle tubes .

@@36019054 @5019054/ <h> Crawler Setup Key Elements <p> Whether your idea of competition is attending a national championship or one-upping your friend at the local park , getting your rock crawler- dialed in for top performance is an obvious plus . Out of the box , your Axial vehicle is setup for high performance , but so is everyone else 's . You need an edge . The following tips cover the key elements that you should address when you want to have the best setup crawler possible . Every aspect of tuning is not covered . These are the key elements . Also , as you learn about setting up a rock crawler you 'll quickly see that almost everything is a compromise ; what works for one type of competition and/or terrain does n't  necessarily work for another . <p> Tires Tires profoundly influence performance " maybe more than anything else . While there is no single best tire , you want to make sure you have the best tire for the conditions you 're running on . Also , not all rocks are the same , so there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the softer the compound is better . The compromise here is wear and the need to get the tire 's foam insert right for the weight of the vehicle . Axials softer and stickier compound is called R35 ( white dot ) . <p> While outfitting your rig with new tires will cost you , it is money well spent . You can learn more about picking the right tire here . <p> Center of Gravity Specifically where your center of gravity ( CG ) is located is n't important " meaning you do n't need to calculate its exact position . What is of key importance is that the CG is low " as low as you can possibly get it . A lower CG is always better . On a rock crawler , an optimized CG will help on climbs , descents and side hills . <p> There are a number of ways to lower your CG . First , identify your heavy components and try to identify ways to mount them lower . Sometimes lowering a component is n't possible , but lighter options are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're using a NiMH battery , a LiPo will make a profound difference . If you 're already using a LiPo , consider a smaller pack . It 's understandable that if you 're trail riding you want maximum runtime . Just know that the compromise of a big battery with a lot of capacity is a higher CG . Instead of one large battery , consider two packs wired in parallel with one mounted on each side of the chassis . Another way to lower the center of gravity is to add weight to your vehicle down low such is in the wheels or on the axles . The problem with making your vehicle heavier is that it can rob power and decrease durability . <p> A great way to lower the CG is to the body as much as possible . You will need to open up the wheel wells with body scissors , but doing this will make a big difference in handling . <p> Maneuverability If you 're running a course with gates and judges tracking the use of reverse and each - touch of a gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If available , high clearance knuckles combined with universal axles provide maximized steering throw . If you 're running a G6 or similar event , this can move down your list of importance . <p> Weight Distribution Weight distribution , or weight bias , is a close cousin of CG . Your crawler will perform better on climbs if more weight is located over the front axle than the rear . This is why it is better to have the battery mounted up front . While this makes for a tighter squeeze and is a little harder to access with the body on , the end result is improved weight bias . <p> The difference between a front weight bias and a low CG is that with a front weight bias , you can have too much of a good thing . A 60/40 split is probably ideal . Like CG , however , it is best to start by moving components as opposed to adding weight . <p> Durability There are drivers who can compete in competition after competition and never break a single part and then there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Axial has numerous upgrade parts that improve durability , but you do n't need to buy them all at once . For crawlers it 's best to start at the front ( aluminum servo horn , aluminum steering knuckles , aluminum steering links ) and work your way back ( heavy-duty gears , aluminum rear axle lockouts ) . The only exception to the front to back rule of thumb is driveshafts . <p> Ground Clearance Increased ground clearance allows a vehicle to travel over obstacles without struggling or possibly getting stuck . The axles are the lowest components on the vehicle and the most likely to come in contact with obstacles . Without major modifications , the only way to raise axle clearance is to use taller tires . <p> Center skid plate clearance is increased when taller tires are installed and when the suspension height is increased . The latter , however , adversely impacts the CG so proceed with caution . <p> Speed Rock crawling has changed . It was n't that long ago that rock crawling was literally crawling . Now , competitions are entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the type of competition . The key here is to know what you 're getting into . A G6 competition is going to require you and your vehicle to cover some significant ground in the shortest amount of time possible . A 55-turn motor might be good for climbing , but too slow for the long spaces between checkpoints . If you 're running a G6 , consider setting up vehicle so that it 's faster than a brisk walk . In other words , it should be closer to 10 mph than 5 mph . Over 10 mph and you might be giving up more crawling performance than you should , but it really all depends on the terrain . If you 're running brushless , a high voltage , low Kv setup provides the best of both worlds . <p> If you 're running on a super technical course with extremely challenging obstacles , a slow and torque-based setup might be ideal . Even then , however , having some wheel speed at your disposal can come in handy on many obstacles . <p> Articulation If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your Axial Racing vehicle , you 're mistaken . The only thing massive suspension twisting articulation is good for is flexed out photos . In the real world , it will hurt far more than it ever helps you . In stock form , your Axial Racing vehicle has all the articulation it needs . More will just allow it to get twisted up like a pretzel . <p> This article explains why articulation is often misunderstood and overrated . <p> Suspension StiffnessRock crawlers generally work best with slightly stiffer rear springs than front springs and you want to avoid an overly soft suspension that easily collapses when side hilling . Most people do n't consider how increasing the weight of the vehicle with hop-ups and accessories might increase the overall weight and thus require stiffer springs . Stiffer suspension also resist torque twist far better than soft , mushy suspensions.

The transmission for the Wraith is still based off our proven AX10 and SCX10 transmissions . Assembly is still very similar as well , with just a few minor changes . So , let 's get started ! <p> Grab your slipper drive gear shaft , 20t drive gear and 1.5x8mm cross pin . Slide the cross pin through the hole in the end of the shaft . <p> Now slide the 20t drive gear into place over the pin . <p> Install a 5x10mm bearing on each side of the 20t drive gear . <p> Slide the shaft into the top hole in the transmission case . <p> Install two more 5x10mm bearings into the small plastic idler gear , then slide the 5x18mm shaft through the bearings . <p> Insert the gear into the transmission case beside the first gear/shaft assembly . <p> Now its time to assemble the main spool gear . Everything needed for this step . Notice I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instructions , that is suppose to be sandwiched between the transmission outputs . Its not needed , that is a misprint in the manual . <p> Install the main drive gear between the two transmission outputs . <p> Add a dab of thread lock to the screws that will hold the main drive gear assembly together . Its not noted in the manual , but it is a good idea . These screws see a lot of stress , especially with big motors and batteries . <p> Go around the 3 screws holding the main gear assembly , and torque them down as evenly as you can . Then install the 8x16mm and 15x21mm bearings over the outputs . <p> Now add a thin layer of grease the main drive gear . <p> Drop the main gear into the transmission case . Give the whole assembly a spin to spread the grease evenly over the gears . <p> Moving on to step 20 . Everything required to complete this step . <p> Slide the 2nd half of the transmission case into place . <p> Install the small plastic spacer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Slide the spacer into the recess in the transmission housing . <p> Install the backside of the spur gear cover into place over the slipper shaft . <p> Set the motor plate into place over the spur gear cover . <p> Install the 3x15mm self tapping screw into the transmission case to tie the two halves together . <p> Add a dab of thread lock to the 3x25mm screws for the motor plate . <p> Thread the 25mm screws into the motor plate , and torque them down evenly as needed . <p> Moving on to step 21 , grab everything you need to build the slipper clutch . <p> Start with assembling the spur gear . Grab the outer slipper plate , spur gear , three 3x6mm cap head screws and three flat washers . <p> Slide the flat washers over the screws , slide the screws through the spur gear and thread them into the outer slipper plate . Torque the screws down evenly . <p> Now slide the second 1.5mm pin into place in the slipper shaft . <p> Install the inner slipper plate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into plate so the friction pad is sandwiched between the slipper plates . <p> Install the biggest flat washer into place on the slipper shaft , part number AXA1091 . <p> Slide the slipper spring into place next . <p> Install the smaller flat washer , part number AXA1071 . <p> Now start the M4 Nylock screw onto the slipper shaft . You will need a way to hold the transmission outputs still while you tighten down the slipper clutch . Easiest way I found was inserting something into the transmission output holes . Then tighten down the slipper clutch as needed . I usually tighten mine all the way down until the nut stops , then back it off 1-2 full turns for a good starting point . <p> Slipper clutch complete . <p> Next we will tackle the spur gear cover , and finish the transmission assembly .

Every team had one thing in mind , " beating Jake Hallenbeck ! " As things were getting started and heat races were being randomly drawn , Jake found out he had been drawn to start in the back of the pack . Starting in the back forces Jake to work his way through slower traffic , which sometimes is a challenge in itself on a course like this . <p> With the two other power house teams of concern drawing the same heat race , this would give us an idea of how the rest of the day was going to go . Jake found himself being held up by certain drivers , slowing him down considerably . By the end of the race , Jake had worked his way up to finish 2nd behind his closest competitor in the points standings . This was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going over the car in the pits , Jake found out that they had a transmission cooler failure . Without a spare cooler , they decided to bypass the trans-cooler altogether and hope for the best . <p> Starting in the back of heat race 2 once again meant that Jake would have to rely on his skills to get him out in front to secure a better starting position for the main event . As the race started and Jake charged through the pack , he suffered a broken axle in the first rock pile . He maintained his pace the best he could to finish that heat in what appeared to be 4th place . Jake and his team quickly went to work pulling the axle , and in the meantime damaged the inner seal . <p> Fortunately , with Trail Gears large fill cap on their axles , they were able to get a pry bar in there so they could get the axle changed without having to pull the entire axle apart to put the seal housing back in . As it was , they finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event ! <p> When- the teams lined up for the main event , I could see Jon Cagliero starting in the front row . Jon was only two points behind Jake in the points race . Jake was forced to start mid-pack and have to work his way through traffic once again ! With the lineup in place and the sun in their eyes , the race for the Championship was about to begin ! <p> From what I could see , Jake got a great hole shot and by the first and second rock pile he found himself in 3rd place . He drove the wheels off his bomber buggy and began to reel in the leadersuntil his engines heating issue began to come back and haunt him . He was forced to pace himself for the longer main event so he could be in the hunt at the finish . He maintained his 3rd place position throughout the race until he got over taken by a car during a yellow flag . <p> Out of his control at that point , Jake knew he needed to gain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to keep his lead in the points standings . With one lap to go , Jake overtook that 3rd position again but was running out of time to catch the leaders . When the race came to an end , Gary Ferravanti Sr. crossed the line first , followed by Jon Cagliero , and- Jake finishing in 3rd and collecting another podium finish ! <p> With the results of the race in place , it was time to figure out the point standings and who would be the 2014 Season Champion ! With Jon Cagliero finishing the race in 2nd and Jake finishing in 3rd , it meant that they were tied in points for the 2014 season . With nothing in the rule book stating what to do in the case of a tie , John Goodby of Nor Cal Rock Racing decided to go with a motocross rule that states whoever crossed the finish line first between the two points leaders would be the new Champion . <p> Like the true Sportsman and Champion that Jake Hallenbeck is , he looked at Goodby and stated , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the rule books in the future , I am good with that . " In the same breath , Jake asked John if he could deliver the Championship trophy to Jon Cagliero himself . Goodby agreed as long as he could be present . They together they delivered the trophy to Jon Cagliero and named him the 2014 Nor Cal Rock Racing Champion ! Its never easy in racing to except a 2nd place finish , but Jake did it with grace and style . <p> As the season concludes , I look forward to seeing if Jake can pick up new sponsors in the off season so he too can upgrade his rig to what most of the powerhouse rigs are running . Jake proves to me that you can stay on the podium with driving skills alone , but to be able to win races consistently you have to equal the playing field and run Independent Front Suspension with big horsepower ! <p> All in all , in two years of racing the Ultra4 class , Jake has achieved a Nor Cal Championship , a tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rookie of the Year Award , and is still in contention in the 2014 Ultra4 Racing Series on driving ability alone .

You know when you pull into the gas station you spend a minute looking around your rig checking any for fresh for fluids on the ground . The dribbles brings a quick double take and brings the pulse up ! Closer inspection reveals that it is in fact ours and its coming out of the rear differential ; and its enough to be truly worried ! <p> Off to the local auto parts store we go ! <p> With our past off-road experience we have all heard the noise , smelled the smell and know it only ends in disaster to push a rear-end with no fluid . Its one thing when your racing ; just call the troops and drag it onto a trailer , but this was our sole source of transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " get after it mode " like this ! What we found was that the axle center section gasket was seeping oil on the left side of the cover . We dig out the tools and check for loose bolts and find that we indeed have loose bolts . Let 's pause and sidebar for a moment here . This is the first real shakedown with the new Currie axles . These axles come un-assembled allowing us to install our specified gearing and such so this is not a Currie fault . With shakedowns , things just loosen up and when you have custom stuff like this , its going to happen ! So , we simply re-tightened all the bolts on the rear housing and pulled the fluid dip stick on the axle ! Yes , kindacool , the Currie Rock Jock 60 's have dipsticks to check fluid levels ! <p> Pulling the dipstick out reveals there is gear oil in the axle but we do not have an indicator mark on the dip sticks . We scratch our heads at this point and call up the Currie crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fluid is suppose to be in the axle ? We were informed that upon installation , add the recommended XXX quarts and make a mark on the dipstick indicator for future reference . OOPS ! ! ! Service them enough and I guess you would n't need the indicators but in this situation , it would be nice to know if we are in the safe zone or the " not drive home " zone . <p> While ScottG is on the phone with Currie Enterprises <p> Brad is putting the " pinch-mod " on the muffler so we get better fuel mileage on the way back home . We ask him to change those muffler bearings while he is in there too . hehehe He is actually bending the muffler back out as the muffler got the ledge-slide-pinch .

@@36019069 @5019069/ <h> Indoor Crawling Course Driving Tips <p> In many parts of the country , hobby stores have setup indoor crawling courses so that their customers can crawl year round . This is , of course , great , but crawling indoors can be radically different than outdoors . There are two basic types of indoor rock crawling courses . One is made out of actual rocks placed indoors . The second type is simulated rock . Both present different challenges . <p> The courses made out of rocks moved indoors are usually a large collection- of many smaller rocks ranging from baseball-sized to rocks about the size of basketballs . Some courses may have some bigger rocks , but that 's fairly rare , as the smaller the rocks are easier to get indoors . Piles of small rocks are very different than large exposed rocks found outdoors . The problem is all of the gaps and holes created between all of the rocks . When navigating these courses , the vehicles tires are constantly dropping in these holes . This can be brutal on the vehicles . When tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension and especially the drivetrain take a real beating . Extremely careful line selection is needed to avoid as many of these holes as possible . A suspension setup with less articulationspecifically droop or down travelwill also make a huge difference as the tires will be less likely to fall in holes . Less droop will make the tires more likely to glide over the gaps between rocks . You can fabricate function limiting straps out of items such as shoelaces or cable ties . You do n't  want to take away all of your suspensions functionality , but limiting droop will often considerably help on many indoor rock crawling courses . <p> Another type of indoor course is the manmade type that is often fabricated out of spray foam insulation that goes on as a sprayed foam and then expands and hardens . When painted , this can made for some very realistic terrain . The hardest part about adapting to this surface is coping with inconsistent traction , which is pretty common outdoors as well . The difference is outdoors you can see the difference in terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , rock , smooth rock , etc. and can change your driving style to suit . On these manmade foam courses , you often cant see how the surface is wearing . Sometimes you can see the paint or bed liner coating that is often used completely worn off , but often it looks the same but is completely smooth . Keep in mind too much traction can often hurt your efforts a lot more than too little traction . When traction is low , you slip and slide . That can be a struggle , but you can often just keep trying . When you unexpectedly encounter too much traction on a climb , your rear tires can bite in and flip you over backwards . The key is to keep a careful watch on not just the obstacles in your path but also the terrains surface . <p> With both types of indoor courses one of the best things you can do is pre-walk the course . You do n't  need to actually walk on the course , but you should walk along the course and envision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle as it goes and predict where you find difficulty . Really examine the course for tire-grabbing holes and look for smooth and rough surfaces that could present problems .

( or longer ) servo lead extension . <h> Step 1 <p> Before installing the LEDs in the light buckets , there is a little bit of prep work that needs to be done first . The buckets have provisions for 2 LEDs ; 1 standard headlight and one smaller turn signal . Since I wanted to have both sockets use the super bright LEDs ( for a headlight and driving/fog light ) , I had to use the reamer to open the hole up in the smaller socket to fit the larger LED . Widen the hole in small increments , test fitting the LED a couple times until the fit is nice and snug . <p> For some added detail , I highlighted the area with a silver Sharpie . I think it turned out pretty cool looking and having it mounted behind the Lexan body helps protect it . <h> Step 2 <p> Once you have the front buckets mounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two solutions to securing the LEDs ; you can use the supplied cap and screw ( left LED ) or Shoo Goo ( right LED ) . Either method works great but since I did n't  have enough of the small 2-56 screws to complete the project , I opted for Shoo Goo . <h> Step 3 <p> Using the same procedure , install the buckets and LEDs on the rear of the Retro TT body . You 'll need to ream out the smaller hole in this bucket as well . Since I was using the red tail light stickers on the rear of the Retro body , I opted to use white LEDs . You could also use red ones here instead for more red lighting I listed the red LED part numbers at the end as well . <h> Step 4 <p> Route the rear LED power leads along the rear cage and secure with the black tape . This helps keep the wires away from the spinning tires . If you have some available , you can feed the wires through some shrink tubing for added protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LED bar . A slit can be cut into the roof to pass the wires through . We wont get into detail about building it its pretty simple . Just take a little extra care to make sure its mounted square on the roof . <h> Step 6 <p> Flip the Retro TT body over and feed both the front and rear LED power leads into an AX31097 3-Port High Output LED Controller ( use double-sided tape to secure the controllers on the body ) . The roof mounted LED light bar will connect to the high-output port on the rear 3-Port High Output LED Controller . Masterfully tape all the wires down using the clear tape . <h> Step 7 <p> Feed the 3-Port High Output LED Controller leads to the side of the body and tape them down using the clear tape . Take your Y-connector and connect them as shown . The LED controller wires use a 2-wire , mini JST plug our Y-connector has standard 3-wire plug . Just make sure the black wires match up and you 'll be good to go . You can add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Step 8 <p> Next , well be installing the 6 ? extension , so start by removing the little door on the bottom of your TT to expose the receiver compartment . You may need to pop the receiver off of the tape used to secure it to make this a little easier . You 'll also need to remove the little black spacer used in the clear silicone grommet . Well be filling that space with the new 6 ? wire . <p> I found it way easier to feed the 6 ? extension down to the box from the top of the truck and into the box . Insert the 6 ? extension plug into your receiver with the negative wire ( black or brown ) towards the outside of the receiver . Press the wire into the clear silicone grommet , making sure its down below the top of the grommet . <h> Step 9 <p> Turn the truck over and inspect how much of the 6 ? extension you have available . This picture shows an adequate amount you 'll need . Flip the TT back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up any additional wire into the receiver box . Replace the receiver box cover . <h> Step 10 <p> Install the plastic interior in place , connect the lighting power wires ( black to brown in this case ) and fit the Retro body to your TT . Weve left enough slack in the wire to remove the body without having to unplug the wires each time , but if you feel its too long you can always shorten the lead by pulling a little more into the receiver box . <p> And just like that , we 've got some very bright lights on our Retro bodied TT ! here 's an example of how it should look when you 're finished :

@@36019087 @5019087/ <h> Building the full size SCX10XJ : Part 1 <p> When setting out to build a trail worthy rig , so many things go through your mind . What do you expect from the rig ? What do you plan to do with it ? What budget do you have to work with ? These are all extremely important things to consider when selecting the donor vehicle . However , just know that no matter what you plan for , there will be extras needed , to include the expectations , plans , and budget . Building a 4+4 vehicle to go deep into the elements is not an easy task , and like most things in life , you get what you pay for . This means you have to outfit your choice with the best components available within your budget that will allow you to attain your goals . <p> This is not at all unlike developing the new SCX10 , as all of the same parameters are considered , to include performance expectations and budget restraints . Not budget restraints for development , but budget restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forums and see what people would like to see in the Axial vehicles . We are forced to make some difficult decisions when finalizing the package , as we want to include the world with these rigs , but also do n't  want to ask for $699 for an RTR to get in the game . It is like that with all Axial products , so we do our best to aim for the sweet spot , enough features to perform at the top level , with a reasonable price tag . This is not an easy task . We are faced with the same decisions when building a full size rig . Do we want a supercharged V8 , 1000 minimum on the RTI ramp , seating for 4 , bulletproof axles ? Of course we do , but the budget does n't  allow for all of them , so we settle for what we can and have a blast doing it . <p> One of the most common things we read is . " Oh no , not another Jeep vehicle " , well , I am here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so get over it . The Jeep brand is synonymous with the art of back country exploration with extreme reliability , exactly what we strive for with our little brand . It is a perfect marriage and we are happy . <p> When looking into new options for the new SCX10 , we did what all outdoor enthusiasts do , we went into the woods to think about it , to do a little research . We were checking out all the rigs out on the trail and noticed that the XJ was a very popular rig for the most hardcore wheeler and for family back road exploration . We saw XJs that were exo-caged on 40 's all the way to bone stock 4+4 's loaded with the whole family and dog . This platform was exactly what we were looking for . It is one of the most popular 4+4 vehicles ever built , with millions of them on the road . Some say that Jeep actually invented the SUV with this release . It was not adapted right away for off-road use , as the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) looked down upon these Jeeps , calling them cars with big tires , and promptly showing their owners the direction toward the nearest shopping mall or soccer field . <p> Some XJ inspiration we found on YouTube <p> I personally had this experience with my 1993 Jeep grand Cherokee , I was given directions to the soccer field , immediately preceding my climbing an extremely nasty Granite rock face on Los Coyotes Indian reservation back in 1996 . The CJ owners immediately began to bicker and argue that the other should climb it . Neither one did , nor did they express themselves again to me on the trail . They learned that day that a Unitized chassis was n't the end of the world , and that coil springs are like magic . The Cherokee ( XJ ) shared the same front suspension with the ZJ , though the XJ had leaf springs in the back , something the Jeep guys were used to back then . Any of the XJs and ZJs on the trail were hand built , as there were very few aftermarket components available with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger tires . We told some of our JK friends about our XJ desires and they immediately started flowing some memes our way , most of which we cant publish , but here are a few gems that made us laugh <p> Thanks for the support guyssheesh . <p> Fast forward 20 years , and these old grocery getters , mall crawlers or soccer field shuttlers are now extremely common to find on the trail . The off-road community has more than accepted them and many aftermarket companies now make a decent living supporting them . The hard part , finding a clean one-owner version with no rust and low miles , kind of like finding a Unicorn . One of Axials more predominant partners , Currie Enterprises , was at the forefront of developing suspension for these rigs so that they could be raced in a desert series called Jeep Speed back in the day . We consulted the Currie family and were introduced to Matt Chapman , the owner of the Cherokee that we based our SCX10XJ off of . As we have done in the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale rigs ( see here ) to go out and experience what they can do , and stay on the forefront with regards to what the community is doing . At this time , Matts Cherokee was bone stock , as it had just been purchased and not modified yet . We elected to team with Matt and the Curries in effort to help develop the Full size XJ into an awesome trail machine all the while developing and testing our SCX10 II in tandem . <p> Here is a shot of Matts XJ when he got it , no rust with 150K miles <p> After a good amount of research , we started to compile a list of necessities . We knew the rig had to be able to go with 4 door JKs on 37 's , as most of Matts friends were rolling newer JKs . We needed at least 35 ? tires . Fitting 35 's under the Cherokee would require some proper fender flares and keeps the cops in Moab at bay . Notch Customs said " 35 ? tires with a 4 ? lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension system for the XJ as well as their bulletproof Rock Jock 44 axles , and you know we love the performance of Icon Shocks . So , what we really needed was some armor . We looked long and hard at so many companies making XJ parts , and there is some awesome stuff out there . Russ at Notch Customs introduced us to JCR Off-Road , who ended up having one of the most complete armor systems available . Then we needed some lighting , the natural choice was Rigid powered by sPOD . Almost forgot wheels and tires . In effort to make the full size version look more like the RC , we elected to run a 35X12.50X17 BFG KO2 All Terrain wrapped around Method Mesh wheels . The 17 ? wheel looks closer to a 1.9 than a 15 ? wheel . Of course we needed some nice tone out of the 4.0 straight 6 , so the XJ would need a Magnaflow exhaust . We had some details to sort but the main wish list was assembled ! <p> First things first , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through everything mechanical .

@@36019094 @5019094/ <h> Jessi Combs Attempts Land Speed Record <p> After receiving an invitation to the Alvord Desert dry lakebed in southeast Oregon to witness Jessi Combs attempt at breaking the women 's world land speed record , a record that was set by Kitty O'Neil back in 1976 at a speed of 512.70 miles per hour , there was no doubt in my mind that I needed to be there for the full experience . I had less than a week to figure out a plan and make it happen . There was no way I was going to miss my friend attempt such a historical moment it 's a world record for crying out loud ! ! <p> Jessi had mentioned the plan of making speed runs over September 23-25th . Upon my arrival to the massive lakebed in what seemed like the middle of nowhere , the North American Eagle ( NAE ) was in the pits and I assumed they were just going over the car from the days run . I was quickly informed that Ed Shadle ( co-owner of the NAE ) had attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the car was not steering properly , though they seemed confident the issue figured was out . <p> I was n't sure about Jessi , but I hardly slept a wink that first night at the lakebed . Never having been around anything of this nature my mind was racing with thoughts . How was I going to shoot something traveling over five hundred miles per hour ? Where was I going to shoot fromthe start line or the finish lineor maybe the the mid point of the 9 mile course ? I did n't even know where the starting line was yet ! There were so many things to think about and morning was going to come quick ! As I laid there taking in the whole scene of being out in the middle of a lakebed with the stars beaming down upon me , my mind was exhausted and I finally drifted away . <p> Before I knew it I was awake but it was n't even daylight yet . It was n't long before the team was filtering into the pits and going over the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what it should be doing , they lowered it onto the trailer and was headed for the starting line . I noticed Ed out front picking up several loose little rocks from in front of the cars path . He informed me it was to prevent them from being sucked into the jet engine and potentially creating any damage to the J-79 jet engine . A few short minutes later he was geared up and inside the vehicle as it appeared to be all systems go . I put in my earplugs and anxiously waited to see how this all went down . As the jet engine ignited and began to wind up , Jessi pulled the tire chucks and everyone moved off to the side and out of the way . Ed and the crew exchanged thumbs up and the car headed down it 's path . It appeared everything was going as it should , though how was I to know with the giant dust cloud it kicked up. - Still trying to keep my eye on the race car , I noticed everyone was already loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I wasted no time and was on hot pursuit following everyone towards the finish line 8- miles away . It 's quite a sight seeing all the chase cars struggling to stay outside everyone 's dust at that speed , much like an off road race for the win . Approaching the NAE I could see Ed had made it most of the way down the course and was already being interviewed by the awaiting film crew . Someone called out the speed of which he was , which clocked at roughly 270 mph . Ed replied that he had fought the wheel the whole way down the course , to which the car continued to steer to the left and was therefore going to have to take the car back to the pit and continue to be worked on . Once in the pits , the crew went right back to work , bleeding all the lines again to make sure there was n't any air in the system . <p> While all of that was going on , there was another discussion between Ed and Jessi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having to make and not having enough fuel to complete their mission . So they loaded up three 50 gallon drums and sent two of their men to head out for more fuel . At this point , the decision was also made to pull more steering components and disassemble them for inspection . After the inspection , which did n't reveal an obvious problem , they all agreed upon what appeared to be a scratch in the valve diaphragm plate could very well be allowing enough fluid to bypass into the wrong portion of the system causing the vehicle to pull to the left . They made some changes and bled the system free of air one more time , and after a few tests they could see right away that it was acting worse then it was before . <p> Ed quickly located a new pump out of his home state of Washington and had it shipped via UPS to a town named Burns which was 78 miles away from the lakebed . With a couple of guys staying at a motel in Burns , it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , the guys should be able to have it on the lakebed by noon . That would give them enough time to install , test , and make one or two runs in by dark . It was a lot to ask of for everything going smoothly and still get a couple of solid runs in by Friday night , but since most of the crew had to pull out on Saturday it was the only option they had . <p> The next morning , as I sat in the hot springs taking in the whole idea of being on a lakebed in Oregon about to witness history , I could not think of a better place I would rather be ! It is a very peaceful place that carries an epic energy of its own . The NAE team started to filter back in around 10:00am preparing themselves and the car for when the part arrived . The wind was beginning to pick up as we were forced to secure things down around camp . It was approaching 1:30pm and we saw a vehicle coming from the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the new valve . As Ed pulled the new part from the box , we could see immediately it was not the same as the original part . They were able to make some adjustments though , and like most innovative situations , give it a shot . <p> While fighting the extreme wind and dust the whole time , the crew still managed to get it installed . After bleeding the lines and running a few tests , they found out the new pump was not putting out enough volume to move the wheel ! The dust storm was horrible and things seemed to not be working out , but the team was not giving up . It would have been easy to throw in the towel and call it a wrap , but this team just was n't willing call it quits . As everyone continued on , they tested the steering thoroughly and everything finally seemed to be working properly . There was still one potential steering issue , but both Ed and Jessi discussed this in depth and agreed that neither of them have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this issue should never become a problem . At that point they decided to give Jessi her turn in the cockpit . <p> The wind had calmed down quite a bit by then and we all headed for the start line . I said a few prayers asking that things would go smooth and that she would remain safe . You could feel the excitement in the air as the team prepared the bird for her run . I caught the photos I wanted at the start line , then raced towards the six mile marker . After getting ourselves in position we waited for what seemed like forever ! At one point we saw a large plume of dust pop up , though it did not appear to continue our way as expected . We waited and waited but nothing happenedthen we saw part of the crew heading back towards the starting line . They informed us- that the- steering was still a problem and she had to shut it down . The flow of emotions were strong , yet Jessi was still in high spirits and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The North American Eagle team plans on taking the girl home and completely rebuilding the entire steering system to try it again at another date that 's what we racers do ! I had met some incredible new friends in those few days , and I could n't be more proud of the guys for how hard they worked in their commitment to breaking that record . I could not thank Jessi Combs enough for the experience I had that will stay with me forever ! Hopefully I will be present once again when they set out to conquer the records they aim to break . Godspeed my friends , Godspeed ! <p> thank you for the memories . <p> here 's a preview into Jessis first attempt behind- piloting the North American Eagle Supersonic Land Speed Challender vehicle to an average speed of 394mph on October 9 , 2013. 
@@36019095 @5019095/ <h> Installing a Snow Plow on Your SCX10 <p> Being a SoCal native , I 've never had a reason to build a RC vehicle with a snow plow attachment . After a move to Connecticut back in 2013 , it occurred to me why a slew of snow-moving builds pop up in that latter months of the year . Funny thing is I never took advantage of this situation , that is , until I moved BACK to sunny Southern California in 2015 . After seeing a bunch of videos on YouTube with guys plowing their front yards , a friend ( in CT ) hit me up wanting me to build a custom rig for her husband for his birthday . <p> The entire build was pretty awesome , but for this article I 'm going to just run through the quick steps of attaching RC4WDs plow unit on the SCX10 Ram Power Wagon . <h> Step 1 <p> My first step in any build is to lay out the parts so I know what I 'm working with . We have our SCX10 and the parts from RC4WDs Snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled . A few extra pieces come with the kit to attach it to the frame rails on the SCX10 . You 'll also need a spare servo , preferably one with a decent amount of torque . <h> Step 2 <p> - The plow attaches to the SCX10 between the frame rails . To get to this area , we need to first remove the stock plastic cap . Two screws is all it takes , then give the plastic cap a good pull to remove it . <h> Step 3 <p> - Assemble the bumper mount as shown . You 'll want to make sure the two mounting tabs ( red arrow ) are tilted up ; this angles the plow correctly once installed . Also take note of the flat area on the plow mounts ( green arrow ) notice the flat spot is pointing down . I suggest using blue threadlocker on all the screws here to prevent them from falling out . <h> Step 4 <p> - Time to install the servo , however before you do , I suggest removing all of the screws ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue threadlocker . I also advise removing the plow blade entirely during the install . <p> Moving on slide the servo into place and attach ( do n't  forget your blue threadlocker ) . Attach one end of the chain to the servo horn and the other end to the bottom plow pickup . Typically , servos come with the output shaft set at 90- , so let 's start by attaching the servo horn angled up a bit like the photo . We can adjust the pull height after we have the entire unit installed . You can re-install the plow blade at this point . <h> Step 5 <p> Attach the bumper mount assembly ( from Step 3 ) to the plow assembly . The mount slides into keyed slots in the back of the plow assembly . Blue threadlocker is suggested here . <h> Step 6 <p> Slide the mounting tabs between the frame rails and secure with the button head screws . Again , blue threadlocker is suggested here as well . <h> Step 7 <p> Remove the receiver box top and feed the servo lead into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so thankfully there is an open port for the plug port 3 . Re-install the receiver box top . <p> Now , before you head on out to remove some snow , we need to test the plow for proper operation . Turn the transmitter on , then plug in the battery and turn the SCX10 on . There are two buttons right under your thumb ( on the transmitter ) one raises the plow , the other lowers it . Go ahead and give it a quick test . If the buttons raise and lower the plow , you 're good to go . If you want the plow to raise up more , you have 2 options ; 1 ) remove the servo horn and angle it up more or 2 ) , shorten the chain by changing the attachment points .

Gate 7 was not a bad gate until Brian ripped a chunk of the rock out pulling up the feature . It was still possible after this but it certainly made it more challenging . With any of these style courses time is NOT your friend . A few of the drivers found this out the hard way , missing the course completion by less than a second , others just barely pulled it out .

The 1.9 Trail Limited class is suggested because it is limited to solid axles only and the competition will not be heavily modified . <p> The 1.9 Trail Limited class only allows for 2S LiPo and motors are limited to 21-turn brushed motors or 18.5 2700 Kv brushless motors . The SCX10 RTR models include Axials 27T motor is within the legal limit for 1.9 Trail Limited . While the 27-turn motor will be slower than other motors allowed , your RTR SCX10 wont require a motor change to compete . <p> Motor selection can be a little tricky if you do n't  know how the motor nomenclature works . When a motor limit is set at 21-turn , such as in the U4RC 1.9 Trail Limited class , the rule is indicating that 21-turn and higher motors can be used . The fewer turns a motor has the faster it will be compared to a similar motor with motor more turns . If the motor limit rule indicates a brushless Kv rating such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lower . This is because the higher the Kv rating , the faster the motor . <p> The 1.9 Trail Pro class removes the battery and motor limits , but is still limited to solid axles . This class will feature more heavily modified vehicles . <p> The Vanguard 2900KV brushless motor is legal for the 1.9 Trail Pro class and is an excellent motor for this class . <p> Yeti If you have a stock Yeti , the Yeti Limited class is the perfect class . The rules do allow you to upgrade the servo and servo horn , but the rest should be stock . <p> The next step up is the Yeti/EXO Pro class . There are no motor and battery limits . EXO Terra Buggies will need to be fitted with 2.2 tires to be competitive . <p> Heavily modified Yetis and EXO Terra Buggies are ideal for the Trophy- 2.2 - class. - Metal cages are required , so this class is for more advanced racers . <p> Wraith and Ridgecrest The 2.2 Competitor Limited class is limited to solid axles only , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U4RC rules even state , " This Class is designed for RTR and kits with Axial only parts . " <p> The 2.2 Competitor Limited class does restrict motors to 3150 Kv or less , but 550-sized motors are allowed . This means the Axial Racing Vanguard 3150KV is an ideal choice . This motor is loaded with torque and delivers more than enough speed . <p> The 2.2 Competitor Pro- is also an option , but this class will be faster , so it is recommended that a Wraith and Ridgecrest receive some attention before entering this class . This class is ideal for a modified Wraith . <p> Yeti XL Even though the Yeti XL RTR can handle 6S , the Yeti XL class is limited to 4S to keep speeds reasonable . <p> Do n't  Stress U4RC is understanding that many people may be building rigs without a real understanding of their specific rules , so they will allow anyone to compete the first time they show . They will review the rules and your vehicle and explain what needs to be done to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first race day , but will be expected to be resolved for the second race .

@@36019105 @5019105/ <h> Wraith Steering Tips <p> Now that the Wraiths have been out on the market for a bit . We have had a few people mention that they were getting some bind in the stock steering linkage . So , for this article I will be going over a few simple tips to help smooth out the steering on your Wraith . The biggest culprit for getting steering bind on the Wraiths is dirt . After a few battery packs off-road dust will work its way into your steering and suspension ball studs . Ball studs are the pivot points in any steering or suspension link set-up . The ball studs press into the rod ends , and provide the links the freedom to move as the steering and suspension cycle through their travel . If dirt and debris work their way into the ball studs , it will start to cause bind . Bind in the steering can cause servos to overheat and even burn out , as well as excessive wear in the steering components . <p> Since there are no super mini micro torque wrenches available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much force we use to tighten up our suspension and steering links . Especially when is comes to plastic self tapping screws . The Wraith comes with plastic ball studs stock as well . If the screws that pass through them are over tightened , it will distort the ball stud and cause the steering to bind as well as limited overall movement . So , be vigilant in your maintenance schedule , but do n't  overdo it when you are checking the torque specs on your plastic self tapping screws . The best thing you can do to help avoid these issues is upgrading to steel ball studs , ( Part # AXA1331 ) which are 100 times more durable then plastic . I am also going to upgrade this Wraiths steering system with an aluminum servo horn for added piece of mind and strength . Here are a few tips on the conversion . <p> Here you can see I removed the servo horn from the servo . At this point the linkage should move freely without bind , if it does n't  , then upgrading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this one is a little sticky . <p> Removing the servo horn revealed that the plastic ball stud in this linkage was in fact crushed down a little . <p> To remove the stock ball stud , I use a pair of wire cutters . Squeeze lightly around the neck of the ball stud and pop it out of the steering link . <p> Here you can see the old damaged ball stud on the left and the new ball stud on the right . <p> Use a pair of pliers to install the new metal ball stud as shown . <p> After installing a metal ball stud and aluminum servo horn , you can see the linkage will move freely now . If you still have a little bind , or sticky feel after installing the metal ball stud . Run a couple packs through your truck and everything should seat in and work smoothly after that . <p> Now repeat the above steps on the other 3 points in the steering linkage locations , opposite end of the drag link and at the steering knuckles . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the linkage still feels sticky . Run a battery or two through your truck and the linkage should free up . Sometimes dirt gets embedded in the plastic , so cleaning your steering link holes before installing the new ball studs is a good idea too . <h> 16 Comments : <p> anibal Posted on 2011-07-26 16:05:43 <p> hello i just got my wraith , and i was running in some trails , and all of the sudden the left steering hub got loose and lost the screw and the spacer that goes inside the hub .. what gives ? i do n't  think i was abusing my wraith , i was running it under normal conditions and doing some minor rock climbing ! and that 's about it . now i have to order a new hardware , for it . other wise nice truck ! <p> Ranyon d'Arge Posted on 2011-08-04 17:46:08 <p> That same screw came out on my truck too and it sheared off one of the c hub arms .

Ended having to grind the bearing face down to get the pin in . Also the upgrade requires exact length 3m hardware which it did n't  come with . Good luck finding 3m anything in WY . Sic truck though , lots of good bashing . <p> Tony Bialy Posted on 2011-08-06 17:33:14 <p> The Wraith has made it to Niagara Ontario Canada AWSOME truck ! ! <p> Mike Posted on 2011-08-12 13:15:24 <p> I think the biggest problem with steering bind is not the ball joints but the fact that , out of the box the steering turns farther than the axle is capable of . At full lock one of the pins on the end of the axle can become disengaged from the cup . This causes both the steering to bind and the drive to lock up . Need to turn down the EPA or shorten the servo arm . <p> Matt Posted on 2011-08-14 14:37:22 <p> Anibal , <p> I just had the same thing happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left and a few seconds later the right wheel flopped over . The bushing and screw are now missing and it damaged the C hub carrier . <p> Axial , <p> Are there any plans to fix this ? It is a steering geometery issue , not an abuse issue . I was crawling when this happened , not jumping or anything . <p> Matt Posted on 2011-08-14 14:48:28 <p> The overtravel in the steering is not an isolated issue either . I have talk to 2 or 3 other Wraith owners today that have experienced wheel lock associated with the dogbone locking in the axle stub shaft . I just happened to have it happen while spinning the tires . Now I cant even get the replacement parts until mid August ? Lame ! <p> Bender Posted on 2011-08-15 09:29:08 <p> The kingpins screws will work themselves loose over time and use . It is best to check them after each battery , as the steering forces will cause the screws to come loose in plastic . Going to aluminum C-hubs will fix the issue . <p> Bender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The knuckles and C-hubs on the Wraith are the same as the XR10 , so finding replacements should n't be too difficult . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-08-15 09:38:09 <p> Steering bind is due to the ball joints being plastic , especially if they are over tightened . The problem you are describing is a little different . Installing our CVD axles for the Wraith will eliminate the over steering issue you are describing . <p> Matt Posted on 2011-08-18 08:16:52 <p> I have eveything on order , but the screws are back ordered .

Try to find an aluminum arm that works with Futaba servos , if you are still running the stock servo .

You know how you feel when you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with big tire tracks . Just so cool ! It makes you wonder what the next guy is thinking when he sees them ? Is he an R/C guy ? <p> Here we are coming into the Buck Island Lake area and our first real water crossing . <p> Buck Island Lake makes for a great lunch location ! Mr. Brian Parker is sampling the Beef Stroganoff with Noodles for lunch today . <p> Then he s on to dessert . Yep , that 's an ice cream sandwich ! I know what you are thinking No , its not Adobe Photoshop CS7 with the new " ice cream lasso " tool . Its a Mountain House Ice Cream Sandwich ! Remember , we do not have a cooler for this trip . <p> Youll have to try one for yourself ! ! ! <p> Lunch is over and we make our way up to Buck Island Lake . Nice view and I make a mental note on those clouds , too . Its a great day , but that could all change very fast . <p> While hiking the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the full-size Jeep SCX10JK come into frame and pass over the natural terrain . It would be the same as the Axial 1/10th SCX10 Jeep JK came into my viewfinder looking just like any other rig coming though . <p> I would be breaking down the video camera from the tripod , I would look up and just giggle as the true perspective of what I just witnessed would sink in . <p> The other thing I noticed was that Brad would not always take the easy line . I later asked him about that and he said that he too , wanted the real challenge of the Rubicon Trail and to put the Axial SCX10 through its paces . So , at times he would look for those lines that would give him and the SCX10 a good challenge . <p> The funny thing about this photo is that this little snake is about the only thing we saw on the trail . We spotted him cutting across the road from the Buck Island Lake . But that 's not the funny part . The " funny " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station and having people who were inquisitive about our trip and asking if we saw deer , bear , elk , dinosaurs , or Sasquatch . Nope . All we saw was this this little snake ! We did n't  give the little guy any trouble and we do n't  want any trouble from big mama , so we passed onward . <p> What was cool about having Brian Parker as our tour guide for our Rubicon Trail experience was just that the experience ! He has it and he shares it . With all that comes some history , as he explains to us geographically how the Big Sluice Box was before and what it took to navigate the terrain . <p> There were only three times on the trail , that , after we completed an obstacle section , Parker would give out a little sigh of relief and explain that this particular portion of the trail had been his nemesis . This would be the first of three of those areas . We did not make it around the tree in the direction we are pointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very large set of boulders in effort to not inflict body harm to the bosses rig . Crossing the boulders was not a flat land easy pass either , but did not inflict body damage as the tree-rock combination would have . <p> While we opted out , Parker explained his trials and tribulations with his nemesis and added raisin body treatment . We thanked him for making our passes look and feel so easy with not a paint scratch . Parker does not like to personally back up and go around We asked , so what are the next two ? Parker replied , " no comment " and something about pleading the fifth with a smirk followed by a smile . <p> This section of trail was one of my favorite " scenic " sections . I could have spent a half day shooting this section ! It was not the degree of difficulty , just something about the long skinny bed-rocked road surrounded by the tall trees that had an attitude about it . The trail was observed by these grand trees and anything on site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen those before . These trees filtered the light in a way that gave off an emotionally shaded tint . Of course the camera does n't  quite capture that look or feeling that takes extra time , extra work , extra forethought to pull the trigger in such a way to capture an image that gives those results . <p> DO WORK , DRIVER ! <p> Looking back up from where we drove down you could see this nice long section . <p> Yea , we where there we drove an SCX10 down that ! <p> For me personally , this section was the gnarliest section of the whole trail . It looked like a mini Colorado rapids without the water . It just looked gnarly with loose boulders strewn all over the place and ledges dropping into holes the size of Volkswagens ! <p> I think you can see it in Scotts face that he agrees with me about this waterfall section without the water is kinda gnar-gnar <p> Photos just never capture that true sense of what we saw . We felt like we were going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine this in the rain ? Could you imagine this in the snow ? How about on a unicycle ? Well , we did it in a 1/10th scale off-road vehicle that 's crazy talk ! <p> When we did get to the bottom , we did find the abyss of black water ! <p> This is n't the food color induced black water lagoon at Disneyland . But , Bigfoot and Loch Ness do pass through the metaphysical senses . <p> And then we passed across the Rubicon Bridge that somehow seemed to transport us from the rough we had just transited through and onto the flat dusty two-track into Rubicon Springs where things seemed to calm down . <p> Jed Clampett , you in there ! ? <p> As we head out from Rubicon Springs its apparent that the end of Day-2 is nearing . <p> The museum of outhouses on the Rubicon Trail Trip 2012 <p> Parker took a moment to practice his high flying tight rope routine . The rope broke the dust settled and we moved on nothing to see here kids . Tape erased to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gently roll the back tire down and off the log " <p> ScottG complied with the slow-roll request and an answered with a plush articulate dismount ! <p> Its getting dark but were almost to our prime camp location ! <p> The tents are tossed and Chef Parker goes into action calling out tonights options from the Mountain House menu . <p> JetBoil PCS warms the water to wet the freeze dried food to warm the body . The end of a great Day-2 ! <p> The Axial SCX10 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon RTR out-of-the-box after Day-2 . Not a lick of work has been performed , no repairs needed , just pure driving bliss ! ! ! What a way to end the day !

Whether you have a brushed motor such as used with the rock crawling vehicles such as the SCX10 line or the brushless system in the EXO Terra Buggy , the cleaner you keep the motor the better it will perform and the longer it will last . <p> To properly clean the motor , it must be removed . If you 're unfamiliar with the process , in a vehicle such as the Wraith , Ridgecrest or SCX10 , the gear cover must first be removed from the transmission . This will allow access to the two motor screws that secure the motor to the aluminum motor plate . Remove the pinion gear and the motor screws .

@@36019111 @5019111/ <h> XR10 Build Part 1 Front Axle <p> Now that the XR10 's are starting to hit distributors , we figured that it was a good time to do a step-by-step build of the new kit with pictures and detailed descriptions . This will serve as a guide for a basic XR10 build by the kit instructions . While it is relatively a straight forward build , there are a few steps that require specific screw lengths . It is important that the correct length hardware is used during the build to ensure proper performance . <p> So , let 's get started . <p> First thing we will do is open that sexy box and take a look inside . <p> First step involves building the front gear box/axle assembly . <p> Open up Bag " A " and dump the contents into a small tray or parts catcher of some sort . Each step has its own bag of hardware , and assorted parts . So , it is very easy to build step by step . <p> Here you can see all the parts required for step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the flange bearings in the appropriate holes of the motor plate . Then install the drive pin , drive gear and E-clip onto the transfer shaft . <p> Now slide the transfer shaft through the front bearing and install the drive pin , idler gear and 2nd E-clip . <p> Grab parts tree #AX80063 and remove part #1 , the axle housings top cap . Install the small 5+8 bearing into the top cap for the transfer shaft . Then , attach the top cap to the motor plate with the supplied flat head screw . After everything is in place , check to make sure the shaft spins freely and the drive gear is n't rubbing anywhere inside the top cap . <p> Next , we will install the remaining gears into the gear box . Grab part # AX30556 , install the drive pin and idler gear . <p> Then , set the assembly into place with the 12 tooth gear towards the flange bearing in the motor plate . Next , install the last flange bearing and stepped gear so the smaller 12t gear is facing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kit to lube the gears up a little . <p> Now you can install the plastic gear case over the whole assembly . <p> Make sure you install the small M3 Nylock nut into the gear case ( see arrow ) before moving on to the next step . <p> Next , grab the plastic gear case cover and install the three 5+8 bearings . <p> Install the gear cover as shown in the directions . <p> Grab the front axle housing , specifically the top half . Set the gear box into place , and attach with the supplied hardware . Be careful with this step , it is important that the correct screws go into the correct hole . If too long of screw is used you run the risk of pinching the bearings on either side of the spool gear . This will put tremendous strain on the whole front axle , causing binding at the bare minimum . <p> For the next step we will install the bearings onto both sides of the spool gear , and grease the gear up before dropping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spool gears orientation in the axle housing too , it is n't symmetrical on both sides . <p> Now install the outer bearings into the axle tubes . Pay close attention to this step too . There are 3 different size bearings in Bag " B " . You want to install the smaller 5+10 bearings in the axle tubes . The slightly bigger 5+11 bearings are for the steering knuckles . Here you can see the slight size difference in the 2 bearings . <p> Grab the bottom half of the front axle housing and install the steering slider , again pay attention to the orientation . <p> Next assemble the 2 halves of the axle housing and tighten everything up . <p> Now its time to install the C hubs and steering servo mount . Here you can see all the parts required for this step . <p> Slide the C hubs onto the ends of the axle tubes , note the orientation on these as well . The longer ear will go towards the bottom of the axle housing . Use the supplied short self tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attach the plastic servo mount to the aluminum servo plate using the self tapping button head screw . Then use the flat head screws to tie the servo mount to the axle housing . <p> Here is what the front axle will look like when you are done with this step . <p> Moving on to the knuckles and inner axles . Here you can see the new oversize universals for the front axle . <p> A closer look at the U-joint . <p> Time to prep the steering knuckles for installation on the axle . <p> Drop the bearings into place on the backside of the knuckles . <p> Install the 5+11 bearing into the front of the knuckle , and screw the steer arm onto the passenger side knuckle . <p> Now grab the knuckles , flange pipes and 3+10 button head screws to install the knuckles . <p> Install the universal axles into the axle housing first . Then insert the flange pipes into the knuckles , slide the knuckles over the universals and onto the C hubs . Use the 3+10 screws to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are n't  getting any bind , the knuckles should move freely . Otherwise your servo will have to work even harder then normal . <p> Now on to the steering turnbuckles . <p> Thread the rod ends onto the turnbuckles , take note that one side has a right handed thread and the other a left handed thread . So , one rod end will thread on clockwise , the other will be counter clockwise . Thread the rod ends on until you have an 11.5mm ( or .453 for those anti metric countries like us ) gap between the ends . Using turnbuckles like this allows you to change toe in/toe out on the fly . <p> Pop the flange balls into the rod ends with a pair of pliers , note the direction of these too as you assemble . <p> Here you can see both turnbuckles side by side . Notice the groove cut into the hex on the turnbuckle , make sure they are facing the same rod end for both sides . <p> Install the turnbuckles onto the front axle as instructed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost screws while out in the rocks . <p> The complete weight of the stock front axle is 8.7 ounces . <p> That wraps it up for the front axle . Stay tuned for the next installment on assembling the rear axle . <p> I did some reasearch on rccrawler.com forums that the 5x8x2.5 bearings are a common part to fail and aree recommendced to be replaced with bronze bushings . I ordered an xr10 recently so I am concerned . Is this still the case or have the problems been corected ? <p> Bender Posted on 2012-08-15 15:05:34 <p> The smaller bearings can fail over time . The bushing kit will solve the issue , as will our upgraded XR10 motor plates which use a little bigger bearing and are sealed from the elements .

The first thing on the to do list was a proper suspension system . We have had Icon Vehicle Dynamics as one of our marketing partners for quite some time now , and have decided to run their " Jeep JK 4.5 ? complete suspension system " found here . We are also working with Dylan Evans , their head engineer to further test their new compression clicker reservoir shocks on our JK , talk about some incredible shocks , we ca n't wait to run these on the trail ! I personally have worked with Dylan for many years on different motorsport projects , and am really excited to see these guys working together on this . I am confident that this suspension system will suit our needs and surpass our expectations . Dylan is a mastermind at tuning shock and spring combinations for the best of both worlds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of off-road abuse . Take a look at this suspension system as we break down the different components , and what purpose they will serve . <p> Here is a shot of the entire system laid out on the Rebel shop floor .. <p> With the Axial SCX10JK up on the rack , it is time to get to work and tear it apart .. <p> The suspension links have a brilliant design . First off we have some race car parts with these huge heim joints , because strength is paramount in any suspension system . Second , Icon have developed a 2 stage threaded adjustment system . This means you simply place the link in place on the vehicle , then you adjust the length to desired spec , then tighten down . No more of this remove the link , adjust it , then replace it . It makes setting the caster on solid axle vehicle as easy as it gets ! <p> The links themselves are designed for maximum flex . Pictured here are stock links with Icon links . You can see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flex in the bushings and the arm itself . The Icon arm , has a race spec heim on one end and a Johnny Joint style joint on the other , meaning that the link is allowed to articulate throughout its range of motion without any resistance from rubber or torsional twist from the arm . <p> The front upper arms are designed to flex from one side and solid mount to flexible bushings in the Axle housing , these solid mounts have also been beefed up significantly . <p> The front and rear Icon springs are quite a bit taller than the stock springs , and should provide plenty of extra ground clearance , as well as the perfect rate once the vehicle is outfitted for battle . <p> The pan hard or " track " bars from Icon feature a much stronger and lighter tubular design . The ends of the Icon bars are equipped with heims or Urethane bushings which is a significant upgrade from stock . <p> The shocks for this project are probably the most striking change from stock . It is hard to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad boys from Icon . Rear Shocks <p> Front Shock <p> The install of the suspension system goes really smooth , at least that is what the staff at Rebel makes it look like . Here is the front suspension before and after Icon links . <p> The front springs and shocks are huge ! ! <p> The compression clickers on the reservoir are going to be awesome , we cant wait ! <p> The lower shock mount moves the shock out for clearance during full articulation . <p> And pictured with the reservoir mount in place , almost ready to rock ! <p> The rear suspension was next on the list . In stock form <p> With the Icon links .. <p> Rear sway bar links <p> Rear springs and shocks <p> Completed rear suspension <p> The suspension stage of this project is only the beginning , be sure to check back in the coming weeks to see this vehicle coming together .

@@36019113 @5019113/ <h> Decal Placement 101 Apply Decals Like a Pro <p> We 've all used stickers and have probably been doing so since we were kids . With so much practice why is it so hard to get good results when slapping stickers on an RC body ? For some people , it 's easy , and yet for many others the end results " crooked logos , fingerprints and air bubbles " speak for themselves . Do n't let something like decals make your awesome rig look hack . Putting stickers on is easy if you follow these simple steps . <p> Wash Your Hands As you probably know , your fingers are covered in natural oils . Thoroughly washing with warm soapy water right before you apply decals will help eliminate those oils ( at least temporarily ) , and as a result , help prevent those fingerprints from getting under the clear parts of the stickers . Even with clean hand , you want to avoid touching decals as much as possible . <p> Making the Cut Axial Racing includes high quality decal sheets that are loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have die-cut ( sometimes called kiss cut ) many of the decals . For the ones that are n't precut , use a sharp hobby knife with a classic #11 blade . Hobbico has excellent knives , replacement blades and cutting mats . Using a knife will allow you to precisely cut out the desired logo and leaves the sheet intact instead of making a mangled mess out of it . Two tips to remember are to only cut deep enough to cut the vinyl decal material ( you will lightly cut the backing and occasionally going through wo n't hurt a thing other than your table if you are n't using a cutting mat ) and to cut as close to the logo as possible . The less clear you leave around the logo or image , the better the end results will look . <p> Want to really look like a pro ? After you have applied a pre-cut decal , lightly and very carefully cut the extra clear material from around the logo or image . <p> Sticker Placement The best tool for sticker placement is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using the tip of the knife will prevent you from getting your fingerprints on the back and it will allow you to carefully and precisely place the sticker . Make sure enough of the knife tip is behind the decal so that it does n't  flop down on the body and stick where you do n't  want it . <p> Big Stickers While some people have a hard time getting small stickers on straight , many more people completely blow it when applying big decals . One trick to try is to use a hairdryer or a heat gun ( on low ) to warm the decal material and make it more pliable . This will make the material floppy and a little clumsy to work with , but it will easily conform to the body . This trick is good for large decals that have to go around corners or curves or over uneven surfaces . <p> Another trick is to use spray window cleaner to slide the decal into position and then carefully squeegee the fluid out . This allows you to perfectly position the decal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back and carefully burnish ( press ) the vinyl . Pay close attention to all edges and stickers that go over ridges or indentations such as door panel lines . This will prevent dirt from getting under the decal . <p> Fixing Mistakes Once again that hobby knife will come in handy . If you have an air bubble in a decal , you can gently make a small cut in it and then press it down . A long wrinkle may be impossible to completely fix , but cutting down the center of the wrinkle may allow you to press it down so that the goof is n't so unsightly .

@@36019120 @5019120/ <p> Now that we have released Axials newest scale shocks , which are officially licensed by Icon Vehicle Dynamics , I wanted to take some time to do a step by step build here on the blog to help people get the most out of their new shocks . These shocks are an improvement over our old SCX10 shocks , because of the new fully machined shock piston . The new piston provides a tighter fit inside the shock body which helps eliminate binds as the shock cycles through its travel . The new Icon shock bodies and reservoirs are clear anodized for durability and classic looks , which is a nice touch . Time to dig in and get our hands dirty ! <p> A shot of the packaging . Each package contains all parts and hardware required to build two complete shocks . <p> I cut all the plastic parts I will need to get started off their respective parts trees . <p> Open the hardware bags and dump the contents out in a secure location so you do n't  loose any vital parts . <p> Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apply a little grease to each o-ring before installing them into the shock bodies . <p> Once you have the o-ring lubed up drop it into place in the bottom of the shock body . <p> Now locate the plastic spacer that goes in between the o-rings , and install that on top of the first o-ring . <p> Grease the 2nd o-ring and install it into place on top of the plastic spacer in the shock body . <p> Now we can slide the shock shafts into the shock body from the top .

Once the bubbles are gone fill the shock body until the oil is about 1/16th of an inch from the top of the shock body , so just shy of being full . Once the shock shaft is fully compressed , you should see the oil crown just above the top of the shock body . Screw the cap down tight while holding the shock shaft fully compressed . Once the cap is tight , wipe any excess oil away . Cycle the shock shaft a few times and listen for air bubbles . If you can hear air bubbles gurgling around inside the shock , start over and use a little more oil . Make sure all air bubbles are gone before re-assembling . If the shock shaft wont compress all the way after this step , you have a little too much oil in the shock body . Remove the shock cap , and re-bleed the shock with a little less oil . <p> After you are finished bleeding the shock we can install the dual rate springs and spacers as needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic spring retainer between the two springs . <p> Install the lower spring retainer next , and you are done ! <p> That wraps up building Axials new fully licensed Icon shocks .

@@36019122 @5019122/ <h> Birth of R/C Do You Know Your Roots ? RC HISTORY <p> I stumbled across an old school R/C video recently on YouTube that covers the early beginnings of remote control cars . Little did I know that when I clicked that link I was going to be given a lesson in R/C history . I think most people will be surprised to learn that the R/C movement started right here in sunny Southern California , and not overseas as I personally thought . That 's right , the first R/C car was built by Norbert Meyer here in the states . Norb is also known as the " Father of R/C Racing " because of what he and a handful of others started back in the mid to late 60 's . <p> The background : <p> According to my research Norb Meyer and his neighbor Bob Blair built the first two R/C cars in existence . These were basically high end slot cars , without needing a slot to race in . Of course with any new " outside the box " idea there will be nay-sayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the radios would n't work in the cars because of all the chassis vibration . Well , apparently they found a way to make it work and I would personally like to thank them for that . Not long after Norb had invented the first true remote control car , a guy by the name of George Siposs would meet Mr. Meyer and the official history of R/C was started . If you are not familiar with the name George Siposs , he started R.O.A.R . ( Radio Operated Auto Racing Association ) in Anaheim , Ca back in 1967 . He is the voice narrating the video below too . In an effort to spread the word about R/C , George even ran ads in Road and Track magazine back in the day . When George and Norb would show up to race , they would lend their spare personal hand-built cars to spectators to race as well , just so they would have more than 2 cars on the track at the same time . Now that is dedication ! ! Keep in mind every part on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspension . <p> 1968 : <p> Norbert Meyer and George Siposs started the first ever R/C manufacturing company , RA/CAR . They built parts to support the classes of R/Cs they were racing at the time . These guys are credited for inventing servo savers , heat sinks , and a handful of other well known R/C parts that we use today , according to my findings . One thing that always comes up in the articles and videos I have seen is how important " scale realism " was to these guys , very similar to the scale rock crawling builders of today . It seems that every aspect of this hobby comes back to the scale details in the end , I think that is the biggest attraction for R/C newcomers . The rules even required cars to have a driver figure , realistic number plates and realistic bodies to be legal for the races . And at one point they contacted BFGoodrich and got permission to run the BFG logos on their tires . <p> 1969 : <p> Fast forward the reel to reel projector to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the race that is featured in the video below . The video description says it is the race from 1967 . But , after my research , and watching the video , it appears the first true nationals was held in 1969 in Garden Grove , Ca. , and this video is from that race . There were many variables that had to be overcome to win the national title . It was n't just about who could complete the race the fastest , you had to look good doing it too . They also incorporated " Lemans " style starts as well , which is awesome in my opinion . For the start of the race the drivers stood on the opposite side of the track from where the drivers will stand during the race . Once the race was started drivers had to run to their car , put the car on the starter box , fire the nitro engine up , and run 50 laps without breaking down . If that task was n't tall enough , you had to compete in a slalom course and your vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Something that I find to be very cool ! ! I can see many similarities between this form of racing back in the day and R/C rock crawling back in 2004 and 2005 . Back then rock crawlers had to hand fab 75% , if not more , of their rig themselves . Not long after Axial came in and brought crawlers to the masses , and saved everyone a ton of fab time , and let us concentrate on making cool custom scale mods to our crawlers . While scale detail is all the rage right now . It seems that these pioneers were on the cutting edge of scale realism , before scale realism was cool . It is great to see the hobby come back around to its original roots after 45 years . Very interesting . <p> The video ! ! Sit back , grab a drink , some popcorn and settle in for a little R/C History 101 ! ! The volume is set extremely low in the video , so you may need to turn your volume up to hear the narration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comments : <p> SCARHARDT Posted on 2012-01-24 19:10:57 <p> WICKED FRIGGIN DEADLY ! <p> Thom K Posted on 2012-01-24 19:48:00 <p> Thanks for the memories .

@@36019124 @5019124/ <h> Shock Building Tips <p> here 's a few pointers for assembling Axials new comp shocks for optimum performance . Building shocks is fairly easy , but paying attention to small details makes a huge difference in how they perform . Nothing is more annoying them rebuilding a set of shocks only to see they 've started leaking after a couple runs . So let 's get started . <p> First step is assembling the shock cartridges . Here you can see I 've laid the parts out in order . <p> Start by lubing up the rubber o-rings with grease . This helps eliminate any chance of tearing the o-rings when you install the shock shafts into the cartridge . Just put a dab of grease on your finger and cover the o-ring with grease throughly by rubbing it between your fingers . <p> Now install the supplied o-rings onto the base of the shock cartridges . <p> You 'll want to slide the shock shaft into the cartridge from the bottom , or left to right as the pictures indicate . If you slide it in the opposite way you run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M3 threads for the lower rod end . Since the shock piston is held in place with a smaller M2.5 Nylock nut the threads are less likely to touch the o-rings when you install the shock shafts . Wipe off any excess grease that is on the top of the shock shaft after sliding it into the cartridge . <p> Now its time to install the shock pistons . You can see I 've laid the parts out again in order as far as assembly goes . <p> Install one flat washer onto the top of the shock shaft , then slide the piston into place and install the second flat washer . Hold onto the flats on the lower portion of the shock shaft with a set of needle nosed pliers and thread the M2.5 Nylock nut onto the threads at the top of the shock shaft and gently tighten it down . This nut does n't  need to be tighten up a bunch , just thread it on until it stops . <p> Next decide which lower rod ends you want to use , for SWX builds I 'd use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . <p> Slide the included rubber bump stops onto the shock shaft and thread the rod end into place . Again holding the flats on the shock shaft with a pair of pliers . Make sure you install the rubber bump stops too , because these will prevent the flats on the lower section of the shock shaft from entering the shock body at full compression . If the flats are allowed to go inside the shock body you risk them tearing the lower o-ring seals over time . <p> Next up , install the shock bladders into the shock caps . Find something soft to work them down into place so you do n't  rip the bladders . I used a plastic pen cap . <p> Now thread the cap onto the shock body and tighten it down as tight as you can with your fingers . If you use pliers you may unseat the bladder which will cause the shocks to leak . I 'm installing the cap now because I will bleed the shocks through the cartridge when I fill them with oil . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just install the cartridge at this point instead . <p> Next well fill the shock bodies with oil and bleed them out . Make sure you let any air bubbles in the oil rise up and dissipate before you try to bleed them . <p> Wrap the shock body with a napkin or paper towel and fill the shocks with oil until the oil just touches the threads inside the body for the shock cartridge . Wrapping the shock body with a paper towel keeps the oil from running down all over the shock body when you bleed them . <p> Pull the shock shaft all the way out until the shock piston bottoms out on the cartridge . Then thread the cartridge into the body a couple turns only . <p> Now compress the shock shaft until the bump stop bottoms out on the cartridge . Any excess oil should flow out through the gaps in the threads at this point . Once the shock shaft is bottomed out , thread the cartridge into the shock body with your fingers and tighten it up by hand . Make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridge into place . Remove the paper towel and wipe up all excess oil . Now tighten the shock cartridge up using a pair of pliers on the plastic flats of the cartridge and holding the shock body with your hand . If you start cycling the shock before you tighten the cartridge up all the way , you may get air bubbles inside the shock body and you 'll have to start all over again .

The course was basically an oval track where you would finish where you started. - Axials title course was composed of loose and fixed natural rough limestone with two 60+ degree ascents , two equally steep descents with table top with fixed logs with and rock overhangs as obstacles. - Most competitors only cleared the first gate . <p> The next hardest courses was the Tekin Sponsored course . <p> Tekins course had a concrete covered 60+ degree incline embedded with river stones followed by a foam/bedliner slide with rough limestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors pass. - One would think that a rough concrete 60+ degree incline would n't have been a huge problem , however most only made it a foot up the incline before tumbling back down . <p> DNAs 100% man made materials course started with a slick steep foam/bedliner incline that only a few ascended . <p> Once at the top of the incline the man made sculpted concrete and foam-based boulders with extremely tight turns , high clearance breakovers , deep passes , and a near vertical drop off that needed to cleared to finish the course . <p> Hitecs incredible tight course used similar materials to DNAs but focused on traversing very tall Moab UT style deep valleys and crevices that required your to clear the first gates by wiggling through sideways . <p> The next segments required near 90 degree turns and transitioning wide and deep chasms .

@@36019128 @5019128/ <h> Exo Terra Sand Buggy 2WD Conversion <p> When the Axial EXO was first announced I found myself going back to the web page over and over again just to look at it . Axial really nailed scale appearance with this rig and I knew I had to have one . So whilst daydreaming about what I wanted to do to my EXO , I began to kick around the idea of making a sand car . This vehicle would make an awesome sand car , it looks like those 100K sand cars flying around Glamis sand dunes . I began researching the drivetrain and what it would take to make this into a RWD sand buggy . Axial is great at using common gear train in their vehicle line up , so I was hoping to see the same gear sets in the EXO as their other vehicles . They did not disappoint , the differential components were the same as previous Axial vehicles with an open diff . This meant the parts would already be available to lock the center diff and make this a RWD sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very simple , have a look . I elected to build this into a sand car while building the kit for the first time , so these steps can be followed exactly if you are building a kit from scratch , if you already have a running EXO and want to do this , simply remove the center diff and start here . <p> Step 1- Secure Axial part number AX30390 , the Differential gear set . <p> Step 2- Build center diff according to instructions , or open the center diff if EXO is already built <p> Step3- You are going to lock the center diff by simply placing an extra spider gear in the diff which will not allow the diff to function . You will be using one of the 2 smaller gears in the diff gear set to accomplish this . <p> Step 4- I have found that grinding down the outer diameter of the extra gear to be added to the diff really helps for ease of installation <p> Step 5- Install the extra gear into the diff housing as shown <p> Step 6- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chassis . Be sure the differential housing sits flat against the spur gear , you may need to adjust the position of the extra gear a few times to get it to seat properly . If there is extra space between the gear and the diff housing , do NOT use the bolts to try and seal the space , the bolts will pull through the gear before you get a seal . Take your time and make sure everything lines up nicely before final tightening . <p> I elected to remove the front axles and run some Pro-line Mohawk SC front blade tires for a proper scale sand car look and performance . I also elected to run the Pro-line Sling Shot SC rear paddles , as these tires are awesome in the soft stuff . If you wish to run 4 paddles you can leave the front axles in place , the locked center diff will help tremendously with the traction in the sand either way , and will offer the option of pulling and keeping the front wheels off the ground .

@@36019130 @5019130/ <h> Step By Step Wraith Kit Build Part VII Electronics Install <p> Here is the final installment of our 7 part Wraith kit build series . For this post I will cover the electronics I am using , and placement in the chassis . Wiring this truck is a little tougher then normal , because of the tube chassis and interior tray . Proper planning is needed to pull off a clean install . My first objective with this wiring job was keeping it clean . I did n't  want to see a bunch of electronics or wires while the vehicle is running , it takes away from the overall scale look . The plan was to shoe-horn as much of the electronics as I could under the interior . Here is how it all played out . <p> For the motor and speed control I went with Tekins RS Pro ESC , and 10.5t brushless motor . This combo should give me a decent combo of wheel speed and torque with a 2S lipo . I am using my Futaba 4PK receiver and radio , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the ESC for mock-up to see where it would fit under the interior before I started wiring everything up . It took a few tries to get it properly positioned so it would fit without interference . I ended up using an AX10 servo mount for the ESC mount . I attached it to one of the holes in the top of the transmission . Then used double stick tape to attach the ESC . Once I finalized the ESC position , I soldered everything up as needed . <p> A few shots of the transmission and electronics before installing it back into my Wraith . <p> The wiring <p> The ESC shelf <p> For the receiver mount I used the stock Wraith electronics box , but modified it a little to work with my set-up . I moved the battery up front , so it is now positioned behind the dashboard . I did this to put more weight bias out front , which will help in technical rock sections . In order to mount my battery up front I knew I would have to fab a battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my Wraith for a while it hit mejust modify the stock battery tray instead . I basically ended up cutting the stock tray in half lengthwise , and bolting it into position where the stock ESC would normally sit in an RTR Wraith . Then added a few pieces of foam to fill any gaps between the tray and battery . I was even able to use the stock battery straps , which was a nice bonus . <p> A shot of the newly revised battery tray . <p> You will have to cut away a lot of the interior out front for the battery and tray to clear without issue . <p> The tray installed .. <p> A few photos with the battery in place . You can also see the new hole I added to the lid of the receiver box , this just made the wiring job a tad easier , and it moved my servo wires away from the battery tray as well . <p> The good thing is I use my hood to put all my screws when i repair something in the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick on the magnets . If you loose a srew just have to scan the floor with the hood and the hiden screws will stick on the hood magnets . <p> My 2 cents . <p> By the way Bender still my mentor since my first ax10 ! ! ! ! <p> Duffster Posted on 2011-11-19 15:21:17 <p> Where were you able to get that " revised " battery tray ? <p> Bender Posted on 2011-11-21 08:44:05 <p> It is just the stock battery tray cut in half lengthwise . <p> Bender Posted on 2011-11-21 08:44:36 <p> Love the magnet idea , great tip . <p> Bill Hammond Posted on 2011-12-30 18:50:39 <p> I have a very lightly used 10.5 with a 13mm high torque rotor that was raced once in my MOD SCT 4+4 and the tekin RS .. What gearing did you decide to run . I am going to do some " mild crawling " and some antics on fairly loose stuff .. I have a 90 spur in it now . <p> Also , did you do any " advanced setup " to your Tekin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nice build thread ! <p> I am a huge Axial fan I have a SCX10TR ( I pull a boat with it and do some scaler runs ) , SCX10 ( two kits ) built into a dually with a Top Kick body ( I pull a 65 ?

I like the Magnet idea posted in another verion ( part ) of this thread . Use magnets to keep the hood on , and it functions as a " screw tray " for when you are working on your rig ! <p> Bender Posted on 2012-01-03 10:19:43 <p> I am running the stock Wraith gearing that comes with the kit , 20t pinion and 80t spur . I have n't messed with the timing in the motor at all . On 2S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . I think with your 90t spur it will be where you want to be , as it will crawl quite a bit better in technical situations . <p> Do you have 2 external Caslte BECs to power your 2 servos for 4WS ? Im told that the Tekin RS Pros advertised 6.0V/3.0V is n't really accurate . I was hoping I would only have to use 1 CC 10A BECdirectly wired to the front servo ( Hitec HS-7955TG ) and use the Tekin RS Pros internal BEC for the rear servo ( another Hitec HS-7955TG ) going through the receiver . So , can the Tekin RS Pros internal BEC handle the rear steer ? Or , should I solder 2 Castle 10A BECs for front and rear servos ? I will be running 3S LiPo with Tekin 13.5 sensored brushless motor . <p> Bender Posted on 2012-01-23 09:55:55 <p> I am not running a BEC on mine , and it will glitch in hard binds when using 4ws because of it . The Tekin RS Pro will handle one high torque servo without a BEC ok on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a BEC to power one of the servos , if not both when using 3S , because of the extra voltage . <p> Casper Hansen Posted on 2012-04-11 13:39:31 <p> Hi Bender ! <p> Have you tried to watter prof the tekin system ? ? <p> Iam getting the same set up just with a 13.5 tuns motor and i would love it to be water prof . <p> Bender Posted on 2012-04-12 07:45:45 <p> I have n't tried waterproofing this system .

Lake Amador is over three hours from my house , yet I woke up early Saturday morning to make the drive . Why would I do this when I could have just waited a couple weeks for the next local event ? Simple , the RECON G6 Challenge delivers more adventure , camaraderie , and drive time than any other RC event could ever dream . After a few stops for some warm morning beverages and sustenance , I arrived at Lake Amador . <p> Some locals winked at me as I drove in , so I knew it would be a great day . <p> Lots of people had already arrived and were in line for tech inspection . <p> The first thing I spotted was this SaWeet EXO . It has some hydro graphic love applied to it . <p> Parkers XR10 had the same treatment . <p> Stewey , B-Rad , and ColeMan were busy checking drivers in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting rigs showed up including this one . Is that an AMC Gremlin ? I was only three in 1974 , so I ca n't be sure . Nevertheless , it was hooked up with Axial Ripsaws , so it was ready to conquer . <p> After tech , rigs lined up and waited for the festivities to begin . <p> This event featured three classes ; Ultra , Wraith , and Adventurer . Ultra class was for the runners . Anyone needing some cardio work should apply for this class . Ultra classers were free to run as fast as they could . Theirs was a race against the clock . The Wraith and Adventurer classes were all about the experience . As I heard Parker say several times , " Finishing is winning . " This G6 was about slowing down and enjoying the experience .

Follow these steps and you can take your SCX10 , Deadbolt , or Wraith to the next level and dominate the competition . <p> Tires Your truck 's tires are its connection to the ground . If the tires do n't work , nothing else in your setup really matters . Tire considerations are size , compound , tread design , and foam insert . You can learn more about Axial Racing 's tires here and about choosing the right tires- here . You can learn about gearing and how it relates to different tire sizes here . <p> CG Lowering your crawler 's center of gravity ( CG ) should be a priority . Look at your Axial Racing vehicle from the side and imagine a horizontal line going the length of the vehicle . Your center of gravity may be above or below the line depending on your setup . A vehicle with too much weight above this imaginary line will be top heavy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gravity , the better . If you add scale accessories to your vehicle , the CG may be raised and your vehicle may be more tippy . The easiest way to significantly lower your CG is switch to aluminum wheels and to add Axial Racing 's aluminum knuckles and C-hubs . <p> Weight Distribution Much like CG , weight distribution greatly impacts performance . In addition to making sure your vehicle 's CG is as low as possible , moving weight forward will significantly improve your vehicle 's climbing ability . You can learn how to move the battery on an SCX10 here . The aluminum knuckles and C-hubs mentioned above also add weight to the forward portion of the vehicle and improve weight distribution . <p> Durability The steering components on your Axial Racing vehicle take the brunt of the abuse you subject the vehicle to .

@@36019134 @5019134/ <h> Tire Cutting 101 <p> When it comes to scale trail runs , mud bogging , competition crawling and racing , tires are one of the most important aspects of your vehicle . Without proper traction it can be tough to hold your intended line in the rocks or around the track . Having multiple sets of tires in your arsenal is always a good idea in order to be prepared for any and all conditions . But , for the budget crawler , basher and racer having numerous sets of tires and wheels is n't always a feasible option . There are ways to improve your existing tires and wheels though , and all it requires is a little time at the work bench . For this tire cutting article we will show you a few ways to get more traction out of your stock or existing tires , with little to no money out of your pocket . There are numerous ways to cut tires for better performance . Siping , read cutting , tires is a technology used in the 1:1 off-road world for everything from rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster trucks . Tire cutting can be used to get better forward bite , better lateral bite , and even help to avoid mud from packing into certain tread patterns . You can also cut the side wall lugs to soften up the overall feel of the tires carcass as well . There are many aspects to this technology/art form . <p> A good example to start with for the scale crawlers is the stock R40 compound Axial Ripsaw tires that are original equipment on the RTR Wraith and new RTR Ridgecrest . These tires have a great tread pattern with aggressive lugs for hardcore off road terrain . But , the compound on these is quite a bit harder than the softer R35 Axial Ripsaw tires . Here are a few different methods you can use to get the most out of your stock RTR Ripsaw tires . Only tools needed are a good pair of small wire cutters , a Dremel with a cutoff wheel and a little bit of your time . <p> Wire cutters used . <p> Dremel and cutoff wheel used . <p> A stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to improve upon was forward bite , and the ability to clean sticky mud out of the tire lugs . The tires I am using for this article will be bolted up to a 2.2 scaler/rock racer which will see a wide variety of terrain . I started by cutting the smaller rows of lugs completely out of the tires for a super aggressive tread pattern that will have the ability to she 'd mud and wet dirt , using a small pair of wire cutters . This cut will also soften the carcass up and allow for more forward bite in technical rock sections , similar to airing a 1:1 tire down for more grip and better ride . If your wire cutters are too small to span the entire lug you are trying to remove , you can cut half of the lug and slide the cutters along the base of the lug for a second cut as needed . I had to use this method on the biggest lugs . <p> Next cut the smaller center lugs out on the same row . <p> Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting is complete . <p> A profile shot after the first round with the wire cutters . <p> A photo of all the lugs removed from the 4 tires . <p> Next I want to improve the tires performance on the rocks in off camber situations . To do this I will use my Dremel and cut the existing tire grooves in the center lugs down to the tire++-+-+G++-+-+G+++-s carcass . Here you can see it grooves before I modify them . <p> Position the Dremel over the lug to be cut and follow the existing groove to make it deeper . <p> Keep your RPMs on the Dremel high enough to cut the lug without bogging the motor down . Gently apply pressure until the cutoff wheel cuts the full depth of the lug . Be careful not to go too deep and cut all the way through the tire , take your time and be patient . You can also do this to the outer lugs if you find you need more bite , or sidewall flex . Another way to get more flex out of your tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I drilled out the existing breather holes in these wheels to twice the stock diameter .

@@36019151 @5019151/ <h> Jump Properly <p> If you got started in RC with one of Axials rock crawlers , you may not know how to properly jump . What is there to it ? There 's more to it than pointing your vehicle at a jump and launching it . The part you may not know is that you can actually use the throttle and brakes to control how the vehicle flies through the air . <p> If you have experience with dirt bikes you may catch on that the throttle can be used in the air to actually raise the front of the bike . The opposite happens when brakes are appliedthe front end lowers . Every RC vehicle jumps differently , but they all react , at least to some degree , to throttle and brake inputs . 4WD vehicles such as the Yeti , Yeti XL and EXO Terra Buggy offer more in-air control than 2WD vehicles . Vehicles with bigger tires can also react better to throttle and brake inputsif they have enough power to really spin the tires . Also , in general , the more power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to approach a jump surface is with even speed . Your suspension reacts as you accelerate and decelerate on the ground just like it does in the air as described above . When you approach a ramp , for example , and suddenly accelerate , on or right before the ramp surface , the rear suspension will compress . It will then rebound when you let off the throttle . Without getting too deep in a physics lesson , the rebounding suspension will cause the vehicle to start to lift its rear higher than the front . Even speedneither an increase or decrease in speedwill provide the most consistent results . <p> If the vehicle is nose-diving in the air , grab and hold the throttle until the attitude of the vehicle is level or slightly nose up . Dropping the nose using the brakes requires a slightly different method . Only a tap of the brakes is needed . Too much brake will quickly over rotate the rear up and over the nose . <p> The key to a perfect landing , as far as throttle input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicles speed upon touchdown . That 's a whole lot easier said than done , so concentrate on not having the brakes applied or having the tires spinning too fast . This will keep the drivetrain from taking too much of a jolt and keep the vehicle from darting out of control . <p> From approach , to launch , to being airborne and finally landing , jumps go by pretty quickly . Its sometimes hard to imagine you 'll have time to think and do all of the actions described above , but with just a little bit of practice , it will all be second nature .

@@36019154 @5019154/ <h> Pre-Run Checks <p> Have you ever heard the saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure ? This is profoundly true when it comes to RC . A little preventiona quick once over , reallywill go a long way towards ensuring nothing goes wrong when you least want it to . Here are the items you 'll want to quickly check before hitting the trail . <p> Wheels Nuts It seems simple , but many people only tighten the nuts holding their wheels when doing maintenance that requires removing and reinstalling the wheels . Do n't  wait until doing something where you have to take the wheels off to make sure they are properly tightened . Loose wheels can lead to ruined drive hexes and wheels . <p> Wiring The wiring on your Axial Racing vehicle needs to be secure . Cable tires should be used to make sure wires are kept away from moving and hot components such as driveshafts and the motor . While the wires should be kept slightly loose to allow for movement as the chassis twists , the wires should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise up into the chassis or get snagged on branches . Notice that the SCX10 is equipped with clips on the side of the chassis to keep the wires out of harms way and still allow the wires to move as needed . <p> Gears and Slipper While a visual check is best , taking the gear cover off can take more time than you 'd like . The best tool for a pre-run gearing check is your ear . Hold your Axial vehicle while applying a small amount of throttle . Listen carefully for any grinding noise or anything but smooth gear engagement . Any excessive noise can mean there is debris in the teeth of the gears , a gear is damaged , or the gear mesh is off . <p> The slipper clutch is a wear item . Check to make sure that it has n't  loosened . Occasionally after extreme use , a tighter setting will be needed to achieve the same results as when the parts are brand new . For complete maintenance , the parts ( specifically the slipper pad AX30412 ) can be cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly tightening the retaining nut can restore the desired amount of slip . A slipper that is too loose will often make a noticeable squeal. - Only tighten the nut if you notice slippage . If the slipper is too tight , it wont be able to protect your drivetrain . <p> Shocks Check for excessive buildup of grime on the shocks . Examine the shock caps and the bottom of the shock body . Dirt will naturally be attracted to these areas , especially where the shaft exits the shock body , but an excessive amount of accumulation can indicate a shock that has leaked out too much oil . A quick refill will most likely get you through the day , but a shock rebuild may be needed soon . <p> Loose Screws Before a run , quickly go through the vehicle and look for loose hardware . Check the steering knuckles where they attach to the axle C ends . Check the set screws for the driveshafts . Also , check where the C ends attach to the front axle tubes . Do n't  over-tighten the hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly snug and are n't  loose . <p> Transmitter Batteries Do n't  let transmitter batteries die at the worst time possible . Check and replace them before you go out . Axial transmitters use state-of-the-art 2.4GHz that has low current draw and only requires four AA batteries , so the batteries last a long time . <p> Driveshafts The Axial WB8 Wild Boar driveshafts- are extremely strong and one of the most advanced designs offered , but they still must- be periodically checked . Examine that the end pieces have n't loosened and check that the splines have been twisted . <p> Tires Whether you use bead locks or glued tires on your Axial , check the beads on all four tires to make sure they are attached properly . If a bead lock has pulled apart , you will need to completely remove the retaining ring and reassemble . Glued tires can be re-glued with RC specific CA glue after being thoroughly cleaned with a cleaner such as rubbing alcohol .

Use your steering servo to set the width between the servo posts before tightening them down . <p> Install the servo mount onto the top of the front axle . <p> Next we will install the servo arms on the knuckles . Use the extra M3 machined screws from the first installment of this build , if you are using aluminum knuckles and C-hubs . They are the same length as the M3 screws used for the kingpins in the knuckles . <p> Now install your steering servo . <p> Find your steering links and hardware .

Use a 2.5mm allen driver for this adjustment screw . <p> Step 2 : Once the mesh is set install the M4 set screw in the top of the motor mount. - Do not tighten this screw all the way down yet. - Use a 2.0mm allen driver here . <p> Step 3 : Continue tightening this set screw , you will feel the screw stop once it hits the motor mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image above . <p> Step 4 : Once the screw has touched the motor mount slide you only need to turn it another 1/4 turn. - Or 90*. - This will snug up quickly and lock the motor slide into place. - Over tightening this set screw will cause damage to the motor mount or the motor mount slide. - 1/4 turn is all you need here . <p> The Motor Mount has a male dovetail , while the motor slide that the motor mount attaches to has a female dovetail. - When the M4 setscrew is tightened you are not only applying pressure to the point of the set screw , but also to the entire surface of that dovetail. - This increased surface area means you have that much more material holding the motor slide into place . Trust the surface area ! Over tightening the set screw will actually decrease this surface area and potentially break the mount .

If you missed the first part of this blog , you can check it out here . If you added those details on your vehicle , - hopefully yours now stands apart from the rest . Now its time to add an- interior and a few other details to complete the look . <p> This was my Axial Dingo I ran for a while , I keep some of my old bodies for this exact reason . What reason you ask ? Well , myself and I 'm sure hundreds of others do this . <p> Some of our RC bodies go under the knife , well body scissors actually . One of the coolest things about Axial bodies is that they have an interior that can easily be put into another body . <p> This Axial Dingo is the donor for the Honcho RTR project . This is where you can really get creative . You have almost limitless options , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . You can paint this to match or- make it- custom . I would suggest painting it with a matte or satin , doing this helps sell the overall look in my opinion . The silver works for this project so I am not going to paint it . <p> Obviously you will need to make it fit . My starting point is always the dash , as most people will notice the dash before they notice the extra cab . <p> I always trim the interior- to be bigger at first , then I 'll start fine tuning it on the fitment . <p> These interiors always seem to fit so well , like I said , myself and others have been doing this for years . If you 're not a scratch building styrene expert yet , - I would n't worry too much . You can still be scale on the trail with this . Do n't  go right to installing it just yet , this is where you get to be creative . <p> I am going to add a driver . There are a number of places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $30 dollars , possibly more if you want a seriously scale action figure . Things to know : some guys will skip this all together because- they want a serious performance crawling RC . This is definitely a scale feature , but that 's what this project is about . Doing this will affect your COG ( Center- Of Gravity ) , and that 's why some do not do this . I however like the look and drive scale , so you are not likely to see me climbing a 3 foot vertical rock anytime soon . I drove competitively back in the 2.2 comp days and now I find more fun in this style. - To each their own and do what- you enjoy because this hobby should always be fun . <p> After you have spent your hard earned paycheck or allowance , break out the dremel and cut your new driver in half . You can also use a saw for this . There is not really a wrong way to do this , just keep test fitting him so he fits in the interior while inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . Notice how much shorter he is in the picture below , so you may have to do some more trimming . <p> Smear some trusty shoe goo on it- ( or whatever you like to use ) and install your new driver . <p> I always like to add the steering wheel , so it has that scale appearance . Its nice- to have a few AXIAL AX80037- parts trees on hand ; they have some cool extras- on there like a choice of steering wheels , rifles , and mirrors . You can add anything you can think of , shifters , CB radio , GPS units etc . <p> I add some Shoe Goo on the dash and use the screws for middle of the Honcho cage pictured below to support the rear of interior . <p> Another cool Axial parts tree to check out is this one , AX31186. - This parts tree has some Axial Ammo Cans . Who does n't  want a scale Ammo Can ? If you want to learn more about all the cool stuff you can find on Axial parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accessories on Axial Parts Trees <p> Here are the 3 pieces to Axial Ammo Cans , and on the other end you can find these Long Horns . <p> I am going to make- 2 Ammo Cans to go on the bed of the Honcho RTR . <p> I am going use this quick drying paint . It is Italian Olive with a satin finish . I could n't find it in a matte finish or I would have used it . <p> I am shooting it in pieces so I get a good coat of paint on the inside too . Once I get on a few good layers and it dries , I will partially- assemble it . <p> I 'll do a few more layers while its partially assembled. - Then I add the screws I am using and partially screw them in . <p> I partially screwed them in so I could hit them with some paint . Most Ammo Cans are all one color of military green . Do n't  forget to paint the lid , top and bottom as well . <p> The picture below is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to use the PanPastel Weathering Kit . Used mostly on models and dioramas , it will also work perfectly for this project . You can also use paint , but this will be much easier . <p> I am using the PanPastel art sponges to apply my weathering . This is a kit that has everything available . So let me show you how it works . Here is one pallet of colors pictured below and there are several different pallets of color available . <p> I am going to start with the white , imagine how rusted items look , if they are worn they tend to go to the metal , so that 's where I will start . <p> Next I am going to go to a darker color . When doing rust like this , layers works best. - Do n't  be afraid or intimidated , you may surprise yourself . <p> Ill actually use lighter browns over the dark I have applied . You can see the results so far . <p> Next I will do the lid . Use the same technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles rust , you are done . I am calling it good with this look . Results are pictured below . <p> I 'll do another one using paint . I am using the military paints in matte finish from a local Hobby store . <p> Just this bit of flat yellow helps add to the look as well . I am doing a new looking can as well . Here are the ammo cans I did pictured below . A new look , a military look , a rusted can with PanPastel , and a rusted can with modeling paints . The paint colors are brown , light brown , rust and silver . I also diluted the browns with- paint thinner so its transparent . Expect a lot of wait time on paints drying , a day is optimal , especially using thinner . <p> Here are the ammo cans on the RTR Honcho project . Not done yet though , Im am going to add another small detail while I have the paints out . <p> I am going to use the stock Axial wheel caps , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am using model paints in silver and red . You can make some scale hubs for under $10 . <p> Paints are still out , so I 'm also going to hit the rear with a few dots of silver on the bolts . Pretty good look if you ask me . Yes there are aluminum hubs out there available . I even have some , but I love to see people create and use their imagination . <p> Hopefully you found this inspiring and got some ideas of things you may want to do on your scale rig . One of the best parts of the hobby is making it your own , the other part to that , is for all of us to see it . <p> Maybe I will get to see your scale rig out on a trail . If not make sure you share your pics and builds on Axials Facebook . I am always a fan , so I 'll be surfing the page for your cool builds . Thanks for checking out the RTR Project and scale on !

One thing we noticed right away is that the people behind the Jeep brand are enthusiasts . These guys are always out on the trail with their customers , learning and working on the next evolution of their vehicles . One thing they do religiously is participate in the Annual Easter Jeep Safari event in Moab , Utah . Every year the engineers at Jeep team up with the staff at Mopar to build some new vehicles to be unveiled at the Moab event . Call them concept vehicles , or show rigs , either way this is what is in the mind of the Jeep engineers , and on display for the public to enjoy . Truth be told , most of these vehicles will never become production models for one reason or another , but that does n't  stop them from putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have a look at a few of the concept vehicles that Jeep is set to release at this years Easter Jeep Safari .. <p> From Jeep Press Release <p> Jeep Mighty FC Concept The Jeep Forward Control was built from 1956 to 1965 and offered a clever packaging solution . It kept overall length at a minimum for maneuverability but maintained a full-length cargo box for utility . For 2012 , Jeep has created a modern version of this classic : the Jeep Mighty FC concept . <p> To create the Jeep Mighty FC concept , the design team started with a 2012 Wrangler Rubicon and repositioned the cabin over and ahead of the front axle , lengthened the wheelbase , and added a custom built drop-side cargo box . The cab utilizes a roof from the Mopar JK-8 conversion kit , as well as a custom-designed front clip . The Wrangler-based interior has been enhanced with bold , heavy-duty Katzkin leather and a unique color scheme . The cargo area is handled by a full-width , drop-side tray-style bed that measures more than eight feet in length . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Portal Axle set . These offset axles offer the greatest amount of ground clearance without requiring excessive suspension lift . <p> Mopars Front Portal Axle ( 8-lug , part number P5155670 ) is available at a Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price ( MSRP ) of $12,500 , and the Rear Portal Axles ( 8-lug , part number P5155671 ) MSRP is $11,000 . <p> The axles are controlled with King coil-over assemblies along with beefy Teraflex control arms and track bars . Traction is handled by massive 40-inch tires mounted on custom Hutchinson 17-inch beadlock wheels . <p> Jeep J-12 Concept The Jeep J-12 concept is essentially an extended version of Mopars recently introduced JK-8 pickup conversion kit for the Jeep Wrangler . With a new 2012 Wrangler Unlimited as the starting point , the rear of the vehicles frame is extended 18 inches , allowing the spare tire to be relocated under the bed floor and making the cargo box a full six feet in length .

That mighty FC is freaking sweet looking . I know it would be super expensive with the portal axles , but it should do ok on regular 44s with some smaller tires . Those axles on it do n't  look like portal axles to me , unless the portals sit inside those knuckles where the universals would go . And the J-12 just looks sick .

@@36019171 @5019171/ <h> Body Tech 2012 Jeep- Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Kit <p> Now that the " kit version " of Axials 2012 Jeep- Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon has been released I wanted to go over some tips on painting and assembling the body . This is Axials most detailed body to date , with several plastic bolt on accessories . There are numerous holes to be drilled in specific locations for all the " bolt on " accessories . This post is meant to help show people what order to assemble / paint this new body to get the best results . So , let 's get started ! ! <p> For this body I wanted the cut lines to be really clean , so instead of using standard Lexan body scissors , I used a new X-acto knife to cut out the body and hardtop . This method works great , but you have to be very careful not to veer off your intended cut line . Take your time and you should n't have any issues . So , the first thing I did was use the knife to cut the hardtop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardtop with the X-acto . You do n't  have to push down very hard either . You are not trying to cut through the Lexan , you just want to score it with the blade . <p> After I have scored the body lines , I used Lexan scissors to rough the body out . Here you can see I stayed away from the finish cut lines with the scissors . <p> Once the excess Lexan is cut away you can start peeling the last bits of Lexan away from the body . You will basically be tearing the body on the score lines you created with the X-acto . <p> Here you can see the hardtop is cut out and ready for the next step . <p> Now add your window masks , and label the paint scheme if needed . I am using white and black for this particular body . <p> Next I cut the windshield out with scissors and applied the paint mask for the window . <p> Using the X-acto method again , I cut the main body out as needed . Then , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I want to add lights down the road . <p> Using a body reamer go ahead and ream the roll cage mounting holes around the interior to fit 3mm hardware . <p> Now assemble the roll cage complete . <p> Go ahead and bolt the roll cage to the body . <p> Out back the roll cage has a spare tire brace incorporated into the cage . Just loosen it up a little and flip it up and out of the way for now . <p> Now we will fit the hardtop to the body to mark the screw holes that hold the top into place . I used electrical tape on the sides of the body and hardtop to hold the top while I fine tuned its fit on the body . <p> At this point I took the time to mark any areas that may interfere with final assembly with a marker . Here you can see the hardtop lines will need to be trimmed a bit to clear the screws that hold the windshield in place . <p> Before you mark any holes to be drilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on both sides . <p> Once all the body lines are properly lined up , go ahead and tape the top down to the main body , and mark the holes for the hardtop with a marker . <p> After the holes are all marked , remove the top and drill the holes as needed . Be careful not to go too big with these holes , as the screws for the top are smaller than the standard M3 hardware . <p> At this point I went ahead and notched the front of the hardtop to clear the windshield screws . <p> Now set your windshield in place and mark the holes to secure it to the roll cage . <p> Be careful drilling these holes as well , since there is n't much excess material to work with . The hole should fall right between the molded studs in the windshield frame . <p> Now we can assemble the hard top , body and windshield to make sure everything fits properly . <p> Looking good ! ! At this point you can remove the hardtop and flip the spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place until the brace touches the rear window and mark the hole for the brace to come through . Then , ream your hole to size so it slides over the spare tire brace . <p> Now we can turn our attention to the smaller details like tail lights , mirrors , shifter , steering wheel , etc . I used calipers to measure the distance between the molded stud on the tail lights and the mounting hole . <p> Next , I went ahead and marked the body with my calipers for where the tail lights should sit . We will drill our holes on that scribed line the proper distance apart . <p> The side of the tail light should sit almost flush with the outside of the body , so mark your holes as needed . <p> Test fit parts as you go to ensure proper fit . <p> We will take the same steps to mount the mirrors as we did to mount the tail lights . Measure the spread between the molded stud and the mounting hole on the mirror . <p> I measured from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over a 1/4 ? , to the first hole for the mirror . Then moved down another .200 per my measurement , so the bottom hole is 1/2 ? from the top of the door . <p> To keep the holes in line , I measure another .300 from the door seam to the mirror holes . <p> Ream your holes and double check the fit . <p> Now its time to mark the holes for the Poison Spyder Crusher Flares . I found the best way to do this was to use the plastic backing for the flares as a template to mark the holes . Set the proper back plate in place on the inside of the body , line everything up , and carefully mark your hole locations . You can also tape them in place , then mark the holes , to ensure they do n't  move on you . <p> Holes marked .. <p> and drilled . <p> Next up are the body mount holes . Set your body in place on top of the body posts , and carefully line it up front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body mounts on the outside of the body with your marker . <p> Partially ream the holes out and double check to make sure everything lines up properly . <p> If everything looks good , drill the holes out to size . <p> Last few items to take care of are the steering wheel , and shifter . To mark the steering wheel hole I just used my calipers to find the exact center of the panel the wheel mounts to , and marked it . <p> Drill your hole and double check the fit . <p> To mark the shifter holes , I held the shifter up to the inside of the body and marked the holes as needed . <p> And done ! ! <p> Now , we get to take the entire body apart , and remove all plastic accessories . Tedious yes , but needed to get a clean finished product . Now it is time to start painting . I chose white and black for the colors on this build to give it that " Stormtrooper " affect . I think Mr. Lucas would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few good coats of rattle can white to the inside of the body , windshield and hardtop . <p> You will notice that some spots , like this seat , on the body are n't  covered with white very well . Most of those areas will be painted flat black on the outside of the body later . So , I did n't  worry about getting complete coverage in those areas . <p> After the coats of white were dry , I backed everything in black , like I usually do . <p> To paint the interior flat black , I cut the over spray film out of the interior area only with an X-acto . Then , carefully peeled it away so it did n't  pull any areas I do n't  want painted away from the body . Take your time here as well . After you spray the interior , peel the rest of the over spray film off the body and it should look like this . <p> I followed the same procedure for the interior , as I did for the hard top . Cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before painting the flat black . I used a second set of window masks on the outside of the windows on the hardtop , so the windows will remain clear after paint . But , you can just leave the over spray film on the windows by cutting around it with your X-acto and use that as your paint mask . <p> Remove all window masks at this time . I used the tip of my knife to peel a corner up enough to grab with my fingers . <p> Notice I have a little white bleeding through the rear windows . <p> I used a marker to cover the paint , and once the window decal is in place it will still look pretty clean . <p> Apply the window decals . <p> Next we will apply all interior decals . <p> For the seats I tried something different . I only cut the center of the seat decals out with my knife and applied the center portion only . <p> Apply the exterior decals next . <p> Do n't  forget your mirror and tail light decals . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steering wheel , do n't  forget the Jeep decal that goes in the center . <p> Shifter installed . <p> Apply the windshield decal . <p> Before I bolted the Crusher Flares on I used my marker to color anything that will be inside the wheel well black , just for a cleaner look . <p> Now we can bolt the cage into place , add the windshield and install the hardtop . Notice there is a small white strip between the hardtop and the black rear quarter panel stickers . To fix this , I removed the top and broke out my trusty black marker and colored that strip of white in . You could also use vinyl , or electrical tape to cover it too . <p> If you find the sides of the hardtop wanting to bow out away from the body , you can use double stick tape on the tops of the doors to hold them tight . <p> The finished product . <p> Whew ! That covers detailing your new Axial SCX10 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon kit body . A few things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your base color of paint up inside the tops of the doors as best you can . This areas coverage was a little thinner than I expected it to be , and you can see some shading from the black paint at certain angles . Two , I would have left the sides of the hardtop a little longer and trimmed after paint . The black paint left a shadow along the bottom of the sides . Not critical stuff , but just a few things to keep in mind .

@@36019174 @5019174/ <h> Brandons Formula Offroad Build : Part 1 <p> The latest buzz around Axial has come about after Bender introduced us to Formula Offroad . I was aware of this sport and always enjoyed watching the 1:1 videos , but it never really hit me to build a RC replica of one before . I am a huge fan of Scale RC , so anything I can get my hands on and modify to closely resemble the real thing just adds to the fun factor . The looks of the 1:1 formula offroad vehicles are a bit odd compared to what we normally see offroad in the states , but you can tell that they are built purely with performance in mind . <p> After seeing Benders build progress , I immediately started kicking ideas around for my own . I really liked the look/performance aspect of using the SCX10 as the base and had an old RCP Crawlers Wreckluse chassis that had been collecting dust for a few years so I thought to myself , PERFECT ! <p> Here is a picture of a stock RCP Wreckluse chassis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has more of a " Rock Crawler " look to it with the large stinger on the front . <p> Now that I had my starting point , I went out and searched for a 1:1 Formula Offroad Jeep to scale down the proportions from. - For me , Pirate4x4 is the ultimate source for full-size images and builds . <p> I wont be following that build exactly since the Wreckluse chassis comes with a modern jeep hood and the cage shape is slightly different , but it can give me a great reference for the overall wheelbase , axle location , and stance . <p> So here is my Wreckluse chassis stripped down and ready for some " slight " alterations ! <p> From there , I started to take a look at what needed to be changed . First was get rid of the huge stinger . None of the 1:1 Formula Offroad rigs have anything beyond the front axle or body work . Then , I started to sort out the link lengths to get the axles positioned correctly and set the wheelbase . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to be changed on the cage . <p> From there it was obvious that even with the stinger removed the remaining tube work in front of the grill/hood also needed to be removed . The old bracing from the bottom of the stinger needed to be modified as well , with the low stance the front links/axle were interfering with the Wreckluse chassis . <p> So here is the updated chassis , looks a little " stubby " and tall now . Isnt that how its supposed to look though ? I 'm sure it will grow on me . <p> Thinking ahead I added this tube in the back of the cage for a rear sway bar . <p> Now I could have just painted the chassis and called it good , but I felt it was important to leave it raw and finish the build . This way , after driving it for the first time I could easily tear it down and make any modifications to the cage without having to strip any paint off. - So I moved forward and started assembling everything . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Body Painted <p> Suspension/Link geometry sorted out <p> Battery mount complete <p> Rear Sway Bar ( we will see if the front needs one after the initial drive ) <p> Hood body mounts using SCX10 parts left over from a kit . The body posts were perfect ! <p> Axial orange beadlock rings for the rockster beadlocks <p> I definitely was able to achieve the look I wanted using the Wreckluse chassis. - It took some work and unfortunately it was n't something I could just bolt together and be finished , but that makes it unique and adds to the overall appeal for me . <p> Still a lot of work to do ! <p> Install Electronics <p> Rebuild the Transmission with HD internals <p> Install Driveshafts <p> Possibly relocate the front steering links to behind the axle to protect everything <p> Mount rear tires on 2.2 Rockster Beadlocks with matching Orange rings <p> Go have fun ! ! <p> Stay tuned for Part 2 when I share some of the action shots , hopefully some video , and the final pictures with the painted cage. - Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - Its just too hard to resist ! ! - Thanks for reading . 
@@36019175 @5019175/ <h> Jeepspeed Cherokee Build <p> Some of you may recognize this build from the June 2011 issue of RC Driver magazine , page 28 to be exact . The guys over there did an article/interview with me about this build and how it came about . Now that the article is out and in circulation , we wanted to do a little update with more details here on our blog . If you want to read the article in RC Driver , this issue is now available at news stands . <p> If you have n't seen the article , I built this SCX10 up to replicate a Jeepspeed Cherokee . I wanted to build a scale replica of the real thing using off the shelf parts that you could find at most hobby shops . Most people do n't  associate the term " custom build " with the phrase " off the shelf parts . " But , with a little imagination you can build a one off custom truck with store bought goods . This build started life as an SCX10 Dingo , and the chassis/suspension is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body on this particular build , since that is what most people see first . I started with a Pro-line Jeep Cherokee body , interior , scale accessories and their 1.9 Super Swamper SX tires . Since the 1:1 1700 class is limited to 33 inch tires , a smaller 1.9 tire looks the best for this style build . <p> For this particular article I am going to concentrate on a few of the scale details that went into this build . Aside from the Pro-line goodies , I also used an array of Axial parts on this build as well , like the narrowed Dingo roll cage , Dingo rear bumper , interior detail kit , exterior detail kit , Honcho bumper , Honcho spare tire mount , aluminum scale shocks , 4 link parts tree , light buckets , etc . <p> First thing we will cover is the scale interior , and what went into it . I decided to use black , orange and silver for my colors on this rig . So the interior was painted predominately black , with silver and orange highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in place to sort out the mounting points . I measured the inside of the roof line on the Cherokee body to determine the width I needed first , then cut the center of the roll cage as needed . <p> To mount the cage I used Axials rubber shock bump stops at the base of the cage . Then , used long M3 screws to tie everything together once the placement was dialed in . <p> More interior detail . <p> Custom fuel filler . I made this using black fuel line and a Great Planes nitro fuel line plug ( Part #GPMQ4166 ) for a cap . Reamed a hole in the body smaller then the outer diameter of the fuel line , then pressed the assembly into place . <p> Next , I started working on the body . First thing I wanted to add was Axial scale fender flares , as most of the Jeepspeed Cherokees run a wide fender kit front , and/or rear . I did trim the fender flares back a little to give them more of a high speed look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> here 's a little closer shot of the trimmed fender flares . Notice I cut the Cherokee fender wells back until the fender flares were even with the hood . <p> Once I moved the fender flares up level with the hood , and trimmed the Cherokee Lexan bumpers off , the front of the fender flares end up fairly short . This left me with no holes to mount the very front of the flares to the body . So , I drilled a hole through one of the " dummy " fasteners molded into the flare , then trimmed the head of the fastener off with an X-acto . Now , I can screw the front of the flares down to the body as needed . <p> I had to cut the backside of the fender flares into small pieces in order for it to not distort the body lines when everything was bolted up . <p> After installing the fender flares , I installed the interior to see if there were any clearance issues . Notice I had to cut part of the interior away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see the internal roll cage pretty much sits against the roof line of the body , which should help keep the cab rigid during any high speed rollovers . <p> Another Pro-line accessory that I added was their roof rack . I installed a few Axial light buckets to customize it a little too . <p> Next I needed some bumpers . The stock Dingo rear bumper was a perfect fit for the Cherokee body . But , the front bumper is n't really a desert style bumper . So , I decided to see if I could use a Honcho bumper instead . In order to give our Honcho bumper a little more of a pre-runner look , I cut the bottom of the wings off . Then , cut the aluminum inserts that fit the wings into small pieces to look like reinforcing gussets . Also added our big round lights and amber lenses while I was at it . <p> Once again I mocked everything up to ensure a proper fit . It can be a pain to keep assembling everything , just to tear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get everything exactly where it needs to be . Patience is your friend during these steps . <p> Once the roof rack was mounted and everything fit properly , it was time to start working on the paint job . I laid out the design I wanted as true to scale as I could . Then , weaseled my way into Brandons office to see if he could cut me some paint mask for the body . Thanks Brandon ! <p> I just used basic rattle can paint on this build . After masking the windows and paint job , I gave the body a very light coat of black paint . To ensure the paint would n't bleed under my mask , I let this first coat completely dry before I applied anymore paint . A light first coat , that is allowed to dry , is the best insurance for a clean paint job . That first light coat basically seals the paint mask to the body , and does n't  allow later coats to bleed under . <p> Paint is done ! I applied the black first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange last . After that I went back and laid down another coat of black . This did 2 things , one it gives the orange paint a " burnt " look so it is n't so bright . And two , its a pet peeve of mine to look inside a Lexan body to see the same color on the inside as the outside . So , I always back my paint jobs in black . <p> With the fender flares installed . <p> Shot of the scallops on the hood . <p> Applied all the stickers and it was time for another mock up . <p> The ride height looked a little tall to me , so I made some functional limiting straps out of shoe laces to lower the ride height a bit . <p> Last thing I did was install the spare tire and add the other scale accessories from Pro-line . <p> The final product <h> 16 Comments : <p> Brandon Posted on 2011-04-29 10:43:01 <p> Sweet !

I noticed you cut before you painted . Pro line recomends you cut after apinting what is your opinion . <p> Bender Posted on 2013-01-08 19:58:05 <p> It is really personal preference . As long as the over spray film stays intact , you will be fine . I cut mine out before paint so I could test fit everything . 
@@36019177 @5019177/ <h> How to Remove Stripped Screws <p> The hardware fails , but the part is fine . This is the opposite of what we expect to happen . As- it happens on full-size vehicles , it also happens in RC . Usually in RC , it 's a small set screw or flat head screw . Both are prone to stripping out if poor quality tools are used or if care is n't taken . Many people get stumped when this happens , and while the fix is a bit of work , when the worst happens , it is still fixable . <p> Prevention Two things prevent stripped hardware " quality tools and proper use of those tools . Axial Racing vehicles include some basic tools to get you started , but lots of wrenching ( half the fun in this hobby ) requires quality tools . Axial offers hex drivers with comfortable handles that feel like real tools and have replaceable tips . The tips are precision ground so those are a perfect fit . Proper use consists of making sure the tool is fully seated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel tools , to not have the tip of the driver fully seated in the hex hardware is one the biggest reasons hardware gets stripped out . In addition , to make sure you are inserting the wrench fully , make sure the hardware is free of debris . Use the tip of a hobby knife to clean out any screw heads that may be clogged with dirt . <p> Gear Puller Pinion gears are held in by small set screws . These small screws are prone to stripping out when we use Herculean efforts to tighten them down . Great Planes makes a pinion puller ( item no . GPMR2410 ) that can sometimes force a pinion off a motor 's output shaft as the puller is tightened down . These pullers cost about $25 and are not guaranteed to work . Axial pinion gears cost between $5 and $6 , so it will most likely eventually pay for itself as other methods of removing a stuck pinion result in a destroyed pinion gear . <p> Rotary Tool and Cutting Wheel I would n't even read this section without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinion gear or in a driveshaft , the most common way to fix the problem is to break out a rotary tool fitted with a cutting wheel . The fiber reinforced cutting wheels are preferred as they are more durable , but regardless of what type of cutting wheel you use , you must use eye protection and keep your head clear of the path of potential flying pieces . Cut off wheels shatter and the flying pieces can blind you permanently . This type of work should only be done by an adult . <p> To remove the stripped out hardware , you will need to basically grind out the set screw . This is the preferred method over attempting to drill out the set screw . Drilling a set screw on an object that wants to spin can be very difficult and even dangerous . Grinding out the set screw results in a ruining pinion or driveshaft , but cures the problem . <p> If a flat head screw is stripped ( most commonly stripped screw type other than set screws ) , use the cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're careful , you will only damage the already damaged screw . This notch will allow you to remove the screw with a flat blade screwdriver . <p> Reliability and customer satisfaction go hand in hand , so Axial is continually improving our products . A great example of this the WB8 HD Wild Boar driveshafts that uses a 2 mm hex drive instead of a 1.5 mm hex , which can be prone to stripping out if the wrong tools are used . 
@@36019178 @5019178/ <p> First thing I did was pick up a new unpainted Dingo body ( AX4010R ) and laid down a two tone paint scheme to freshen it up and give the TR a new look . <p> I also made myself a light bar for the top of the cage from some steel plate and 1/8 ? solid rod brazed together . With room for 6 of the large lights on top I used two of the Black Axial light bucket sets in addition to the two lights that were on the TR bumper . This required 3 of the Axial LED Lens sets to fill all 6 lights . <p> Installing the Tube bumper was easy , just pulled out the 2 set screws from the original TR bumper and slid in the Tube bumper , then reinstalled the set screws . I decided to run a winch on this rig , so I cut a slot in the center aluminum bumper plate for the fair-lead to come through . <p> To make sure I got the most use out of the light kits I installed side markers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse lights , and the smaller buckets on the tube bumper .

If you are not familiar with Ultra 4 Racing it basically combines low speed " rock crawling " with high speed " baja " style racing . So , your vehicle has to be able to handle technical rock sections and high speed desert bumps in the same race , on the same day . Most hardcore off-road enthusiasts know a solid axle set-up front and rear rules in low speed rock crawling . And most of those same off-road fans know that independent suspension rules for high speed and jumps .

I was pleased to see the highly detailed JCR bumpers for the Jeep XJ body , and more pleased when I noticed how well they fit on the Jeep Nukizer body . That sealed the deal , SCX10 II Jeep Nukizer here we come ! To further separate the build from a stock SCX10 II , I changed things up a bit with a set of 1.9 Maxxis Trepadors mounted on my VP KMC 1.9 beadlocks . <p> Let the modifications begin ! Even though the JCR bumpers were the proper width they needed some massaging . I cut some material from the bumper post mount system up front to bring it closer to the Nukizer grill : <p> Then I sanded down the chassis brace to allow the bumper to push all the way back . <p> New front bumper position .

I immediately took it to the saw and cut the A-Pillars off the cage , then removed some height to match the roofline of its new home . The end result was a customized cage ready to completely alter the Nukizers attitude . <p> With the cage in position I could start marking all the required holes on the body . I carefully used a body reamer to create 2.5mm holes for M2.6mm hardware . <p> With so much material removed the cage , it required new holes for the M2.6 hardware to attach to the Nukizer body .

The length of the roof rack ties together the cab and cage . <p> In order to mount the JCR rack I drilled some more holes and utilized M2.6 hardware again . Attaching to the cage was easy with the 2.0mm drill bit . To mount it at the cab , I used the under body mounts that required some modification . I basically cut them at the 2nd mounting boss . <p> Hardware installed . <p> Now we 're getting somewhere ! <p> Something is missing though How about some Rigid Industries lights ? <p> The fun part , dealing with the wiring .

I also snuck in another LED controller mounted on the chassis for the 4 LED Rigid bar on the bumper and a set of tail lights in the rear JCR bumper .

@@36019207 @5019207/ <p> Wanted to share the latest updates to my Formula Offroad build . When I first built this rig using AX10 axles the WraithG had just hit the market . At the time I thought it would be great to have those new AR60 axles found in the WraithG underneath my Formula Offroad rig . Well its been long enough , time to get it done ! <p> But first , I will explain a few of the advantages of the AR60 axles for this application . <p> Axial R&amp;D developed the new AR60 axles for a few reasons . First , we wanted the WraithG to perform well at higher speeds . Speed is n't all about straight line performance , stability is important as well . The AX10 axles with some wideners would not have cut it . To increase handling ability at speeds we needed to utilize a design with proper scrub radius . So what is Scrub radius and why is it so important for handling ? Scrub Radius is determined by the kingpin location on the steering knuckles and hubs . Draw an imaginary line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginary line lands close to the center of the tire to achieve the ideal scrub radius . <p> Ideal , or zero scrub radius occurs when the kingpin line meets the ground at the center of the tire . <p> Here is a pic I found to help explain Scrub Radius ( aka pivot angle radius ) : <p> Now let 's take a look at the AR60 axle by drawing a similar diagram . <p> The Blue line is the imaginary line I mentioned above . The screws this imaginary line travels through are the kingpin screws . The red " X " at the bottom of the tire is the location that the kingpin line meets the ground . You can see this very close to the center of the tire therefore the scrub radius is minimal . <p> On 1:1 cars you want this scrub radius to be as close to zero as possible . Vehicles with a large scrub radius require powerful steering systems to move the tire when steering . Cars with zero scrub radius can usually be driven without power steering . So this brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The larger the scrub radius the higher the torque required to steer it , therefore you need a stronger steering servo on your RC car . Keeping the scrub radius to a minimum will let your steering servo work at its full potential and use the steering torque efficiently . <p> Let 's look at my old setup using the AX10 axles and a wide offset wheel to achieve the width I wanted . Keep in mind that this is extreme due to the wheels I was using . Axials current products that utilize the AX10 axle do not exhibit this large scrub radius . <p> Here you can see the distance from the center of the tire where it meets the ground is a good distance away from the red X. This creates a very large scrub radius . <p> There are few other important things to note when looking at the comparisons above . See how the imaginary line through the kingpin screws is at an incline on the AR60 axle ? This is due to the inclined kingpin screws compared to the vertical kingpin screws on the AX10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the XR10 competition Rock Crawler . It effectively moves the imaginary line closer to the center of the tire . The extra width of the AR60 axle and the incline kingpin angle both work together to increase handling , stability , and steering efficiency . <p> When Axial R&amp;D started looking into Kingpin Inclination during the design of the XR10 competition Rock Crawler we found that the 1:1 automotive industry settled on an inclined kingpin angle of 7-9 degrees . Anything more and the contact patch of the tire is decreased during steering . The XR10 and AR60 axles utilize 8 degrees of kingpin inclination . <p> Another example of kingpin inclination can be seen on a Dana 44 Axle , its always cool to see real world 1:1 technology trickle down into the RC industry . <p> The second major design focus on the AR60 axles was strength . The WraithG was designed to handle more more speed and larger tires than any previous Axial product . The AR60 axle utilizes a 1 piece molded axle housing with thicker axle tubes . By removing the seam of the 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is substantial . <p> The third major design focus of the AR60 axle was adjustability . Some key adjustable features include : <p> The AR60 axle can easily be flipped for a left or right offset pumpkin . The offset pumpkin allows for more clearance under a larger area of the axle and properly aligns the axle output with the transmission output to create a more efficient drivetrain . <p> The lower link/shock mounts can be flipped to adjust height and anti-squat . <p> Remove the diff cover and you can access the ring and pinion . Again this can also be flipped to keep the same rotation when you flip the axle housing to change the offset of the pumpkin . <p> Caster angle can be changed in 18* increments to drastically change driving/handling characteristics . <p> Upper 4 link truss is designed to be modular and act as a true truss to stiffen the axle housing . <p> Here is a exploded view showing the removal of the ring gear . Again Axial R&amp;D took inspiration from 1:1 axles and the accessibility of the ring &amp; pinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axle , its just too cool the way it comes apart and the diff cover gives you access to the axle internals . <p> Flipping the axles is also very easy . For this part of my Formula Offroad build I opted to install them flipped when compared to the Wraith . This was done to keep the transmission in the same orientation . If the AR60 axles did not have the capability to easily be flipped I would have been forced to rethink my whole build . The current transmission position allows me to run a full size 2 or 3S lipo pack under the hood . Once the axles were flipped all I had to do was flip the differentials inside the axle to correct the rotation . This extra adjustment is a great feature for changing the rotation to accommodate electronics or fighting torque twist . <p> Along with flipping the axles , the lower link/shock mounts can be flipped to further fine tune the suspension . Anti-squat characteristics are determined by the location of the links at the chassis and the axle . Triangulation and link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the AR60 axles give you that extra adjustability needed with the lower link mounts . Take a look at the image below , the green line running through the center of the axle helps to show the difference when the link mounts are flipped ( link mounts shown in blue ) . If you need to replace a lower link mount its an easy part to change out that does not require the entire AR60 axle housing to be replaced . Axial also sells a machined aluminum lower link mount AX30830 . <p> Here are a few initial build pictures of the AR60 axles underneath my Formula Offroad rig . Because this is a custom build I did have to make some slight adjustments to bolt on the AR60 axles and still utilize the full stroke of the shocks without interfering . I will update this post with some more detailed photos soon . <p> I also opted to upgrade the driveshafts to the new AX30794 WB8 versions . The new WB8 driveshafts utilize a CV style joint that is rebuild-able . <p> The wheels are the new Axial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tires are Pro-Line SC Slingshots.

Well the railroad brought in all kinds of adventure seeking souls looking to make it big out West , but with the good , the rails also brought , the bad . <p> The baddest was a man named Jeremiah Earl Danziger , a descendant of Poland , came to Harriman , NV in 1910 and one of the bloodiest years that Sparks , NV has ever seen . Jeremiah Earl Danziger , or Jed went to work for Aphia Mine in Virginia City but was soon dismissed after he was caught stealing from the mine . This upset Jed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still horrifies and haunts people who walk the river path through Rock Park . <p> Jeremiah Earl Danziger ( aka JED ) killed 16 young girls in 7 months . Butchered was used in most of the descriptions as each girl was found missing wrists and ankles . When Jed was caught in the act with his last victim , he slashed her throat as she yelled for help for her unborn child , just as a group of hunters passed by . One of the hunters shot Jed , but the bullet struck him in the lower back . Unable to walk , Jed was dragged to a tree and hung after his hands and feet were cut off with the hatchet that Jed himself used on his female victims . This all happened where Rock Park is located today . <p> I have lived in Reno for over 30 years and have only heard bits and pieces of this tale . But some say they see a blood covered man carrying a hatchet . I have been to Rock Park after dark and have never seen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree once stood is a bridge and walking under that bridge all the hairs on the back of my neck and arms stood straight out .

Yup , trucks were going to be driving through it . <p> At the graveyard , drivers had to stop to find their tombstones , yes , each driver had his name on a tombstone and there where 50+ more names than event entries so finding your name was a little more in depth !

Look at all the people doing something . There 's not a lot of sit time like there is at other R/C events . And when there is that " sitting moment " its REST ! <p> Six female drivers made the G6 Challenge . Here one of them shows that all that is needed is an RTR Honcho in order to do the Parkerism " Do Work ! " <p> These G-Rides show how they are not afraid to " DO WORK !

@@36019211 @5019211/ <h> Axial EXO How to swap batteries <p> Now that the EXO Terra Buggy has officially been announced , I want to take some time and highlight a few of the features . For this post I want to cover how to swap the batteries and show a couple of the subtle but cool details on the EXO battery tray assembly . Our patent pending quick release battery tray makes swapping the battery in the EXO really easy to do , with minimal down time between runs . <p> A few photos of the battery tray with the body and cage removed . <p> Here you can see the rubber battery straps lock into the battery tray tabs securely . The straps have steel pins pressed into the ends of them , the ends of the pins are what tie into the battery tray tabs . <p> Grab the tab on the end of the rubber battery strap , pull down and release the pins from the battery tray tabs to remove the battery . No body clips or threaded nuts required . Notice the battery tray is two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . <p> To aid in removing the battery , the battery tray tabs fold down out of the way . Once they are folded down , the opposite end of the tabs help lift the battery out of the tray too . <p> Notice the M3 screws and slots in the battery tray as well . <p> I grabbed one of our 2S lipos to show how easy it is to make adjustments to the battery tray . Here is where the two piece tray is key . I set the battery into place first to see where it sits . <p> Once you install your battery into the tray you can adjust the two halves of the battery tray to fit the battery as needed . The two halves of the tray are mounted to the chassis with M3 screws as I mentioned earlier . Because the battery trays have slots built into the mounting tabs , you can adjust the size of the tray to fit most batteries . Here you can see that the tray is a little too long to hold this battery properly right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battery tray halves and snugged them up to the battery before tightening them up again . Now you can see the tray fits this battery like a glove . <p> Another cool feature to this battery tray is the the rubber straps . There is adjustments built into those as well . You can fine tune the straps to fit different height battery packs if need be too . A close up shot of the stationary side of the battery strap , and its different mounting options . Three holes in the strap and two holes in the battery tray give you a handful of options to fine tune the straps . <p> Here are a few more photos showing how to change the battery with the cage and body installed . <p> The passenger side of the EXO has 2 body posts and clips that hold the side panel on . Remove those 2 body clips , pop the side panel off and you have access to the battery . <p> As I mentioned earlier , grab the tab on the end of the strap , pull down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery tabs back to pop the battery up out of the tray . <p> Then remove the battery . <p> Grab a freshly charged battery . <p> Slide the battery into place . <p> Secure the battery using the rubber straps . <p> Then reinstall the passenger side body panel . <p> Time to go tear it up ! ! <p> That covers the EXO battery tray , and its adjustments .

You have to take the cage off in order to make any adjustments to the electronics . Also , will there be a design change so the rear suspension is not attached to the cage ? Quite alot of work to take all those screws out , take the cage off , make adjustments , put the cage back on , screw ALL those screws back in , then hope its running how you want it to . If not , you 'll have to repeat that process again . Great looking buggy though . Any diff upgrades coming out to a 4 gear diff ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@36019212 @5019212/ <h> Benders AX10 Ridgecrest Project Backyard Basher <p> Now that Axials new Ridgecrest is readily available I wanted to show one of the Ridgecrest projects I have been working on . For this project I just wanted to build a do it all trail runner/crawler/basher . The Ridgecrest is the perfect platform for this type of build in my opinion , because of the stout AR60 axles and the well tuned suspension geometry . The purpose of this build is to have a rig that can handle a lot of various situations from sandy hills , to rocks and roots , a little water , and possibly some urban bashing . This project will also probably be a loaner vehicle on occasion as well , so I want it to work decent in all situations . here 's a rundown of what I changed , and why . <p> A couple shots with the body removed . I swapped the electronics and battery trays around so the battery now sits in front for better weight distribution . <p> Swapping the two trays around was easy , the only thing required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead on this rig was a bit too short for me to reach the receiver after swapping the two trays around . Servo extensions can be found at most hobby shops and online retailers for less than $5 , so it is a cheap and easy solution . <p> Here you can see the junction where the servo wire and the servo extension meet . I used the stock wire guide to keep the wires out of harms way . Also notice I moved the on/off switch to the opposite side of the chassis , just to keep wires cleanly tucked away . <p> I stretched the wheelbase on this Ridgecrest to help on big rock obstacles , and hill climbs . A longer wheelbase usually helps a rigs capabilities in these situations . So , I installed our 106mm grey links , part number AX30516 , to replace the old stock plastic lower links . Then , I used our grey machined high clearance links , part number AX30469 , to replace the stock upper links . In order to stretch the wheelbase as much as possible I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links , part number AX80057 . You will need 4 of the rod end parts trees total to complete the conversion , as well as M3 threaded studs to secure the rod ends to the links , part number AXA0187 . You will need two packages of the threaded studs to complete the conversion . My wheelbase now sits at 13 1/2 ? . <p> A shot of the link set-up . <p> Here you can see I also installed our new AR60 machined link mounts , part number AX30830 , on the axles as well . These link mounts are cool because they have multiple mounting points , which will help you fine tune wheelbase , ride height and shock angles as needed . <p> Another modification that I made was the jump to XR10 beadlock wheels , part number AX08061 , and R35 Ripsaw tires , part number AX12015 . This mod is one of the best you can make , the difference in traction between the stock RTR Ripsaw tires and the better R35 compound tires is night and day . <p> Last thing I changed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit too stiff for my liking , so I swapped them out for our purple comp springs , part number AX30224 . <p> A few shots with the newly cut body . <p> So far these few mods have really transformed this vehicle into a super capable basher/trail runner , that is extremely fun to drive . Keep an eye out for my next few Ridgecrest installments covering how to convert your Ridgecrest into a capable comp crawler. <h> 5 Comments : <p> Anthony Posted on 2012-11-12 17:23:07 <p> I was just wondering if you tried to crawl with this set up ?

On July 14 , 2012 a new edition to the park was finally unveiled . First conceived as far back as 2001 by Mike Bishop , president of Azusa Canyon Off Road Association ( ACORA ) , the 4X4 obstacle course is now open to the public . The 3 acre course presents challenges not only for heavily built rigs but for near stock 4X4 's as well . Work began in the summer 2010 and was near completion by September 2010 when the Forest Service told Mike and the team that a seasonal stream cut directly through the site . Nothing was going to stop ACORA at this point . So with some clever revisions , and the help of Falken Tire , not only was the stream protected but a new obstacle was born . With the last hurdle out of the way the final touches were added including a mini ATV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivities Axial was invited to set up some gate markers and run a demo RC course . Several Axial rigs appeared out of nowhere to participate in the fun . When the demo concluded the announcement was made to gather around the podium so the opening ceremonies could get underway . Among some of the local dignitaries that spoke were the Mayor of Azusa , Joe Rocha , Assemblyman Roger Hernandez , and the Director of LA County Dept. of Parks &amp; Recreation , Russ Guiney . They were all very excited to witness the unveiling and hopeful of its future contribution not only to the local economy but to off road enthusiasts from all around . Alas the ribbon was cut and immediately after all who spoke during the ceremony were practically forced , by Mike Bishop , to go for a ride on the course . Professional drivers were on hand , including Axials Randall Davis , giving many their first taste of extreme 4X4 driving . I assure you the smiles were of no shortage from the passengers . Afterwards the course was fair game to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply get a tire up on a rock . As the day came to a close CORVA continued to raffle off some awesome prizes including a set of Pro Comp tires courtesy of 4Wheel Parts and an Axial AX10 RTC that was ready to hit the rocks .

This year 4Wheel Parts of Compton was kind enough to open its gates allowing off roaders from all over Southern California to display their rigs . From a bone stock 1950 's GMC pickup to pre-runner style trucks to all out rock crawlers this show had something for everyone . The California Off-Road Vehicle Association , CORVA , was on site handling the announcing duties as well as the raffle . This organization works tirelessly to keep our trails open for us to enjoy ; please visit their website for information on how you can help : www.corva.org .

It was difficult to get all 4 tires up on the rock without using too much gas and going right up and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were facing the ladder because there was n't much room to maneuver without falling off the rock . The skill level of the drivers was impressive and most had prior R/C experience . The EXO RTR was a hot topic since it was just released and not yet in stores . Those who were lucky enough to get behind the wheel were surprised with its top speed and excellent handling . Just before the raffle 4Wheel Parts brought out the RTI ramp for anyone who wanted to test their flex out . A crowd drew as more and more rigs , including a 2wd pre-runner , tested the fruits of their labor . One rig went a little too far and flopped over to the crowds delight and cheers , see the pic and video link below . Lastly was the much anticipated CORVA raffle . Raffle items included a Smittybilt 8,000lb winch donated by 4Wheel Parts , a LED Light Bar by Tough-Light , even a ride in a Class 1 trophy truck by Engage .

This enthusiasm for full scale adventure translates directly into the scale products we have all come to enjoy . <p> While hanging around the office after hours , a conversation sparked up about full size trail rigs . The VP of Axial , Jeff Johns had recently parted company with his 99 Jeep TJ and was in the market for a new rig .

Eventually the discussion led where every good 4+4 discussion leads , right into the age old Jeep vs . Toyota battle .

That being said we wanted to take a few minutes to help you get familiar with this new platform ! First and foremost , let 's go over what to look for when you first pull it out of the box . As with any new RTR R/C vehicle , you should check everything over carefully before installing a battery and heading off to your local bash spot . RTR means " ready to run " , but even then there are certain things you should check before actually running your new " RTR " R/C . For this blog post we will cover unboxing your new Yeti , and what to look for before driving it for the first time . <p> Checklist : <p> 1 . Check and make sure the wheel nuts are properly torqued down on all four corners of the vehicle after you pull it out of the box . No need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are good and snug . <p> 2 . Adjust the height of the battery tray to fit the battery packs you have , or that you plan on running.You want to make sure the battery is held firmly in place so it ca n't move around while you are driving . If the battery can move around in the chassis while you are driving the Yeti , it can cause erratic or inconsistent handling . <p> 3 . Next we added a little foam to the battery tray to stop the battery from sliding back and forth after you have adjusted the height in the previous step . We cut up an old tire foam and used a little at both ends of the battery . Shoe Goo can be used to hold the foam in place so it stays put during battery changes . <p> 4 . Check all drive shaft set screws prior to your first run to ensure they are tight . You will also want to check these after your first battery pack as well , just to make sure they are still properly seated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the passenger side . Then , you can access the set screw from the drivers side with a long 2mm driver as shown . <p> This covers the initial inspection before you run your Yeti for the first time . Taking a few minutes to go over this list , as well as giving the entire vehicle a quick visual check , will definitely give you a better experience . We will have more maintenance tips and tricks coming soon as well ! Stay tuned ! !

@@36019232 @5019232/ <h> Add 4 Wheel Steering to Your Wraith <p> One modification that I wanted to make to the Wraith kit build I did here on the blog is 4 wheel steering . Driving a rig with four wheel steering is extremely fun , especially on a scaler that will see a lot of technical terrain . So , I recently gathered all the parts I would need to make this mod . In this article I will cover the parts used and give a few tips for making this conversion as simple as possible . Let 's get started <p> Parts list for 4ws conversion : <p> AX80073 AR60 OCP Steering Linkage <p> AX30777 AR60 OCP Servo Plate <p> AX30078 Zero Ackerman Steering Plates <p> AX30780 Wraith CVDs <p> AX30760 XR10 Aluminum Knuckles <p> AX30762 XR10 Aluminum C-hubs <p> AX30450 Steel Flange Pipes <p> AX80072 Servo Post Parts Tree <p> AX30524 Grey 91mm links <p> AXA1221 5x11mm Bearings <p> AXA1230 5x15mm Bearings <p> AXA1417 Grey 5mm spacer for steering <p> AXA1428 Grey 55mm standoff <p> AXA1331 Steel Flanged Balls <p> AXA465 M3x10mm Self tapping Flathead screws <p> AXA434 M3x8mm Self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M3x10mm Buttonhead Screws ( x3 ) <p> A few photos of the major parts required : <p> Steering linkage <p> Steering plates for knuckles <p> Servo plate <p> Aluminum knuckles <p> CVDs <p> Aluminum C-hubs <p> Steel flange pipes <p> Steel flanged balls <p> Before we get started there are a couple things I need to mention . One , I stretched the wheelbase of this Wraith already by replacing the stock rear lower links with our XR10 94mm lower links . This moved the rear axle back just over 6mm , or about a 1/4 ? . To extend the upper links to match the newly lengthened lowers , I used our long curved XR10 rod ends at the chassis instead of the short curved rod ends . You can see the new lowers and longer rod ends on the uppers in this photo . <p> Another mod I made was to flip the plastic rear upper shock mount/chassis cross member upside down . This lowered the rear of my Wraith a little , which lowers the overall center of gravity . I also added a grey 55mm threaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will explain why in a minute . <p> One thing I notice right away when I tried to mock the rear servo up , is the lack of uptravel in the suspension due to the servo case hitting the bottom of the tube chassis . The servo case hits the chassis almost immediately when you try to cycle the suspension . To fix this I removed the rear plastic lower chassis brace and replaced it with one of our 91mm grey lower links from the SCX10 's . I bolted the 91mm link into place where the widest part of the lower chassis brace normally sits . You could also cut the stock plastic chassis brace , and just use the long section to tie the 2 halves of the tube frame together . The aluminum link will provide a lot more rigidity though , so I went that route . Here you can see the brace I removed . <p> Look carefully and you can see the new 91mm link just below the upper links in this photo . Adding that 91mm link and the 55mm standoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity from removing the stock rear lower chassis brace . <p> After the lower rear chassis brace is removed/replaced you can mount the servo plate to the rear axle and attach the steering servo . I am using Futabas S9157 servos for steering duties on both axles . Here is a shot of my rear servo and servo plate before installation . I used the short self tapping M3x8mm buttonhead screws to attach the servo tabs to the servo plate . I will use the M3x10mm self tapping flathead screws to tie the servo plate to the axle . Then , I will use the M3x10mm buttonhead screws to attach the servo to the tabs . <p> If you have n't already , remove the rear wheels , drive hexes and cross pins . Next remove the rear plastic straight axle lockouts , and inner axle shafts . In order to remove the inner axle shafts , you will need to remove one of the screws holding the lower link/shock mounts in order to get the inner axles out of the housing . Replace the straight axles with the new CVDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings into your steering knuckles , bolt the steering plates onto the knuckles using four of the M3x10mm buttonhead screws , insert the flange pipes into the knuckles and slide them into place over the C-hubs . Secure the knuckles to the C-hubs with four more M3x10mm screws . Then re-install the cross pins and drive hexes . Next we can install the rear steering link . One thing you will notice is the steering link has to be run upside down to clear the differential cover . Not a big deal , but you will need to drill the existing .100 diameter hole in the tie rod that the drag link secures too , all the way through the linkage . Then use one of the 5mm spacers between the drag link and tie rod with the long M3x20mm buttonhead screw to tie everything together . I will eventually trim the plastic boss hanging below the steering linkage , I left it there for now so people can visually see what I am talking about . <p> A shot with everything buttoned up and ready to roll . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the rear axle shafts out too . <p> Here you can see at full compression of the rear suspension , the servo sits perfectly in the rear cargo area without any interference from the chassis . Since I stretched the wheelbase a little , I did have to trim the cage a little where the plastic chassis brace attaches to the back of the tube frame . If you are still running the stock rear upper and lower links this should n't be an issue . <p> One last adjustment I made was to zero out the caster angle in the rear steer to make life on the rear servo a little easier . To do this I added a 3mm grey spacer ( Part# AXA1415 ) to the lower links at the rear axle . <p> It is hard to see in this photo , but the rear steering kingpins are now perpendicular to the bench my Wraith is sitting on . This means the caster is set to zero degrees . Adding positive or negative caster will put more stress on the rear servo , and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stance now .. <p> One thing to keep in mind when adding rear steer to any vehicle , you may need to add a Castle BEC to your system , depending on the torque rating on the servos you use they may overload whatever ESC you are running . I am sporting a Tekin RS Pro ESC , Tekin 10.5t motor , Thunder Power 5300mah 2S lipo and dual Futaba S9157 servos . To my surprise after driving for a few hours with this set-up , the ESC was only overloaded a few times while trying to throttle out of a bind and steering with both axles simultaneously . I am going to try and gear my Wraith down a little to help alleviate that issue . But , in order to have smooth performance at all times installing a BEC is the only way to go . <p> Another thing to keep in mind is you will need at least a 3 channel radio , with a 3 position 3rd channel switch , to have independent control of your front and rear steering set-ups . I am using my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to set the rear steer up for 5 positions , center , 50% right , 50% left , 100% right and 100% left . Some radios will only allow you to steer the rear from center to full throw left or right . Only a dual stick radio will give you full proportional control of both steering set-ups . Now , you can run a 4ws set-up on a 2 channel radio as well , if you use a Y-harness to plug the servos in to work together . But , that set-up will give you 4ws all the time , there is no way to control the servos separately . Just a few things to keep in mind before you dive into converting your Wraith to 4 wheel steer . <h> 15 Comments : <p> Keagan Posted on 2011-12-06 20:28:27 <p> Awesome job ! <p> mitch Posted on 2011-12-07 12:06:27 <p> nise job , will there be a video <p> Bender Posted on 2011-12-08 09:55:27 <p> Thanks .

If that works all you need is a Y-harness to plug the 2 steering servos into . That will give you full time 4ws . If you cant get it to turn in the proper direction , a reversing harness may be needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacers instead of adjusting where the c hub carrier has splines for caster adjustment ? <p> On gear ratios , i 'm running 12 pinion &amp; 87 spur &amp; going with a 90 spur , when apart next time with only a 19 turn , its fast enough &amp; has great slow crawling . <p> U will need a servo reverser for 2 servo/1 channel alltime 4ws , the reverser is only around $10.00 &amp; has a centering adjuster screw , very handy for adjusting alignment between front &amp; rear .

This years dates are May 20th-22nd 2011 . <p> We are very excited to be a part of this event again , and look forward to being there with our core customers .

This class ended up being one of the most talked about classes all weekend , as it turned into a drivers class , since no one rig had an advantage over the other .

So , instead of driving 4 vehicles that are exactly the same , drivers will have to drive a totally different rig on each of the 4 courses . Should make for an interesting event to say the least , and we cant wait to see how it all unfolds . Plus , this will be the first time the general public gets a chance to drive a Wraith before they are even available in hobby shops . <p> So , without any more delay , here is your 2011 spec class line-up .

@@36019234 @5019234/ <h> Understanding Tire Wear <p> Tires are inarguably one of the most significant deciding factors when it comes to determining the real-world capability of a vehicle . Tires will make or break a RC vehicle . In the case of crawlers , where a lack of traction can lead to a nasty fall , tires can quite literally make or break a rig . You need the right tires , and to really get the most out of a set of tires you need to know when to replace them . <p> Most people think of reduced tread depth as the primary concern with tire wear . It may be important for your full-size car , but it is essentially a nonissue when it comes to RC applications such as rock crawling . The real issue at hand is rounded edges . When tires are new , the lugs have sharp edges that grab rocks and provide traction . Rounded edges will , in contrast , slip and spin . <p> Examine your tires closely and look at the forward edges of the lugs . If you look closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also most likely notice the rear facing edges of each lug are relatively new looking in comparison . <p> Where all of this leads is to hopefully making you realize the value of rotating your RC tires . Rotating tires really works for getting the most out of a set . When a set of tires has been rotated and both sides of the lugs are rounded off , its time to set the tires aside for practice and play and get a new set . <p> Another part of tire wear you need to understand is examining for tears and cuts . Tires come in different thicknesses - Thinner carcasses are , as you 'd expect , often easier to get tears and cuts in . The key to dealing with these puncture wounds is early detection . If you notice the damage before it gets too bad , you can actually fix the repair with CA glue . Its worth noting that some pretty long tears can be fixed , but have to be fixed in small sections at a time . 
@@36019237 @5019237/ <h> Axial Visits ICON Vehicle Dynamics <p> You have probably noticed a lot more full size off-road company names featured on Axial vehicles as of late . These names are not just another marketing ploy , but instead relationships that Axial has developed to bring you the best products we can . We all know that R/C vehicles are scale representations of full size vehicles , so is n't it natural that Axial would want to work with full size companies to make their products as accurate as possible ? There are obviously components that can not be made to scale , due to the abuse that an R/C- vehicle will see , which is way more intense than a full size rig would endure . Take an R/C- car and let it tubmle off a 10 ' rock , which would be scaled to a 100 ' rock in full scale , where a full size vehicle would be literally totaled and made into scrap metal ; your Axial rig keeps on ticking . So as you can imagine , not all components scale out just right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension tuning crosses over extremely well . The Axial staff recently ventured out to Riverside , California to have a technical chat with Dylan Evans and company at ICON Vehicle Dynamics so I tagged along to bring you the scoop ! <p> ICON Vehicle Dynamics is a very unique company staffed with some of the most talented suspension development experts in the nation . Headed up by SCORE off road racing champion Dylan Evans , who also knows rock crawling through his membership of the Poly Goats Four Wheel Drive Club of Cal Poly SLO ; Evans and company know a thing or two about how to deal with rough terrain at all speeds . As the name implies , this company focuses on the unique characteristics of each vehicles dynamics ( forces causing motion ) , and how to improve that vehicles ability to tackle rough terrain while significantly improving ride quality . <p> ICON Vehicle Dynamics is further unique due to their manufacturing process , which all takes place " in house " at their Riverside , Ca facility . The ICON Vehicle Dynamics philosophy demands the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products in the USA and deliver to the consumer the best mix of top-shelf product and customer service . This philosophy has made ICON Vehicle Dynamics stand out in a sea of aftermarket companies and has them labelled as the place to go if you demand the best available . <p> Cool ICON Decal ! <p> Here is a short video they have as an introductory to their company , check it out ! <p> We started out our visit with ICON Vehicle Dynamics in their large meeting room , where we met with the marketing staff , the general manager , and the engineering staff . This gave both companies an opportunity to discuss the similarities between the two companies . It is amazing how we share the same customers and the same passion for the off road lifestyle <p> After the meeting , we were off to the warehouse and shop area to check out where the magic happens . I made a few pit stops on the way out of the offices to snap a few pictures of some cool stuff I saw laying around . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axial EXO proudly on display ! <p> The SCX10 Honcho articulated in the office <p> The line-up of Axial vehicles featuring ICON branding <p> I decided to peak out the windows from the upstairs office and sneak a few shots of the facility from a birds eye view .

These guys make some really impressive components . <p> Everything about ICON Vehicle Dynamics , from their design process , to the manufacturing all the way to packaging , is top notch !

We figured since we were here , we should go ahead and remove them to see how they were doing , as well as make a slight valving adjustment . We pulled the SCX10JK up in the shop , and Adrian ( shock building master ) got to work . <p> The first step was to remove all of the shocks <p> Once the shocks were off of the vehicle , Adrian set up the shock dyno , yes I said shock dyno ! This is where these guys take technology to the next level to put their experience into scientific numbers . <p> The numbers from the shock are then placed on a graph in real time on a computer screen <p> The objective of the change was to make the shocks 25% lighter on the compression valving to make the clickers more effective through their range of adjustment . We found that the SCX10JK never went above 6-clicks even in the harshest of terrain . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic on the Dyno and out in the shop as they dissassembled and re-assembled the shocks for the adjustments . We will let the pictures tell most of the story <p> The shock pistons look quite a lot different than the average R/C shock piston . These pistons have valve shims that are designed to flex out of the way of piston holes to let fluid pass . The one unique feature of full size ICON shocks is their very drastic difference in tunability between compression and rebound settings . Were we would normally make changes in the R/C world with oil viscosity , these guys make changes with shims . They have been doing it long enough to know what shim stack will make the desired change , and only have to tear them down once and get it dialed in perfect ! <p> The seal heads are similar to the R/C versions , here is a cut away version of the ICON seal head <p> Once the shocks are completely reassembled , its back to the dyno for a comparison check from the original numbers <p> Dylan fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap top and confirms they are good to go ! <p> While Adrian re-installs the shocks on the SCX10JK , Dylan , Brandon and Matt discuss some of the suspension tuning Dylan has been doing on his Axial EXO and Wraith . Dylan is also an R/C enthusiast and really gets into the deep technical theory conversation with Matt and Brandon . <p> It was extremely cool to be a fly on the wall while the head of R&amp;D from both of these companies exchange theories and ideas . It will be very interesting to see where this corroboration leads in the future . One thing for sure , with Partners like ICON Vehicle Dynamics , there will not be an issue gathering insight into the full size world when developing the next Axial vehicles . <p> Thank you Dylan and Crew at Icon Vehicle Dynamics , we appreciate your hospitality , and look forward to future visits !

The molded plastic rollcage , fenders and bumpers are all realistic features you would see on any hardcore 1:1 trail rig . Also included are molded plastic tail lights , side view mirrors , steering wheel , gear shifter , D-rings and even a fuel filler assembly for the Fuel Safe fuel cell which adds even more realism to the overall look . <p> For this article I will cover how you can add a little more detail to your new SCX10 , with parts that are included in the RTR box .

Measure .300 out from the mark on the center of your fuel cell to get your drill points . Mark those points with a marker and drill them out with a body reamer . <p> Take your time when drilling / reaming the holes . Make sure you test fit the fuel cap assembly as you go .

@@36019246 @5019246/ <h> Decal Removal <p> While its a task most of us rush to get done , applying decals can be tricky . Less than careful work can yield crooked decals with creases and air bubbles . But , what about removing decals ? When you peel decals right after they have been applied , they might come off cleanly . Decals that have been adhered for a while may be difficult to remove , coming apart incompletely and in pieces , or at the very least leave a lot of messy residue behind . Using certain solvents can work , but some can easily damage Lexan . Lifting the edge of a decal with a sharp hobby knife can work and often does , but you need to be careful to not scratch the body . <p> The best way to remove a decal is to use heat to loosen the adhesive . The key is to use heat , but not too much heat . A hobby-grade heat gun can be used , but most get hot enough to damage the body ( and your skin ) if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . Rarely do hairdryers get hot enough to damage Lexan , but most get plenty hot enough to loosen the adhesive . When using a hairdryer , or any heat gun for that matter , turn it on and let it run . The wire coils inside take a second or two to heat up . Start with the hair dryer close enough to target the decal you want to remove , but not so close that too much direct heat is applied . Keep the heat source moving and only apply heat to the non-painted side of the body . <p> If a small decal that is close to other decals needs to be removed , the heat trick may not work . You may have to go simple and use your finger nail to scrape the decal off . To remove the residue that has likely been left behind , use an ordinary cotton swab and a cleaner such as rubbing alcohol to target the specific area . A careful touch here will prevent damage to surrounding decals.

Well , do n't worry ; we have you covered with the Axial bead-lock series of wheel . All Axial wheels are made from super strong composite material and come in several high quality finishes so you can customize the look of your truck . The 17mm hex is fast becoming the standard for super strong durability and light weight performance . For those that do n't want to step up to the 17mm just quite yet all the Axial wheels include an adapter set that allows you to fit them to current 14mm hex hubs.The 8 Spoke Oversize wheels will fit directly on to most 1/8 scale vehicles and fit all Axial Oversize Tires as well as Pro-Line 40 series . 
@@36019249 @5019249/ <h> Mount Scale Accessories <p> Axial Racing 's scale accessories are designed to be easy to attach to a body , but there are steps you can take to get more realistic results and to ensure the scale accessories stay put . <p> Mirrors Side mirrors might be small , but they undeniably make a huge difference and really up the scale realism of a body . Quite possibly the most important tool for mounting the vast majority of scale accessories , including side mirrors , is a high quality body reamer . Axial 's thin reamer is more precise than a large reamer and perfect for this type of work because it makes it much harder to cut an overly large hole . The first step in mounting your mirrors correctly is to go online and do a little research . Search for photos of full-size trucks similar to your model . This will help you select the best mirror style and locate the correct placement . After you have located where you want to mount the mirror , use a permanent marker to mark the spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . Go slowly and make sure you do not create too large of a hole . Do n't worry if the mirror fits slightly loose as the mounting method we recommend will secure the mirror . Axial 's scale accessory parts trees include shims . The shims are not always needed , but are very handy for achieving the desired angle of the mirror on different bodies . If shims are used , a small amount of modeler 's cement will keep them in place . Glue the shim to the mirror 's mounting plate . Do not glue the shim to the body . The glue is n't necessary , but it will keep the shim from rotating . When the mirror is inserted through the body , slide one of the supplied O-rings over the small nub . If a shim is used , the O-ring can be difficult , if not impossible , to install . Do not worry if you ca n't get an O-ring on . Either way , secure the mirror with one of the small body clips . The real trick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body . Silicone will still be flexible when dry and can be removed if the mirror needs to be replaced . A healthy glob of silicone glue will secure the body clip and keep the mirror from rotating on the body . <p> Windshield Wipers Windshield wipers are more straight forward and easier to mount than side mirrors , but they too require a little bit of research for the best results . For example , if you 're trying to make your Deadbolt look like an early Bronco and have added a windshield , mount the wipers from the top of the windshield frame . <p> Dirty Windshield Trick Real off-road vehicles get dirty and one of the places that always catches dirt and grime is the windshield . You can easily mimic the dirty windshield look and the results are truly eye-catching . This technique requires a lot of masking , but is fairly easy to full off . What you are to do is mask off the entire body . A plastic bag will be a big help here . Next , carefully mask off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially look like two overlapping half circles . The only part of the body that should be exposed is the parts of the windshield that the wipers do n't clean . Sometimes there is a small section in between the wipers at the bottom of the windshield that also does n't get cleaned . When you 're satisfied with how everything is sufficiently masked , spray a very light coat of brown Lexan safe paint . Hold the can twice as far away as you normally would and move the paint spray across in a smooth motion . You are not painting the windshield brown . The goal is to slightly tint the area . Next , do an even lighter coat of black . Be extremely careful to only perform a quick , light coat . Also , resist the temptation to add more paint . When the paint dries , it will cover slightly better than it looks wet . Plus , you do n't want the windshield to look completely filthy when the rest of the body is relatively clean .

Off-roaders , however , usually , just suffer the damage until it has to be fixed . Making a fake crack is easy , but you have to be carefully so you do n't hurt yourself or your vehicle 's body . Using a hobby knife , draw a slightly zigzagging crack down the windshield . You can add a few small offshoots if you like .

I picked the GoPro camera since it can both record in HD and send the live feed out for the FPV link , and it features a nice wide angle lens that makes for a great perspective inside the Wraith cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera mount plate that would fit onto the Wraith to hold the GoPro ( or other cameras ) firm onto the truck to handle the sometimes bumpy ride , and we came up with something that works perfect for a camera mount either just to add a GoPro for simple recording , or for full on FPV . <p> On the truck side it was setup with the GoPro linked to the ImmersionRC 5.8G 600mw video transmitter and Circular Wireless ( CW ) Skew Planar antenna to help improve the video link quality cruising around on the ground . <p> That signal was sent to a 5.8G wireless receiver module using another CW Skew antenna on some FatShark Dominator goggles where I could see the video from the Wraith to drive it . <p> The 5.8G setup was clean and concise and the small Circular Wireless antenna were easy to tuck under the roll bars to protect them from roll overs . <p> This made for a " grab and go " setup with the FPV enabled Wraith , radio and goggles that 's it ! <p> Once running in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbs and trail running , and even some short course like fun just to try it out . <p> I also built up a second Wraith kit version and did a custom paint job honoring ReadyMadeRC as a sponsor along with Axial and hit the road for some tandem FPV action with the trucks . <p> The Wraiths perform great and driving from inside the cab is a total blast . If you 've not tried FPV , you should check it out for your ground vehicle . Its a ton of fun challenging yourself with the new driving perspective alone or with friends . <p> Check out the video ! This is exactly what I see while driving the vehicle <p> You can get all the featured FPV gear and camera mounting kit from ReadyMadeRC <p> You can also check more pics , build info and links to the components here

I started the build on my EXO Kit , so excuse its rough looks . <p> Some more trimming , fitting , and head scratching resulted in the following : <p> I immediately knew this body needed something to top it off- How about Axials Universal Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paint scheme was easy. - I know this is a VW and not a Toyota , but I could n't resist . <p> To finish off the lighting I installed a pair of the small round buckets included on the Axial Light Bucket Set. - Part Number : AX80045 <p> Now for the fun part. - My AX90024 Axial EXO Terra Buggy RTR is still fresh and right out of the box. - Let the modifications begin. - With the body already trimmed to fit and the basic modifications required already laid out this was an easy build ! <p> First things first , I removed those awesome green body panels . The rear wing was also removed for now. - Still undecided on the look with/without the wing . <p> Because the hood of the VW body is longer I had to look at finding a way to move the front bumper out of the way. - So for now I simply removed the bumper brace. - Add that to the pile of removed parts <p> I also wanted to give this build more of a long travel stance. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid travel for ideal handling. - I decided to use some longer rear springs in the front to achieve the look I am after. - Some 14x70mm Firms did the trick. - Part Number : AX30221 . <p> To mount the VW baja body I decided to avoid using the existing hardware that was used to mount the EXO Terra Buggy body. - Instead I fabricated some body mounts. - Lots of ways to do this but here are the parts and placement I decided to go with . <p> I picked up some some threaded posts. - They were included with Traxxas TRA3727A. - The simply threaded into the existing hole that held down the old hood . <p> I also trimmed the hood mounts on the front to allow the body to sit as low as possible. - The two mounts circled in red were cut flush . <p> For the rear body mounts I dug through the parts box. - These started life as AX10 body mounts. - Part number : AX80005 <p> I simply cut them to the required length and drilled a new hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confirmed the length I used the existing holes on the EXO cage ( where the original body mounts ) . - I used some M3x15mm Tapping Buttonheads that used to hold on the bumper compression brace. - Perfect length for this , and a great way to re-use parts from the " removed " pile . <p> The end result looks factory. - I even have some adjustment left to fine tune the fitment of the VW Baja Bug Body . <p> Next I decided to remove the rear light bezel. - The roof of the VW Baja Bug body will cover this , and removing this allowed me to get the body to set at the desired height. - Plus this gives me easy access to install the radiator. - Note : It is possible to remove the light bezel without removing the cage , I used an Axial 2.0mm ball driver. - Axial Part Number : AX20021 <p> Guess what is included in the spare parts bag of the Axial EXO Terra Buggy RTR ? - How about an officially licensed Griffin Radiator. - Score ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great accessory for your SCX10 or Wraith. - Part Number : AX80103 <p> I decided to cut the radiator off and lay down some silver paint for scale realism . <p> Radiator assembly and installation . <p> Did you catch that additional parts tree with rod ends I showed in the picture of the radiator ? - They provided a perfect solution for adjusting the position of the front bumper to fit the VW body. - I picked up some M3x25mm threaded turnbuckles , Part Number : AXA1633 to complete the assembly of the links . The following screws and nuts were used to mount the assembled links to the bumper and bulkhead : <p> One thing I really liked about the 1:1 inspiration was the overall width and stance. - I decided to mimic this look by simply installing some front wheels and tires on the back of the EXO. - The EXO Terra Buggy comes with narrow front wheels/tires and standard rear wheels/tires. - To match the narrow wheels/tires on all 4 corners I needed the following parts : <p> Here is my final pile of removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body panels and a new wing now ! <p> Here is a shot of the cutouts on the hood to clear the shocks. - Also note the cutouts for the front bumper , this wasnt necessary but I did n't  want to take away too much clearance from the front by pushing the bumper any further forward . <p> Install time , simply remove the 2 button head tapping screws holding on the center brace from each side and it comes right out . ( 4 Screws total ) <p> I grabbed 4 of the M2.6 button heads that held all the original green body panels to the cage. - These will be used again to mount the motor . <p> Once mounted it simply slides into place. - The detail of the motor and radiator should definitely make this VW Baja Build stand out . <p> Ready for it ? ! ? <p> The completed build is definitely very unique. - It was surprisingly simple to do as well ! - The EXO Terra Buggy platform has a ton of potential for scale builds and replicas. - Already brainstorming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . <h> 9 Comments : <p> Dave Posted on 2012-08-22 18:48:55 <p> Wow , it really came out great !

The Axial WraithG changes the game with its impressive 1:1 scale looks , high-speed monster truck " bashability , " and technical " crawl " capabilities .

The WraithG can go in so many directions ; desert sand , mountain trail runner , rock racer , mud bogger and any form of backyard bashing that can be dreamed up ! <p> Within the 1:1 full size crawl &amp; off-road race segments , overall tire diameters have been on the rise , literally and directly influencing the R/C crawl segment , thus this Axial Ripsaw reflects this attraction of flirting with rocks at speed with a compelling design that will give your rig the aggressive competition look and performance . R/C crawlers will clearly benefit with larger ground clearance where it counts as the Ripsaw measures 5.5 ? 140mm in diameter . This gives the lowest point on the 4X4 axle housing more clearance thus giving you many more tactical driving options in those sticky predicaments !

It has an awesome realistic C channeled frame that reminds me of the old Tamiya Bruiser frame , and had awesome 1.9 bead locks and proline flat iron tires . At the time of their kit being released , I had so many projects going on that I did n't  have the chance to pick one up . With the winter upon me here in NY , the temps have dropped and its back into the shop for a winter of pure building . I picked up a kit and started thinking what I wanted to build . Since I am huge Toyota fan , work as a tech at a dealer , and own 2 1:1 trucks ( an 02 Taco on 35s , and 86 4runner soon to be SAS ) I knew I wanted to build another Toyota .

Finally the gears started turning and it hit mea 4 door Hilux would be awesome ! There are only 2 or 3 that I know of on the web so I figured why not . I have never tried any sort of 4 door build myself so I figured not only would it be cool but it would be something to challenge me to step up my game . <p> I grabbed 2 NIB Hilux cabs off the shelf , grabbed the masking tape and fired up the Dremel . <p> I carefully cut the 2nd cab in less then half and cut the rear window section of the 1st cab . After that , I joined the 2 cabs together using .030 styrene on the side of the door areas of the cabs and the underside of the roofs as well . <p> When building scale RC Crawlers I always find it best to use the least amount of body filler as possible . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack easier and the weight will actually start to add up quickly . In order to avoid the roof being full of filler I decided to skin the roof using .030 piece of plastic styrene on the top and .010 on the sides . <p> After getting the roof skinned , I applied the 1st coat of filler . While the filler was curing I decided to get started on making the rear window frames . I started 1st by making the front uprights.The main frame support was .060 styrene square stock and the sub frame being .030 <p> I then made the top part of the frame using the same pieces of styrene for the front portion of the window frame <p> Well that is it for now , please be sure to check back often for more updates on the 4 door lux . <p> Thanks -Mike <h> 6 Comments : <p> Brandon Posted on 2009-12-15 14:26:17 <p> Looking Good Mike !

@@36019278 @5019278/ <h> Custom 6+6 SCX10 <p> here 's a little sneak peek at a project I have been working on in my spare time . I have always wanted to build a custom 6+6 , but never really had the time . Recently I decided I was going to make time to get this project going . It is still a build in progress at this point , but it is drivable now . I have run a few battery packs through it so far so I can tune the suspension . I am at the point now where it is working pretty good , I just need to finish a few details . I want to make inner fender wells , add rock rails , waterproof the electronics , finish the cage work , add some scale details and maybe redo the stock Honcho bed in styrene . <p> Here is what the overall stance looks like now with the new Pro-line 2.2 Super Swamper SXs installed . I love the looks of these new tires , and the G8 compound ensures they will work great in all conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here you can see that I linked the rear axle off the center axle , then installed a custom panhard bar to eliminate axle steer . <p> That should cover the parts I used on this particular build , but it is possible that I am missing a small detail or two . You will need a fair amount of M3x.5 screws in various lengths , as well as an assortment of rod ends , some basic hand tools to fab the panhard bar bracket and the braces I made to tie the two frames together . You will also need some patience . There will be some trial and error involved if people want to replicate this build even with the parts list I supplied . Its just a fact of life when it comes to building one off custom rigs . The best advice I can give is take your time , and do it right the first time . You will be a lot happier in the long run . <h> 17 Comments : <p> sabahan crawler Posted on 2010-11-16 18:34:13 <p> this is amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on sale so we can order . nice . <p> wondering about the middle axle is this already out or is this modded axle ? ? ? thanks for any info and awesome as overall ! ! <p> Travis Brock Posted on 2010-11-17 14:41:27 <p> Wow ! ! ! <p> Andrew just sent me a link to this and its very cool .

@@36019279 @5019279/ <h> Step By Step Wraith Kit Build Part V Chassis <p> Next step in our Wraith kit build is the assembly of the chassis . Flip to page 26 in the Wraith kit manual , start with step 25 . <p> Find bag E and the corresponding parts required from the various parts trees . <p> We will start with the light buckets , grab everything you will need to complete this step . <p> Grab the first light bucket and mounting bracket . <p> Insert the light bucket , part number AX80045B-5 , inside the mounting bracket , part number AX80045B-2 . <p> Install the LED holder , part number AX80045A-1 , on the backside of the light bucket with the supplied 2x6mm screws . <p> Tie the bucket and bracket together using another 2x6mm screw . <p> Now snap the light bucket lens into place . <p> Repeat the last few steps for the second light bucket . <p> Grab the remaining parts needed to complete step 25 . <p> Install the light buckets to the bottom of the rear frame cross member , part number AX80077-001-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross member assembly . <p> Now install the battery tray as directed with the supplied 2.6x8mm flat head screws . <p> Jump to page 27 and step 26 . Lay everything out needed for this step . <p> Tie the lower part of the tube frame to the upper left side of the chassis . <p> Install the left shock mount next . <p> Last thing we need to do for step 26 is install the front bumper support and radio box base . <p> Step 27 is next , lay everything out you 'll need to complete this step . <p> Assemble the right side just like you did the left side . At this point I installed the battery tray on the right side chassis plate , even though the instructions say to mount it to the left side chassis assembly . Either method will work fine , it has no bearing on the assembly process . <p> Next we will prep the radio box . <p> Start by applying the thin strip of foam to the top half of the radio box . <p> Then install the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Attach the bottom half of the radio box to the frame support . <p> Flipping to page 30 you will see its time to start on the body panels . All the panels laid out like a blank canvas . Make sure you wash the inside of the body panels with soap and water before painting . Regular dish detergent will work fine . This will help the paint stick to the panels properly . Its a bummer to spend time painting a body all up only to have the paint flake off during your first rollover because you skipped this step . The instructions suggest cutting the panels out first , then washing them and paint last . I washed the panels first , then paint and trim last . Again , either method works great , its just personal preference . <p> The theme for this build will be black on black ! ! Here you can see the painted roof and dash panels . <p> Next I trimmed the dash per the instructions . <p> Dressing up the dash with some decals . An X-acto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wraith side panels and hood I am going to do something a little different . I am going to use the over spray film as a paint mask . I am going to paint parts of these few panels on the outside , and the inside , to get a gloss black on flat black effect . Keeping it simple I laid out the paint job as desired on the outside of the body panels with electrical tape . <p> The hood . <p> I am even going to carry the paint job into the interior a little , with one flat black strip on the transmission tunnel . <p> Now use your X-acto to cut the desired areas to be painted on the outside of the body away . <p> Peel your cut areas away very carefully . If your cuts are n't  nice and clean , when you remove these pieces it may pull up the rest of your over spray film at the same time . Patients is key here , take your time . <p> Next I painted the inside of the body panels black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Corbeau seats . <p> Slide the back rest of the seats into place . <p> Move the seat back into position , and secure using the supplied 3x12mm self tapping screws . <p> Using my X-acto knife again to position the seat detail stickers . <p> Both seats assembled and detailed . <p> Back to the body panels . Now that the inside of the panels have been painted with a few light coats , its time to paint the outside . Take a minute to do one last visual scan to ensure the over spray film is n't pulled up in an area it should n't be . Then paint the outside of the panels . I use very light coats of paint to get the desired coverage needed , and to keep the paint a consistent color . Once this coat of paint on the outside is dry , you can remove the over spray film . <p> Subtle but cool ! ! <p> A couple shots with the flash directed at the body to show the contrast . <p> Interior . <p> Next I rough cut the panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then I go back and cut the panels to size as needed . Cutting the body twice takes a little extra time , but your body lines will be a lot cleaner using this method compared to cutting it on the body lines the first time . <p> Its best to use a body reamer to cut the front grill area cleanly for the chassis tubes that will hold the front bumper . Use a reamer to punch the holes in position , then cut the remaining body out with scissors . <p> Simple sticker scheme for the side panels . <p> Time to add some detail to that interior . Using your body reamer , punch all the holes needed in the interior tray to finish detailing it . <p> After applying the interior decals , we can add the cool scale bits into the drivers compartment . <p> Attach the shifters to the proper spots in the interior . <p> Finish building the dashboard . <p> Finish the interior by bolting in the seats and dash . <p> Now we will attach the interior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior into place I noticed that it was n't sitting square to the chassis . Closer inspection exposed the culprit . There is a boss molded into the roll cage that allows you to bolt the body panels on . This tab was hitting the interior floor pan before I could get it into position . So , a little trimming with the body scissors was in need . I just had to elongate the scallops on the sides of the floor pan beside the seats and everything fit fine after that .

The panhard par will locate the axle side to side and needs to be parallel to the drag link . There is a lot of great information on this on RCC. http : //www.rccrawler.com . Once that is setup properly you wont have to worry about the tire kicking out when flexing . This is also known as bumpsteer . <p> Brandon Posted on 2012-03-19 07:38:44 <p> I believe that is the 4 ? box . On long G6 runs I remove the lid as long as there are n't  any water obstacles . Even with the lid on I havent had any heat issues , although that 's dependent on the ESC you use . <p> Erik Posted on 2012-04-29 11:09:56 <p> Hi Brandon , how did you actually mount the project box ?

@@36019289 @5019289/ <h> Benders AX10 Ridgecrest Stage 2 <p> Its time for Part 2 of our Ridgecrest crawler build . For those that missed Stage 1 , here is a link to that article in order to bring you up to speed.Stage 1 Ridgecrest crawler build <p> Out of the box the Ridgecrest is meant to be more of a basher , rather then a full on crawler . So , for Stage 2 of this build we will cover more tips , and option parts , to improve upon its crawling capabilities . <p> First thing we will work on for this installment is the steering . Out of the box the Ridgecrest comes equipped with a plastic servo horn , which works fine with the stock steering links . But , I want piece of mind when out crawling and do n't  like making repairs in the field . So , I am going to install an aluminum servo horn , and upgrade the plastic ball studs to steel for a little smoother steering action . Some may think that upgrading the plastic steering links at this time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little flex in my steering set-up on my crawlers . Some of you may recall I ran Delrin steering links on my competition crawler for years with good success . Its really personal preference at this point . <p> Start by removing both front tires . <p> Use a 2mm driver and remove the button head screw from the servo output . <p> After removing the screw , slide the servo horn off the splines . <p> Now remove the plastic servo horn from the steering drag link . <p> Using a pair of wire cutters remove the plastic ball stud from the steering drag link . <p> Now we will replace the plastic ball stud with a steel stud . <p> Use a pair of pliers to pop the new steel stud into place . <p> The new replacement servo horn . There are a few different spline counts for the various servos that are available on the market . For RTR Axial vehicles you will need a 25 spline servo horn , which is compatible with Futaba and Savox servos as well . <p> Install the servo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servo horn into place on the servo output . Make sure your servo is centered before tightening everything up . Reinstall the button head screw to hold the new servo horn in place . <p> These new servo horns have small screws on each side of the head . When these screws are tightened down the servo horn actually clamps onto the servos output splines like a piranha . A must have for harsh conditions . Use a 1.5mm driver and gently tighten up both screws evenly . <p> Next we will pop a new steel stud into place at the opposite end of the drag link . Remove the self tapping screw that ties the drag link to the tie rod . <p> Pop the old stud out and replace with a steel ball stud . <p> Now remove the tie rod from the steering knuckles and replace the plastic ball studs there too . <p> After replacing the ball studs I left one end of the tie rod off the knuckle to access the differential cover . This is for my next modification . <p> Next we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even more beef , to those AR60 axles . <p> Use a 1.5mm driver and remove the 4 screws on each side of the stock plastic diff cover . <p> Remove the cover . <p> Insert the new diff cover and re-install the diff cover screws . Re-attach the steering tie rod to the knuckle when finished . <p> Make sure to trim any excess flashing away with an X-acto knife . This has no performance gain , it just makes for a cleaner install . <p> Once you have the threaded studs installed , assemble the lower links . Make sure the rod ends as facing opposite ways as shown in this photo . Pops the ball studs into place last . <p> Now move on to the upper links . <p> Repeat the same steps for the upper links . All 4 upper links assembled . Again make sure the rod ends are facing opposite each other . <p> Remove the lower links and swap them out for the new aluminum lowers . <p> Now swap the upper links out as well . Pay attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are installed the same way . <p> Here you can see the front after completing the conversion to aluminum links . The aluminum will eliminate any link flex in hard binds , which makes for a more predictable vehicle . <p> Another mod I want to make for this Stage 2 build is the jump from Tamiya battery connectors to Deans Ultra Plugs . I plan on running small lipo packs in this build from here on out , and all my small packs have Deans plugs . So , the Tamiya plug had to go . <p> Snip , Snip ! ! <p> First thing I do after cutting the old plug off is to slide the heat shrink tubing for the Ultra Plug into place . Nothing is worse then installing new battery connectors and putting your soldering iron away , only to realize you forgot the slide the heat shrink on first . Doh ! ! <p> Strip a little of the wires insulation off the ends to be soldered , and twist the ends of the wire to prevent fraying . <p> Using your soldering iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solder . Do the same to the tabs on the Deans plug as well . <p> Solder the new connector into place , make sure to double check the polarity is correct before plugging a battery in . Now slide the heat shrink tubing down over the terminals and heat them up with a lighter to seat/shrink them . <p> Here you can see I have a few older small 2S lipo packs that I will be using for this stage of this build . <p> Next modification I made was the jump to XR10 beadlock wheels and our sticky R35 compound Ripsaw tires . The difference in traction between these tires and the stock tires is unreal . I could n't scrape up a new set for this build so I borrowed my old set off the Project Backyard Basher Ridgecrest build . I also added some weight to the front wheels . This helps keep the front tires planted on steep climbs . <p> The Vanquish wheel weights slide right into the stock XR10 wheels . <p> Last modification for this round was a fresh new Ridgecrest body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body lines a little better . A few shots of this build in its current state . <p> That takes care of Stage 2 . I will try to shoot some video of this build as it sits now , before I move on to Stage 3 . Stay tuned ! ! <h> 6 Comments : <p> I 'm loving my exo and already considering getting another Axial RC . I was pu off of thr ridgecrest initially because I do n't  like the stock RTR body with the opaque silver windows . <p> What a difference it makes , looks much more scale more expensive and less of a toy . <p> Mike Posted on 2012-08-14 02:39:55 <p> Ok , so I bought a Ridgecrest about two weeks ago . Done your upgrades in installment one and two . Managed to brake a C hub and nuckle at the same time because the screw kept loosening . So I went aluminum on those . Now where the C hub bolts to the axle the screws keep comming out after tightening them back on knowing I was screwing into plastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripping it out . Having this problem all over the truck . Money pit . Wheels amazing though . <p> Bender Posted on 2012-08-15 15:23:41 <p> Try going to a machined threaded screw on the C-hubs .

Well , do n't worry ; we have you covered with the Axial bead-lock series of wheel . All Axial wheels are made from super strong composite material and come in several high quality finishes so you can customize the look of your truck . The 17mm hex is fast becoming the standard for super strong durability and light weight performance . For those that do n't want to step up to the 17mm just quite yet all the Axial wheels include an adapter set that allows you to fit them to current 14mm hex hubs.The 8 Spoke Oversize wheels will fit directly on to most 1/8 scale vehicles and fit all Axial Oversize Tires as well as Pro-Line 40 series . 
@@36019295 @5019295/ <h> Benders AX10 Ridgecrest Stage 1 <p> As some of you may have seen I recently built up a new Axial Ridgecrest dubbed " Project Backyard Basher " . It was built for all around bashing , trail running and a little light duty crawling without adhering to any rules or specifications . I have been having a lot of fun with it in its current state . But , I also wanted to build another one up for entry level competitions . These competitions require your rig to fit certain criteria , like having a maximum wheelbase of 12 1/2 ? for the 2.2 comp class . I wanted to do this build in a few different stages starting with some very basic mods and eventually evolve that into a hardcore crawler , with durability in mind . While the Ridgecrest is pretty stout right out of the box , I want to take it even further with vital option parts in key areas . Those modifications will come later though . For now , I want to see how capable I make this rig just spending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started ! <p> The new Ridgecrest that was recently liberated from its box . <p> First thing I wanted to do was get as much weight over the front axle as possible .

Start by unscrewing the top cap on the radio box . <p> Now remove the last two screws that hold the top half of the radio box in place . <p> Flip the top half of the radio box up and unplug the ESC and servo . It is important to pay attention when you unplug everything so you know how it goes back together . <p> Remove the wire routing tab from the motor wires . <p> Unplug the motor wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on/off switch . <p> Remove the power switch . <p> Then remove the 4 screws holding the electronics tray in place , and remove the electronics tray . <p> An overall shot of the chassis with both trays removed . <p> Time to re-assemble .

You will notice the servo wire lead is probably too short to plug back into the receiver now . No big deal , you will just need to spend a few bucks for a servo extension wire . This is basically an extension cord for your servo wire . Plug the servo lead into the female end of the extension , plug the other end into your receiver and you are ready to go . Notice I have already plugged everything back into its required place . Route the antenna wire out the top half of the radio box , and run the servo and ESC wires in from the top . <p> here 's a shot of the servo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to the opposite side of the chassis from the stock location , just to keep wires neatly routed along the chassis plates .

Make sure your wires are neatly tucked in and clear of being pinched between the two halves of the box . <p> Grab the top cap for the radio box and route the antenna wire through the cap from the bottom . <p> Secure the top cap with the last two screws . <p> Plug the motor wires back together and secure them to the chassis plate with the wire routing tab . <p> Another overall shot of the chassis now that the battery tray is out front . <p> Next thing I wanted to improve upon is the ride height .

@@36019298 @5019298/ <h> Wraith Kit Build Scale Details <p> Over the holidays I found some time to start adding scale details to the step by step Wraith kit build . I still have a little more work to do , but I wanted to update the blog with what I have done so far . Most of my time was spent detailing the rear " cargo " area of the Wraith . My intent with the scale details was to give this Wraith the look that it was out for a day long trail run . So , there are no tents , kayaks , firewood , etc. , just what you would see loaded up for a day trip . I also added a driver figure to the cab . After some extensive searching for a normal looking guy , that actually fit the scale of the Wraith , I ended up going with the Sam Fisher action figure from the popular " Splinter Cell " line of video games . So , when the wife asked what I wanted for X-mas , I told her Sam Fisher ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonderful wife she is , she searched it out and bought it for me . Thanks babe ! <p> On to the details.a few shots of the rear cargo area . I added a couple Pro-line scale accessories like the Hi-lift jack , axe , cooler and gas can . <p> Next , I fabbed up some panels out of styrene and painted them black to box the rear lower portion of the cage in . I attached the panels to the extra holes in the rear shock tower , and added our scale battery from the EXO kit . It is sitting on a shelf for now , but I will be making a battery strap for the top , and I plan to add wires going to the terminals as well . Another thing you will see is I added aluminum panels to the rear of the cage . These are the inserts from the wings of the Honcho bumper , Part # AX30530 . I held the aluminum inserts from the bumper in place on the cage , then scribed the hole location using the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a punch to mark the center of the hole , then drill it out to .100 diameter . I tapped the holes for M3 screws , and attached them to the cage with M3 flathead screws . Last thing you will see is I added our Lexan gas tank from the Honcho , Part # AX80046 . I cut just the gas tank portion out of the Lexan flatbed , and attached it to the shock tower/chassis brace . <p> Moving on to the back of the cargo area . You can see I added the radiator from our EXO kit as well . If you remove the rear lights from the bottom of the cage , you will see the hole spacing is perfectly matched to the radiator . I used our long M3 set screws to attach the bottom of the radiator . I did drill the cage and radiator mounting holes for M3 screws though , so you may need to open them up slightly before the set screws will thread in . To cap the top of the radiator off I cut a section of Honcho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butts up against the back of the Honcho cab , it is the bottom bar . You will notice the hole spacing is perfectly matched to the radiator as well . I used a couple M3 self tapping screws to tie the tube to the top of the radiator . Then bent the ends of the tube in to try and match the profile of the existing Wraith cage . One last detail on the radiator is the radiator hose . I used an 1/8 ? drill bit to drill a shallow hole in the top right corner of the radiator . Then , bent a small piece of 1/8 ? solder at 90 degrees and pressed it into the hole . Last thing needed was some black nitro fuel line , which slides over the solder perfectly . Next , I added some scale mesh to the rear tailgate area of the cage . That mesh started life as a business card holder , the scale is perfect for this application . I made a cardboard template to fit the rear first , then used that to cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is needed to hold it in place . Of course , I added one of my old Colorado vanity plates to the mesh as a final touch . <p> A few shots of Sam himself . In order to get him in the drivers seat without his head hitting the cage , I had to remove the lower portion of the Wraith seat . Sam is basically sitting on the Lexan floor pan of the Wraith . I drilled and tapped the back of the seat , used a little Shoe Goo , and attached it to the Lexan floor pan too . Some flat black shoe laces we used for his lap belt . Last thing needed was to lengthen the steering column . I just cut the steering column in half and found some rubber hose that fit over the OD of the steering column . I cut the hose to the length needed , and re-attached the steering wheel . <p> Next thing I wanted to address was the hood on the Wraith . Those that have seen this build-up know I moved the battery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change batteries when using the stock screws to hold the hood on . I have seen a few guys use the cable tie downs as hood latches , then install a couple body posts , and use standard body clips to hold the hood down . I like that idea , but wanted a more scale look . After checking out few set-ups , I got a chance to see Scott Hughes dads set-up . He used magnets to attach the hood to the chassis . Bingo , perfect ! Thanks for the idea Don . After a quick trip to Ace hardware I was on my way back home with some 3/4 ? round magnets and 1/4 ? cable tie downs . After debating for a few , I decided to hinge the hood backwards so the hood is n't in my way when making battery changes . I had to trim the lower part of the grill so it would clear the tube chassis when it was opened . Once I installed the hinges , I looked around for the best place to mount the magnets . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock hood mounts . I had to use an X-acto to trim the plastic tubing away a little so the magnets would sit properly for this application . Once I could press them in between the tube work , I need something underneath the magnets to hold them from pushing down and eventually out of the tube work . I ended up using our 2/3A cell carbon fiber battery mounts for the AX10 axles . I drilled the existing hood mount holes all the way through the tube . Using a couple flathead self tapping screws I attach the battery mounts from the bottom of the cage . For added security I used Shoe Goo again to hold the magnets in place . Next , I dropped the 2nd set of magnets in place on top of the set that is now tied to the chassis . This set will also be held in place by Shoe Goo . Once I had the hood marked where the magnets need to be , I secured them to the hood with a couple more dabs of Goo . Make sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoe Goo , otherwise itll be tough to close the hood . <p> A few action shots .. <p> I am even adding scale rock rash to my diff covers . <p> That covers this round of detailing , stay tuned for more . <h> 18 Comments : <p> Mike buck Posted on 2012-01-05 12:50:29 <p> Fantastic nice rig <p> Mike Rausch Posted on 2012-01-05 19:06:50 <p> Hey where did you get those diff covers ?

@@36019299 @5019299/ <h> 3rd Annual Fire and Ice Reno , Nevada <p> Its Friday morning , about 10 am. - Ben and I are headed to Reno , Nevada for the 3rd annual Fire and Ice event , put on by Team MRB ( Moon Rock Bashers ) . This year Axial has sponsored the- event along with CKRC the supporting hobby store in Reno . I am excited to see what kind of crowd it will draw . Rumor has it that it has- snowed up there , so we will see what we run into along the way ! <p> Cool little Samurai as we head out of town . I am not sure where he is headed , but we have 400+ miles to Reno . <p> If you have never done this drive , I will tell you there are many small towns like this . They come up quick , so the speed drops from 70 to 45 mph or less in a short distance . <p> Lots of history in these small towns , its cool to stop and take in the dated buildings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center peak is a Drone , kind of cool to see along the drive . <p> More open road till we hit Tonopah . I look forward to this part because its the halfway mark . <p> As small as this town is , I always find it mind boggling that the Stealth Bomber is from here . There is n't a single stop light . Time goes by quick from here to Sparks . <p> We made pretty good time , making it into- Reno at nightfall . Grab some dinner , wrench , and get some sleep . <p> After getting- a good nights sleep we are up and looking forward to todays event. - I can now see- some snow off in the distance . Roads were completely dry coming in . What 's Moon Rocks going to look like ? <p> I always enjoy seeing how creative you guys are with parts , like this Wraith using the Axial light bar mount . <p> This Axial based truggy looks like it has seen some trails , that 's some heavy duty body armor on the lower doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at events its crazy , but I like them and love watching them perform . <p> Someone always brings a Yeti XL to play- around with during down time . <p> These Axial Honchos look ready for action . <p> The Axial AR60 axles complete the look of the full size axle under a midsize truck. - I bet this guy is going to get some good footage here at Moon Rocks . <p> Lots of Scale on hand , like these cool trailers from Elio who made the drive over from Nor-Cal . <p> Speaking of Elio , can you believe this gold Axial remote control is his hood ornament ? You may recognize him from AXIALFEST2015 and his scale diorama . If you look below you may recognize his shell . <p> There- is pretty cool scale trials section , with- some scale on the outskirts . <p> Wow , I have seen- an original- Axial AX10 at the last 3 events ! Is there a secret supply somewhere that I do n't  know about ? <p> I really dig the rust and overall look of this Volkswagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it there ? <p> Anybody- else have a recovery vehicle ? <p> Nice use of the Axial Yeti Cage in combination with this VW bug body . <p> I see an ocean of cars , this is staging for the event . How many drivers are there ? <p> Seeing more and more of the Axial Jeep FC bodies , this one stands out . <p> If you have read my last few blogs you may remember me saying " I think there is a 6+6 movement going on " . I may need to join this movement . They are just so cool . <p> This Monster Truck looks on point , so nicely done ! I may have to check more into monster trucks as well ! Watch for it ! <p> You can never have too much power ; that 's like having too much fun . Good looking build . <p> Speaking of power , I think this VW is turtle powered . <p> Hmmm Way more cars than people . <p> Let me scoot back a little bit and take a second shot at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drivers card ; if you did n't  have a drivers card you were not counted . This is drivers , not entries. - Drivers from Washington , Salt Lake , all over California , Oregon , and of course Nevada were- well represented . This event also took in over 1000 pounds of food and $400 dollars that was donated . Well Done JJ- Dreiling , Frank Testa , and Russ Cushway . <p> They are off and running in waves . <p> This is one super clean Axial based Toyota . Mathew had a super clean front bumper as well . <p> Moon Rocks has such scale lines every where you look . <p> No shortage of Axial based Toyotas here . <p> The Axial Bomber is just so versatile . Its at home anywhere . <p> Pretty cool flat bed . Those are Axial SCX10 axles , but at first glance I thought it was wider like the AR60 . Looks great though . <p> Super clean build right here . <p> Another AXIALFEST2015 sticker , I wonder if they will return this year to AXIALFEST2016 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this style of Wraith . <p> There were a couple of sections where guys could open it up and let- brushless systems run . The Wraith pictured below looked good as a fast back . <p> Lots of rigs are sporting CKRC stickers and why not ? CKRC- hobby store owners can often be found on the rocks of events they are a part of . Jason and Dena ( pictured below ) enjoying some drive time . <p> This Axial Jeep Nukizer body looks well used , not afraid to squeeze that trigger either . <p> This tandem rotor heavy lift Chinook helicopter made some low passes over the event . Its not everyday you see one of these guys . Unless , you 're Len Root ( pictured below ) who happens to be a Chinook mechanic as well as RC enthusiast . <p> Lens wife sure seems happy . Well she is driving the- Axial Wraith she won at AXIALFEST , then built , and is driving today ! They started their vacation today , all the way from Oregon . <p> Drivers of all ages were present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hobby ? <p> This California couple is out enjoying the Nevada rocks . <p> Eric or " Tree " as most of us- know him as , was not going to give up on this line . I watched some Wraiths tumble here . He did indeed drive this line with no assistance . <p> What do we have coming up the trail ? <p> Its the Axial Jeep FC I spotted in staging . <p> There was some sand , so roost it if you can right ? <p> Here " Skeeno " who also brings you Axial blogs , finds himself on the opposite side of the camera . He and his daughter are taking on this course as a team . <p> Watching a 6+6 is cool if you like watching suspension and tires work . <p> At first glance I though this was- the 2.2 Deadbolt version. - This one is on an SCX10 chassis . <p> This Axial Deadbolt is looking more race inspired . <p> So as far as weather , I wondered if it would be snow covered or muddy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Axial Jeep FC before , but look closely at the chassis . This one looks to be Axial Wraith based . <p> An Axial Yeti driving this entire event . There are actually a few of them on course . <p> Scale signs and bridges are always a nice touch . <p> Something out here kickin up dust . <p> It looks like a- Toyota- 4Runner . It being built on the Wraith platform gives it a built look for sure . <p> Oh look its Shane getting his RC on ! <p> Axial AX10 Toyota on Boggers , works for me . <p> The big power Jeep having to sit idle for a minute . <p> Wow this big power Axial Yeti is screamin and providing some entertainment . <p> Some families came out just to spectate and see what this event was all about . <p> These 2.2 's stayed together and ran as a group . <p> Dual stacks and pulling the front tires off the ground . <p> If you 're from the Nor-Cal area perhaps you recognize this Guam flag . Ben runs it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be young , but when she saw her dad fall into this- hole she did n't  hesitate to use his truck as a bridge . <p> These boys were ready to race , making short work of sections . <p> I like how this Axial Bomber has a fastback look with the side pieces . This is what its all about . Making your rig your own and having fun . <p> I have seen the Meeks family at quite a few events . One thing remains the same though , I always see them out as a family . If you 're not into the hobby yet , it maybe worthwhile for you come and check out . <p> Once you came off the main trail , you got to wheel this little 10 gate section like the old comp days . <p> I think everyone had the same general consensus , today was a good day ! For some it got even better as the raffle prizes were handed out . <p> Wait a minute . Is this a selfie recap ? <p> Well this is Elio and Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people randomly . They saw this- kid on course and picked him to receive a custom trailer . <p> Check out the trailer this kid is holding , that will make a persons day right ? <p> Here 2 Chainz Scalerz ( Elio and Adam ) give another trailer away to a random little girl . She rocked an all pink Axial Jeep JK . After this , Team MRB gave away some raffle prizes . <p> After seeing all the trucks here today I wonder what he will come up with for a paint scheme ? <p> Axial Dingo body , I am a fan of this body . <p> This kid was excited , but then again who would n't be ? <p> Axial Poison Spyder body , plenty of Rock Racing on this terrain . <p> Axial beadlock wheels and a great day of driving . <p> I am convinced you can never have too many tires . <p> This kid is a holding a new project . You ever get a new- part and have your mind start racing with what you will do with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This sums it up . Great driving , lots of cool people , and I too give this event a thumbs up ! About time to jump on the road and head for Vegas . I hope you find time to go out and enjoy your own adventures . 
@@36019300 @5019300/ <h> Make Your Own RC Vehicle Field Tool Pack <p> When you 're enjoying a trail run with your SCX10 or other Axial vehicle , the last thing you want is for a simple problem to end your day early . Going home before the fun ends is , well , no fun at all . The key is to be prepared when your adventure takes you away from the workbench . And , being prepared does n't mean taking your whole arsenal of tools and spare parts with you . You can , in fact , pack light with a properly , and selectively , stocked- field tool- pack and still be more than ready for the typical field repair . Here 's what you should have on hand for your next off-road excursion . <p> Backpack First things first , you need somewhere to put your gear . You do n't need to get fancy when picking a field tool- pack . Any inexpensive daypack will do . You may even have one at the bottom of your closet . For an added measure of security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect your items and also make it easier to clean . <p> 7mm Socket Driver In addition to tightening the wheel nuts ( you check those often , right ? ) , a 7mm socket driver is essential for removing the wheels , which is essential for many repairs . <p> 1.5- , 2- and 2.5mm Wrenches You could bring a half dozen or more wrenches with you , but that is hardly packing light . A complete set of wrenches does n't way that much by itself , but the idea is to have a pack that is so light that you do n't even know it 's there . The three most often used wrenches are the 1.5 , 2 , and 2.5mm wrenches . This will allow you to do everything from replace a driveshaft to swap in a steering knuckle . <p> Needle-nose Pliers Instead of bringing a bunch of socket wrenches , a pair of needle-nose pliers will allow you to grasp most nuts while that hex screws thread into . Long pliers will make it easier to get into tight spots . <p> Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good idea to have a few other items stowed away in your adventure pack . These include : Cable ties Extra battery Assembled driveshaft Body clips Spur
