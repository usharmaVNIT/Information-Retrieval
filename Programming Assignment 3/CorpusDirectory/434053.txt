A true paragon of the blues , he brought the music of the Delta up to Chicago in 1952 . From that moment , his name would forever be etched in the annals of music history . In remembering his art and legacy , we offer 10 things you may not know about Howlin Wolf . <p> 1 . Born on June 10th , 1910 in White Station , Mississippi , just north of West Point , Chester Burnett grew up on the Young and Morrow Cotton Plantation near Ruleville . His grandfather would tell him and his siblings stories of the wolves in the area . Once , something frightened the young Chester and he ran howling upstairs , which prompted his family to dub him the Howlin ' Wolf . At just one year old , his parents separated . His mother left him with a stern , unforgiving uncle . He ran away at age 13 , finally finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , Dock , who gave Wolf his first guitar at the age of 18 . <p> 2 . Wolf spent two-and-a-half years in the US Army . For part of that time , he was assigned to the 9th Cavalry Regiment , famed for being one of the units dubbed , " Buffalo Soldiers . " He participated in the largest military exercise ever held in the United States , The Louisiana Maneuvers , in 1941 . It was there that one of the earliest photos of Wolf was taken , showing him cleaning the frog of a horses hoof as a senior NCO looks on . Still a horse cavalry unit while Wolf was a member , the 9th was deactivated in March , 1944 . That made Burnett one of the last true cavalry soldiers , as well as one of the last Buffalo Soldiers in the army . <p> 3 . Outside his military service , Wolf spent most of his early life as a farmer , both in Mississippi and Arkansas . However , growing up in the Delta at that time gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He learned guitar techniques and showmanship from Charley Patton , the ins-and-outs of the harmonica from Sonny Boy Williamson II ( who was married to Wolfs step-sister , Maggie ) , and tried to emulate the yodeling of his idol , Jimmie Rodgers . He also played with Robert Johnson , Johnny Shines , Honeyboy Edwards , Son House , and Willie Brown . Burnett was also married to Browns sister for a short time . He took other jobs to help pay the bills as well . One of these was selling advertising on KWEM Radio in West Memphis , Arkansas . He would also play his music during a 30 minute planters show on that station , which eventually earned him a recording contract . <p> 4 . It was Ike Turner , then an A&amp;R man for RPM Records , who produced the first Howlin Wolf sides , and served as his piano player . He used the recordings to secure a contract with Sam Phillips at Sun Records in Memphis . Those two original songs , " How Many More Years , " and , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits , after being sold to , and released by Chess Records in Chicago . " How Many More Years , " holds a couple other distinctions . Recorded at Memphis Recording Service around July of 1951 , and released as a B side by Chess on September 15th of that year , it shot to the #4 spot on the charts . Writer , Robert Palmer , has cited Willie Johnsons guitar work on the track as the first use of the power chord . Producer , T-Bone Burnett ( no relation ) , said , " In some ways How Many More Years , by Wolf would be the first rock ' n ' roll song because that has the guitar lick that became the central guitar lick in rock n roll , and that 's the first time we heard that played on a distorted guitar . " <p> 5 . In 1952 , Wolf drove his own car to Chicago to join the Chess Records stable . It was there that one of the greatest love-hate relationships of the blues began . When Wolf got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label-mate , Muddy Waters . " I got in touch with him because I did n't know nobody here , " Wolf said to reporter , Peter Guralnick . " He carried me around to the clubs and helped me get started . " The rivalry , which has been much overblown in literature and on film , was rooted in a grudging admiration of one other . Waters is recognized for having the all-around better band , while Wolf is known for his powerful stage presence as well as his business savvy . Around 1956 , Muddy stole Hubert Sumlin from Wolfs band for a short time , while in 1969 , Wolf stretched out his set at the Ann Arbor Blues Festival , attempting to keep Waters from performing . After the release of Waters Electric Mud , Wolf released his own " psychedelic " blues album , The Howlin Wolf Album , which he later regretted and dismissed as , " dog shit . " While Waters was more of a " company man , " for Chess , Wolf would speak his mind , in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined force that created the post-war Chicago blues , much to the credit of Willie Dixon , who wrote dozens of hit songs for both artists . <p> 6 . Howlin Wolf was functionally illiterate into his 40s , but eventually received his GED and continued in school , studying business and accounting . He could n't read music . He depended on long rehearsal sessions , demonstrating what he wanted until his backup musicians understood . In 1972 , he received an honorary doctor of arts degree from Columbia College in Chicago . <p> 7 . Much revered by his band members for his business practices , Wolf paid his people a fair salary , on time and withheld unemployment insurance and even Social Security . He also offered them health insurance benefits . He was not an extravagant man in his personal life . He , and his wife Lillie , along with her two daughters , lived in a modest , yet comfortable home on Chicagos south side . He never wore a great deal of jewelry , or drove flashy cars , preferring a Pontiac station wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fished , owned farmland in Arkansas , and volunteered with the local fire department . <p> 8 . Suffering from kidney disease , and having suffered several heart attacks , Wolf kept on recording and performing . The London Howlin Wolf Sessions album , recorded at Londons Olympic Studios , for example , saw him taking dialysis treatments in the studio between takes . His final , live performance was in November , 1975 at the Chicago Amphitheater . Sharing the bill with B.B. King , Albert King , O. V. Wright , and Luther Allison , Wolf performed as he always did , even crawling across the stage during the song , " Crawling King Snake . " The crowd gave him a five-minute standing ovation . When he got offstage , a team of paramedics were called in to revive him . <p> 9 . The Howlin Wolf Foundation , was established by his step-daughter , Bettye Kelly , to preserve and extend Wolfs legacy . The foundations mission and goals included the preservation of the blues music genre , scholarships to enable students to participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . Currently , no information on the foundation , its work or tax status is available . <p> 10 . Its been a long-held belief that Wolf had a grudge against the young British and American rock bands that were covering his songs . However , a 1967 interview with Chris Strachwitz , for his radio show , Music in America , told a different story . " Well I 'll tell you , there 's nothing wrong with that . I want all of them to make my records , because I gets money out of it , see , " Wolf explained . " It does n't  matter no different who sang your song . They sang because of the way they feel . Do n't  never take and try to change a musician when he does something . Let him play the chords the way he feel .

@@61382892 @1382892/ <h> 10 Things You Did n't  Know About Leonard Cohen <p> One of the most dark , morbid , yet brilliant songwriters of our generation was Leonard Cohen . His songs have been some of the most covered in pop music history , with over 900 covers , and counting . Today , we offer up 10 Things you may know not about the " Godfather of Gloom . " <p> 1 . Leonard Norman Cohen was born on September 21st , 1934 in Westmount , Quebec , Canada . Raised as an Orthodox Jew , he studied music and poetry in high school . He taught himself to play acoustic guitar , and at age 17 , formed his first band , a country-folk group called the Buckskin Boys . He graduated from McGill University with an arts degree in 1955 . The following year he published his first book of poetry , Let Us Compare Mythologies . <p> 2 . Cohen had a habit of living as a semi-recluse . In the 1960s , he purchased a house on the Greek island of Hydra . With intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muse , Marianne Ihlen . During this time , Cohen wrote more books of poetry , at least one novel , and music for his first two albums . Songs From a Room , contained the tune , " Bird on a Wire " , which became one of his most covered songs . At least 78 versions of the song have been recorded by other artists . When he and Ihlen broke up , he wrote the song , " So Long Marianne " . Ihlen died of leukemia on July 28th , 2016 . Upon news of her illness , he wrote her you can reach mine . " Cohen died just over three months later , on November 7th . <p> 3 . Other relationships included artist Suzanne Elrod , who was the mother of his two children . She is pictured on the cover of his album , Death of a Ladies Man , and is also the inspiration for the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Death of a Ladys Man . In the 1980s he maintained a relationship with French photographer , Dominique Issermann , and in the 90s , actress , Rebecca De Mornay . At one point , in 1968 , he also had a tryst with Janis Joplin . The lyrics of his song , " Chelsea Hotel No. 2 " , are a stark description . " I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel , You were talking so brave and so sweet , Giving me head on the unmade bed , While the limousines wait in the street . " <p> 4 . His big break in music came with his meeting folk singer/songwriter , Judy Collins . In 1966 he had published a poem entitled , " Suzanne Takes You Down , " in the book , Parasites of Heaven . It was the story of a friends wife , Suzanne Verdal , with whom Cohen had a platonic relationship . As the poem suggests , they did walk around old Montreal , and she did invite him to her apartment for tea . Cohen sang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year she recorded it . Collins went on to record several of Cohens songs . <p> 5 . The subject matter in Cohens songs is often morose . In fact , it became somewhat of a trademark for his music . He battled manic depression his entire life . His lyrics seemed to be a way of winning the battle , or at least , getting his feelings out . When asked why he did n't  take drugs as relief , his response was to the point . " The recreational , the obsessional and the pharmaceutical I 've tried them all . I would be enthusiastically promoting any one of them if they worked . " <p> 6 . Cohen was never quite satisfied with his writing . He would spend days , months , and even years re-writing song lyrics until he was content . One example is the song , " My Secret Life . " He began excitedly writing the tune in 1988 . It finally came to fruition , 13 years later as , " In My Secret Life , " on the album , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't discard a verse until I 've written it as carefully as the one I would keep . " Another of his best known strains , " Hallelujah , " was written in one sitting , in his room at the Royalton Hotel in New York . Over 80 verses were drafted for the song , and left Cohen sitting in his underwear , banging his head on the floor . A much-covered Cohen classic , " Hallelujah , " has been most famously done by John Cale , Jeff Buckley , and Rufus Wainwright . There have been , however , over 300 covers recorded in nearly as many languages . <p> 7 . In 1995 , Kelley Lynch , Cohens former manager , began putting together a tribute album called , Tower of Song : The Songs of Leonard Cohen . For this project , she gathered artists including Don Henley , Sting , Bono , Elton John , and Aaron Neville . She also made contact with Phil Collins , who turned her down . Upon hearing of Collins refusal , Cohen sent him a fax which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Not to be outdone , Collins faxed back , " No , unless Beethoven was on a world tour at the time . " That got the point across . <p> 8 . Lynch , who managed Cohen for 17 years , and who 's family were friends with the artist , was accused , by Cohen , of stealing over $5 million from his personal accounts . He won in court in 2005 , but Lynch soon disappeared , making sure that Cohen would never receive the money back . In 2012 , Cohen again took her to court , this time for harassment . Apparently , Lynch had sent him thousands of abusive voicemails , and emails making the artist fear for his life . Lynch was convicted , and sentenced to 18 months in prison , and five years probation . <p> 9 . Although raised in an Orthodox Jewish household , and being the grandson of a Talmudic Rabbi , Cohen found peace in other forms of spirituality . During the mid-60s , he was a vegetarian . Later , he took up yoga . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sasaki , Cohen moved into the Mt . Baldy Zen Center , near Los Angeles , in 1994 . He lived there for five years , serving as personal assistant and driver for the Roshi , who was in his 90s . In 1996 , he was ordained a Buddhist monk , and took the Dharma name , Jikan ( the silent one ) . <p> 10 . When Cohen first wrote the song , " Bird on a Wire , " again , he was n't satisfied with the outcome . He was quoted as saying he , " had n't  finished the carpentry . " Others felt differently . The popular song has been covered by artists including Joe Cocker , the Neville Brothers , Johnny Cash , and Tedeschi Trucks Band . Although Kris Kristofferson once accused Cohen of stealing part of the melody from another country song , he also promised to put the first few lines on his tombstone . If he keeps that promise , Kristoffersons epitaph will read , " Like a bird on a wire , like a drunk in a midnight choir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free . " 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486 
@@61382893 @1382893/ <h> Patrick Recob Delivers Outstanding Debut <p> Patrick Recob is an old soul . That phrase gets bandied about , but in Recobs case , it couldnt be more true . His debut album , Perpetual Luau , is testament . Here is a talented , blues multi-instrumentalist , that in all respects should have been sharing stages with the Chicago greats 60 years ago . If hed been alive then , that is . <p> Now comes his debut album release , Perpetual Luau . For this project , produced by James Harman &amp; Nathan James , Recob has gathered a flight of top-notch musician friends . Harman brings his harmonica mastery to the tracks . James unmistakable guitar , the drums , and percussion of Marty Dodson , and Mike Tempo , respectively , and guest guitar slinger , Laura Chavez , round out the group . Recob , himself , provides the vocals , bass , and acoustic guitar . <p> Perpetual Luau is a cohesive collection of 13 original tracks . They 're each as familiar as the streets of our home towns , yet fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and James slide guitar introduced us to , " Frustration Blues , " we were absorbed . This is simple , classic , blues . Nothing elegant , rather the kind of music that surely whirled up from the depths of Theresas Lounge . Recob has a strong , deliberate voice . You can hear the influence of the masters he so admires , yet he s no copycat artist . The longest track on this offering , its the perfect opener for what 's to come . <p> Next up is , " We Have Got It Going On . " Written for his wife , Lisa , this one is also a tip of the hat to the late , great Arthur Alexander . For those too young to remember , Alexander was an underappreciated genius . His mixture of country music , and soul was passed on to the masses by artists including the Beatles , Rolling Stones , Bob Dylan , and George Jones . Recob nails the vibe , even adding lead guitar to this breezy , loving tune . Another , along this vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A loving nod to the earliest days of rock n roll , James guitar is dripping with tremolo . <p> " Words Are Like Bullets , " transported us to the Windy Citys South Side , where Elmore James , and Jimmy Reed held court . Chavez guitar rocks this one from beginning to end . She is not just a phenomenal female guitarist , she is a phenomenal guitarist period . Speaking of Chicago , the West Side sound is well represented on , " I Kept My Cool . " This belly-rubber , again , has Chavez in top form . <p> Our favorite picks from this offering are three-fold . All of the artists involved in this recording seem to have a knack for channeling the influential masters of the craft . Nowhere is that more evident than on the BB King inspired vibrato guitar , and soul-soaked vocals of " Help ! Is On The Way , " or the obviously Magic Sam influenced , " Find The Answer . " Our third choice is the hard-driving , " Grave Yard Woman . " Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some absolutely killer slide guitar . Recobs vocals are powerhouse on this one , and who does n't  love a song about the devil ? <p> Our one complaint , is the lack of audible bass . Whether on electric or doghouse , Recob has been a talented , prominent bassist for decades . He s provided that fat , bottom end on some great music , but here , those talents seem to be lost in the mix . <p> Photo : A. Hagerman <p> Funny thing about this record . Whether its the funky , instrumental , " LaMieuxs Jungle Strut , " the back porch acoustic sounds of , " Soul Cry , " or the beatnik poem set-to-music , " For Loves Desire , " we could picture ourselves , somewhere , on a beach . Maybe its because it was recorded at Sacred Cat Studios in Oceanside , California . Maybe its just the album title getting in our heads before we even began listening . Maybe , just maybe , be it Chi-Town , Muscle Shoals , or Memphis , it seems many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last ones a stretch . <p> Regardless , this record is pure , relaxing , enjoyment . It makes the listener feel , somehow , at ease .

@@61382894 @1382894/ <p> In the first part of our conversation with Third Man Records recording artist Todd Albright , we discussed masters of the finger-picked guitar , both originators , and modern players as well . We also examined how Albright strings , tunes and plays his twelve string guitar the way he does to achieve the tone and timbre he does . Albright also shared with us anecdotes regarding his previous and current recordings . <p> Here in part two of our conversation , Albright discusses why Jack White has been so important to the music industry in terms of preservation of music that otherwise would have vanished , and also in terms of innovation and moving the industry and music as a whole forward . He also opines on the state of affairs and music in his hometown of Detroit . <p> Barry Kerzner for American Blues Scene : <p> So how did that come about , you and Third Man Records ? <p> Todd Albright : <p> I was sitting in Detroit , minding my own business , and they had just opened Third Man Records in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Books , a book imprint , and they were doing a poetry reading and wanted some music . I guess I was more or less a palette cleanser ? <p> Sure , like they used to do in The Village . <p> Right . Exactly . That 's what that was . Jack White was there and I played two really short sets , three songs each , and when I came off my first set , they asked me if I wanted to do a record . Jack liked it . <p> The thing about Jack White is that he never rests on his accomplishments . You never know what he will be doing next . In that way , he is a lot like Miles Davis . He is always moving forward . <p> Just as Davis talked of his masterpiece Kind of Blue , that he had done it , and that was long ago , and hed moved on , Jack is always moving on , moving forward , growing , working on new ideas . <p> Right . <p> It 's really great for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work .

You 're not getting that anywhere else . <p> The other thing with him that 's really cool is his preservation vein , how he 's all about trying to preserve and bring music back and restore it so that things do n't vanish into oblivion . What Ted Turner did for the old movies , he 's doing for music . <p> He reissued a few things from the Document catalog : The Complete Charlie Patton , The Complete Blind Willie McTell , and The Complete Mississippi Sheiks from the Document Records catalog . <p> Well thank God he 's doing it , otherwise , a lot of this would be gone ! <p> Yeah .

Those things cost a lot of money to produce . <p> He might make some of that back . <p> I do n't know if he 'll make ANY of that back ! <p> In the long run , he really does n't care because his point is , OK , its out there , and the people that are gon na preserve this art-form are gon na buy it . And that 's all I 'm concerned about. <p> He was not concerned with sales at all . It does n't factor in . <p> No . It 's all about the preservation of the art form for him . <p> Yep . Making it available . <p> Exactly <p> Where else are you gon na get everything recorded on Paramount records ? All in one place ? You 're not . <p> And that 's a beautiful thing to do for people . <p> It 's not just the music . It 's every ad , it 's every possible detail , every poster , everything .

" <p> Staving Chain was a string band that sounded like , what we attempted to sound like was the 1942 Library of Congress Recordings of Son House and Willie Brown . That 's what we were aiming for , and I think some of the time we hit the mark . I was n't the singer in that group ; I was just the auxiliary guitar player .

It 's great to play Muddy Waters note for note , but after a point , you have to move forward . <p> You can walk into any place and hear Muddy Waters being played by somebody . <p> And there are people that play it better than other people , but " <p> There 's no end to it . <p> We spoke with Eliza Neal a while back and she told us that Detroit was undergoing a revival ; the music , various neighborhoods , and the people . What are YOU are seeing , and is it being accomplished ? <p> I think Detroit has never gone through any kind of revitalization . It 's always existed . Musically , since Charlie Spand was playing piano in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise Valley , it 's always been there . Then it moves on to Motown and the enormous garage rock scene that happened in the 80s and 90s . Then the White Stripes . <p> It has always been there and I think that it 's a media concept that somehow it 's this new thing . It 's not . It has always been there , it 's just that people stopped paying attention for a while . <p> Every decade , Detroit has always produced something really important . <p> How about the city ? Is the city itself coming back a little bit ? The infrastructure , etc. ? <p> You know , here 's the deal with that . So , the city is eighty , maybe ninety percent African American . It 's a Black city ; it 's the blackest city in the country . Those folks are n't being helped out . At all . Not as far as I can see . We elected the first white mayor in what , thirty years ?

What they 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and very comfortable for white people , who do n't live there . <p> The jobs that are opening up there are mostly low-paying service jobs ; there 's no industry anymore . That 's gone ; that will never come back . Factories are done . That 's never gon na happen again . It 's incredible to me that you 're seeing condos being sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars in the Cass Corridor , which was one of the roughest neighborhoods in Detroit at one point . Now , you 've got condos going up that are selling for $350,000 , and it 's like , Where 's this money coming from ? Its a bubble ; I do n't know what 's gon na happen , and I do n't think anybody knows what 's gon na happen . <p> There 's a lot of people that have shown up in town and scooped up a lot of parts of available real estate " they 're carpetbaggers .

It 's upsetting , but what can ya do ? <p> Almost exactly a repeat of what took place in New Orleans ? <p> Exactly . Exactly . Think about this . What happened in the 60s , with the interstate projects . You 'll notice that all the interstates in the country are driving right through what used to be Black neighborhoods . They eminent-domained the whole thing and flattened all the houses , and put the interstate right where they did it on I75 going through Detroit . They did it in Atlanta . They 've done it in anywhere there 's an interstate . They always run it through the most impoverished neighborhoods they can find . <p> So , has this climate affected the music in any way that you can see ? <p> I do n't think so . I think it 's not improving it , but it 's not any worse for it . <p> So , it 's still basically thriving and growing and changing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think that maybe things will change a little later on . You have to realize that people emigrate to the next largest city . Detroit WAS always it , in this area . It was really cheap , so it was affordable to do what you love to do and you could get by on a lot less . I think that 's gon na change . I think that as housing prices increase that artists go elsewhere . They leave ; once things start to get too gentrified , they 're gone .

@@61382897 @1382897/ <p> On Saturday , April 29th , Willie Nelson will be celebrating his 84th trip around the sun . Born in Abbott , Texas in 1933 , he is an American icon . His music transcends genre . A giant in his field , and legend in his own time , Willie offers something for everyone . In honor of his upcoming birthday , we offer 10 Things you may not know about Shotgun Willie . <p> 1 . Willie had several jobs before becoming a recording artist . Although he got his first guitar at age six , and wrote his first song at age seven , it was n't until he was 23 , that he recorded his first record . " No Place For Me , " was n't successful . Nelson had been playing music in local bands , wherever he lived , but also worked picking cotton with his family . Willing to do most anything to keep bread on the table , Nelson worked as a tree trimmer , phone operator , pawn shop clerk , bar bouncer , saddle maker , radio DJ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also sold bibles , vacuum cleaners , and encyclopedias , door-to-door . <p> 2 . While working as a DJ at KVAN in Vancouver , Washington , Nelson had one of the longest titles in the history of disc jockeys . Not satisfied with simple nicknames of the time , such as " Moon Dog , " or " Wolfman , " he was known as the , " Cotton-pickin , snuff-dippin , tobacca-chewin , stump-jumpin , gravy-soppin , coffee-pot-dodgin , dumplin-eatin , frog-giggin hillbilly from Hill County , Texas . <p> 3 . In the fall of 1961 , Nelson signed with Liberty Records , and recorded his first album , which produced two hit singles . Before that , he had already become a recognized Nashville songwriter , having written hits for Faron Young , Ray Price , Billy Walker , Roy Orbison , and Patsy Cline . " Crazy , " which Cline recorded earlier in 61 , became the biggest juke box hit of all time . Nelson also worked for Pamper Records , and recorded for the Monument label , before being signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the time came to renew his contract , he had become disillusioned with the music business in general , and retired . <p> 4 . Moving to Austin , Texas , Nelson was reinvigorated by the burgeoning hippie music scene there . He mixed folk , and jazz with country , and the Austin scene ate it up . During this time , he formed his band , " The Family , " became the first ever country artist to sign with Atlantic Records , and recorded the album , Shotgun Willie . Although it did n't  sell very well , the younger folks loved the new sound , and Shotgun Willie became one of the first examples of " Outlaw Country . " His next release , Phases and Stages , was one of country musics first concept albums . The major theme of the record was divorce .

In 2011 , the show won the prestigious Peabody Award . Hundreds of acts have appeared on the popular program . Genres ranging from Western swing , Tejano , and Texas blues , to jazz , alternative country , and jam bands have all been represented , with artists covering the spectrum from Trace Adkins to Warren Zevon . <p> 6 . In 1978 , Willie broke all the country chart records , but not with country music . The album , Stardust , was a collection of pop standards , written by folks such as Hoagie Carmichael , Irving Berlin , and the Gershwin brothers . Produced by Stax Records hitmaker , Booker T. Jones , the album hit at , or near , the top of the charts in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced four hit singles , and won Nelson a Grammy . Although it was recorded in only ten days , Stardust spent 540 weeks on the country album chart . Thats ten consecutive years . <p> 7 . Trigger , Nelsons iconic Martin N-20 classical guitar , has been with him since 1969 . Trigger created the sound that Nelson had been looking for , that of jazz master , Django Reinhardt . He hid the guitar with family , friends , and managers when the IRS was seizing all his assets . The guitar has been used to record his most epic releases , and has played for presidents , hippies , cowboys , and royalty . There have been over 100 signatures , either penned or scratched , into Triggers body over the years . The very first , was that of Leon Russell , and the most recent , Alejandro Rose-Garcia , AKA Shakey Graves . It is one of the few items that was rescued from the flames of his Ridgetop , Tennessee home , when it burned to the ground . Nelson risked his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One contained Trigger , the other had two pounds of Columbian pot . <p> 8 . Nelson has long been advocate for the use of marijuana . He self-medicates , and has for over 40 years , claiming that smoking ganja has saved his life . He suffered from emphysema for many years , and tended to get into trouble when drinking . His answer ? Marijuana . He s not particular about the strain , but loves the fact that there are so many varieties from which to choose . His own company , Willies Reserve offers flower , vape cartridge , and edible forms of his medicine , grown by various farmers all over the country . Another of Willies interests , outside of music , is bio diesel . His BioWillie is a petroleum alternative , made from waste vegetable oil , fats , and seed crop oils . He owns two bio-diesel plants in the Western United States , and even runs his tour bus on it . Nelson claims that bio diesel can be burned in any diesel engine , without modification . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , like most kids , an avid comic book reader . It was the ads on the back of those comics , for self-defense books , that first spiked his interest in martial arts . He started practicing Kung Fu in the 1960s , and turned to Tae Kwon Do in the 1980s . By the 90s , he became interested in , and a practitioner of , the Korean art of GongKwon Yusul . He has been practicing that martial art form for 20 years , and holds a 5th degree black belt , which he earned at age 81 . <p> 10 . There are dozens of genres in Nelsons musical repertoire . The idea that he is simply a country artist is a common misconception . Willie plays country , its true , but also jazz , rock n roll , pop standards , and more . In 2000 , to celebrate the new millennium , he released the album , Milk Cow Blues , on the Island Records label . He had said he always wanted to release a blues album , but knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he meant bringing in musicians that would make it authentic . A mix of originals and cover songs , Milk Cow Blues featured guest artists including BB King , Dr. John , Francine Reed , Keb Mo , Jonny Lang , Susan Tedeschi , and Kenny Wayne Shepherd . <p> With over six decades in the music business , Willie Nelson has surely touched the lives of nearly everyone who listens to music .

A recent loss , combined with the breakup of a band , would leave many artists on the verge of throwing in the proverbial towel . Not so with Mitchell . Her most recent release , Desire , has her coming back stronger than ever . <p> Moving to Florida from Columbus , Ohio after college , Mitchell worked in a restaurant , and sang with a soul band at night . Her blues and soul loving father made sure she was steeped in the tradition . Her first two releases , Please Come Home , and Live from The Bradfordville Blues Club showed her chops , primarily covering the music of her influences . <p> Desire is her third album release , and also shows off her songwriting skills . A 13 song combination of covers , and original compositions , it comes together cohesively to cover one topic ; catharsis . The blues is all about releasing emotions , and Mitchell has learned that lesson well . <p> Right from the jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( I Do n't Need Nobody To Tell Me ) How To Treat My Man , " comes on like a velvet freight train . Though nobody could match James epic growl , Mitchells voice does the song true justice . Its also a bit funkier than the early Chess hit , which is just fine with us . The horn section , made up of Joe Sublett , and Darrell Leonard , add authenticity to this cut . On " Jump Into My Fire , " Mitchell again channels James . This time , with a bit more gravel , and just as much soul . <p> Four original tracks grace this album . One of which gets our vote as personal favorite . The title track , " Desire , " is a swampy , Delta flavored masterpiece . Lyrically , it comes on strong , urging us to rise like a Phoenix from the flames . Musically , it is brilliantly composed and played . Part Delta blues , part Gospel hymn , and all positive , it has true staying power .

With a loving nod to her father , she brings back those sultry , classic sounds of the 60s and 70s . She covers the gospel-tinged , " Bridge of My Dreams , " and the sad , lost love tune , " Today , " with equal aplomb . Her rockin version of Bettye LaVettes , " Stand Up Like a Man , " is a breath of fresh air , while the funky , greasy , " Anti-Love Song , " brings out the feline assets of her voice . She purrs , she hisses , she growls , and she makes us love it all . <p> Producer/drummer , Tony Braunagel , had his hands in this one all the way .

Braunagel surely coaxed a bit more something-something from Mitchell , who hardly required tutoring .

With backing vocals by Maxanne Lewis , Kudisan Kai , Leslie Smith , and Mellodye Perry , this is an all-star , powerhouse lineup . <p> We see this as a womans album . Sung by a strong woman as a message to other women , Desire shows that venting can purify the soul , and heal the heart .

With a true Jersey Shore sound , John Lyon cut his teeth in Asbury Park , New Jersey , among the likes of Max Weinberg , Steve Van Zandt , and Bruce Springsteen . In fact , Southside Johnny co-founded the Asbury Jukes band alongside Little Steven Van Zandt . <p> Recently , we- spoke with Southside Johnny about his influences , working as a technical advisor and writing for movies as opposed to being on stage , and upcoming projects . <p> Interview by Lauren Leadingham for American Blues Scene : <p> Being a Blues and R &amp; B artist in America in the 70s , how was your music received at the time ? - I know that was a time when our country was somewhat divided racially ; how did that impact your music or ability to advance ? <p> Southside Johnny : <p> Um , you know , I never thought of it . We played the music we wanted to play and we got an audience. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that there was a big blues revival in the early 60 's where a lot of pre-war blues musicians , like Mississippi John Hurt , Furry Lewis were rediscovered . And then , guys like the Paul Butterfield Blues Band , John Hammond , and the Rolling Stones ; a bunch of other people came out . <p> So , to us , it was just sort of a natural progression and I think our audiences were astute enough not to , you know , they knew what kind of music we 're trying to make and they supported us . So , we never felt there was any kind of separation or anything like that . We played ; James Cotton came by and jammed ; it was really cross . There was a lot of cross-talk between all different bands , black and white ; yeah it was a really cool thing . <p> So , in the 50s and 60s , who would you say your influences were ? <p> My big influence when I was 14 years old was Jimmy Reed and Sonny Boy Williamson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to T. Bone Walker and Big Joe Turner , Wynonie Harris and the Blues Shouters , and that kind of thing . So , to me , it was just the music that people played in their house . Um , but , there was a black radio station from Newark , New Jersey and they played a lot of blues . They played Elmore James and Muddy Waters . My brother and I would listen to this little radio and we would hear this stuff , and it just sounded great . <p> It sounded as though there was life outside of this little **25;0;TOOLONG kind of place and you know , we were young and we gravitated to the energy of it , and the feeling of excitement . It just , sort ofit just seeped into us , you know ? We did n't really like the Beach Boys and a lot of pop music ; it just did n't really appeal to us . <p> I understand you wrote with Steve Van Zandt very early on . I 'm curious as to how that relationship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Upstage Club , and it was open from 8 olock at night until 5 oclock in the morning , and there was no alcohol served . So , you know , if you were young , you could still get in and stay all night . And I lived about a half a mile from there , and I would walk over there every day around 8 or 9 oclock and stay as long as I could , you know , school or not ; and just play , and just get up and jam and Steven came one time with his band and we met and we liked a lot of the same music ; Bruce came ; so many different people came to play there . <p> And you know , we ended up being friends and sharing all the different music that we had , whether it be rockabilly for Gary Tallent , you know , all the guitar hero stuff ; Hendrix and Jeff Beck , from Steven and Bruce , and I liked a lot of blues and we just kind of shared all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of bands together , including an acoustic duo , where we played a lot of blues . <p> Oh , that sounds amazing . <p> Yeah , it was really great . I mean , we did n't know that we werent supposed to , or were supposed to ; we did n't really think of those things . We just did the music we liked , along with soul music and some rock and roll , and we just kind of went out and did it . <p> How do you enjoy acting as a technical advisor and writing for movies ? How does that compare to your stage life ? <p> Oh , there is no comparison . I would much rather be on stage . <p> Yes , I figured . <p> Yeah , movies are a lot of standing around . They have to move the lights ; every take , they have to move the lights , move the camera , and it takes about an hour . <p> The stage gives you life ? <p> Yeah , and when you 're on stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , not really . You just kind of carry it along with the night . <p> Its a different energy . <p> Yeah , the energy is much more satisfying , too . So , I would much rather do that , but , you know , I 'm always curious to see what goes on behind the scenes , so its fun to do those jobs , too . <p> Speaking of stage performances , how do you manage to keep the level of energy you have on the stage ? <p> Well , by doing the songs you really love to do and having a really great band . Right at this moment , I have the best band I think Ive ever had and that 's in 40 years of singing . <p> I agree . What 's your secret , though ? <p> There 's the energy of the audience and the song that you love singing , and the band really kicking ; you know , really cranking it , you know , and you 're just carried away. - Two hours passes by and you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its all about chemistry . <p> Yeah and also , you know , you spend a lot to time ; like we 're coming to Florida , well be on the bus and well be watching movies , sleeping , reading ; doing all those things , but really , you 're just biding time until you get on the stage . Once you get on stage , it all makes sense . <p> Well , it sounds like you guys are really doing it for the music , I always love to hear that . <p> Well yeah , I mean , it does n't  ; I make a decent living , but I 'll never be rich . Ill never be a billionaire or anything like that , but I do n't  really care . I mean , I still love playing and like I say , I 've got a great band . So to me , its just fun traveling and playing music and I get to sock away some money for retirement , but I do n't  know when that 's ever going to come , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on anything right now ? <p> Yeah , I 'm working on an album my publicist told me not to talk about , but I 'm working on a Jazz ; more jazz its like an album with my saxophone player . Uh , I got another Jukes album I 'm trying to get rolling . Um , you know , just writing and all that stuff , and it will be a follow up to Soul Time.- I 'd like to make another Poor Fools , which is my little acoustic band , so I 've got three albums in my head to do in the next year-year and a half , two years , and a lot of touring . This year , 2017 is going to be very heavy on touring. - So , its just more work . <p> Your fans will like that . <p> No , you know , I want to do it , and then there 's times I go , I 'm so tired. <p> Yeah . <p> But you know , I mean , I always consider it a great privilege that I 've been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of better musicians . <p> Well , your fans are lucky to have you , though . <p> No , I 'm lucky to have my fans . Really , yeah , the fans have kept me going , too . I mean , we get to go all around the world and people come and see us play . So , you cant ask for more than that . I 'm glad you 're writing about blues . It is a universal music and its a timeless music and it has filled my life with joy and insight . <p> Yes , and you never stop learning . I 'm still learning about it , you know ? <p> Yeah , I mean , I just like 6 months ago , bought a Mississippi John Hurt CD cause I had n't  heard him in years and years . So , since , I guess , the 60s and early 70s when I was listening to that pre-war stuff . I loved it ; it was just , it had that kind of open-hearted playing and , uh , it teaches you the lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity ; its the open-heartedness , all the different phases . <p> Yes , I think it opened a lot of doors for other genres . <p> I play all kinds of music . I just was in Jamaica , playing with some Reggae musicians and that was fun , too . <p> I like some upstroke ; I like some old Reggae . <p> Yeah , Reggaes cool . I mean , uh , a lot of that stuff is cool . <p> Yeah , I like Toots and the Maytals. - And , you know , a lot of those bands have really good guitar licks. - Like the 60s original Ska bands , they are n't really known for that , but they do have that quality . <p> I just played with Earl " Chinna " Smith and he s a guitar player , and he played a lot of blues. - Its very organic with those people. - They do n't  try to overthink it . <p> I 've always thought the more simplified , the better it sounds . <p> Well , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but everybody has their own taste and I 'm happy that everybody loves music .

I do n't have that kind of love ; I do n't have that thing . I wish I did , just so I could give it to him . " <p> Hart draws strength from another bright spot in her life ; her never quit attitude .

I feel like from the beginning , I 've come a long way in learning how to break down some of those walls of bullshit denial , but it is a constant practice . I think that 's the whole goal for me is not quitting on practicing on how to tell the truth , and doing it through music ; if that makes any sense at all .

I do n't go and write music for an audience , or a career ; I do n't do that at all . I write basically all the time . I 'm addicted to it . I go to the piano and I stay there for days , and I just write about all different kinds of shit . I do n't judge it ; I just go with it . " <p> She worked with two new producers on Better Than Home , Michael Stevens , who had just had surgery for stomach cancer , and Ron Mathes . They pushed Hart to write from a different place , a different perspective that was not as dark as her previous work .

I was in and out of psych ward twice during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " All of this record Fire on the Floor , was already written when I wrote better than home .

I just turn in about 50 songs . They said ' No ' to a shitload of songs . Then they chose like , 14 , and we went into New York , and we recorded in seven days , Better Than Home . " <p> As Hart relays , there 's more to the story . " Then when we got home , I went directly back into the mental ward again , and that 's when I called the head of my label , Ed , and I said , You know what ? I need to go make another record right now. He asked what happened ? What 's wrong ? I said , Everything is wrong and I need to go make another record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , I probably wo n't go back into the studio again . This experience was just way too fucked up. So , its like if you fall off a horse you have to get right back up on because if you do n't  , you might not go riding again . Youll be afraid . " <p> Hart was in dire need of getting into the studio and laying down some music to heal her spirit . " I 'm just really blessed because Ed was like , You got it. And , he gave me a bunch of money , and I called Oliver Leiber , an old friend of mine , and I just asked him , Can I send a bunch of songs your way ? I want to make another record , and I wan na do it right away. So I sent a bunch of stuff and two weeks later , he had a great group of musicians . We had chosen 16 songs to do . I just made recordings of my stuff onto my phone from the piano , the guitar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the producer , who then sends the song to the band . He made Fire on the Floor in three days ; we were done ! So , this album was done before I ever even mixed Better than Home . " <p> Even though Hart does not do " concept " albums , and she does not write songs " chronologically , " her albums do have a different vibe from one to the next . She explains : " Every record I make , is never like the record previous to it . A big part of the reason is that I work with different producers on every record I do . Every time you switch up producers , you 're gon na have a different sound . Every time . But , also as a writer , I write all over the place . <p> " So when I go to turn it into a producer , whoever I 'm working with is gon na be attracted to specific styles that they feel that they could do a good job at . Really , the toughest part for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that I just have to turn it over . I am such a control freak .

And , the musicians that he got " Those musicians include Waddy Wachtel , Ian Neville , Rick Marotta , Brian Allen , and Leiber himself . The results are truly powerful and moving , keeping listeners riveted for the entire ride . <p> Before our time runs out , we want to know what advice Hart has for young artists just starting out , and those considering breaking into the industry . She thinks for a moment and then says emphatically , " I do n't  think there 's really any way to go about doing it . The game is constantly changing , and there 's a lot of different games that you can play . I mean , there 's the pop route . There 's just being a fucking artist and doing your own thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing your own thing ? There are so many different routes to go .

Brooks ' son Wayne Baker Brooks , who is also a blues musician , wrote on Facebook- that the singer died on Saturday in Chicago . <p> He was born Lee Baker Jr . on December 18 , 1933 , in Dubuisson , St. Landry Parish , Louisiana .

Brooks could not use the stage name Guitar Jr . in Chicago as he had been doing because Luther Johnson was already using the moniker " Guitar Junior " in the Windy City . He recorded for several labels including Mercury Records , Chess Records , and USA Records . During this period he backed other performs including the great Jimmy Reed appearing on Reeds 1961 double album Jimmy Reed at Carnegie Hall . <p> It was at Capitol Records that Brooks recorded his first album in 1969 titled , Broke an ' Hungry . 1974 saw Brooks on a European tour and that same year he released his Sweet Home Chicago on the French label Black &amp; Blue .

There are high costs of music rights and clearances that must be paid before the film can be released in theaters , on DVD , or as a digital download . To that end , a Kickstarter campaign has been launched to raise the funds needed to release the film worldwide . <p> In the summer of 2008 , director Scott Rosenbaum , along with writer/producer , Jasin Cadic , brought together three legendary bluesmen for a concert film . The film , The Perfect Age of Rock n ' Roll , cast Joe Willie " Pinetop " Perkins , Willie " Big Eyes " Smith , and Hubert Sumlin , to show the evolution of rock n roll through the blues . That particular feature evolved into The Perfect Age of Rock n ' Roll Blues Band , a live tour , hours of interviews and behind-the-scenes moments , all while documenting their lives . The ultimate goal was a Last Waltz-style film vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , all three of these iconic performers passed away . After a year of contemplation , a decision was made to change the focus of the film . It would be a story of perseverance , of hope , and of acknowledgment . Five years later , Sidemen : Long Road To Glory , premiered at the 2016 SXSW Festival . <p> Producer Jasin Cadic told us , " Its so humbling to have my name on a film about these guys in general . Period . End of story . I mean , who they are , and what the did , it just blows my mind . And , one of our biggest goals with this film is to make enough noise to get Hubert into the ( Rock and Roll ) Hall of Fame . " <p> Sidemen : Long Road To Glory , has been a labor of love , nearly a decade in the making . The producers , director , and crew spent years traveling with the fabled musicians they were depicting on screen . Pinetop Perkins , Willie Smith , and Hubert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to share their stories . All three had their origins in the Delta areas of Mississippi and Arkansas . All three were members of influential Chicago blues bands for decades . All three outlived the front men of their respective bands ( Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf ) and fell into poverty and near obscurity . All three , through pure diligence , and love of music , triumphed over their adversities , ending their careers on top of their games , as old men . As a crowning triumph , Smith , and Perkins won a Grammy award in 2011 for their collaboration , Joined at the Hip . At almost 98 years old , it made Pinetop the oldest living Grammy recipient , ever . <p> Theirs was the music behind the big names . Each , a master of his craft , influenced the world in such a way , that rock n roll may well have been stillborn without them . When asked how they hoped to be remembered , Willie , Pine , and Hubert consistently expressed their wish to be known for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inspiration for the younger generations of musicians . They accomplished those goals and many more . <p> As just a few examples , the song , " Rocket 88 , " written by Ike Turner , has long been in contention as the first rock n roll tune . The boogie-woogie piano in that song traces directly back to Pinetop Perkins , who taught the young Turner to play . " Little Red Rooster , " as performed by the Rolling Stones in 1964 , remains the only blues song to ever hit the #1 spot on the British charts . When Jimi Hendrix first arrived in London , he climbed on stage with Cream , and , quite literally , blew Eric Clapton off the stage with his amped up version of , " Killing Floor . " The man who created the guitar riffs in both those songs was none other than Hubert Sumlin . Willie Smith was Muddy Waters drummer for nearly two decades , recording nearly 90 tracks and appearing on several of Waters Grammy-winning albums . He also won 13 career BMA awards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chock-full of interviews from people whom this trio influenced . Artists such as Bonnie Raitt , Johnny Winter , and Bobby Rush share recollections , both personal and professional . A younger generation of blues acolytes , including Joe Bonamassa , Eric Gales , Warren Haynes , Derek Trucks , Kenny Wayne Shepherd , and Christone " Kingfish " Ingram , all weigh in on how the legacies of these once nearly-forgotten artists , are alive and well in their own music . <p> " These artists were quick to talk about someone other than themselves , " Cadic shared with us . " Especially these guys , who influenced all these artists , and created all the music they love and grew up on . " " People really loved these guys , " he continued . " They admired them . These three guys in our film , Willie , Pine , and Hubert , its amazing how many people they touched . Just from traveling around the country , the local bands , the bar bands , the medium size bands to the stars , they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scores of sidemen in the history of the blues , these three , in particular , were chosen for a specific reason . According to Cadic " We met them . We started a friendship , and then they took it upon themselves to ask us to go on the road . It all organically became about those three guys . Then , what sealed the deal , was that they all passed away in the same year . " <p> Thanks to journalist , Tony Conley , we were able to preview the film . Watching as casual blues fans , the ducks lined up , the skies parted , and the truth came crashing down like thunder . Without the contributions of these unsung sidemen , there would , ostensibly , be no British Invasion , no rock n roll , and perhaps even no modern blues as we know it . It was bluesmen , and blues women , who lived hand to mouth , and gig to gig , who kept the blues alive during a time when the genre was on the back burner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humble , fun-loving individuals . Each quick with a smile , a story , or a joke , they made friends wherever they went . Their influence was global , even though described as , " too famous to be a sideman , and too shy to be a leader . " They fought the good fight . They kept the music moving forward and set an example of perseverance and dedication that resonates with everyone , musician or not . As Cadic describes it , " Its a music film that needs to be seen . " <p> " I feel there 's a real ageism in our lives , " Cadic continues . " Oh , you 're 30 its over , you 're 40 its over , or you 're 60 , forget it . Why cant you do what you love until you 're 97 , and then die ? Why do you have to stop doing what you love when you 're 40 ? You do n't  even have to be successful at it . Never stop doing what you love is what got them through the highs and lows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 , when he was making next to nothing , and then win a Grammy at age 97 ? " <p> A true labor of love , the past few years of production and screenings have been coming directly from the pockets of the producers , writers , and director . Technical staff , editors , cartoonists and other craftspeople have put in their time , with the hope of getting their pay after the movie is released . <p> Herein , lies the crisis at hand . With less than three weeks remaining in an " all or nothing , " Kickstarter campaign , the needed funding is falling short of the goal . Dozens of artists and organizations have chipped in to provide rewards to those who pledge funding . From year-long subscriptions to Blues Music Magazine , and DVD copies of the film , to autographed guitars from Tim Reynolds , and Robben Ford , to VIP concert packages , private music lessons , and even associate producer credits , donors will receive something tangible in return .

A master songwriter , whose influence transcended genres , and yet , many people did n't  know his name . This week , we offer 10 things you may not know about the late , great , JJ Cale . <p> 1 . Although a great many fans , and fellow musicians alike , were under the presumption that JJ stood for Jean-Jacques , that is not the case . He was born John Weldon Cale , and although he began his extensive career in Tulsa , and is recognized as one of the architects of the " Tulsa Sound , " he came into this world on December 5th , 1938 , in Oklahoma City . It was n't until the mid-1960s that the co-founder of the iconic Sunset Strip clubs , Whisky a Go Go , The Roxy , and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recommendation was made so that people would n't confuse him with avant-garde rocker , John Cale , of the Velvet Underground . In addition , Valentine thought it would look good on the marquee at the Whisky . <p> 2 . Cale did n't  start out to be rock star . In fact , he shied away from public performances and the media for almost his whole life . His first actual love was electronics and recording . He studied the principles of sound engineering while still attending Tulsa Central High School , building a recording studio in his parents home . He furthered his knowledge of electronics while serving in the US Air Force and got his first job in Los Angeles as a studio engineer . In his capacity as studio engineer , Cale recorded artists that included Freddie King and Bobby " Blue " Bland . Many of his own original recordings , including his demo recording of " After Midnight , " in 1966 were done with electronic drum machines providing the rhythm section , since he was n't making much money and could n't afford session musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eric Clapton , who recorded it on his eponymous debut solo album in 1970 , was turned on to the song by other Tulsa musicians . Well , let 's backtrack a bit . It was Delaney Bramlett , the Mississippi born blues rocker that first introduced Clapton to the music of JJ Cale , while Clapton was working with Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends . When Clapton went into the studio to record , Delaney , along with two Tulsa musicians , Carl Radle , and Leon Russell were session musicians on the album . It was Radle that played this particular song for Eric , and the decision was made , on the spot , to include it on the record . It was the runaway hit single from that project , scoring the number four position on the Billboard charts , and Cale had no idea Clapton had recorded it until he heard it on the radio and the royalty checks began arriving . <p> 4 . Of course , " After Midnight , " and later , " Cocaine , " were both JJ Cale originals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other most famous song , was " Call Me the Breeze , " which he initially recorded in 1970 , released on his album , Naturally , in 1972 , and became a southern anthem when Lynyrd Skynyrd rocked it on their 1974 album , Second Helping . But that 's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg . Other famed artists to record Cales music include , Jerry Garcia , Nazareth , Johnny Cash , John Mayer , Kansas , Waylon Jennings , Dr. Hook , Poco , Beck , Santana , Widespread Panic , Johnny Rivers , Lucinda Williams , Maria Muldaur , Cissy Houston , Randy Crawford , The Band , George Thorogood , and dozens more . <p> 5 . Clapton once said of JJ Cale , " He has been misunderstood by most people , referring to him as a recluse when he 's very sociable , open and charismatic . He just prefers his own company . " To say the least . So much so , in fact , that he never publicly claimed to be married to his long-time guitarist , and muse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on his 1979 album , 5 , although she had been a member of the touring band for three years prior to that . Being a rather cloistered artist herself , no confirmation was made of their actual relationship until the printing of his obituary . They lived for years in mobile homes , and eventually on a secluded piece of property outside Escondido , California . Early in his touring career , supporting Black Oak Arkansas , Cales band opened for Quicksilver Messenger Service at the Warehouse in New Orleans . The night before , they had been booed and assaulted with bottles , flung by the young crowd in Baton Rouge . Cales response was to play the entire New Orleans show , seated on a stool with his back to the crowd . <p> 6 . Famed blues rocker , Tinsley Ellis , was once fired from a gig because of JJ Cale sort of . Ellis was just getting started in the music business , playing as part of a ' 70s-hits oriented , supposed family act at Six Flags over Georgia . The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cale song , " Cocaine , " at the amusement park , and were summarily dismissed from employment , even having to leave the park barefoot . According to Ellis , " They fired us and confiscated our leisure suits and high-heeled boots . " <p> 7 . Of all the recognition his songs achieved over the years , Cale has not been included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , the Blues Hall of Fame , nor the Country Music Hall of Fame . He was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2014 . Cale also received a Best Contemporary Blues Album Grammy Award in 2008 for his collaborative album with Clapton , The Road to Escondido . The award remained in the box for the rest of his life . Cale said , " I may put it on the mantle but I probably wo n't . My domestic duties are kinda slow . It did n't really change my life , ' cept it was a nice pat on the back . Good for my ego . " <p> 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was in 1972 . Recorded in one take , with Barefoot Jerry slide guitarist , Mac Gayden , " Crazy Mama , " was actually the B-side of the single , " Magnolia . " It was a DJ in Little Rock , Arkansas that flipped the record , loved the tune , and hammered it out on the airwaves . The song peaked at number 22 on the charts , making it his only Top 40 hit . Cale was glad the flip-side got the airplay . He considered " Magnolia , " a " slow , draggy-ass ballad . " However , his fans loved it , and he ended up playing them both at every gig he played . <p> 9 . Neil Young once said , " Of all the players I ever heard , its got ta be Jimi Hendrix and JJ Cale who are the best electric guitar players . " Guitarist Mark Knopfler , also claimed Cale as in influence on his art , even participating in the 2014 tribute album , The Breeze : An Appreciation of JJ Cale . Cale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knopfler . According to Gayden , Cale would , " rag " on him , claiming the Brit ripped off both his guitar playing and singing styles . Apparently burying the hatchet however , JJ did eventually open for Knopfler on a US tour . <p> 10 . Not all of Cales recordings were the relaxed , dirt road , sounding songs that caught the ears of generations of artists to follow . In 1967 , while trying to fit in to the California scene of the times , he joined a band called the Leathercoated Minds at the insistence of producer , Snuff Garrett . Their one venture was , A Trip Down the Sunset Strip , which was mostly psychedelic covers of songs such as " Eight Miles High , " " Along Comes Mary , " and even " Puff ( The Magic Dragon ) . " Although it did contain four original Cale instrumentals , Cale considered the entire project regrettable . In a 1999 interview with Max Bell , Cale admitted that it was recorded under the influence of LSD and quite a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 've tried to burn it whenever I see one .

@@61382912 @1382912/ <h> TBT Magic Sam Lives On In His Music <p> When Samuel Gene Maghett , known as " Magic Sam , " died of a heart attack on December 1st , 1969 , he was only 32 years old . Think about that for a moment . He was 32 years old . Sure , Hendrix , Joplin , and Morrison were only 27 when they left us , but still , 32 was way too soon . <p> Maghett was born in Mississippi and grew up listening to Muddy Waters and Little Walter records , teaching himself the guitar . By the time he was 19 , he was in Chicago with these masters , whom he had grown up listening to , and learning licks from . Arguably , Otis Rush , Buddy Guy , and he himself gave birth to the " West Side " sound that the city is now so renowned for . They did n't  hide the guitars behind the piano and bass , and it was not relegated to a second tier position in their thinking or their playing . No sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Although he continued to play and in fact , toured and recorded , his relatively brief misadventure in the U.S. Army , having been imprisoned six months for desertion , then being dishonorably discharged , had shaken him to his very core , and would have an effect on him throughout the rest of his life . <p> He had accrued a decent following prior to his military difficulties , and upon his return he continued building on that . He would go on to record one of the seminal blues records of all time , West Side Soul . <p> It was on this album for the Delmark Records label that Maghett had nailed down and mastered a sound that was loose , with amazing chording , unique staccato picked lead lines , and a percussive edge . Musicians appreciated the fact that that " loose " sound actually required considerable control to pull off without having it unravel . It was expressive , almost primitive in a sense , but it moved people . Of course , his vocals just gave the music that much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also for Delmark Records , and a solid follow-up to its predecessor . <p> During his lifetime , Maghett suffered numerous setbacks that contributed to his not becoming as popular as he could have been . Record labels had not signed him when they could have , and should have , including Chess Records . Even though he had been signed by the Cobra Records label , they eventually folded . He also suffered from lack of a good manager for the better part of his career . <p> Lest we forget , there was no internet then to spread the word as there is now . There was no social media to constantly blast and remind fans of this or that release , or upcoming playdate . <p> Maghett began to feel as though he was getting his mojo back in 1968 as he recorded his Black Magic album , which he described as " the best album I 've heard . " The album was released only days before his death . <p> In August of 1969 Maghett played the Ann Arbor Blues Festival , which also hosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddie King , T-Bone Walker , Otis Rush , J.B Hutto and the Hawks , and even Son House . This appearance resulted in a huge increase in recognition for Maghett , and also an increase in his bookings . <p> One of the greatest portraits of Magic Sam was released on Delmark Records in November of 2013 as , Live At The Avant Garde . It was recorded in the summer of 1968 in the Avant Garde , on Milwaukee 's east side . This was when he was having a rough time gaining bookings , and he decided hed look outside Chicago for opportunities . Jim Charne , a high-school student at the time who would later become a recording engineer , recorded the proceedings with a very rudimentary machine . Even so , what he captured were the qualities that made a Magic Sam performance so indescribable , and yet , left such a lasting impression . <p> Sure , Sam Maghett has been gone these many years now , but what a wealth of music he left for us . He gave us a beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had inside us , that his music , his work , was able to bring out in us , even today , and with no less intensity than when we first heard him play . <p> Perhaps he might have marveled at how popular he has become since his death . One thing is certain though ; he was an innovator who blazed a path for others to follow , and his work has more than stood the test of time . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

A man of pure wisdom , creativity , and jaw-dropping sinful licks that knocked me off my feet during his set , he was a pleasure to see . He told the crowd " If you do n't like the blues you have a hole in your soul " and the follow-up line of " I 'm here to fill it " settled the matter . Put this man on your playlist and keep it loud : He conjures nastiness and dirty blues out of his guitar , and the sounds are unforgettable . <p> Mud Morganfield , the eldest son of the legend Muddy Waters , graced the Byron Bay stage with his signature flashy gold jacket and a soulful performance did his dad would be proud of .

Along with Buddy Guy , she traveled exclusively to play Bluesfest 2017 with no other Australian dates . She reached into her soul once again and gave fans tears and chills , and an ability to feel something deeply . <p> Eric Gales played his ass off and left nothing in the tank during his appearance this year .

" <p> Stewart and Axton , who changed the name of the label from Satellite Records to Stax in 1960 , soon had a self-contained soul music powerhouse , complete with its own recording studio , a growing staff of A&amp;R personnel , songwriters , producers , and an inimitable house band . They also had Stax publicist , Deanie Parker , who continues to fortify the legacy of Stax in Soulsville , USA . " Through the Stax Museum of American Soul Music , the label 's rich musical and cultural history can be studied , felt and enjoyed , " Parker offers .

@@61382917 @1382917/ <p> It speaks volumes of an artist that he or she will- enthusiastically and lovingly present music in a way that is at once new , bold , and refreshing , yet still , respects the traditions and roots from whence it came . It is even more remarkable when that music is born of a long lost art that is n't dead by any means but does not enjoy the favor and recognition that was once showered upon it . <p> Todd Albright has studied both revered past masters of country and delta blues , as well as modern masters of these art forms and " folk " as well . Currently , he is a recording artist on Jack Whites Third Man Records label , and his latest release is the EP Detroit Twelve String Blues &amp; Rags , a selection of acoustic 12 string performances that exhibit a mastery and passion seldom heard in this day and age . <p> Barry Kerzner for American Blues Scene : <p> There 's really not a lot out there in the wild on you . <p> Todd Albright : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do deep dive research on the artists I speak with because I really do n't want to waste anyone 's time , and <p> This is a unique situation . <p> I know that you have been asked this before but for the benefit of our readers who might not be familiar with your story , tell us about when you were 12 and your sister gave you that John Lee Hooker record . What was that like for you ? <p> I 'm actually glad you asked this question because I 'm not sure how that ended up in the bio . I think it was actually the Robert Johnson boxed set that came out in ' 88 or ' 89 , whatever it was . It was the first thing I had seen or heard . I knew it was important then , but I could n't make sense of it at 12 . <p> I had n't started playing guitar yet and I was playing harmonica at that point because the Hohner Marine Bands were fairly inexpensive . I think that 's where it started . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was like I do n't know what this is , but I want it . ' It might have been the photograph of him sitting there with the guitar . I do n't remember how I scrounged the money , but I did . <p> At first , listen it was like I do n't know what this is. I knew it was really important though ; there was a spookiness to it . a lot of his songs were like " If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day " and it was kind of terrifying . When you 're twelve and you 're in Catholic school It was intriguing in the fact that it was kind of punk rock sounding . <p> Later , the John lee Hooker thing came in , but I was well into playing guitar at that point . When I started playing guitar , I was immediately attracted to anything that was finger-style . I would listen to anything that was fingerpicked . I did n't care whether it was John Denver , Jim Croce ; you name it . <p> Basically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of a fingerpicked guitar . Then I was at the public library and I came across an album called Inside Dave Van Ronk . This has happened to me twice now . I took that LP home the library still carried LPs then , and I could n't believe what I was hearing . That progressed to John Hammond , and immediately thereafter , Paul Geremia . I 've been learning a lot from Paul for years and years . I was buying records on the strength of the cover art . <p> He was one of the first guys that came out of the country-folk revival during the 60s . He was a student of Reverend Gary Davis . Yeah , running into Dave 's record was an incredible thing because it was this big burly white guy , playing country blues . <p> Your bio says that you were " self-taught . " Besides the folks you 've mentioned , is there anyone or anything else in particular that you learned from ? <p> My mom 's cousin liked Hillbilly music and he was really big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chords but , after that , there was n't too much further to go with that instruction . With playing guitar , once you become obsessed , you remain so . <p> Basically your goal or intent , and I 'm quoting here , was to " interpret the sounds of the masters . " Could you elaborate a bit on that ? <p> For me , it seems like the ' 20s and ' 30s were the golden age of guitar playing . As far as finger-style guitar playing , we 're talking about guys like Blind Willie Walker , or Reverend Gary Davis , who came out of the South Carolina area . finger-style guitar was the only way of playing guitar back then . It had multiple strings and you picked it . <p> I do n't know when flat-picking a guitar became a thing but , at the same time , it kind of became uninteresting . Strumming a guitar versus picking a guitar , I do n't know ; it leaves a lot to be desired . <p> Sure . Josh White was great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all five , four of his fingers to pick with . You do n't hear many people do it . His son , Josh White Jr . can do it , spot on like the old man , but I 've never heard anybody be able to play in his style . And , who can sing like him ? Just an incredible vocalist . The guy stood when he played , with his foot on a wooden chair . That 's how he performed . It was very sophisticated . <p> Big Joe ? Big Joe was great ! All the stuff he did in the 30s ; he had such a long career , for someone that was nicknamed " Hobo Joe . " He was incredible . The guy was the whole secretive shit where you add a couple of strings to the guitar and tune it in a strange way to throw off other players so they could n't copy you . <p> Tell the folks at home a wee bit more about Sylvester Weaver wo n't you ? That 's not a name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's a shame too ! That guy was the first person to ever record slide guitar . <p> Wow . <p> 1926 , I think it was on the Victor label , he recorded " Guitar Rag , " which was the first solo slide song ever recorded . What 's strange about him was that he had this great career ; he was backing up , ca n't remember her name , singer Helen Humes , and he did sides later on , by himself singing and guitar . Then , he abruptly quit the music business and took on a job as a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Louisville , Kentucky . <p> He got married and had a family and nobody even knew he had a career in music , not even his wife . After he died , his wife found a scrapbook that he had kept that had every receipt , every bill for every recording , every detail of his entire career he kept in that scrapbook . So everything that we know about him comes from his own scrapbook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have where you 'll be covering some artists that you have n't covered before ? <p> I do n't have anything on the books yet because we are still working this one Detroit Twelve String Blues &amp; Rags . The next record will be another outing of country blues on a twelve string guitar . It 's a difficult deal because there 's not a lot of songs that translate from a six-string to a twelve-string . And , vice versa . There are just some things that you ca n't get away with on a six-string that you can do wonderfully on a twelve-string so you have to be really kind of choosy about what you decide to do . A six-string guitar and a twelve-string guitar ; they 're just such different animals . <p> You do n't ever tune down and then capo to take some tension off the top ? <p> No . I mean , the guitar is tuned so low and so slack that it 's never gon na damage the guitar . <p> So you 're not in a normal tuning then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A normal guitar is tuned to E and the heavy string is an E , and this is dropped way down to A. It 's super low . Willie McTell ; it seems like the older he got , the lower his tunings became . Part of that was because back then , they did n't really repair guitars , and when the action on the guitar got atrocious , he just bought a new one . He was known to buy a new guitar once a year . <p> So as soon as the action got shitty on the guitar , he just moved on to the next one . The lower the tuning , the more slack there is on the strings , the easier it is to play , but then you 're playing in a much lower pitch . So , that 's why a lot of his recordings are way low . <p> I think it 's amazing that you get such clear tone ! <p> Well , you 're listening to a record full of it that guitar is tuned to " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest string on the guitar is , the gage of it is a .68 . It 's super big . <p> Man ! <p> The lightest string on there I think is .15 or .16 . So , they 're super heavy strings which give it some tension where if you did n't get that they 'd be like rubber bands . <p> That one is somewhat hard to find . I did find it , and it was digital , and " name your price . " <p> The guy that did those did n't make CDs ; he only made cassettes , and he made the digital . You can download the digital version . <p> The other work I wanted to talk about is 2016 's Fourth Floor Visitor . So , if you want to talk about these two albums for a bit , that would be great . They are two different things . <p> The folk blues thing was a monthly happening in Hamtramck , Michigan in a record store called Lo and Behold Records . It was essentially a hootenanny type of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and older music ; anything that was in the folk blues realm . That was kind of started by Danny Kroha . <p> And the Fourth Floor Visitor ? <p> I drove out to Minneapolis , Minnesota , where there was a guy named Dakota Dave Hull , who is probably the best living finger-style acoustic guitar player . There 's nothing Dave ca n't do . His primary playing is Ragtime , and he 's absolutely amazing . He has a studio there in Minneapolis , and I 'd become friends with him from playing gigs with him over the years . He was also friends with all the guys I knew like Roy Bookbinder , Paul Geremia , Dave Van Ronk ; the elder masters of the folk revival of the 60s . He was a little younger than most of those guys and he was stuck in the middle of North Dakota . <p> I went to his place and we recorded it in 2015 . It got passed around a bit and I could n't get any bites on it . I was approached by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about it . They wanted to put it out and I was happy to do it . It came out just a few months before the Third Man record . <p> Part two of this conversation with Todd Albright is just around the corner 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486 
@@61382918 @1382918/ <p> The Memphis based quintet , Southern Avenue , is set to release their eponymous debut album on February 24th . Dropping on the legendary Stax label ( a member of the Concord Music Group ) , its tagged as a blues album . It is , however , much more . <p> The Bluff City has always been recognized as a musical Mecca . A sacred place , to which blues , soul , R&amp;B , rock and roll , and Gospel pilgrims would journey . The shrines of Stax , Sun , and Royal recorded their heavenly sounds for the world to hear . So it is that these young prophets have gathered , from far and wide , adding to the very voice of Memphis , itself . <p> Southern Avenue has varied and distant roots , but its beginning came from Israeli-born , blues guitarist Ori Naftaly . First arriving in Memphis as an International Blues Challenge contestant in 2013 , Naftaly found a home . Opportunity presented itself when he met Gospel trained vocalist , Tierinii Jackson . Musical sparks flew immediately . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jazz-influenced bassist , Daniel McKee , they were a touring force to be reckoned with . The newest member of the group is keyboardist , Jeremy Powell . An early alumnus of the Stax Music Academy , he comes trained in the rhythm , sound , and soul of Memphis . <p> From Southern Avenues very first track , " Do n't  Give Up , " we were hooked . The simple guitar picking , hand-clapping rhythms had us wanting to clap along . This song would be as comfortable at a Friday night fish fry as it would at Sunday morning services . Its a song with a simple , yet powerful message . If there were ever a moment in time when the message , " Do n't  Give Up , " was needed , its now . <p> " What Did I Do , " follows along nicely , with Jackson providing the voice of a no-nonsense woman , demanding to know what she did wrong . We 'd bet our last shiny dime that every person , man or woman , can relate . Tieriniis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rafters . <p> To say that their cover of the Ann Peebles classic , " Slipped , Tripped , and Fell in Love , " is spot on would be a misnomer . Southern Avenue give the song even more depth . Although Tierinii does n't  emulate Peebles growl , she does n't  have to . Her powerhouse voice is more than enough to breathe new life into another Memphis soul paradigm . <p> Brilliantly produced by Kevin Houston , this album puts Tieriniis voice out front , where it belongs . However , its not done to take anything away from the talented musicians backing her . Naftaly showcases his virtuoso guitar talents throughout . Tikyras beats are steady as a clock , with just enough fills to keep things interesting , while Daniel provides a funk-infused jazzy bottom to the mix . Jeremy Powells keys are pure River City soul and add the right flourishes at just the right times . Special guests on Southern Avenue include Luther Dickinson of the North Mississippi Allstars , trumpeter Marc Franklin of Bobby " Blue " Bland , and Bo-Keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who provided backing vocals throughout the album . <p> Even the name of the band , and the album , are a nod to The M. Southern Avenue , for those not in the know , is a street that runs from the easternmost city limits right up to Soulsville , USA , the original home of Stax Records . <p> Our choice for favorite song falls squarely on the shoulders of " 80 Miles From Memphis . " This blues ditty has everything . Beginning with Tikyras big band , swing beat , it evolves into a feisty blues shuffle . Lyrically , its exceptionally clever , hitting on a myriad of blues idioms , from " stones in my pathway , " and " ten dollars in my pocket , " to " my guitar on my back . " Speaking of guitars , the distorted , rockabilly solos , combined with the absolutely filthy slide , are stunning . <p> What we have here , is a young , yet seasoned group of artists , who took everything Memphis has to give , rubbed their own magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single serving . Its not blues , soul , Gospel or R&amp;B . Its all of the above , blended in such a way to create its very own category . We 've said before , " If Memphis music is a genre , this is it ! " We stand , steadfast , by that statement . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61382925 @1382925/ <h> TBT Magic Sam Lives On In His Music <p> When Samuel Gene Maghett , known as " Magic Sam , " died of a heart attack on December 1st , 1969 , he was only 32 years old . Think about that for a moment . He was 32 years old . Sure , Hendrix , Joplin , and Morrison were only 27 when they left us , but still , 32 was way too soon . <p> Maghett was born in Mississippi and grew up listening to Muddy Waters and Little Walter records , teaching himself the guitar . By the time he was 19 , he was in Chicago with these masters , whom he had grown up listening to , and learning licks from . Arguably , Otis Rush , Buddy Guy , and he himself gave birth to the " West Side " sound that the city is now so renowned for . They did n't  hide the guitars behind the piano and bass , and it was not relegated to a second tier position in their thinking or their playing . No sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Although he continued to play and in fact , toured and recorded , his relatively brief misadventure in the U.S. Army , having been imprisoned six months for desertion , then being dishonorably discharged , had shaken him to his very core , and would have an effect on him throughout the rest of his life . <p> He had accrued a decent following prior to his military difficulties , and upon his return he continued building on that . He would go on to record one of the seminal blues records of all time , West Side Soul . <p> It was on this album for the Delmark Records label that Maghett had nailed down and mastered a sound that was loose , with amazing chording , unique staccato picked lead lines , and a percussive edge . Musicians appreciated the fact that that " loose " sound actually required considerable control to pull off without having it unravel . It was expressive , almost primitive in a sense , but it moved people . Of course , his vocals just gave the music that much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also for Delmark Records , and a solid follow-up to its predecessor . <p> During his lifetime , Maghett suffered numerous setbacks that contributed to his not becoming as popular as he could have been . Record labels had not signed him when they could have , and should have , including Chess Records . Even though he had been signed by the Cobra Records label , they eventually folded . He also suffered from lack of a good manager for the better part of his career . <p> Lest we forget , there was no internet then to spread the word as there is now . There was no social media to constantly blast and remind fans of this or that release , or upcoming playdate . <p> Maghett began to feel as though he was getting his mojo back in 1968 as he recorded his Black Magic album , which he described as " the best album I 've heard . " The album was released only days before his death . <p> In August of 1969 Maghett played the Ann Arbor Blues Festival , which also hosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddie King , T-Bone Walker , Otis Rush , J.B Hutto and the Hawks , and even Son House . This appearance resulted in a huge increase in recognition for Maghett , and also an increase in his bookings . <p> One of the greatest portraits of Magic Sam was released on Delmark Records in November of 2013 as , Live At The Avant Garde . It was recorded in the summer of 1968 in the Avant Garde , on Milwaukee 's east side . This was when he was having a rough time gaining bookings , and he decided hed look outside Chicago for opportunities . Jim Charne , a high-school student at the time who would later become a recording engineer , recorded the proceedings with a very rudimentary machine . Even so , what he captured were the qualities that made a Magic Sam performance so indescribable , and yet , left such a lasting impression . <p> Sure , Sam Maghett has been gone these many years now , but what a wealth of music he left for us . He gave us a beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had inside us , that his music , his work , was able to bring out in us , even today , and with no less intensity than when we first heard him play . <p> Perhaps he might have marveled at how popular he has become since his death . One thing is certain though ; he was an innovator who blazed a path for others to follow , and his work has more than stood the test of time . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61382931 @1382931/ <p> The Memphis based quintet , Southern Avenue , is set to release their eponymous debut album on February 24th . Dropping on the legendary Stax label ( a member of the Concord Music Group ) , its tagged as a blues album . It is , however , much more . <p> The Bluff City has always been recognized as a musical Mecca . A sacred place , to which blues , soul , R&amp;B , rock and roll , and Gospel pilgrims would journey . The shrines of Stax , Sun , and Royal recorded their heavenly sounds for the world to hear . So it is that these young prophets have gathered , from far and wide , adding to the very voice of Memphis , itself . <p> Southern Avenue has varied and distant roots , but its beginning came from Israeli-born , blues guitarist Ori Naftaly . First arriving in Memphis as an International Blues Challenge contestant in 2013 , Naftaly found a home . Opportunity presented itself when he met Gospel trained vocalist , Tierinii Jackson . Musical sparks flew immediately . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jazz-influenced bassist , Daniel McKee , they were a touring force to be reckoned with . The newest member of the group is keyboardist , Jeremy Powell . An early alumnus of the Stax Music Academy , he comes trained in the rhythm , sound , and soul of Memphis . <p> From Southern Avenues very first track , " Do n't  Give Up , " we were hooked . The simple guitar picking , hand-clapping rhythms had us wanting to clap along . This song would be as comfortable at a Friday night fish fry as it would at Sunday morning services . Its a song with a simple , yet powerful message . If there were ever a moment in time when the message , " Do n't  Give Up , " was needed , its now . <p> " What Did I Do , " follows along nicely , with Jackson providing the voice of a no-nonsense woman , demanding to know what she did wrong . We 'd bet our last shiny dime that every person , man or woman , can relate . Tieriniis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rafters . <p> To say that their cover of the Ann Peebles classic , " Slipped , Tripped , and Fell in Love , " is spot on would be a misnomer . Southern Avenue give the song even more depth . Although Tierinii does n't  emulate Peebles growl , she does n't  have to . Her powerhouse voice is more than enough to breathe new life into another Memphis soul paradigm . <p> Brilliantly produced by Kevin Houston , this album puts Tieriniis voice out front , where it belongs . However , its not done to take anything away from the talented musicians backing her . Naftaly showcases his virtuoso guitar talents throughout . Tikyras beats are steady as a clock , with just enough fills to keep things interesting , while Daniel provides a funk-infused jazzy bottom to the mix . Jeremy Powells keys are pure River City soul and add the right flourishes at just the right times . Special guests on Southern Avenue include Luther Dickinson of the North Mississippi Allstars , trumpeter Marc Franklin of Bobby " Blue " Bland , and Bo-Keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who provided backing vocals throughout the album . <p> Even the name of the band , and the album , are a nod to The M. Southern Avenue , for those not in the know , is a street that runs from the easternmost city limits right up to Soulsville , USA , the original home of Stax Records . <p> Our choice for favorite song falls squarely on the shoulders of " 80 Miles From Memphis . " This blues ditty has everything . Beginning with Tikyras big band , swing beat , it evolves into a feisty blues shuffle . Lyrically , its exceptionally clever , hitting on a myriad of blues idioms , from " stones in my pathway , " and " ten dollars in my pocket , " to " my guitar on my back . " Speaking of guitars , the distorted , rockabilly solos , combined with the absolutely filthy slide , are stunning . <p> What we have here , is a young , yet seasoned group of artists , who took everything Memphis has to give , rubbed their own magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single serving . Its not blues , soul , Gospel or R&amp;B . Its all of the above , blended in such a way to create its very own category . We 've said before , " If Memphis music is a genre , this is it !

Also in 1998 , via selection from a tape she submitted , Popovic was offered a spot to attend the Utrecht Conservatory of Music , in the Netherlands . Studying jazz guitar , she formed the Ana Popovic Band a year later , in order to pay the tuition costs . The band took off , becoming extremely popular in the Dutch , and German music scenes . They appeared alongside artists such as Buddy Guy , Taj Mahal , Double Trouble , and Eric Gales . In 1999 , she signed a record deal with Ruf Records , and in 2000 , traveled to Memphis to record the album , Hush ! . <p> 4 . Popovic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her career . She was a contributing artist on the album , Blue Haze : Songs of Jimi Hendrix . In 2003 , she became the only continental European artist to be nominated for the WC Handy Award for " Best New Artist .

While racking up blues award nominations , she also won the prestigious French award , " Jazz a Juan-Revelation , " for her contributions in the genre of jazz music . In 2006 , Popovic became the first European artist ever to be invited on the Legendary Rhythm &amp; Blues Cruise . She is also the only female guitarist to appear on the all-star Experience Hendrix tours , 2014 2017 . <p> 5 . In their 11th floor apartment in Belgrade , was an enclave referred to as the " Blue Room . " It was there , listening to and discussing blues , soul , and rock music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2015 , after ten years of trying to convince him , Ana recorded an album with her father . The record , Blue Room , by Ana and Milton Popovic , is a collection of the music upon which she grew up . Artists including Robert Petway , Jimmy Reed , John Lee Hooker , and John Lennon , all had their original songs masterfully covered by the duo . Milton ( Milutin ) , taught himself to speak English by listening to classic blues albums . <p> 6 . Popovic was on the cover of the very first American Blues Scene Magazine . In 2013 , ABS began issuing fine quality , print magazines . First available for free at blues venues , and festivals , the print magazine was abandoned so that our readers could get all of their content , digitally , on a daily basis . <p> 7 . While playing hundreds of shows per year , touring still takes a back seat to family . A mother of two , Popovic believes that spending time with her children is more important than touring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , but has said , " A lot of them ( blues artists ) , tour 300 days a year , and that is not really , in my opinion , the way to lead a good life . If you have children , you need to be there . You ca n't just leave it all behind . " Popovic , when home , turns off the television and computers promptly at 5 PM , to make room for family time . When her son , Luuk , was a baby , he accompanied her on tour . She believes that she got to spend more time with him , than a mother who works in an office . Shed spend all day with the baby , and then perform at night , while he was asleep . <p> 8 . Each record she makes talks specifically about a moment in her life . Still Making History , takes on the memories of growing up under the regime of accused war criminal , Slobodan Milosevic . Blind For Love has her touching base on all aspects of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the song , " Part of Me , " which was written as a lullaby to her son Luuk . Her latest release , Trilogy , looks forward to the future of the music business . In her words , " In an era where most are skeptical about the current state and future of the music industry , I wanted Trilogy to tell a different story . The record biz might be broken and Spotify might rip us off , but that ca n't keep an artist down . Creativity is very much alive , and music is the celebration of life . " <p> 9 . While studying music in the Netherlands , Popovic became a fan of jazz music . Its a genre she incorporates into her music still today . The combination of jazz and blues may seem complicated , but she draws inspiration from artist who came before her . Loving music in general , she has often said her major influence was Albert King . However , closely behind were the jazz-tinged blues guitars of Gary Clark , Jr. , and Ronnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , and Bukka White , and she plays it flawlessly , but one can always hear the jazz influence of her college days in the mix . <p> 10 . Popovic has often been criticized for her wardrobe choices , and sexy album covers .

" <p> Eleven of the twelve tracks are covers , but the record begins with an original composition . " Sonny and Brownies Last Train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting tribute . Although damn few artists could match Terrys whoops and hollers , the harp on this opener conjures the slow chug , and haunting whistle , of an old locomotive pulling out of the station . Davis story-telling vocals apprise the tale of that train , meant just for the two of them . As the train picks up speed , so does the tune , and there , right there , the far-away whoops come in , as familiar as moms Sunday supper . You can hear the tears in Davis voice when the train , and the song , slow to a grind , and he says , " Goodbye Sonny . Goodbye Brownie . See you on the other side . " <p> This is country blues , the likes of which one rarely hears anymore . Two veteran masters of their craft , whose years of playing together still display respect to their influences .

Jorma Kaukonen , who used to be with Jefferson Airplane , has a camp called Fur Peace Ranch . It was a lot of fun .

He , and the Devils Kitchen Band , were part of the famed Northern California music scene in the 1960s . They performed in clubs , both large and small , up and down the left coast , opening for artists including Taj Mahal , Lightnin Hopkins , and Big Mama Thornton . They played tiny clubs with Carlos Santana and Creedence Clearwater Revival . Folks like Elvin Bishop , Jerry Garcia , and Phil Lesh were frequent jam partners with Champlin and company . The combination of his performance experience , business management acumen , and the camps proximity to the birthplace of the Chicago blues is what sets his camp apart from all the others . <p> Cost for the week-long camp is $2,195 , which includes 30 hours of group instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightly outings to the famous area blues clubs , lodging , and meals . 20 percent of all profits are donated to non-profit organizations that support the blues community . <p> With his extensive business background , Champlin did a cost comparison analysis to approximately 50 other similar programs . " We priced it about midway , " he said . " Its not the cheapest , but its not even close to the most expensive when compared to similar programs . You have to remember were in downtown Chicago , so it may be a little more expensive than I would have wanted , but with all that the camp includes , I think its priced just about right . There are other places , where you actually camp out , that are n't  in a major metropolitan area , that are less expensive , but to put all this together , that 's just what it takes .

@@61382952 @1382952/ <p> Editors Note : This week , Throwback Thursday looks at the work of Leonard Cohen and why it means so much to so many people . <p> Most people see Leonard Cohen as a composer , a singer , a writer , a poet , an artist , and a painter . In actuality , he was all of those , but truly , he was an explorer who mapped the human condition . Perhaps only a handful of others has done so as well as he did . Of course , there 's Bob Dylan , but also John Steinbeck , Vincent Van Gogh , Homer , Michelangelo , John Mellencamp , and William Wyler . <p> Perhaps the greatest aspect of Cohens perspective is its honesty . As a rule , there is no gussying up or tidying up his protagonists unless this is something they themselves are trying to do . <p> Known as the " Godfather of Gloom , " Cohens narratives are often bleak and introspective , but always there is so much to learn . There is what was , and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is left with us . Always a window to something we have to seek , or maybe we have n't looked ; maybe we do n't  want to look , maybe we do n't  want to see . Seeing is final , knowing is confirmation , and that is the end of one journey and the beginning of the next . <p> When one looks back upon narrators of the human condition , in an abundance of such observations , these were lives certainly well lived . This is not to say that they were always filled with joy or sorrow , but simply that these individuals squeezed every drop they could out of their allotted time . Cohen is certainly not alone in this ; look at Johnny Cash , Muhammad Ali , and an infinite host of others . They suffered the slings and arrows as well as the triumphs of life and used them for their art whether in song , boxing , film , writing or simply as a tool for helping or informing others . <p> Cohen wrote of our relationships with others : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> " And you treated my woman to a flake of your life <p> And when she came back she was nobodys wife . " <p> " Death Of A Ladies Man " " <p> ( Leonard Cohen words and Phil Spector music ) <p> " The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get a womans education but he s not a woman yet And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy . <p> So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed Its like our visit to the moon or to that other star I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far . " <p> Cohen also wrote of our relationships with ourselves : <p> " I Tried To Leave You " " <p> ( Leonard Cohen ) <p> " I tried to leave you , I do n't  deny I closed the book on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every morning by your side . The years go by , you lose your pride . " <p> " In My Secret Life " <p> ( Leonard Cohen ) <p> " I smile when I 'm angry . I cheat and I lie . I do what I have to do To get by . But I know what is wrong , And I know what is right . And I 'd die for the truth In My Secret Life . " <p> The album Death of a Ladies Man is a great example of the quality and thoughtfulness that embodies Cohens work .

After ending up in Indiana , he played with Jimmy Reed before cutting his first record , which was of no success .

His string bending , interesting tuning methods ( standard , tuned two full steps down ) and using an electric guitar were all rather progressive at the time , which gave Albert a unique , trademark sound that can be instantly identified to this day . In the late 1960s he pumped out hit after hit ; " Crosscut Saw " , " I 'll Play the Blues for You " , and his biggest hit " Born Under a Bad Sign " .

His massive influence can be felt in a number of heavily Blues influenced rock groups today .

In actuality , he was all of those , but truly , he was an explorer who mapped the human condition . Perhaps only a handful of others has done so as well as he did . Of course , there 's Bob Dylan , but also John Steinbeck , Vincent Van Gogh , Homer , Michelangelo , John Mellencamp , and William Wyler . <p> Perhaps the greatest aspect of Cohens perspective is its honesty . As a rule , there is no gussying up or tidying up his protagonists unless this is something they themselves are trying to do . <p> Known as the " Godfather of Gloom , " Cohens narratives are often bleak and introspective , but always there is so much to learn . There is what was , and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is left with us . Always a window to something we have to seek , or maybe we have n't looked ; maybe we do n't  want to look , maybe we do n't  want to see . Seeing is final , knowing is confirmation , and that is the end of one journey and the beginning of the next . <p> When one looks back upon narrators of the human condition , in an abundance of such observations , these were lives certainly well lived . This is not to say that they were always filled with joy or sorrow , but simply that these individuals squeezed every drop they could out of their allotted time . Cohen is certainly not alone in this ; look at Johnny Cash , Muhammad Ali , and an infinite host of others . They suffered the slings and arrows as well as the triumphs of life and used them for their art whether in song , boxing , film , writing or simply as a tool for helping or informing others . <p> Cohen wrote of our relationships with others : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> " And you treated my woman to a flake of your life <p> And when she came back she was nobodys wife . " <p> " Death Of A Ladies Man " " <p> ( Leonard Cohen words and Phil Spector music ) <p> " The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get a womans education but he s not a woman yet And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy . <p> So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed Its like our visit to the moon or to that other star I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far .

Staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect cover of Earl Kings , " Those Lonely , Lonely Nights , " in 1955 . The previous year , he had seen the western movie , Johnny Guitar , starring Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden . Whether it was just the name , or the character of a reformed gunslinger , the moniker , Johnny " Guitar " Watson was born . It was the stage name he used for the remainder of his career . <p> 4 . In 1957 , he first released his song , " Gangster of Love , " on the Keen label . It would eventually become his most popular song , but not until it was re-released in 1962 for King Records , and then again , in 1978 . One person who really took a shine to the song was Steve Miller . Miller covered the song on his 1968 album , Sailor , but also referenced it in 1969 on " Space Cowboy , " and , again in 1973 on , " The Joker . " In 1971 , Miller released the album , Rock Love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Back . " Four years later , Watson released his own album , The Gangster is Back . A sure case of art imitating art . <p> 5 . Johnny was an in demand sideman and touring partner . He and friend , Larry Williams , both toured and cut two albums together . Watson also worked with Little Richard , Don and Dewey , The Olympics , Johnny Otis , and Frank Zappa . Zappa credited Johnnys 1956 song , " Three Hours Past Midnight , " as inspiring him to play guitar . He also had Watson appear on four different records of his , including , One Size Fits All , his last studio album with the Mothers of Invention . <p> 6 . With R&amp;B and blues music fading behind the glaring disco and funk of the 1970s , Watson re-invented himself , and his music , to fit in . Dressing in the style of a pimp , complete with bell-bottom suits , platform shoes , gold teeth , oversized fedoras , and Elton John like shades , his Texas blues melded into bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't  That a Bitch in 1976 , and , A Real Mother for Ya , the following year . Watson was on the cutting edge of the funk movement , influencing artists such as Sly Stone , and George Clinton . It was Watsons catchphrase , " bow wow wow yippi-yo yippi-yay , " that Clinton used in his final hit with Parliament-Funkadelic , " Atomic Dog . " His stylized version was then used by Snoop Dogg , Bow Wow , and several other rap stars . In fact , Watsons music has been heavily sampled by hip-hop artists including Ice Cube , Dr. Dre , Jay-Z , Redman , Mary J. Blige , and dozens more . <p> 7 . Johnny " Guitar " Watson , as we 've pointed out , played guitar and piano . However , a talented composer , producer , and master musician , he also contributed drums , keyboards , bass , and saxophone to several of his own records . Most of these were on his gold-record releases while with DJM . On tour , he traveled with a six-piece band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Watsonian Institute . <p> 8 . In the early 1980s , following the suicide of his long time friend , and band mate , Larry Williams , Watson seemed to change . His US appearances were fewer and further between , yet he still successfully toured Europe and Japan . After his charting single , " Strike on Computers , " in 1984 , a decade went by before the charts saw him again . Although he contributed guitar to Dr. Dres Grammy winning , " Let Me Ride , " in 93 , Watsons next charting song was , " Bow Wow , " in 1994 . <p> 9 . On May 17th , 1996 , during a tour of Japan with James Cotton , and Ukadan , Watson stepped on stage for the very last time . At around 7:40 that evening , Johnny was performing his first song of the night , his 1976 hit , " Superman Lover , " at the Ocean Boulevard Blues Cafe in Yokohama . After singing the first verse , he made a gesture like pushing the microphone stand towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on his back . Suffering a heart attack on stage , he was pronounced dead , at a nearby hospital , less than two hours later . Two days afterward , at a break in the show , one of Watsons band mates told the audience , " Johnny once said that if he were to die , he wanted to die on stage . " His body was flown back to the US for burial at Forest Lawn Memorial Park , in Glendale , California . <p> 10 . Watsons influence was extensive . Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan both had him at the top of a very selective list of artists they idolized . He had a major impact on Hendrix , Miller , and Zappa . Soul artist , Bobby Womack , called Watson , " the most dangerous gunslinger out there . " It was blues , R&amp;B , and soul diva , Etta James , who may have loved him most . James toured with Watson and Johnny Otis in the 1950s , when she was just getting started . She adopted his ballad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , " They call Elvis the King ; but the sure-enough King was Johnny Guitar Watson .

What started as a chat about their upcoming album , turned into an in-depth conversation about influences , old school vs. modern techniques , and saving the blues in America . Therefore , this will be part one of a two-part article . Here , well discuss the album , and this world premiere release of the single . In part two , well get deeper into the mind of the Rev. <p> The newest release from The Reverend Peytons Big Damn Band , entitled , Front Porch Sessions , will be released on March 10th . We are proud to present the world premiere of the stand-out single , " One More Thing . " <p> With a touring schedule of over 250 dates per year , we had a rare opportunity to sit down with the Rev and discuss the song , in particular , and the album in general . <p> " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he begins . " People talk about all the homeless people we have today . The one thing I know , in particular , especially in rural areas , is there are lot of people that are one catastrophe , one mistake , just one more thing from themselves being homeless . I think that 's a bigger problem . I think its why there are a lot of people feeling hopeless right now . They do n't  have a big safety net in a bank . They may be getting by , but one big thing happens , and that 's it . When I wrote that song , I was just expressing myself , really . " <p> The lyrics of " One More Thing , " resonate across cultural , financial , and racial lines . However , the Rev points out the rural population as the catalyst for writing it . " All I do with a song is try to write what I know , what I see , and what I live . Rural people do n't  like to let on that they 're having trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream it , but rural people do n't  like other people to know . They 're too proud . " <p> We asked if the entire album was written from a rural point of view . The Revs response , was one we did n't  expect . " You 're gon na get a kick out of this , because its nuts , " he says with a chuckle . " I write all the time . But what I do n't  do all the time is finish what I think is a good song . To me , a song has to pass a certain test , and I end up throwing a lot of stuff away . When we went in to do Front Porch Sessions , we booked some studio time and said , we want to do some recording. I wanted to make a record . But I did n't  know what , yet . So I gave myself one week . I holed up in a cabin , and I just started writing . I had never given myself such a short deadline before . About 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deserve a Happy Ending , " came to me . I had written , " One More Thing , " the day before , and had finished " One Bad Shoe , " and Happy Ending was the last thing that came to me . It was at the moment I thought , I think I have a record . " <p> What 's one thing that all the music on the release has in common ? The Rev explains , " This one may be more stripped down than a lot of stuff we 've done . If you took every record we 've ever done , and turned the drums down , it would n't sound that far off from this . I just wanted this one to be a little bit more like if you were here on my front porch , and we were hanging out . Like , We Deserve a Happy Ending. That song there , is Max hitting his palm on a suitcase for the kick drum . Theres hand claps , and some tambourine from Breezys washboard . I mean , its absolutely minimal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is another record I produced myself . It kind of put me in a mindset , as a producer , of going back to , sort of , where I started . I mean 1930s ribbon mics , thinking about placement and the room its in . Even at Chess Records , those recordings were made with two microphones . Two microphones in a room . Less is more , ya know ? I really want to hear the room . But , the secret is finding a good room . Front Porch Sessions has a lot of that . We put the mic far away , so we could really hear what was happening . This album just sounds rich , like fudge . I want people to hear it . I 'm really proud of it . It represents , to me , being right out in the open . There 's no drums to hide behind . I just know if people get it , and listen to it , they 're going to like it . " <p> When we asked if he had a personal favorite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy Ending , is the first song on the record . There are a lot of songs that could be my favorite , but that ones kind of my favorite song on the record , just because it makes me feel good to play it . Since I was 12 years old , I 've always tried to do things that I thought were cool , and made me happy . I take the same style , country blues guitar , to places its never been . I want the music I make to sound timeless . I do n't  want it to sound like it was done 100 years ago , and I do n't  want it to sound like it was done yesterday . I want people not to be able to tell when it was done . " <p> With that thought in mind , were proud to present the World Premiere of , " One More Thing . " 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61382984 @1382984/ <p> Ok , maybe it 's the cynicism of this grizzled old blues journalist , but I just never expected ZZ Top to be this good in concert . In an age of Pro Tools and other technological wizardry , most producers can turn a good garage band into a slick rock machine . Add to that ZZ Tops almost half century with monolithic Warner Brothers Records " the company that helped create larger than life hard rock with acts like The Grateful Dead , Van Morrison , and Van Halen . That just led me to assume the corporate giant had been tweaking ZZs sound forever . <p> Plus , the bands image of hiding behind two-foot beards , cheap sunglasses and hats that look like an amoeba on steroids , and you got ta figure these guys are hittin it with a sneaker . Do n't  get me wrong , I love their sound , a kind of Hill Country blues mind-warping drone with a Hollywood smirk and a Vegas neon blink , but I had n't seen them live for 35 years . That concert damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orifice . <p> But it was worth it . These guys transport you into another galaxy . Theyre Rocky and Bullwinkle when it comes to turning rock culture into one huge fractured fairy tale and their Jimi Hendrix collision with a Minnie Pearl dress code breaks the rule of cool that most hot rocks cling to . <p> So , who are these guys hiding their age behind a fa+ade , and are they a manufactured flavor of the half century that can sell 30 million records to pop confectionary addicts ? Sure , but they 're a hell of a lot more . <p> The band I saw on February 26th at Proctors Theater in Schenectady was a trio joined at the heart , one organism so tight in its presentation that its sound is as perfect as a world-renowned orchestra and just as transfixing . The idea that a threesome can produce such perfection has to be experienced to be believed . <p> Forget the Pro-tools and other digital magic . Opening with " Have Mercy " and concluding their first of two encores with " Tush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was loud but crystal clear , besting their recent Live ! Hits from Around The World CD ( On Suretone , not Warner Brothers ) with unbridled energy . Gibbons fretting on Jimi Hendrixs " Foxy Lady " was adroitly executed without ever soliciting feedback from the amps . And the bi-play of those guitar runs with Dusty Hills bass and Frank Beards drumming were as overpowering on " Tush " as James Browns delivery on " Night Train " backed by a big band including horns and two drummers . <p> I expected their volume alone would checkmate whatever nuances I heard on their CDs . Instead , it was just the opposite . In a pre-concert email interview , Billy Gibbons told me , " The studio is an adjunct to what we do and something of a tool shed for us . There 's not much we 've done in the studio that we have n't been able to do on stage , and that 's quite intentional . We aim to sound like ourselves . Its much more comfortable that way . Then again , we do enjoy going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the blend . " <p> Bottom line , Gibbons is way under-rated as a guitarist . OK , but is it blues ? The band answered that question with a version of " Catfish Blues " segueing into " Two Trains Running " that reminded me of a version The Blues Project used to do in the 60s . The song has an almost century-old thread that weaves through the repertoires of Muddy Waters , R. L. Burnside , and countless rock luminaries . Dusty Hill handled the vocals and Gibbons lifted Dustys plaintive cries on eagles wings , sending the sold-out crowd into orgasmic nirvana . <p> Perhaps my biggest takeaway with ZZ Top is that they ARE rock stars , but they 're not living out their image , staring down their nose at the fans . Between songs , Gibbons told the upstate New York audience that his father had grown up in Gloversville in the Adirondack Mountain foothills about 50 miles from Schenectady , and he told an anecdote about walking into a Dollar Store and buying a shirt with FFA stitched into it standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of farmers in Hollywood , " he said . <p> Rock is usually about bravado and ego , using loud volume and driving sexual rhythm to flex muscles and strut with an aggressive stance . Blues more often is about tellin it like it is . ZZ Top plays both ends of the field . They may have 15 million-selling studio albums that pound home a driving beat , but their concert is rock 's answer to a Saturday night fish fry . Songs like " Gim me All Your Lovin , " " Nationwide , " " Tush , " and " Legs " may be all testosterone , but there 's a wink from behind Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hall beards and dark glasses that says its all in the game. - And " Under Pressure , " " Have Mercy and " Sharp Dressed Man " with their twisted innuendoes is not about sexual conquest as much as letting the ladies in on the dance . <p> In my interview with Gibbons , I told him that ZZ Tops drummer Frank Beard once told me that the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dials it back just far enough not to get censored . Had that become easier with time as society becomes more open ? " The entendre is oft times double and sometimes triple , " he answered , " but coming right out and saying it would n't be much of an artistic challenge . Its not we 've gotten away with anything over the years " those who know the subtext might get a charge , but those who do n't still get off , so it 's a win/win . Nuance is everything . " <p> This portion of ZZ Tops almost endless tour is being billed as the Tonnage Tour referring to the old Tennessee Ernie Ford hit " Sixteen Tons . " Years ago someone posted a YouTube video of a band purported to be ZZ Top with Jeff Beck performing the song .

The one exception would be a couple of b-b-b-b-baby moments in " You Ai n't  My Dog No More . " Janis , God love her , could never quite hit those highs without falling into a primal scream . Eliza , on the other hand , not only can , but does . There may be a bit of gravel , reminiscent of Danielle Nicole , or the late , great , Koko Taylor , but Neals powerhouse voice is unequivocally her own . <p> " Burn the Tent Down , " is a flat-out rocker . Her creative lyrics put us in the midst of a southern barbecue , that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , add nicely to this one . <p> Some old blues imagery appears throughout the record . " Downhill on a Rocket , " is a gritty , swampy piece that references voodoo , while on the title track , Neals describes crawling up from hell after winning a battle with ol Scratch , himself . On " At the Crossroads , " we expected to hear another revamped Robert Johnson tale . We were right , and we were wrong . Neals version of the tale is haunting , with just her piano , and some truly evil guitar , supplied by Rock and Roll Hall of Famer , and Jimi Hendrix tutor , Billy Davis . Her vocals begin , and end , in the depths of what may very well be the manhole shes is descending on the cover . <p> " Cold Cold Night , " has a jazzy , almost acoustic feel , and features guest guitarist , Paul Nelson . Nelson has some of the best guitar chops in the business , and the list of artists with whom he s worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although again mentioning the devil , is another refreshing whiff of the world above . <p> A galaxy of other guest musicians appear on 10,000 Feet Below . Bassists , Randolph , Lenny Bradford , Mike Griot , and John Abraham all add their individual bottom . Drums and percussion are provided by Skeeto Valdez , Demarcus Sumter , Brian Clune , Rubin Nizri ( who also engineered the album ) , and John Medeiros . Piano , Rhodes , Hammond B3 , and vocals are all handled by Neals herself . <p> Neals also wrote or co-wrote each song , with one standout exception . She gives new life to the renamed Skip James classic , " Hard Killing Floor . " While James version was written about The Great Depression , Neals cleverly reworks it into a story of the kind of depression we all know from time to time . Once again , Glazers piercing guitar adds the correct bit of despair . One couldnt have picked a better song to cover on this album . It fits , hand in glove , with Neals original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although we were unable to pick one favorite from this eclectic collection , the funky , - wah-wah driven , " Merle Dixon , " did trip our collective triggers . Its bluesy , soulful , and right on time in our ears . <p> An interesting side note to this record is the story behind the piano . The 1937 Hardman grand , which Neals so deftly plays , spent six decades in a Baptist church , and another 20 years in an old music club . The congregants may not approve of the " devils music " it produces now , but we damn sure do . <p> 10,000 Feet Below is not a casual listening record . On this one , you drop the needle and prepare to marinate in all that is Eliza Neals . Its a warm , welcoming experience , but just remember to breathe . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

By the 1970 's , rhythm and blues was used as a blanket term for soul and funk . In the 1980 's , a newer style of R&amp;B developed , becoming known as " Contemporary R&amp;B " , which , today , also includes elements of hip-hop , neo-soul , trap , and incorporates more sonic elements than before , as it expands its appeal and commercial viability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasts over 135 inductees .

" People talk about all the homeless people we have today . The one thing I know , in particular , especially in rural areas , is there are lot of people that are one catastrophe , one mistake , just one more thing from themselves being homeless . I think that 's a bigger problem . I think its why there are a lot of people feeling hopeless right now . They do n't  have a big safety net in a bank . They may be getting by , but one big thing happens , and that 's it . When I wrote that song , I was just expressing myself , really . " <p> The lyrics of " One More Thing , " resonate across cultural , financial , and racial lines . However , the Rev points out the rural population as the catalyst for writing it . " All I do with a song is try to write what I know , what I see , and what I live . Rural people do n't  like to let on that they 're having trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream it , but rural people do n't  like other people to know . They 're too proud . " <p> We asked if the entire album was written from a rural point of view . The Revs response , was one we did n't  expect . " You 're gon na get a kick out of this , because its nuts , " he says with a chuckle . " I write all the time . But what I do n't  do all the time is finish what I think is a good song . To me , a song has to pass a certain test , and I end up throwing a lot of stuff away . When we went in to do Front Porch Sessions , we booked some studio time and said , we want to do some recording. I wanted to make a record . But I did n't  know what , yet . So I gave myself one week . I holed up in a cabin , and I just started writing . I had never given myself such a short deadline before .

The Rev explains , " This one may be more stripped down than a lot of stuff we 've done . If you took every record we 've ever done , and turned the drums down , it would n't sound that far off from this . I just wanted this one to be a little bit more like if you were here on my front porch , and we were hanging out . Like , We Deserve a Happy Ending.

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is another record I produced myself . It kind of put me in a mindset , as a producer , of going back to , sort of , where I started . I mean 1930s ribbon mics , thinking about placement and the room its in . Even at Chess Records , those recordings were made with two microphones . Two microphones in a room . Less is more , ya know ? I really want to hear the room . But , the secret is finding a good room . Front Porch Sessions has a lot of that . We put the mic far away , so we could really hear what was happening . This album just sounds rich , like fudge . I want people to hear it . I 'm really proud of it . It represents , to me , being right out in the open . There 's no drums to hide behind . I just know if people get it , and listen to it , they 're going to like it . " <p> When we asked if he had a personal favorite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy Ending , is the first song on the record . There are a lot of songs that could be my favorite , but that ones kind of my favorite song on the record , just because it makes me feel good to play it . Since I was 12 years old , I 've always tried to do things that I thought were cool , and made me happy . I take the same style , country blues guitar , to places its never been . I want the music I make to sound timeless . I do n't  want it to sound like it was done 100 years ago , and I do n't  want it to sound like it was done yesterday . I want people not to be able to tell when it was done . " <p> With that thought in mind , were proud to present the World Premiere of , " One More Thing . " 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61382996 @1382996/ <p> Ok , maybe it 's the cynicism of this grizzled old blues journalist , but I just never expected ZZ Top to be this good in concert . In an age of Pro Tools and other technological wizardry , most producers can turn a good garage band into a slick rock machine . Add to that ZZ Tops almost half century with monolithic Warner Brothers Records " the company that helped create larger than life hard rock with acts like The Grateful Dead , Van Morrison , and Van Halen . That just led me to assume the corporate giant had been tweaking ZZs sound forever . <p> Plus , the bands image of hiding behind two-foot beards , cheap sunglasses and hats that look like an amoeba on steroids , and you got ta figure these guys are hittin it with a sneaker . Do n't  get me wrong , I love their sound , a kind of Hill Country blues mind-warping drone with a Hollywood smirk and a Vegas neon blink , but I had n't seen them live for 35 years . That concert damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orifice . <p> But it was worth it . These guys transport you into another galaxy . Theyre Rocky and Bullwinkle when it comes to turning rock culture into one huge fractured fairy tale and their Jimi Hendrix collision with a Minnie Pearl dress code breaks the rule of cool that most hot rocks cling to . <p> So , who are these guys hiding their age behind a fa+ade , and are they a manufactured flavor of the half century that can sell 30 million records to pop confectionary addicts ? Sure , but they 're a hell of a lot more . <p> The band I saw on February 26th at Proctors Theater in Schenectady was a trio joined at the heart , one organism so tight in its presentation that its sound is as perfect as a world-renowned orchestra and just as transfixing . The idea that a threesome can produce such perfection has to be experienced to be believed . <p> Forget the Pro-tools and other digital magic . Opening with " Have Mercy " and concluding their first of two encores with " Tush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was loud but crystal clear , besting their recent Live ! Hits from Around The World CD ( On Suretone , not Warner Brothers ) with unbridled energy . Gibbons fretting on Jimi Hendrixs " Foxy Lady " was adroitly executed without ever soliciting feedback from the amps . And the bi-play of those guitar runs with Dusty Hills bass and Frank Beards drumming were as overpowering on " Tush " as James Browns delivery on " Night Train " backed by a big band including horns and two drummers . <p> I expected their volume alone would checkmate whatever nuances I heard on their CDs . Instead , it was just the opposite . In a pre-concert email interview , Billy Gibbons told me , " The studio is an adjunct to what we do and something of a tool shed for us . There 's not much we 've done in the studio that we have n't been able to do on stage , and that 's quite intentional . We aim to sound like ourselves . Its much more comfortable that way . Then again , we do enjoy going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the blend . " <p> Bottom line , Gibbons is way under-rated as a guitarist . OK , but is it blues ? The band answered that question with a version of " Catfish Blues " segueing into " Two Trains Running " that reminded me of a version The Blues Project used to do in the 60s . The song has an almost century-old thread that weaves through the repertoires of Muddy Waters , R. L. Burnside , and countless rock luminaries . Dusty Hill handled the vocals and Gibbons lifted Dustys plaintive cries on eagles wings , sending the sold-out crowd into orgasmic nirvana . <p> Perhaps my biggest takeaway with ZZ Top is that they ARE rock stars , but they 're not living out their image , staring down their nose at the fans . Between songs , Gibbons told the upstate New York audience that his father had grown up in Gloversville in the Adirondack Mountain foothills about 50 miles from Schenectady , and he told an anecdote about walking into a Dollar Store and buying a shirt with FFA stitched into it standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of farmers in Hollywood , " he said . <p> Rock is usually about bravado and ego , using loud volume and driving sexual rhythm to flex muscles and strut with an aggressive stance . Blues more often is about tellin it like it is . ZZ Top plays both ends of the field . They may have 15 million-selling studio albums that pound home a driving beat , but their concert is rock 's answer to a Saturday night fish fry . Songs like " Gim me All Your Lovin , " " Nationwide , " " Tush , " and " Legs " may be all testosterone , but there 's a wink from behind Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hall beards and dark glasses that says its all in the game. - And " Under Pressure , " " Have Mercy and " Sharp Dressed Man " with their twisted innuendoes is not about sexual conquest as much as letting the ladies in on the dance . <p> In my interview with Gibbons , I told him that ZZ Tops drummer Frank Beard once told me that the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dials it back just far enough not to get censored .

On her new , self-produced offering , 10,000 Feet Below , she gathered 16 fellow musicians , in five different studios , and created one brilliant album . We use the word brilliant in describing the record as exceptionally clever , not bright , and shining , because this E-H Records release is anything but . Henry Stuckey may well have invented the " gothic " blues sound , but Skip James took it to the next level , Ledfoot gave it the name , and now , Neals has perfected it . <p> Her operatically trained voice is sexy , and menacing . It drew us in to her essence so tightly , that we felt stifled , yet unwilling to escape . Neals took us to a confined , sweltering place , and welcomed us . There are wafts of fresh air throughout 10,000 Feet Below . Take a deep breath during the foot-stomping , hand-clapping opener , " Cleotus . " Long time confidant , guitarist , and songwriting partner , Howard Glazer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up of flawless vocal layering . Its gospel tinged , country blues , in an urban backdrop . <p> All bets are off when the fully electrified , " Another Lifetime , " begins to play . Glazers searing guitar work , punctuates Neals vocals , and Hammond B3 organ . While were on the subject of her vocals , she 's been compared , vocally , to Janis Joplin , but that 's a misnomer . The one exception would be a couple of b-b-b-b-baby moments in " You Ai n't  My Dog No More . " Janis , God love her , could never quite hit those highs without falling into a primal scream . Eliza , on the other hand , not only can , but does . There may be a bit of gravel , reminiscent of Danielle Nicole , or the late , great , Koko Taylor , but Neals powerhouse voice is unequivocally her own . <p> " Burn the Tent Down , " is a flat-out rocker . Her creative lyrics put us in the midst of a southern barbecue , that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , add nicely to this one . <p> Some old blues imagery appears throughout the record . " Downhill on a Rocket , " is a gritty , swampy piece that references voodoo , while on the title track , Neals describes crawling up from hell after winning a battle with ol Scratch , himself . On " At the Crossroads , " we expected to hear another revamped Robert Johnson tale . We were right , and we were wrong . Neals version of the tale is haunting , with just her piano , and some truly evil guitar , supplied by Rock and Roll Hall of Famer , and Jimi Hendrix tutor , Billy Davis . Her vocals begin , and end , in the depths of what may very well be the manhole shes is descending on the cover . <p> " Cold Cold Night , " has a jazzy , almost acoustic feel , and features guest guitarist , Paul Nelson . Nelson has some of the best guitar chops in the business , and the list of artists with whom he s worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although again mentioning the devil , is another refreshing whiff of the world above . <p> A galaxy of other guest musicians appear on 10,000 Feet Below . Bassists , Randolph , Lenny Bradford , Mike Griot , and John Abraham all add their individual bottom . Drums and percussion are provided by Skeeto Valdez , Demarcus Sumter , Brian Clune , Rubin Nizri ( who also engineered the album ) , and John Medeiros . Piano , Rhodes , Hammond B3 , and vocals are all handled by Neals herself . <p> Neals also wrote or co-wrote each song , with one standout exception . She gives new life to the renamed Skip James classic , " Hard Killing Floor . " While James version was written about The Great Depression , Neals cleverly reworks it into a story of the kind of depression we all know from time to time . Once again , Glazers piercing guitar adds the correct bit of despair . One couldnt have picked a better song to cover on this album . It fits , hand in glove , with Neals original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although we were unable to pick one favorite from this eclectic collection , the funky , - wah-wah driven , " Merle Dixon , " did trip our collective triggers . Its bluesy , soulful , and right on time in our ears . <p> An interesting side note to this record is the story behind the piano . The 1937 Hardman grand , which Neals so deftly plays , spent six decades in a Baptist church , and another 20 years in an old music club . The congregants may not approve of the " devils music " it produces now , but we damn sure do . <p> 10,000 Feet Below is not a casual listening record . On this one , you drop the needle and prepare to marinate in all that is Eliza Neals . Its a warm , welcoming experience , but just remember to breathe . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61383002 @1383002/ <h> 12 Things You Did n't  Know About Chuck Berry <p> It was 90 years ago , today , that Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born in St. Louis , Missouri . The great-grandson of slaves , Chuck Berry grew up to become the " Father of Rock &amp; Roll , " and one of the most influential artists , ever . Berry was the catalyst that would integrate musical styles , as well as the races , cranking out hit after hit , for anyone who would buy his records . To celebrate his 90th birthday , we 've compiled a list of lesser known facts about the man , and the artist . <p> 1 . Berry was raised in a segregated , middle class , neighborhood of North St. Louis , known as " The Ville . " The area was so segregated , in fact , that he did n't  encounter a white person until he was three years old . It was then he witnessed several white firefighters battling a large blaze . According to Berry , " I thought they were so frightened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fire . " <p> 2 . Chucks father , Henry Berry , was not only a carpenter , but deacon of the Antioch Baptist Church . It was there that the young Berry started singing in the choir at the age of six . Later , he attended Sumner High School , where , in 1941 , he sang the Jay McShann song , " Confessin the Blues , " at the annual talent show . The school administration was less than impressed with his song choice , but the student body loved it , sparking the young mans interest in learning guitar . <p> 3 . Berry is well known for his run-ins with the law . His first time in jail was at the age of seventeen , when he and some friends went on a robbery spree in Kansas City , with a gun they found in a parking lot . Convicted of armed robbery , he was given the maximum sentence of 10 years , to be served at the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men , near Jefferson City , Missouri . During that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxing , fighting under the name , Wild Man Berry . He was released after 3 years on his 21st birthday . <p> 4 . On New Years Eve , 1952 , a member of the Sir John Trio , led by pianist , Johnnie Johnson , fell i 'll and was unable to perform their gig at the Cosmopolitan Club in East St. Louis . Johnson knew that Berry was still a relatively inexperienced guitarist and probably would n't have a gig that night , so he called him to sit in . Berrys vocals and flamboyance impressed the band , as well as the crowd , and Johnson added him as a full time member of the group . So began a long , musical relationship between the two . <p> 5 . The music known as " hillbilly , " was the favored music among whites in the area , at that time . Berry began adding up-tempo country songs to the Trios repertoire of ballads and blues . It was n't long before white patrons heard the rumors of a black hillbilly , and began coming to their shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , who first laughed at his attempts , soon found themselves requesting the hillbilly songs as well , dancing to the beat . <p> 6 . In May , 1955 , Berry , at the suggestion of Muddy Waters , auditioned for Leonard Chess at Chess Records in Chicago . It was his reworked version of the Bob Wills song , " Ida Red , " which Berry had renamed " Ida May , " that caught his attention . Thinking the title sounded too rural , Chess spotted some mascara in the studio and suggested they call the song , " Maybellene , " changing the spelling to avoid a lawsuit from the cosmetics company . The song , which was dripping with teenage interest in cars and sex , was recorded by the Trio along with Willie Dixon on bass and Jerome Green , ( from Bo Diddleys band ) , on maracas . In order to get the song more airplay , Chess gave a copy to disc jockey , Alan Freed . Unbeknownst to Berry , he also gave Freed and his associate Russ Fratto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybellene , " became Berrys first hit , scoring on the R&amp;B , Country , and Pop Charts and selling over one million copies by the end of the year . <p> 7 . Berrys last studio recording was the album , Rock It , released on the Atco Records label in 1979 . He has released several live and compilation albums since that time . <p> 8 . Chuck Berry wrote dozens of hit songs that were covered by other artists . Some of these include , " Roll Over Beethoven , " " Brown Eyed Handsome Man , " " Rock and Roll Music , " " Little Queenie , " " Memphis , Tennessee , " and " Promised Land . " His only Number One hit , however , came in 1972 , with his live version of the Dave Bartholomew novelty song , " My Ding-a-Ling . " <p> 9 . Outside of the music business , Berry has owned several businesses in and around the St. Louis area . His first endeavor , the fully integrated , Club Bandstand , was opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was , shortly thereafter , convicted of violating the Mann Act , when an underage Native American girl he had hired , and subsequently fired , was arrested for prostitution at a local hotel . Compelling evidence has been provided that his conviction was , in fact , an act of systemic racism against Berry . Wealthy locals were enraged that he had the gall to open an integrated nightclub in the most prosperous and lavish part of the city . Regardless of the reasoning , it spelled the end of Club Bandstand . His second purchase was Berry Park , a 30 acre plot near Wentzville , Missouri , that originally featured 2 guest cottages , a nightclub and guitar shaped swimming pool . Although still Berrys primary residence , it is no longer open to the public . In the 1980s , Berry purchased the historic restaurant , The Southern Air , in Wentzville . A 1990 class action suit against him for allegedly videotaping female employees and customers , caused Berry to sell the establishment . It is now a satellite campus of Lindenwood University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , with just his guitar . He would hire local musicians at each tour stop , to save the cost of touring with a full band . A local promoter would make all the arrangements , and Berry would show up , usually minutes before the show , without rehearsal , and instruct the band to watch his leg for cues . These shows were generally disappointing to his fans , and were eventually stopped . <p> 11 . Berry emulated the showmanship of guitarists such as T-Bone Walker , but his signature move on stage , the " duck walk , " was actually a fluke . At a show in New York , in 1956 , he used the move he had begun as a child , in order to hide the wrinkles in a rayon suit he was wearing . The crowd went nuts , giving him a standing ovation , so he continued doing it for the rest of his career . <p> 12 . Chuck Berry was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1985 . The following year , Keith Richards inducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Its very difficult for me to talk about Chuck Berry cause I 've lifted every lick he ever played . " Almost every legendary rock band to follow him , including the Beatles , Rolling Stones , Bob Seger , and Aerosmith , all give credit to Berry for their early sound .

We hope you enjoy these as much as we enjoy bringing them to light . <p> 1 . Uncertainty concerning his date of birth . <p> He was born , John Smith Hurt , however , his actual date of birth is a bit of a mystery . The most likely is March 8th , 1893 . This is the date written in the Hurt family Bible , and accepted by his biographer and several other researchers . The birth date on his grave stone , however , is March 3rd , 1892 . Other researchers have submitted the dates , March 8th , 1892 ; March 16th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1893 ; and May 5th , 1895 . <p> 2 . Teoc , Mississippi <p> Hurt is probably the most notable person to be born in the hamlet of Teoc , Mississippi , which is located in Carroll County . Teoc , though is also known for its links to Arizona Senator John McCain . His great-great grandfather , William Alexander McCain , bought the Teoc Plantation in 1851 and owned over 50 slaves . He was killed , fighting for the Confederacy in 1863 , but after the Civil War , many of the former slaves stayed as tenant farmers for Williams son , John Sidney McCain and adopted the McCain surname . Some are even blood related , descended from two of the slaves , Isom and Lettie , and fathered by Henderson McCain . The black McCains were instrumental in organizing schools for African-American children in the 1880s and , nearly 100 years later , were local leaders in the Civil Rights Movement . <p> 3 .

Hanks played 12-string guitar and harmonica , and although unrecorded himself , was one of the major influences on the young Hurts playing . Another was William Henry Carson , a frequent visitor to Johns childhood home . Young John would play Carsons guitar while he was asleep . When Hurts mother mistook his playing for Carsons , she scraped together $1.50 and bought her son his first guitar , which he named " Black Annie . " <p> 4 . First recordings <p> In 1923 , he began playing guitar with a white fiddle player in the area , by the name of Willie Narmour . Five years later , Narmour won a fiddle contest and his prize was a recording contract with the Okeh label .

None of Hurts recordings were commercially successful , and when the Okeh label folded during the Great Depression of the 1930s , Hurt returned to Avalon and a life of share cropping . <p> 5 . Rediscovery <p> In the early 1950s , two events sparked interest in Hurts music once again . The first , was the release of his 1928 songs , " Frankie , " and " Spike Driver Blues , " on The Anthology of American Folk Music , released by Folkway Recordsin 1952 . The second was the discovery of one of the original copies of " Avalon Blues , " from Hurts December , 1928 , New York sessions .

Stagger Lee <p> The song , " Stagger Lee , " or any of its several variants , has been recorded dozens of times since its publication in 1911 , and first recording in 1923 . Its a murder ballad that speaks to the killing of Billy Lyons by the pimp , Lee Shelton , in St. Louis on Christmas , 1895 . Hurts version , titled , " Stack O Lee Blues , " was recorded on December 28th , 1928 in New York and is considered the definitive version of the song .

@@61383014 @1383014/ <h> 10 Things You Did n't  Know About Sam Cooke <p> Editors Note : The great , Sam Cooke would be 86 this week , if hed lived past his 33rd year . An artist who many regard as the founder of soul music , we offer 10 things you may not know about the " King of Soul . " <p> 1 . Its been said of Sam Cooke , that he was blues-born and church-bred . He was born Samuel Cook , in the bosom of the Delta , Clarksdale , Mississippi , on January 22nd , 1931 . One of eight children born to a Church of Christ ( Holiness ) minister and his wife , Sam moved , with his family , to Chicago in 1933 . His singing career began in a group made up of his siblings , when he was just six years old . By age 14 , he had become a lead singer with the Highway QCs , a Gospel group known for producing secular singing greats . In 1951 , when Sam left the group to join the Soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his place . Two years later , when Rawls left the QCs to join the Chosen Gospel Singers , it was none other than Johnnie Taylor who succeeded him . Coincidentally , it was Taylor who replaced Cooke in the Soul Stirrers , in 1957 . <p> 2 . Sam had a duality about him in regards to superstition . His father had taught him to always stand up for himself , no matter what . Although admonished to respect his elders , and authority , he was never to back down if he was in the right . These teachings worked against Rev. Cook in later years . Sam , the middle child , was never willing to wait for a heavenly reward , as his father often preached . He saw those sermons as a tactic , using fear and superstition , to keep the flock in line . Conversely , when it came to choosing a stage name , Sam simply added an e to the end of his family name . He reasoned that a full name , with an even amount of letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Cooke had 30 Top-40 hits in a span of just seven years , he was no stranger to tragedy , conflict , nor the price of fame . A bit of a philanderer , Cooke is said to have had 3 pregnant girlfriends , all at one time , during his stint with the Soul Stirrers . Cookes first wife , Delores , was killed in an automobile accident in 1959 . Although already divorced , Sam insisted on paying for her funeral . His youngest son , Vincent , from his second marriage , drowned in the family swimming pool when he was only 18 months old . His manager , Allen Klein , owned Tracey , Ltd. , the organization that eventually owned all rights to Cookes music . Sam Cooke , himself , was shot and killed by the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles , on December 11th , 1964 . Decades of speculation , accusations , and finger-pointing have followed his death , which was determined to be " justifiable homicide , " by a coroners inquest . <p> 4 . Cooke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be buried in a book or periodical . He even ordered an airplane swivel light installed in his car , so that he could read on the road . Stopping at drug stores along the tour route , neither his band , nor his brothers , Charles and LC , who accompanied him everywhere , were surprised to see him buy a copy of every magazine on display . He would devour everything from Playboy , and The New Yorker , to War and Peace , and The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich . He studied the writings of Aristotle , and of historian , John Hope Franklin . According to his brothers , Sams thirst for knowledge began in early childhood , and never left him . <p> 5 . It is fairly well known that protege , Bobby Womack , married Cookes widow , Barbara , just three months after his death , and that Cookes daughter , Linda , later married Bobbys brother , Cecil Womack . But there is more to the story . Cookes family was livid when Bobby and Barbara married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the couple in a Chicago hotel and beat Womack senseless . Also , according to Womacks autobiography , Midnight Mover , he would sneak out of his bedroom at night , to carry on a tryst with step-daughter , Linda . When Barbara found out , she held a gun to his head , ordering him out of the house . As he ran toward the garage , she fired one shot , grazing Bobbys scalp . This was the cause of their divorce . Linda went on to marry Cecil , often working musically with Bobby as well , although she never spoke to her mother again . Such is part of Cookes tragic legacy . <p> 6 . Womack was n't the only one whose career Cooke aided . He founded his own label , SAR Records , which released albums by the latter day Soul Stirrers , Billy Preston , Mel Carter , and Johnnie Taylor , to name a few . He also owned the publishing and management company , Kags . Because he was acknowledged as a pioneer of soul music , his influence directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when she was just 19 ) , Al Green , Curtis Mayfield , Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye , and many others . Although not allowed to play sports as a child , he befriended Cassius Clay , the professional boxer who converted to Islam , and changed his name to Muhammad Ali . Through this friendship , he fell in with a tight-knit group of civil rights supporters that also included football legend , Jim Brown , and Malcolm X. <p> 7 . The only show anyone can remember Cooke canceling was in Memphis , Tennessee . He received a telegram from the local NAACP stating that the audience for that nights show was to be heavily segregated . With only one side of three balconies being reserved for black audience members , they would make up only one fourth of the audience , and none would be on the floor level . He sent his brother , Charlie , to check it out , and when word came back that the telegram was true , Cooke canceled his appearance on the spot . He released a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time he s ever refused to perform , it was , " against his policy and the policy of his promoter to play to a forced segregated audience . " <p> 8 . Just after Christmas , 1963 , Cooke invited his friend and business partner , JW Alexander , over to hear a new song he had written . Inspired by Bob Dylans , " Blowin in the Wind , " Cooke had penned what would become the anthem of the Civil Rights Movement , " A Change is Gon na Come . " Cooke had heard Dylans song several months earlier and was moved that such a profound , and poignant song could be written by a white man . A bit ashamed that he had n't  written one like it himself , he held back in doing so for fear of alienating his predominantly white fan base , but had almost immediately made , " Blowin in the Wind , " part of his repertoire . Remembering back to events in his own life , such as his arrest in Louisiana after being denied motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anti-racism song of his own . Composed by Ren+ Hall , it was recorded on January 30th , 1964 . Hall had composed such a grandiose piece , that there were 30 artists contributing to the song . This included five backing vocalists , four guitars , a complete string section , a brass section including a french horn , and kettle drums . Cooke performed the song only once , on Johnny Carsons Tonight Show , just 8 days after recording it . His performance should have been a career milestone , but it was overshadowed by the Beatles appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show , two days later . The song wasnt released until December 22nd , 1964 , two weeks after Cooke was killed . <p> 9 . Sam Cooke actually had two funerals . After what can be best described as a shoddy job by Los Angeles morticians , Cookes body was flown to Chicago . There , an estimated 200,000 fans , as well as family and friends gathered for the viewing on December 18th . At the Tabernacle Baptist Church , the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been a member of the Highway QCs . The Staple Singers sang , " Old Rugged Cross , " with Mavis Staples in tears throughout . Afterward , his body was flown back to Los Angeles for a second service the next day . This one took place at the Mount Sinai Baptist Church . Gospel great , Bessie Griffin was too overcome with grief to sing at the funeral , so the rendition of , " The Angels Keep Watching Over Me , " was performed , instead , by Ray Charles . <p> 10 . Cooke has received a great many posthumous honors . In 1986 , he was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 . In 1994 , he was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . Rolling Stone Magazine has listed him on both their " 100 Greatest Artists of All Time , " and " Greatest Singers of All Time , " lists . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Although concertgoers received a copy of Musicology as part of their ticket purchase , the album still sold well , and with good reason : It was a solid look at modern soul with a tip of the hat to the old-school soul and R&amp;B from back-in-the-day . It was almost as though Prince was saying " Hey yall ; This is what solid , quality , grooving soul and R&amp;B sounds like . What 's up with the mess yall have been putting down ? " It was so good ; it was almost scary ! <p> With Middle of the Road , Eric Gales has borrowed a page from the Prince playbook . The album , Gales fourth on Provogue/Mascot Label Group is a rebirth .

There are several guests on the album including Gary Clark Jr. , mentor and older brother Eugene Gales and LaDonna Gales , Lance Lopez and Christone Kingfish Ingram . <p> These 11 tracks run 55 minutes , and they are a revelation . The sound quality , production , and mix are fresh , with an almost sparkling clarity . The backing vocals by LaDonna Gales are a transcendent backdrop draped throughout this musical masterstroke . <p> Excellent all the way through , we still had our favorites . " Good Time " says , " I 'm back and I 'm bad ! " It will absolutely school players , the same way Prince cut a whole new landscape with Musicology . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Change In Me " is a new beginning ; rocking , soulful , with a perfect lead . Gales is still fast , but now , slow enough to digest . Gales said , I changed up some things in life and decided to go a new route . " Arhythmic wonder , " Been So Long " has just the slightest echoes of Living Colours Vernon Reid coursing through it . <p> " Help Yourself " features the young guitar Jedi knight Christone " Kingfish " Ingram . This is a truly deep cut ; rocking , bluesy , percolating , and just a great listen . " Ive Been Deceived " showcases deliciously stout guitar lines , and once again , LaDonna Gales off-the-chain vocals . " I Do n't  Know " is what the Red Hot Chili Peppers would sound like in overdrive ! <p> Middle of the Road is a huge step forward in both contemporary blues and soul .

The Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco , California played host to one of the most remarkable concert events ever . In the beginning , The Band decided to hold a concert in the first place they had played , some sixteen years earlier . What began as a concert , turned into one of the most recognized music movie events of a generation . Forty years later , it is beyond legend , it is iconic . Were taking a look back at The Last Waltz , warts and all . <p> Perhaps the Sixties are still too near , but the effects of The Last Waltz are not always gratifying . Like scrupulous caretakers making merry at a wake , the Band brings on the best of the survivors " an impressive cast of stars not unlike the Hollywood has-beens who often take cameo roles in airport disaster films. - Jim Miller , Rolling Stone Magazine <p> Planned , not as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would see members of The Band go their own ways , for a time . Members of the group were looking into solo projects , recovering from injuries , and suffering from road fatigue . Lead guitarist , Robbie Robertson , came up with the idea to give their fans a Thanksgiving gift . A show that would reunite the group with their earliest influences and allow a jumping off point for band members to launch their solo projects , recuperate , and then , eventually , return bigger and better than ever . Almost from its very inception , the simple plan began to snowball . <p> We wanted to bring it to a conclusion . We 'd been together 16 years , and we 'd kind of done everythingwe thought . And so we said , let 's have a musical celebration , then well close this episode and then come back with a new creative spirit . It started as a very modest idea . Well play a last concert where we played our first concert as The Band . Well invite Ronnie Hawkins , who we started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectful thing to do . And then someone said , I know , but we cant do this and not invite Eric Clapton . That 's just wrong . He s been waving the flag since the beginning. Then I said , ah geez , if we invite Eric Clapton , then we have to invite Van Morrison. Then we have to get Neil Young , you know , get the Canadians in there. - Robbie Robertson <p> When all was said and done , those five artists , and over a dozen more , joined in the celebration . Dr. John , Bobby Charles , Paul Butterfield , Muddy Waters ( with his band members , Pinetop Perkins and Bob Margolin ) , Joni Mitchell , Neil Diamond , Ron Wood , Ringo Starr , Stephen Stills , Carl Radle , the Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris all took part . Several poets also took to the stage , and the 5,000 fans in the crowd were treated to a full Thanksgiving dinner , compliments of promoter extraordinaire , and Winterland owner , Bill Graham . As we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , Martin Scorsese , was brought in to record the entire extravaganza . With him came several well known cinematographers , including Michael Chapman , Vilmos Zsigmond , and L+szl+ Kov+cs , who operated seven 35MM cameras . This was the first time in history that 35MM had been used to record a concert and it caused major problems as the shoot went on . Hollywood production designer , Boris Leven , was hired to decorate the stage and design the lighting . Among his decorations were the crystal chandeliers used in Gone With the Wind . <p> Chandeliers ? I do n't  think that 's going to go over with Neil or Bob or the rest of the musicians . These people do n't  do chandeliers , Boris. - Robbie Robertson <p> For those lucky , or wealthy enough , to afford the $25 tickets , the concert was , as many are , fraught with technical issues . Out of tune instruments , lackluster performances , and timing issues plagued the show , but for the millions who saw the concert on film , it was spectacular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the greatest rock concert movie ever made " and maybe the best rock movie , period . " Terry Lawson , of the Detroit Free Press , wrote , " This is one of the great movie experiences . " Why ? Because the glitches were all fixed in post-production . <p> As far as I was concerned , the movie was a disaster . For two hours at a screening we watched as the camera focused almost exclusively on Robbie Robertson , long and loving close-ups of his heavily made-up face and expensive haircut . The film was edited so it looked like Robbie was conducting the band with expansive waves of his guitar neck . The muscles on his neck stood out like cords when he sang so powerfully into his switched-off microphone. - Levon Helm <p> Band drummer , Helm , was n't the only one to point out the differences between the live show and what fans saw on film . Another example was the horn section , with their parts arranged by famed New Orleans musician , Allen Toussaint . Although their performance throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they were recorded in the remote truck . <p> I 'm pretty sure that Levon is the only honest , live element in The Last Waltz , with the exception of Muddy Waters vocal . Everything else was overdubbed and redone . Levon was basically gone , because he was disgusted with certain aspects of the business practices . Robbie asked him to do his part over again , but Levon had nothing to do with it . Robbie was right in that there were some good reasons for overdubbing the whole thing . Richard was n't singing well , Ricks bass was out of tune , and Robbie wanted to improve his guitar solos . Also , the horns were recorded completely out of balance and had to be redone in New York with arrangements Henry Glove and I put together. - John Simon ( Producer ) <p> That is n't where the issues ceased . One particular artist , Bob Dylan , negotiated his performance right up the last minute . Fifteen minutes before he was scheduled to go on , Dylan arrived at the venue and announced that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was reluctant largely out of concern that The Last Waltz would compete with his own upcoming concert film , Renaldo &amp; Clara ( 1978 ) . With five minutes to go , Graham convinced Dylan to agree to be filmed for his last two songs only . To make it clear that he was n't being filmed , the cameras were physically turned away from the stage during his first few songs . After the show , Dylans lawyer seized the footage for future negotiation purposes . <p> Luckily , one of the high points of the production was captured , without Dylans knowledge at the time , and preserved for posterity . As the crews tried to wrap up at the agreed-upon time , Bill Graham rushed in to countermand those instructions . That is how the sing-along of " I Shall Be Released , " which featured Dylan , and The Band , along with Wood and Starr , was documented . <p> Fuck you ! Roll the fucking cameras ! Roll ' em ! - Bill Graham <p> The performance by Chicago blues great , Muddy Waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked to find that because of time and budget constraints and Band politics , Muddy was nearly bumped from the show . Levon fought bitterly behind the scenes and prevailed to not only keep Muddy in but to indulge him with me and Pinetop too . We were treated as honored guests at The Last Waltz and I enjoyed the once-in-a-lifetime jam afterwards , but Levon never told us about making a stand for us . He just made us welcome . Ultimately , this gracious , classy , and tough gentleman was responsible for my good time there. - Bob Margolin <p> However , Waters performance may not have been captured on camera , if not for sheer luck , and director , Martin Scorseses temper . Thanks to The Band making some changes on the fly , Scorsese grew frustrated , screaming into his headphones to make last-second cue changes to his camera crew . Cinematographer , L+szl+ Kov+cs , could n't handle it and ripped off his headset . With Scorsese thinking a different song was coming up , he ordered all the cameras to shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy . " Fortunately for us , Kov+cs did n't  hear Scorseses order , which is why the only footage of Waters performance came from his camera . <p> When that great , pounding rhythm on Mannish Boy started up , I certainly did go into a panic . As Jonathan remembers , I did n't know the song 's alternate title : like a lot of people my age , I was still learning my way through the blues by way of rock and roll . It was indeed fortunate that one of the cameramen kept on shooting , for whatever reason , and doubly fortunate that the cameraman happened to be the great cinematographer L+szl+ Kov+cs. - Martin Scorsese <p> It did seem that most of the guest artists had a connection to The Band . They were original masters of the genres that Robertson , Helm and company emulated , or they were artists or groups that they had worked with in the past . Again , most of them . Enter Neil Diamond . Diamond appeared at the insistence of Robertson , who had recently produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on guitar , Garth Hudson and Dr. John on Hammond organ . The song that Diamond performed , " Dry Your Eyes , " from that album was also co-written by Robertson . <p> When I heard that Neil Diamond was going to play I asked , What the hell does Neil Diamond have to do with us ? Levon Helm <p> Diamond was also involved in a couple of humorous situations while in attendance . One of them was when Neil Young introduced himself backstage . <p> The other has its base in rumor . As the story goes , Diamond , feeling pretty good after his performance of " Dry Your Eyes , " challenged Dylan to , " follow that . " Dylan allegedly responded by asking , " What do I have to do , go on stage and fall asleep ? " When Rolling Stone asked Diamond about the incident in 2010 , the story had somewhat changed . Dylan apparently replied only with a quizzical look to Diamonds statement , which also differed from the original story . <p> Actually , it was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I came over to him and I said , You know , Bob , those are really my people out there.- Neil Diamond <p> With the exception of the Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris , who were recorded on an MGM studio soundstage days after the show , all the acts performed live on the Winterland stage . The concert , which began at 9 pm , was still going strong into the early morning hours , with encores and two jam sessions . When it finally came to a close , the artists were physically and mentally exhausted . After all , The Band had to learn twenty or more songs they had never played before , and then play them with their guests . <p> I was on stage for five and a half hours . They could do a Son of The Last Waltz , because we 've got some great material . We only used a small amount of it. - Rick Danko <p> In his recent book , Testimony , Robertson remembered , <p> At the end of the tune , everybody looked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to accept it . As many of the performers left the stage , some just could n't do it . Levon and Ringo were n't going anywhere yet . They kicked into a feel-good beat , and I put my guitar back on . Eric , Ronnie , Neil , and Butterfield all started trading licks . Dr. John took over at the piano . Rick , Garth , and I continued our duties as hosts and let the good times roll. - Robbie Robertson <p> Perhaps the coolest performances in San Francisco on that day , the night before , and the day after , were only heard by the musicians themselves . The Band had reserved the entire Miyako Hotel for their guests , and where you have all that talent in one place , impromptu jam sessions are bound to break out . Some took place the evening before the big show . In a 2013 interview with American Blues Scene , Dr. John recalled the pre-concert get together . <p> I seen Muddy Waters playing The Last Waltz . He played Nine Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every so-called bad-ass guitar player with his jaw droopin ' and saggin ' I wish they 'd filmed that. - Dr. John <p> With the actual concert over , and the artists safely back at the Miyako , the music still did n't  stop . The blues artists , with the exception of Waters and Perkins , gathered together and another jam session broke out . It began around 7 AM , and lasted well into the day . <p> We had Dr. John on piano , Ron Wood on bass , Levon on drums , Butterfield on harp , and Clapton , Dylan , and myself playing guitars . There were no vocal microphones , and we all played softly enough to hear Dylan sing , Kind Hearted Woman , and a few other well-known blues songs . His trademark vocal eccentricities sounded outlandish in the blues , but he did make them his own . Generally , the blues we played that morning were not remarkable , but I was honored to be jamming with these fine musicians , and I realize that they belong to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margolin <p> The main thing , however , is that even with all its flaws and glitches , The Last Waltz will be remembered as one of the greatest gatherings of a generation . Some people , such as Helm , remembered it as a catastrophe . <p> People ask me about The Last Waltz all the time . Rick Danko dying at fifty-six is what I think about The Last Waltz . It was the biggest fuckin rip-off that ever happened to The Band without a doubt. - Levon Helm <p> Others , such as the aforementioned journalists , the millions of people , all over the world , that have seen the film , or heard the soundtrack , and Robertson himself , look at it from a 40 year distance and are satisfied . <p> So we thought , good , this is a good way to shuffle the deck , we 'll do this and when we come back we can get these things sorted out . And everybody went off to do these things and nobody came back . But over time it looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's why I 'm saying that was never the plan at all. - Robbie Robertson <p> All we know , is that there are two great musical accompaniments to the Thanksgiving holiday . Arlo Guthries Alices Restaurant , and The Last Waltz . You can bet your pumpkin pie that well be playing them both today . Well also be following the instructions on the opening placard : " This film should be played loud ! " 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Now , a Grammy-winning guitarist , around 1970 , at the age of 14 , Flynn was discovered playing outside a Green Bay , Wisconsin club . The man who noticed him , and invited him to join in on stage , was none other than Jimmy Dawkins . Dawkins had released his Delmark Records debut , Fast Fingers , a year prior . Five years later , Flynn joined Dawkins band full-time , becoming a dear friend and musical disciple . <p> On March 17th , Flynns own Delmark debut , Lonesome Highway , hit record store shelves . In the time since that chance meeting , Flynn has escalated to near living legend status . He s been a first call guitarist for artists including Billy Boy Arnold , Kim Wilson , Mississippi Heat , and dozens more . Flynn has also established himself as a first rate vocalist , songwriter and bandleader . A expert on several roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blues , able to channel the masters at will . Yet , all the while , maintaining his own trademark style . <p> The recent ghost of Chuck Berry whirled from the speakers the moment we hit play .

The welcome addition of Deitra Farr , on second vocals , created a runaway dance hit , reminiscent of the thousands of halls that Chuck , himself , played . Farr , a Chicago soul , blues , and gospel great in her own right , appears again halfway through the record on , " Hold On . " This time , its a true duet with Flynn also demonstrating his killer harmonica skills . <p> Flynns ability to convey the vibe of past genius artists is prevalent throughout the entire offering . The title track , as well as " If It Wasnt For the Blues , " are solid , West Side Chicago . His piercing , grungy guitar conjures the spirits of Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he recreates the crying slide of Earl Hooker , while John Lee Hookers influence is spread all over the foot stomping , " Waiting Game . " All of this is on just the first half of this extended 17 track release . <p> Flynn has also successfully surrounded himself with top-notch musicians . Roosevelt Purifoy supplies piano , organ and Rhodes , while E.G. McDaniel on bass , and drummer , Andrew " Blaze " Thomas make up the rock solid rhythm section . The first-class horns of Doug Corcoran , and Christopher Neal , nicely add to the Second City feel . Chicago blues veteran , Dave Katzman , plays rhythm guitar on " The Lucky Kind , " which also features a wonderful trumpet solo from Corcoran . This hand-picked group of artists all brought their A games to Delmarks Riverside Studios , for a monster session back in October . 17 songs recorded in just two days , demonstrates the professionalism and dedication of all involved . <p> This is a literal cornucopia of great Chicago blues , all written by Flynn himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumental cover of Billy Pages " The In Crowd .

" <p> Self produced , along with Dick Shurman , and Steve Wagner , Lonesome Highway , is a true celebration of Billy Flynns 60th trip around the sun . Many of the songs were shared with Jimmy Dawkins before his tragic passing in 2013 . He offered his advice , and Flynn truly honors his mentor with this one .

We continue the tradition this year , and who better to start it off than a man with over 70 years in the music business , who is still going strong ? We offer you 10 Things You Did n't  Know about the great Louisiana piano man , Henry Gray . <p> 1 . The son of a church deacon , Henry Gray began playing piano at the age of eight . Due to the strict Christian attitude of his father , he was only allowed to play spirituals in the family home . He was , however , allowed to play blues in the home of his piano teacher , Mrs. White . By the age of 16 , he was playing blues professionally , at a local club in Alsen , Louisiana . Although his father did n't  approve of the " devils music , " he became supportive of his sons endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray then began accompanying young Henry to his gigs . <p> 2 . Gray joined the Army at the age of 18 . The year was 1943 , and he was sent to the South Pacific to fight in World War II . Many times , his popularity from playing piano for the troops kept him from the front lines . After serving three years , he received a medical discharge , and went home to Louisiana . <p> 3 . After a brief stay at home , Gray relocated to Chicago . He knew that 's where all the big name blues players were at the time . He also thought that he could make more money playing there , than in Louisiana . In 1946 , there were only a couple of young , hot , piano players in the Windy City . One of them was Otis Spann , who had moved there , the same year , from Belzoni , Mississippi . The other , was Spanns cousin , " Little " Johnny Jones , who had traveled to Chicago from Jackson , Mississippi , the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common . <p> 4 . Major " Big Maceo " Merriweather , had been a Chicago hit-maker for five years when Gray arrived . He had served as a mentor to both Spann , and Jones , and soon took Gray under his wing as well . Maceo taught him the intricacies of using his left hand , developing the " two fisted " playing for which Gray became famous . When Big Maceo suffered a stroke , Gray would appear with him on stage , playing the left hand parts for his friend . <p> 5 . In 1956 , after years of gigging , and becoming a successful session musician , Gray joined the Howlin Wolf band . After guitarist , Hubert Sumlin , Grays 14 year tenure , made him the Wolfs longest lasting band mate . During that stint , he also continued his session work , playing and recording with artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson II , Muddy Waters , Little Walter , Otis Rush , and Koko Taylor .

It was n't long after his return , that he began playing with Slim Harpo . The combination of the two , helped promote the burgeoning " swamp blues , " sound of the area . <p> 7 . After nearly 40 years as a professional musician , Henry Gray cut his first solo album , They Call Me Little Henry , in 1977 . Ironically , it was his popularity in Europe that made the record possible . Recorded at Rhenus Studio , in Cologne , Germany , the album was released on the British label , Bluebeat .

@@61383049 @1383049/ <h> 10 Things You Did n't  Know About Scotty Moore <p> Editors Note:Yesterday , December 27th , would have been Scotty Moores 85th birthday . Moore was a guitarists guitarist , one of the inventors of rock-a-billy , lead player for Elvis Presley , and an inspiration to generations of musicians to follow . In honor of his incredible influence on the music scene , we offer 10 things you may not know about the man of whom Keith Richards said , " Everyone else wanted to be Elvis , I wanted to be Scotty . " <p> 1 . Moore was not a guitar collector , as many artists are today . He actually began his career using a Fender , but it did n't  feel right to him , so he switched to a Gibson ES-295 , then the L5 , and finally to the Super400 , which he played until his last days . He sold off his older guitars as he purchased new ones . <p> 2 . He ordered an EchoSonic amplifier from a man named Ray Butts , who had built one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watts , it had a built-in tape delay system that allowed Moore to replicate the slapback echo sound of the Sun Studio recordings , live . He first used it on the recording of , " Mystery Train , " in July 1955 , and continued to use it for every recording and live performance for the rest of his career . His was the third EchoSonic ever built , and it was remodeled due to damage over time , with new cabinets , and two additional 50 watt boosters . Eventually , Butts built 68 such amplifiers , each , one at a time , with artists such as Carl Perkins , Roy Orbison , and Luther Perkins ( Johnny Cash guitarist ) , commissioning one for themselves . Moore retired the amp in the early 1990s after it was nearly destroyed by an airline , and finally sold it , privately , in 2008 . <p> 3 . Moore did n't  play professionally for nearly twenty years . After his last performance with Elvis in 1968 , he recorded with Carl Perkins in 1975 , on Perkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs for Billy Swann , his next recording session was again with Perkins , at Sun Studios , for 706 ReUnion : A Sentimental Journey , in 1992 . <p> 4 . When Elvis joined the US Army in 1958 , the Blue Moon Boys , made up of Moore , bassist , Bill Black , and drummer , D.J . Fontana , were left hanging . Although Presley was raking in the money , his musicians were all salaried players , and when Presley joined up , their income stopped . It was at this time that Moore bought interest in , and became Vice-President of Fernwood Records . The label was relatively short-lived , producing just one hit record ; " Tragedy , " by Thomas Wayne Perkins . <p> 5 . After his time with Fernwood Records , Moore went to work for Sam Phillips as production manager of Sun Studios . In 1964 , Scotty released an album of instrumentals on the Epic label , called , The Guitar That Changed the World . That release got him fired by Phillips , and Scotty moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business nine years later and worked , for many years as a recording engineer . He engineered several television shows for Opryland Productions , featuring artists such Dolly Parton , Carol Burnett , Bob Hope , and Johnny Cash . <p> 6 . In 2013 , to honor Scottys 81st birthday , Gibson released 81 exact replicas of his famous 1952 ES-295 guitar . Each one was played , and signed , by the man , himself . Gibson also threw in a trick bag of extras , including a signed photo of Moore . We found one , currently for sale in the UK with an asking price of just under , $9,000 . <p> 7 . Besides being a major influence on every single rock-a-billy artist who followed , Scotty Moores impact reached into the realms of British Invasion artists as well . Eric Clapton , Mark Knopfler , David Gilmour , Alvin Lee , Ron Wood , Keith Richards , Jeff Beck , Jimmy Page , and George Harrison have all touted him as a reason they took up guitar in the first place . The list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also includes Bruce Springsteen , Rick Nielson , Brian Setzer , metal rocker , " Filthy " Phil Campbell , and even punk guitarists , Poison Ivy , and Johnny Ramone . <p> 8 . The use of a root note and the fifth , more commonly referred to as a " power chord , " began with commercial recordings in the 1950s . Although there is some debate on who began using them first , it seems to trace right to Sun Records . Writer and musicologist , Robert Palmer , claims that power chords were first used by Willie Johnson on the Howlin Wolf song , " How Many More Years , " in 1951 , and then by another Sun guitarist , Pat Hare , on , " Cotton Crop Blues , " by James Cotton in 1954 . Rock critic , Dave Marsh , however , gives the invention credit to Scotty Moore , for Presleys , " Jailhouse Rock , " in 1957 . Native American blues rocker , Link Wray , is generally credited for popularizing its use on his 1958 instrumental smash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position playing behind Elvis Presley , was a salaried musician .

When Moore and Black first quit the band , it was a strike for more money . They never did get back on the payroll after that . While Presley was famous for his generosity , handing out diamond jewelry , motorcycles , and Cadillacs to his friends , the band members never received any gifts of that nature . " I honestly do n't  think he ever gave us anything , " Moore was quoted as saying . " I 've never held it against him , but I 've always wondered why . He was very generous to all his friends , but we always seemed to be in the wrong line . " <p> 10 .

Fortunately , with this album , they share their experience and music with all of us as well .

On one level , this album is universally pleasing as it nudges , pushes , lifts up , and touches the soul , drinking in its goodness . Naturally , everyone also has their favorites . We enjoyed " Do n't  Leave Me Here , " with its serious backbeat , horn fills , organ textures and guitar fills , and " Shake Me In Your Arms , " again with an incredible back beat , and strong guitar lines with a winning solo by Joe Walsh . <p> Another track we appreciated was " Thats Who I Am , " with a seeming symphony of guitars including electric and slide by Keb Mo , resonator by Keb Mo and Taj Mahal , and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talkin ' " featured a slow groove , slow , with brilliant harmonies and textures , and guitar lines , while " Soul " had an infectious Caribbean vibe . John Mayers " Waiting On The World To Change " closes the album and is a completely unique performance of this modern classic . Keb Mo plays bass , percussion , acoustic guitar and provides the vocals , with Taj Mahal also on acoustic guitar and vocals , with Bonnie Raitt providing backing vocals as well . The simplicity of the presentation is what endears this performance to listeners , along with the beauty of the acoustic rendering , and even a bit of scat singing too . <p> Do n't  pass up this opportunity to spend time with these two masters as they share their music with you .

Staples credits his song , " Happy , " as the inspiration for her latest album , Livin on a High Note . <p> 10 . One would think that after well over 60 years as an internationally recognized , and award winning artist , Staples may have developed some diva like qualities . Nothing could be further from the truth . In a 2016 interview with Jude Rogers of The Guardian , Mavis had this to say , " I go to the cleaners , I go down in the basement to wash my clothes . I do n't have anyone running around for me like some of my girlfriends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I feel if you do n't go out there , if you do n't mingle among the people , how are you going to know what they need to know , and hear what they need to hear ? That 's the good part .

At the forefront of the KC music scene these days is a power trio of young women known collectively as Katy Guillen &amp; The Girls . <p> One of the most sought after acts in America , KG&amp;G got their start when guitarist and lead singer , Katy Guillen , was offered a slot to open for the all-star group , Royal Southern Brotherhood in 2012 . In need of a backing band , she enlisted bassist , Claire Adams and drummer , Stephanie Williams , who both also supply backing vocals . The chemistry was immediate and incendiary . Guillens searing blues guitar complimented by Williams jazz and rock influenced drumming and Adams impeccable bass lines quickly elevated their original material to an epic status . In 2014 , the release of their eponymous , debut album and impressive showing as finalists at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reckoned with . <p> Their sophomore album , Heavy Days , is set for release on June 24th and takes them on a new heading . " The bands songs started out in more of a blues vein on the first album , " says Guillen , " and with the newer originals we have been moving toward more of a rock and roll sound with high energy and heavy riffs . Its what you come up with when you 're not thinking about fitting into a niche or genre , but when you 're having fun . " <p> Fun seems to be the key word with KG&amp;G . Theyd rather be on stage performing than almost anywhere else . Theyve had the opportunity to tour the US and Sweden , as well as play the Montreal Jazz Festival , and the groups with whom theyve shared the stage thus far are some heavy hitters . Along with trading licks with seasoned artists such as Samantha Fish and Danielle Nicole , theyve also opened for bands like the Doobie Brothers . One thing they took away from each show was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait . Do what you love , have fun , and do n't  stop . " <p> If for one second you think this is just another air-headed girl group , you need to immediately hit your mental reset button and reboot your thinking . This is a triad of smart , talented , business minded young women who are charging ahead with the speed of a runaway train . The most astonishing thing about them is how deeply rooted they are with one another , and their hometown , as they scale new heights daily . <p> Take their new release , Heavy Days , for example . There are guest appearances from renowned keyboardist , Mike " Shinetop Jr . " Sedovic , and trombonist Ryan Heinlein of Project H , both famed Kansas City musicians in their own right . That 's just the beginning , however . The album was recorded at Weights and Measures Sound Lab in the " City of Fountains , " with Paul Malinowski producing and Duane Trower as the engineer . They played live in the studio , recording 10 tracks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - they spent the better part of two months , " laying down ideas and fleshing out the bones . " To add the proverbial cherry on top , the girls founded KG&amp;G Records in conjunction with the VizzTone Label Group , all while maintaining a nearly non-stop touring schedule . <p> When we asked Katy why go to all this extra bother , her response was honest and heartfelt . " One of our goals , " she explained , " is to be able to maintain creative integrity in a competitive industry . We want to have control over what we do , selecting our own songs that go on our own albums , deciding when to release them , what aesthetic to use , etc . On top of all this , we have accomplished these things as a result of the efforts of our own KG&amp;G family . I couldnt be prouder of that . What 's more , is the three of us have experienced it all together . Its made us grow closer and be really grateful for each other . " <p> Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness is a wide-ranging group from Jimi Hendrix and John Lee Hooker , to Heartless Bastards , Band of Skulls , and even The Bangles and Beach Boys . This is probably why they ca n't be typecast into a specific genre . Then again , they do n't  want to be . They describe the ride they 're on as fun and enlightening , and they are genuinely excited to be creating their own sound and bringing it to the world . In our opinion , you 'll be just as excited once you 've seen them . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

We continue the tradition this year , and who better to start it off than a man with over 70 years in the music business , who is still going strong ? We offer you 10 Things You Did n't  Know about the great Louisiana piano man , Henry Gray . <p> 1 . The son of a church deacon , Henry Gray began playing piano at the age of eight . Due to the strict Christian attitude of his father , he was only allowed to play spirituals in the family home . He was , however , allowed to play blues in the home of his piano teacher , Mrs. White . By the age of 16 , he was playing blues professionally , at a local club in Alsen , Louisiana . Although his father did n't  approve of the " devils music , " he became supportive of his sons endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray then began accompanying young Henry to his gigs . <p> 2 . Gray joined the Army at the age of 18 . The year was 1943 , and he was sent to the South Pacific to fight in World War II . Many times , his popularity from playing piano for the troops kept him from the front lines . After serving three years , he received a medical discharge , and went home to Louisiana . <p> 3 . After a brief stay at home , Gray relocated to Chicago . He knew that 's where all the big name blues players were at the time . He also thought that he could make more money playing there , than in Louisiana . In 1946 , there were only a couple of young , hot , piano players in the Windy City . One of them was Otis Spann , who had moved there , the same year , from Belzoni , Mississippi . The other , was Spanns cousin , " Little " Johnny Jones , who had traveled to Chicago from Jackson , Mississippi , the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common . <p> 4 . Major " Big Maceo " Merriweather , had been a Chicago hit-maker for five years when Gray arrived . He had served as a mentor to both Spann , and Jones , and soon took Gray under his wing as well . Maceo taught him the intricacies of using his left hand , developing the " two fisted " playing for which Gray became famous . When Big Maceo suffered a stroke , Gray would appear with him on stage , playing the left hand parts for his friend . <p> 5 . In 1956 , after years of gigging , and becoming a successful session musician , Gray joined the Howlin Wolf band . After guitarist , Hubert Sumlin , Grays 14 year tenure , made him the Wolfs longest lasting band mate . During that stint , he also continued his session work , playing and recording with artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson II , Muddy Waters , Little Walter , Otis Rush , and Koko Taylor . Currently , Gray has over 75 albums on which he is credited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1968 , Gray moved back to Alsen , Louisiana , to help his mother with the family fish market .

It was n't long after his return , that he began playing with Slim Harpo . The combination of the two , helped promote the burgeoning " swamp blues , " sound of the area . <p> 7 . After nearly 40 years as a professional musician , Henry Gray cut his first solo album , They Call Me Little Henry , in 1977 . Ironically , it was his popularity in Europe that made the record possible . Recorded at Rhenus Studio , in Cologne , Germany , the album was released on the British label , Bluebeat .

The Telarc release garnered a Grammy nomination . <p> 9 . So loved is Gray in Europe , that , also in 1998 , he was invited to perform atRolling Stones frontman , Mick Jaggers 55th birthday party in Paris . The two jammed together , with Gray on piano and Jagger on guitar and harmonica . As a special request from the birthday boy , Gray also played for Jaggers mother at the event . <p> 10 .

These two Columbia label albums are the bedrock that Taj Mahal would build the foundation of a remarkable career upon . To date he has been nominated for nine Grammy Awards , receiving two . In 2006 he received the Historical Album of the Year BMA for The Essential Taj Mahal . Also in 2006 , he was designated the official Blues Artist of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . <p> Born Kevin Roosevelt Moore in 1951 , Keb Mo came to folks attention with his Okeh debut in 1994 , aptly titled Keb Mo .

Fortunately , with this album , they share their experience and music with all of us as well . The album boasts 11 tracks and has a running time of just over 45 minutes , which will seem woefully short when its over ! <p> There are several things that become apparent from the beginning . These two gentlemen are really enjoying each other , building the music , each seeing what the other offers and then serving up their own delight to enhance the whole .

On one level , this album is universally pleasing as it nudges , pushes , lifts up , and touches the soul , drinking in its goodness . Naturally , everyone also has their favorites . We enjoyed " Do n't  Leave Me Here , " with its serious backbeat , horn fills , organ textures and guitar fills , and " Shake Me In Your Arms , " again with an incredible back beat , and strong guitar lines with a winning solo by Joe Walsh . <p> Another track we appreciated was " Thats Who I Am , " with a seeming symphony of guitars including electric and slide by Keb Mo , resonator by Keb Mo and Taj Mahal , and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talkin ' " featured a slow groove , slow , with brilliant harmonies and textures , and guitar lines , while " Soul " had an infectious Caribbean vibe .

Keb Mo plays bass , percussion , acoustic guitar and provides the vocals , with Taj Mahal also on acoustic guitar and vocals , with Bonnie Raitt providing backing vocals as well . The simplicity of the presentation is what endears this performance to listeners , along with the beauty of the acoustic rendering , and even a bit of scat singing too . <p> Do n't  pass up this opportunity to spend time with these two masters as they share their music with you .

@@61383065 @1383065/ <h> 10 Things You Did n't  Know About Neil Young <p> On November 12th , Neil Young will celebrate his 71st birthday . In recognition of the twice inducted Rock and Roll Hall of Famer , we offer 10 things you may not know about Joe Canuck , himself . <p> 1 . Neil Percival Young was born on November 12th , 1945 in Toronto , Ontario , Canada . Although he moved to the United States in the 1960s and got a green card in 1970 , he has never renounced his Canadian citizenship . <p> 2 . At the age of 7 , he contracted polio . It was during the last outbreak of the disease in Ontario and almost cost him his life . On a side note , fellow Canadian artist , and Young collaborator , Joni Mitchell , also caught the virus during the same outbreak . The family took him to Florida to recuperate , and his most vivid memory was of all the brand new American cars he saw during their travels . This instigated a life-long love of automobiles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included a 1948 Buick Roadmaster hearse , which he named Mortimer , a 1973 Eagle tour bus named Pocahontas , a 1949 Cadillac named Hank , a 1959 Lincoln Continental named LincVolt , which has been converted to run on alternative energy , and the 1953 Pontiac hearse , Mort II , which brought him , illegally , across the border , and on to California , in the 1960s . <p> 3 . His first instrument was a cheap , plastic , ukulele , which he received as a Christmas present in 1958 . From that instrument he progressed to a better ukulele , then a banjo ukulele , and finally a baritone ukulele , before ever owning a guitar . <p> 4 . Although his first gigging was done as a member of the Jades , and his first recording with the Squires , he was touring Canadian folk clubs as a solo artist in 1965 . That is when he first met Mitchell , wrote the song , " Sugar Mountain , " and finally joined a rhythm and blues band called the Mynah Birds in 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of Young , future Buffalo Springfield bassist , Bruce Palmer , future Steppenwolf members , Goldy McJohn and Nick St. Nicholas , and front man , and future funk master , Rick James . James and Young shared a Toronto apartment , and the band had signed a deal with Motown Records . Unfortunately , just as they were set to enter the studio , James was arrested for being AWOL from the US Navy . It seems he had joined up to avoid the draft , and then deserted to Toronto . <p> 5 . It would seem that Young has been prone to illness . In 1966 , after Buffalo Springfield was formed during a chance meeting on Sunset Boulevard , he developed epilepsy , often having seizures while performing with the group on stage . A few years later , suffering from another ailment , he wrote three of his most memorable songs . " Down by the River , " " Cowgirl in the Sand , " and " Cinnamon Girl , " were all written under the influence of a 103 degree fever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although initially treated successfully , his femoral artery , which the doctors used to reach the aneurysm , began to bleed . The complication led to canceling his appearance at the Juno Awards that year , but within a few months he was back on tour . <p> 6 . The group , Crosby , Stills , Nash &amp; Young , played their second gig , ever , at Woodstock in 1969 . He was actually the second choice of the group , joining after Steve Winwood turned them down to stay with Blind Faith . In 1970 , Young wrote the CSNY song , " Ohio , " after the Kent State killings . 24 years later , Young was offered $1,000,000 to headline Woodstock 94 , but declined , saying the event had become too commercial . <p> 7 . Through his many hits , and long career , Youngs 1971 song , " Heart of Gold , " is the only one of his works to hit #1 on the charts , both in Canada and the US . The song was recorded for the Harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocals . It was recorded as an acoustic piece , because at the time , Young was recovering from a back injury , and could n't stand with his electric guitar , Old Black , for any period of time . <p> 8 . Young is known as the " Godfather of Grunge , " due to his use of feedback and distortion . In 1991 , he released the album , Arc , which is composed of feedback noise from various live shows . Lyrics from his song , " My My , Hey Hey ( Out of the Blue ) , " were included in the suicide note of Kurt Cobain . In 1995 , he recorded a collaborative album with the band , Pearl Jam , and later that year , Eddie Vetter inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . He was inducted a second time , in 1997 , as a member of Buffalo Springfield . <p> 9 . Outside of music , Young is a well known political activist . However , he also founded The Bridge School , with former wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with severe speech and physical impairments . Young , himself , has two sons with cerebral palsy and a daughter with epilepsy . In 1985 , he co-founded Farm Aid with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp . Also a lover of model trains , he is part owner of the Lionel company . He helped develop more authentic train sounds and designed special remote controls that his sons could operate without using their hands . It was Young who saved the company from bankruptcy in 2008 . <p> 10 . In the 47 years since he wrote the song , and included it on the album , Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young has never revealed who the real " Cinnamon Girl " is. 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

" That 's the first stuff I learned . <p> When did you know without a doubt in your mind , that you were going to be a musician ? <p> There were a couple times for me , but the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with my dads band when I was eight . That 's when I really knew that this was it , you know ? There was n't any other career that I wanted to pursue . I just wanted to play music . <p> What is the best time that you 've ever had playing a show ? <p> I 'd say one of the biggest highlights of my life thus far , has been when we had the opportunity to play at the Theatre in my home town , that I grew up always going to shows at , called The Peace Center . Govt Mule was coming to town so that was the opportunity to open for them was at that show . That was really a start to a lot of great opportunities for a lot of work after that . <p> Worst experience playing a show or doing a show , etc. ? <p> When I was about 15 years old , I was playing a club in Greenville . I do n't know if I was supposed to be in there or not , but I was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; somebody had been shot outside . So , we all had to quit playing and wait for the coast to be clear kind-of-thing . Not to paint Greenville as a bad town or anything <p> Is there anything specific that you want to accomplish with your music ? <p> I want to bring people together through the music . We want to invoke the idea of love and try to bring people together . <p> Youve said , " This album is a big melting pot of different kinds of music . Its the sound of everyone taking their own influences , and collectively coming together as a group . " You go on to say , " We 're all really hungry to play , and we 're so passionate about this music . " <p> Essentially , this album is a reintroduction to the Marcus King Band . On the first album , my drummer Jack Ryan and myself are the only two members that were on that record , as well as our previous bass player and keyboard player . After that record , they both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , and That 's all good . <p> We came back home and started searching for musicians and we found everybody in the group organically , and we started working together . We felt this chemistry that we knew was hard to ignore . That 's really how it started . <p> On this record , we wanted to reintroduce the idea of what the Marcus King Band was . We wanted it to be a band , not Marcus AND his band . I have never wanted that . I wanted to really instill the idea of this being a unit . Everybody in the band brings a different element to the unit as far as their upbringing musically , and their attitude and the stamp they put on a certain phrase . <p> Like ingredients coming together to make a stew ? <p> Yeah ! Its exactly like a stew bro . <p> You have two of your mentors on this new album . Warren obviously , and Derek Trucks . That has to be a rush for you , no ? <p> Man , its crazy ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . <p> You are really blessed . To be so young , and be mentored and helped and work with that level of musicians has to be exciting for you . <p> Its intimidating and scary , and a blast . Its a joy . Its all of that wrapped up into one . Working with Warren and Derek ; I grew up with both of them being heroes of mine . They are really incredible cats ! <p> Besides these two gentlemen , who else really excites you , because your music is like blues , rock , jazz , and soul all rolled into one . Whose music do you admire ? <p> It started with all the great blues artists when I was young , and still listen to today , and I be Jonesing for it . I mean Freddie , Albert , BB , Robert Johnson , and all these cats I was listening to . Willie Dixon the list is endless . At the same time , my grandfather was introducing me to a lot of country artists that were singing to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie Nelson , Merle Haggard they would tell a story . <p> It 's so comparable to the blues ; its just got a twang to it . The correlation I made early on was Hank Williams Sr and Robert Johnson stuff . You could really hear the same inflection within their voices , and the amount of pain these men had gone through was very different , but they were using music as the outlet , or rather the conduit for the pain to flow through . That 's one of the first examples of it that I saw , and its one of the first times that I realized that that 's how I wanted to represent my emotions . <p> At the time , it was unbeknownst to me that I wanted to do it ; I just started doing it . It was n't till later on when I started getting into the Allman Brothers , and I started reading about Duane Allmans philosophies and such . He always talks about music being a way to channel your emotions , instead of having to talk about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning and groaning about their problems . When you flip it and turn it into something for your fellow man to hear , that 's beautiful , then theyll say alright ; theyll take a listen. <p> Absolutely <p> Also : Robin Trower was a big one for me . <p> Bridge of Sighs <p> That 's the one . James Dewars vocals were a big influence on me too . <p> You have a real good sensibility in your chords . Do you listen to any of the old Charlie Parker , Miles Davis , Charlie Christian ; any of that old jazz ? <p> All the time man ! When I was in tenth grade , I had the opportunity to study at the Fine Arts Center in Greenville , SC , and my instructor was Steve Watson . He was a session player out in LA for years and years . He moved back to Greenville in the 90s and started working with the Fine Arts Center . He was my jazz instructor and for two years I worked with him . He turned me on to so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that I started focusing less on guitar players and stopped emulating sounds , but really started working on discovering my own sound . <p> Things have changed quite a bit from when I grew up . What is your take on Spotify and people downloading your music ? And why is it that folks will pay $6 for a cup of coffee , but do n't want to pay 99- to download a song ? <p> All I 'll say is , I just want our music to get to the people ? It goes back to what I said before : As long as I can keep the lights on at my house , and as long as I can continue to do what I love , That 's all that really matters to me . If people are hearing the music and its doing something for them , if they feel compelled to donate to the cause , and help us out however they can , we love that . <p> I do n't really have an opinion on the idea that people are streaming music for free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our shows is that we really try to encourage people to tape the shows because we like to go back and listen to them for our own accounts . We can try to see what we can be doing better . And , people that did n't make it to that particular show that really wanted to be there , they have an opportunity to listen to it later down the line . So , I just think , give the music to the people any way you can . That 's very important to me . <p> Any advice for a young artist coming up ? <p> I guess where I started was , just try to let the instrument become an extension of your mind , as far as being able to represent your emotions through it , just as you would through talking to somebody. - Just get to know that instrument , whatever it may be . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

We use the term , couple , quite literally , as Suzy Starlite and Simon Campbell tied the proverbial knot in 2014 . For Blueberry Pie , they added just the right touches by bringing in shuffle master drummer , Steve Gibson ( Buzzcocks , Van Morrison , Jack Bruce ) ; 2X British Blues Award winning keyboardist , Jonny Henderson ; and Spanish harmonica doyen , Danny Boy S+nchez . With Cambells tight as a tick guitar , Starlites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pie is delicious to the very last . <p> They cover all the bases on this one , beginning with what will surely be the hit track on the album , " Walkin Out the Door .

The wah-wah guitar , heavy ride and bottomless bass begin to conjure the ghosts of Cream . This is what the originators of UK blues took from their American mentors and fabricated into their own distinct genre . The Starlite Campbell Band nailed the sound , on an outstanding original track . <p> All eleven tracks on this offering are originals , written by Starlite and Campbell over the course of just a few months .

Starlite even took the cover photo , a sweet picture of her late grandmother , Betty , that she took in the late 70s . <p> From the haunting , " I Need a Light , " to the dance floor packing , " Your So Good For Me , " to the dulcet acoustic title track , Blueberry Pie , is just what the doctor ordered , diet be damned . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486 
@@61383069 @1383069/ <p> Editors Note:We recently had a rare sit-down with Reverend Peyton , leader of The Reverend Peytons Big Damn Band . In a previous article , we talked with him about their upcoming album , Front Porch Sessions , and World Premiered the single , " One More Thing . " Here , in part two , we talk to Rev about his influences , his thoughts on recording , production , songwriting , and how to save the blues . <p> Reverend Peyton is a big man , from rural Indiana . His specialty , with his Big Damn Band , is country blues . With his feet planted firmly on the ground , and his mind focused on the future , he has some strong opinions on how things should , and should not , be done . <p> With the new album , Front Porch Sessions , about to drop , we had a chance to speak with the " Rev " himself . What we were hoping for , were some quick insights into the album . What we got , was a whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a converted church , " he begins telling us . " It sits next to a big graveyard , and is shaded by the oldest tulip poplar in Indiana . When I first saw the tree , it freaked me out . It does n't  even look like a poplar anymore . They always made log cabins out of poplar , you know , because they 're so straight . But this thing is gnarled and looks like an old maple or oak tree . I saw a picture of the church , taken right after the Civil War , and the tree is in it . Its already big . " <p> At this point , one might wonder why the tree seemed to have more of an impact on him , than the studio . In simple terms , its how he relates to the world around him . Peyton is a straightforward man . Uncomplicated things , that are long-lasting , impress him most . That goes for music , family , and life . <p> One of his earliest influences , Charley Patton , was said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard 500 yards away , without amplification . The Rev , too , was born with a deep , powerful , instrument . " When I really kind of came into my own , and found my voice , its big , " he told us . " For me , its always been kind of a battle . I always say my voice is like wrestling a bear . Its big , and powerful , and its really taken me a while to feel comfortable in it . If you put a microphone right in front of my face , you wo n't hear what 's happening to my voice in that room . You do n't  get all the power and nuances . If I 'm singing in a studio , you have to make sure there 's a microphone kind of far away too . You take those old Charley Patton recordings . He stood there , singing and playing as loud as he could into one microphone . Then all of that , that was happening in an old analog machine , was being scraped into a wax cylinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acoustic guitar sound more electric . It took his voice and just spread it out . That 's what analog tape does . That 's what ribbon mics do . That 's what tube amps do . " <p> A staunch believer in old school methods , and technology , he explained what he meant . " The way I like doing things , the ways I gravitate toward , and the ways that have always seemed to work best for me , are older ways . There 's all kinds of things you can do with music now , to make it sound perfect and clean . I think that messes it up a little bit . Like tube amps . You can plug into a really clean , solid state amp , but why does everyone think that a tube amp sounds better ? Its just old technology and technically , it sounds worse . But , its all of that color . Its all of what 's happening to the notes in a tube amp . That 's why , almost universally , people say , that 's better. I like ribbon mics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think , yeah , this really expensive condenser sounds nice , and clean , and big , but , I like what this old microphone is doing to it . To my ears , it sounds better . As we get away from things like that , we realize that the old way sounded better . " <p> And its not just the recording equipment he s talking about . " Vinyl is making a huge comeback . I was one of those people that by the time I was listening to music , vinyl was n't a thing . It was all CDs and stuff . I mean , I was born in the 80s for Gods sake , so I came into vinyl later . During the resurgence , people were all saying , vinyl is better , and I wondered if it was true . Well , when I first got to hear a vinyl record on a good stereo , I was convinced . It actually is better . There are scientific reasons as to why , but I do n't  think your ears care what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the hertz scale , and the roll-off , but no one cares really . They just want to know if it sounds better or not . " <p> Then , there 's the music . The actual focal point . The reason that artists , of all genres , do what they do . For Rev , again , the simpler , the better . " I 've had a lot of people tell me , well , you do n't  really play blues , ' " he shared with us . " My response to them is , well , I guess Taj Mahal does n't  really play blues either . People get so beholdin to , blues has to be 12 bars , and turn arounds , and triplets , and na-na-na . If it ai n't  that , then they do n't  know what it is . You go back to Charley Patton , and you listen to what he was all about , and it just runs the gamut . I long for the days when the blues had fewer rules . In the pre-war days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought was cool . R.L. Burnside said , blues ai n't  nothin but dance music. I believe that . All American music , blues , jazz , rock n roll , country , hip-hop , it all makes people want to dance and feel good . They want a song to make them feel something . They want a song to speak to them.Thats what I love about Taj Mahal . He s always done what he thought was cool . His feel is amazing . His songwriting is great . He has a mastery of music . He s someone I admire a lot . " <p> With blues music splitting into dozens of sub-genres , does Rev believe it will last ? His answer is as no nonsense as it gets . " I 've always said this , and I 'll say it to you now . There is no blues society that can save blues in America . There is no foundation that can save blues in America . The only thing , that can save blues in America , is blues artists making music that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a show that people want to come to see . That 's it . I had to learn this the hard way . Music people listen differently than people who are just fans of music . A fan of music wont say , oh man , they played the minor third there on the fourth , what an interesting turn. They say , I like that , or I dont. Ultimately you have to make new , good music . I like to hear people put a fresh spin on something . More than that , I like people to tell me their story , in a song . In blues , that 's what we have to do if we want it to keep going . We need to make music that 's true to the roots of things , but is new at the same time . Hopefully , blues in America wises up and gets back to the roots of things . Artists that are out there doing fresh , interesting things , should be championed . It has to be music that people want to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> More than just in music , Peyton strives to bring those values into everyday life . He told us , " I think one of the goals of being a human , is to wake up every morning just trying to be better , in whatever it is you do , and whoever it is that you are . When you stop doing that , I think is when you start to get old , and start to wither away . Me , I 'm still learning . I can promise you one thing . Anything I do is going to be true to my heart . I 'm not going to do anything just because I think it might sell a record . The only thing I 'll ever release is going to be hand-made , from the heart stuff . " <p> " Over the years , I 've encountered certain artists , that just love music , even though they 've been at it for a long time , " he says with dogged determination . " I just hope that when I 'm an old man , that I still feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded yet . " <p> He left us with something that should resonate with artists of all types . " If you like real , from the heart , hand-made music , made by people , about people , then we are definitely a band for you . There 's no putting on airs , there 's no pretending this , that , or the other . We do n't  have a scene . There 's no dress code at our shows . I 'm really proud of that , and I 'm going to keep on doing it . I guarantee . Handshake , pinkie swear , hand on a Bible , for as long as I 'm doing this , its all were ever going to do .

The band delivers and so does Fish , whose playing grows by leaps and bounds with every passing album , as does as her writing . The new album covers everything from rock to blues , and soul to swing . Two songs in , she has the crowd in the palm of her hand . <p> Taking the stage following Fish is Chicago sensation and CTA bus driver Toronzo Cannon .

He , and his group , the NOLA Blues Trio , play six days a week at the Jazz Cafe in the French Quarter . In addition , This Silence is Killing Me , on his own JCP label , was his second release of 2016 . <p> Chaz is known as the " Bourbon Street Bluesman , " even though he has n't  performed there in years . Born in Lake Charles and raised in Creole , Louisiana , he made The Crescent City his home in 1997 . A talented multi-instrumentalist , he previously toured with artists including Jerry Lee Lewis , and Albert King , spent time in California , and several years in Memphis , where he really learned to play the blues . Performing in several small , predominantly black , blues clubs , he learned to sing Gospel as well . He won the very first Beale Street Blues Award , and sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Civil Rights Museum . <p> These days , his music is a combination of two delightful musical recipes . As he says , " It is Memphis barbecue meeting up with New Orleans gumbo . " This Silence is Killing Me , is a prime example of that , offering eleven original pieces of blues , soul , and R&amp;B . <p> The opening number , " Savin Everything For You , " is a true , blues revue , swing number with Chaz guitar out front . A killer horn section , made up of A. J. Pittman , Michael Genevay , and Ward Smith , provide the perfect backing . Chaz voice is in fine form . Its both clear and strong , even after years of 300 plus shows . <p> Other artists on the album include Doug Therrien on bass , Doug Belote on drums , and Michael Skinkus on percussion .

Take a listen to " Fried Chicken Store , " or " The Backwash Blues , " to hear for yourself what we mean .

Their second CD release , Last Night on Cherokee , is taking them back to their funky , greasy , South City roots , as well as bringing them full circle in their career , thus far . We recently got to talk to members Doug Byrkit and Brian Zielie about their music , their careers , both on stage and in the classroom , their connections with the South side of " The Lou , " and their common infatuation with Stephen King . <p> While both are songwriters , Byrkit is the lead vocalist and plays bass and guitar , while Zielie plays drums and supplies backup vocals . Both studied music in college and are currently teachers . They spent years recording and touring with various artists , including former band mate , Mike Zito , and their 2012 release , Dark Matters , was an award winner , garnering them multiple television network licensing deals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who convinced the guys to , " delve deeper into their South St. Louis funk/blues roots . " The songwriting began , the album emerged , and the restwell , well let them tell you the rest . <p> JD Nash for American Blues Scene : Odds Lane . Where does the name come from ? <p> Brian : <p> At our age , we 've been through a lot of bands , with a lot of names . So , finding names is always not a fun part of the job . We ran out of fresh stuff a long time ago . But , were both big fans of Stephen Kings book series , The Dark Tower . Our prior iteration of this band was called , The Breakers , which was based on something from his book . When it came time to come up with a name for this band , we basically went through the encyclopedia of that book series until we found a phrase from the book that sounded cool . Odds Lane was the name of a street in the seventh book of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years we 've been trying to pick band names , and when we came up with The Breakers , we thought , Yeah , we found it ! Were both Stephen King fans , and its not a musical thing but still it sounds cool. When we found that name , it was like the beginning of the internet , and there was another band , in Denmark , that had the same name . A few years went by and we ended up getting an email from Little Steven Van Zandts record company , Wicked Cool Records , who had signed the Denmark Breakers to their label . He comes calling , saying , Hey , I want to buy your name , and we said , ok. We had spent so much time picking that name , that we really liked due to the history , and the book series , and were musicians , but were also nerdy , odd balls at the same time . Then Brian finally found Odds Lane , and I agreed to it . <p> Ok , I have to ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a record label owner , or his Sopranos character ? <p> Brian and Doug ( laughing ) : <p> He did n't  contact us himself , he had a goombah do it . Come to think of it that would have been a cooler way to do it . You want to sell me that name . That 's what you want to do. <p> You guys recorded at Sun Records once ? <p> Doug : <p> Yeah , not this record , but back in 2005 . They actually called us . It was through the Memphis Grammy chapter , and Sun was doing a thing to help up and coming bands . They invited us down to record , put us up in a hotel , and it was this whole crazy weekend . <p> What about your first album , Dark Matters in 2012 ? <p> Doug : <p> That was recorded in kind of a hodgepodge of places , mostly at one of the colleges I teach at in Godfrey , Illinois . <p> Listening to Last Night on Cherokee , some of the lyrics seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King coming out ? <p> Doug : <p> Our collective sense of humor is dark . Were not just brooding around all the time , but things we find funny , things we find interesting . I mean , were not dressing up as vampires or anything . Its not a goth band . But everybody has demons to deal with . It may be my back hurts , or I cant pay the mortgage . But our way sounds a little more artsy. And it gives us a way to deal with old roots rock and blues themes that we like . <p> Brian : <p> A lot of the darkness , or the stuff that sounds more literal , like the clowns or the demons , are way more figurative . We do n't  mean any of those things literally . It sounds a lot cooler to talk about demons coming for your soul , than , I 'm 40 and my shoulder hurts. <p> Now , where does the title , Last Night on Cherokee come from ? <p> Doug : <p> Its one of the lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third track on the album . But the whole idea of the album , that song , and that lyric , kind of sums up what we were doing with this record in general . Were re-discovering stuff we had an interest in a long time ago . We kind of strayed away from it , but somehow found our way back . It has a lot to do with the music we were doing when we lived in South City . Cherokee is a South St. Louis street , kind of known for being the steamier side of South City . We were in a band , years ago , with Mike Zito , and we all lived in a house together down there . We kind of lost touch with Mike for a while , then we got back in touch with him , did a couple reunion shows , and got back into that style we were playing back then . Stuff from the Blue Room album , and that kind of stuff . The title suggests that we 've come full circle back to that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think its a subconscious double entendre . Last night meaning , literally things that happened last night . Or like , the final night and our return to it . <p> In the songwriting department , do you do that together ? <p> Doug : <p> Its a collaborative process . The process is usually me coming up with some kind of lyric or melody . I send it over to Brian , who makes some changes , and then we just go back and forth until its something we agree on . This time though , it was a bit different . We 'd come up with a basic riff , and then we 'd jam on it for twenty minutes to see what would happen . We recorded the jam and then would play it back , making changes until it was right . Doing the recording , we wanted it to have a live feel . But in the writing process , we wanted to spend as much time as we could on everything before we went into the studio . <p> So Doug , on this album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yeah . Again , kind of different . On the last album we had a few more people filling in the gaps . But this record , its just us . I mean , the band is just us two anyway . When we play live , well hire a bass player . One thing we 've always been known for is playing drums and bass really well together . This time , I decided , for this record , to do both . <p> Brian : <p> I pretty much just play the drums , and do some background vocals , but I 'm not as multi-talented as Doug . I mean , unlike Doug , I 'm only terrible at one instrument . He s awful at several . That would be a more accurate representation . <p> Youre signed with Bongo Boy Records . Thats kind of different for them . Theyre known more for compilation albums , right ? <p> Doug : <p> They do a lot of compilation stuff , but one of the heads of the label , Gar , is an old blues guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CBGB days , but he s really into roots and blues . I mean , if you listen to his guitar playing , he s a blues player . They do n't  always get that kind of stuff to put out , so they really took a shine to us . It really makes us a big fish in a small pond . <p> Knowing what we now know about the new release , is it a story album ? <p> Doug : <p> No . Its not a really a concept album , in that way . All of the songs kind of relate , in a fashion . They do n't  necessarily all relate lyrically , but musically speaking , they all relate to that time period . Youd really have to know us and know Blue Room , inside and out , to really catch everything . But there 's a connection all the way through . Its not a book , but its more of a vibe or feeling . <p> This is your sophomore release as Odds Lane ? <p> Doug : <p> Weve recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . This is our sophomore project , and I think , our best . Not just because its the newest . We 've already begun writing songs for another album , but this one sounds like us . I think we 've found the right balance between all of our really eclectic musical interests . I think this is probably what we sound like , and that 's something we 've been looking for , for a long time . You ca n't pigeon hole us . One of the biggest compliments , and one of the biggest complaints we get from other people , is You guys just do n't  really sound like anybody else. Trying to sell , that can be a big issue , but we also take it as a really big compliment . <p> Brian : <p> It just occurred to me . This record in particular , the conscious decision to get back to our roots , because of our reconnect with Mike , and other factors , is the first record where we 've stopped trying to avoid those things . Instead of a conscious effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally , this is what happened . We stopped trying to say , well , this is too bluesy , or that 's gon na be too funky. This time we decided to just play . And in that we realized , oh yeah , this is who we are . <p> Are you touring the album now ? <p> Doug : <p> We are playing some localized Midwest shows , but the label is working on booking a bunch of East Coast gigs and once were out there , well pick up other shows . <p> What should people know about Odds Lane ? <p> Doug : <p> If I had to sum it up : People should know that were honest musicians , and honestly , that 's what we do . Our music is our personality . Like the old jazz players . Sometimes the personality was almost more important than the music . If you listen to our record , you 'll know something about us . The music that we make , that 's honest . That 's us . That 's what we do . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

It was arguably one of the key factors in shaping music and culture in modern times . Almost everyone has heard the stories of friends or strangers hearing a song on the jukebox and then asking others what or who the song is and then that person rushing out to get the music for themselves .

The term " jukebox " came into use in the United States around 1940 , derived from the familiar usage " juke joint " , derived from the Gullah word " juke " or " joog " meaning disorderly , rowdy , or wicked . <p> We know that one of the first music-for-money playing devices was invented by Louis Glass in San Francisco . Glass was an innovator , and somewhere around 1879 , hed gotten burned out working with old technologies , so he left his cushy job manning the telegraph lines for Western Union . He knew that he wanted in on this new craze sweeping the nation and that was the telephone , so he invested in some of the phone companies in both the Bay area and Southern California and rose to become the general manager of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company . <p> Glass was n't satisfied with just the telephone , however . Thomas Edison had invented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glass took over the reigns of Pacific Phonograph Co. as well as some other phonograph companies in the coastal states of Washington , Oregon and of course the aforementioned California . But it was in the city by the bay that he had the big idea the one that would be forever in our hearts and become a massive icon , still revered by avid " Jukebox " collectors today . <p> The 44 year-old Glass , with his partner William S. Arnold , presented a device that would play a song from a wax cylinder phonograph but here 's the catch ; only if you put a nickel in the machine . That first machine was called the " The nickel-in-the-slot phonograph " ! <p> The first machine was installed at Palais Royal Saloon in San Francisco on November 23 , 1889 exactly 124 years ago today . Glasss office was a mere two blocks away and he asked the bar manager if he could display the new-fangled machine to the public there . Not much is known about that first machine , as this establishment went under somewhere around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around there , but during the first year of the jukebox , from autumn 1889 until summer 1890 , quite a few coin-operated music machines were produced in that area . During a conference in Chicago in 1890 , Louis T. Glass brashly told other operators and manufacturers that the first 15 machines had brought in a little more than $4,000 from December , 1889 , until May , 1890 . That was quite a tidy sum in those days , so its easy to see why competitors scrambled to get in on the action . <p> Throughout the next several decades , the look and operational mechanisms of the nickel-in-the-slot phonograph changed to meet the demand . Manufacturers sprung up all over the world , as the idea had caught fire elsewhere . In fact , a similar idea to Glasss was born over in London at nearly the same time , maybe even a bit earlier , but it is still Glass who is credited with the title of " inventor of the jukebox " . <p> Casebeer 's first introduction to music was Elvis .

It was arguably one of the key factors in shaping music and culture in modern times . Almost everyone has heard the stories of friends or strangers hearing a song on the jukebox and then asking others what or who the song is and then that person rushing out to get the music for themselves . The famous image of " The Fonz " is forever etched in our minds as the master of that amazing music machine that gloriously spit out just the right song , at just the right time and occasionally the wrong song at the wrong time . <p> The classic jukebox is an automated music-playing machine .

The term " jukebox " came into use in the United States around 1940 , derived from the familiar usage " juke joint " , derived from the Gullah word " juke " or " joog " meaning disorderly , rowdy , or wicked . <p> We know that one of the first music-for-money playing devices was invented by Louis Glass in San Francisco . Glass was an innovator , and somewhere around 1879 , hed gotten burned out working with old technologies , so he left his cushy job manning the telegraph lines for Western Union . He knew that he wanted in on this new craze sweeping the nation and that was the telephone , so he invested in some of the phone companies in both the Bay area and Southern California and rose to become the general manager of the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company . <p> Glass was n't satisfied with just the telephone , however . Thomas Edison had invented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glass took over the reigns of Pacific Phonograph Co. as well as some other phonograph companies in the coastal states of Washington , Oregon and of course the aforementioned California . But it was in the city by the bay that he had the big idea the one that would be forever in our hearts and become a massive icon , still revered by avid " Jukebox " collectors today . <p> The 44 year-old Glass , with his partner William S. Arnold , presented a device that would play a song from a wax cylinder phonograph but here 's the catch ; only if you put a nickel in the machine . That first machine was called the " The nickel-in-the-slot phonograph " ! <p> The first machine was installed at Palais Royal Saloon in San Francisco on November 23 , 1889 exactly 124 years ago today . Glasss office was a mere two blocks away and he asked the bar manager if he could display the new-fangled machine to the public there .

Glass brashly told other operators and manufacturers that the first 15 machines had brought in a little more than $4,000 from December , 1889 , until May , 1890 . That was quite a tidy sum in those days , so its easy to see why competitors scrambled to get in on the action . <p> Throughout the next several decades , the look and operational mechanisms of the nickel-in-the-slot phonograph changed to meet the demand . Manufacturers sprung up all over the world , as the idea had caught fire elsewhere . In fact , a similar idea to Glasss was born over in London at nearly the same time , maybe even a bit earlier , but it is still Glass who is credited with the title of " inventor of the jukebox " . <p> Casebeer 's first introduction to music was Elvis .

@@61383105 @1383105/ <h> Celebrating the Genius of Sam Cooke , " Mister Soul " , After 50 Years <p> Sam Cooke was a great many things ; a pioneer , a civil rights activist , a successful businessman , and an unmatched singer of such legendary proportions that even fifty years- later , singers of all degrees of fame and listeners of music alike still look upon his songs with absolute reverence . The man known as " Mister Soul " defined a new generation of music , combining the warm , rich history of gospel with the raw emotion of the blues to create a music that still reverberates perhaps now as much as ever . <p> Today , December 11th , marks fifty years to the day that Cooke tragically passed away far before his time under unusual- circumstances that are still mired in some degree of controversy . What Cooke- managed to accomplish in just- 33 years , however , is truly legendary and paints the picture of a man born destined for greatness . <p> The Clarksdale , Mississippi native got his start singing in the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , began his professional career with The Soul Stirrers , one of the most celebrated gospel groups to exist ( and one that continues to this day ) . Sam was quickly a hit , popularizing gospel for a new audience but the handsome 510 " singer- was too big for the gospel circuit and he knew it . In 1957 , he released " You Send Me " , which immediately shot to #1 on both the Pop and R&amp;B charts . But unlike many of the musicians and norms of the time , Sam firmly took control of his own career , forming a record label and publishing company so that his works would remain under his own control . It turned out to be a move filled with foresight : the hits kept rolling in- for Cooke , one after the next . Meanwhile , his label signed future stars like Johnnie Taylor and Bobby Womack . <p> Cookes- amazingly powerful , silky and stirring vocals were- unlike anything else before or since ; - his charisma captivated the world. - He pumped out hit after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bring it on Home To Me " , and many more that even half a century after his death- continue to remain staples on radio playlists across the world a firm sign of the rarified timeless nature of his work . <p> Cookes live performances were nothing short of legend ; The hit 2001 movie Ali , - starring Will Smith , even opened with a complete recreation of Cookes live performance of " Bring it on Home To Me , " taken from one of the most powerful posthumous releases in recorded history : - Sam Cooke : - Live at the Harlem Square Club , - released in 1985 by RCA Records . The album gratefully comes complete full- crowd noise ; screaming , raucious , absolutely captivated fans . For his part , Cooke effortlessly and flawlessly controls the crowd with his very presence. - A year and a month before The Beatles famously touched down , the women in Live- shrieked at the top of their lungs , almost to the point of fainting when Sam hits the- magical opening notes to his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines . The party at the Harlem Square Club on the night of January 12th , 1963 was euphoric and loud , excited and elated . Nobody had experienced a performance ( or a performer ) like this , and its never more obvious than in the grooves of the album that , despite being released two decades after his passing and three decades ago , continues to be placed at the top of any self-respecting " best of live albums " list . <p> On the evening of December 11th , 1964 , Cooke left a bar , famously frequented by the Rat Pack , - on the Santa Monica Blvd- in L.A. with a woman hed met earlier in the night. - Driving his late-model Ferrari , a heavily drunk Cooke and the- young , self-described aspiring model went to the Motel Hacienda in L.A.s gritty south central neighborhood .

The world mourned his- stunning passing , with tens of thousands of visitors coming to pay respects. - Ray Charles sang at his funeral . <p> Eleven days after his killing , - Cook bestowed upon the world arguably the most powerful Civil Rights song ever put to music : - " A Change is Gon na Come " .

Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of racism himself while touring. - " Change " was- not a pop hit like many of Cookes previous releases , nor did it need to be .

By the time he was 23 he had already begun playing guitar with the Chatmon family , and later on he would perform with Willie Brown as well . By the age of 29 , he had made his first recording , and all in , he would make almost 70 recordings . <p> Patton was known for his raw , ruckus playing style , along with his guttural vocals and expressively delivering any lyric .

" As if that wasnt enough , there are an additional 14 tracks with greats such as Son House , Howlin Wolf , John Lee Hooker , Muddy Waters , Big Joe Williams , Brownie McGhee .

Actually playing the music performed here is quite involved once listeners really begin to pay attention and take it all in . Its the same as trying to play Muddy Waters music . Sure , one can play it , maybe even really well , with fervor , and competence , but it is the little things that prove so hard : reproducing those micro-tones , and the minute changes in timing , pitch , and tone . <p> It is these aspects of finesse that are what make these players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many hours of satisfying listening pleasure ; to not have this in a great blues collection would be a serious omission . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Ford Motor Company built the Model T from 1908 to 1927 and it is considered the most influential car of the 20th century . It was Fords first automobile mass-produced on moving assembly lines with completely interchangeable parts , marketed to the middle class . However , there is no link between the vehicle and the artist .

Although no details are available concerning the exact year of the Packard , it was described as old , even in 1937 , with a wooden frame and wooden roof and supports . This would play into the cause of her death . As Morgan tried to brake and swerve around a slow moving truck ahead of them , the Packard hit the rear of the truck almost broadside on the passenger side , shearing the wooden top off the car and nearly severing Smiths arm which had been out the passenger window . The collision also caused major injuries to Smiths ribs and possibly other internal organs as Morgan was thrown into her at the time of the collision . <p> 6 .

" Originally called the Essex-Terraplane , the vehicle was built by Hudson Motor Car Company from 1932 to 1938 . Due to the popularity of aviation at the time , along with its modest price tag , the Terraplane combined style and power that was affordable during the Great Depression . Although Johnson would bemoan the mechanical issues of his Terraplane , they had the highest horsepower-to-weight ratio of any production automobile and were the favored cars of several gangsters of the day , including John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson .

It has since been covered by The Rascals , Sam &amp; Dave , Buddy Guy , Bruce Springsteen , Los Lobos and nearly every bar band in the world .

When the car was returned , Richards was able to save most of the original paint underneath . This was Joplins every day car and soon became a familiar sight in the San Francisco area , with many fans leaving her notes under the windshield wipers . After her death , the car went first to her manager , Albert Grossman , and then to Joplins siblings . Her brother rebuilt the engine and again , restored the vehicle to its original gray color . In the 1990s a decision was made to restore the psychedelic paint job and artists Jana Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photographs .

The Bluesmobile <p> According to the hit 1980 movie , The Blues Brothers , the original " Bluesmobile " owned by the band was a Cadillac . During " Joliet Jake " Blues stint in prison , his brother Elwood traded that car for a microphone . Upon Jakes release , Elwood picked him up in the new " Bluesmobile , " a 1974 Dodge Monaco sedan , that he had purchased at the Mount Prospect police auction .

He was well received there , and King suggested the band to Sam Phillips , owner of Sun Studios in Memphis , Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band needed an original song . It was saxophonist , Jackie Brenston , who suggested a song about the Oldsmobile Rocket 88 automobile that had been recently released and was very popular . The song was written in the Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale , recorded at Sun , and credited to Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats . Released on the Chess Records label in April , 1951 , the song went to Number 1 on the Billboard R&amp;B charts . Due to a damaged amplifier , it features one of the first uses of distortion or " fuzz " guitar , and as such , has strong claims to being the first Rock N Roll record . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Their take on the St. Louis Jimmy Oden tune , " Goin Down Slow , " is spot on , as is the slow drag of Lightnin Hopkins " Black Cat Bone , " which has many times been covered in a harder , blues rock style . <p> These two compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly , with Walklate making use of diatonic , chromatic and tremolo harps .

Its something that takes a moment to catch , the nuance is so nicely done . <p> All in all , this is an impressive collection . The entire offering is recorded in a way that sounds as if the duo is on stage in your favorite club . If we had two wishes regarding Kicking Up the Dust , they would be another original song or two , and perhaps some vocal harmonies from Walklate and Fuschi . <p> If you 're a fan of early Muddy Waters , Howlin Wolf , Little Walter , and the rest of the Chess crew , you 're going to feel right at home with this one . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

What would it be like to do this with someone that played with the likes of Robert Johnson , Big Joe Williams , Johnny Shines , Tommy Johnson , and Charley Patton ? <p> David " Honeyboy " Edwards was just such a person . He had " toured " and played with a number of artists revered as pioneers of the blues , and he had been their friend as well .

As we watch , is apparent how much Dale and his band are enjoying themselves . <p> From a historical standpoint , this set is such a gift . To be able to witness Edwards playing this music is at once both breathtaking , and satisfying . We are reminded that Edwards and his contemporaries were the minstrels of their day , and they did not simply sing songs , they performed stories for their audiences .

" The last track , " Honeyboy Tells You Somethin That He Knows , " has Edwards offering advice , talking about the very night that Robert Johnson died , the death of Charlie Patton , and other antidotes about the likes of Johnson , Hubert Sumlin , Big Walter Horton and many more . <p> The DVD is a visual treasure , and the matching CD is of excellent quality . <p> For those who claim to be blues devotees , I 'm Gon na Tell You Somethin That I Know is a " got ta have " for their collection .

Imagine then , our pleasant surprise when we received a copy of the new album , Kicking Up the Dust , by UK singer and harmonica player , Mat Walklate and Sicilian guitarist/vocalist , Paolo Fuschi . <p> Europe has long been a hotbed of American blues music . Scores of artists have toured across the pond for decades and left an indelible mark on the music scene there . The British Invasion of some 50 years ago was made up of groups , influenced by the blues , making it their own , and then returning it to the US .

You could not only hear , but feel , the classic vibe of tube amplifiers and vintage microphones . <p> All but one of the 10 tracks are covers of songs from those glory days . Their take on the St. Louis Jimmy Oden tune , " Goin Down Slow , " is spot on , as is the slow drag of Lightnin Hopkins " Black Cat Bone , " which has many times been covered in a harder , blues rock style . <p> These two compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly , with Walklate making use of diatonic , chromatic and tremolo harps .

Something else , very unique , to this collection is their subtle addition of another genre into the otherwise quintessential blues . With a tip of the hat to the Afro-Caribbean populace of Manchester , they mix a hint of Ska into these tracks . Its something that takes a moment to catch , the nuance is so nicely done . <p> All in all , this is an impressive collection . The entire offering is recorded in a way that sounds as if the duo is on stage in your favorite club . If we had two wishes regarding Kicking Up the Dust , they would be another original song or two , and perhaps some vocal harmonies from Walklate and Fuschi . <p> If you 're a fan of early Muddy Waters , Howlin Wolf , Little Walter , and the rest of the Chess crew , you 're going to feel right at home with this one . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61383165 @1383165/ <p> When the Levee Breaks- is a widely famous and popular blues song dating all the way back to an unprecedented flood that- devastated Mississippi- in the 1920s . Since then , the track has continued to weave its way into popular culture , solidifying its place in music history thanks to one of the most iconic rock bands of all time . <p> Levees were a particularly common theme among the original delta bluesmen . For those unfamiliar with living close to a river , levees are giant mounds of packed dirt , built along the river ways , so during a flood , the water does n't  immediately spill into the towns and farms . If a river floods too long and too much , however , levees can become saturated and break . If the water level becomes too high , it can flow over the top of a levee . <p> Levees were and continue to be an everyday way of life in the Mississippi delta , - a several-hundred mile area of upper Mississippi that is extremely flat and historically prone to flooding by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi swelled to enormous proportions , smashing through levees and seeping billions of gallons of floodwater into the area , destroying towns , homes , farms , and everything in its path . Residents of the delta , ( many African-Americans reportedly at gunpoint , ) scrambled to build more levees higher . People took shelter on top of levees , the only high points in the area . Desperate measures eventually failed and the swollen river broke through levees , killing hundreds and causing the most expensive natural disaster in American History . Afterwards , conditions worsened . Without a crop to farm , many blacks , who 's only available means of employment in the deeply racist south was often sharecropping , had no jobs and no means of income . Many of their modest homes , rented to them by plantation owners , were gone . A great deal of African-Americans were left defenseless &amp; penniless in ramshackle levee camp tents with no food , no money , and no roofs . As a result , most had no choice but to leave for the North in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original bluesmen sang about the terrible conditions of the levee " camps " , including Son House and countless prison workers , several recorded by Alan Lomax , but none so famous as Memphis Minnie , who along with Kansas Joe McCoy , recorded " When The Levee Breaks " two years after what became known as the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 . The song was played in a loose ragtime style , with the narrator worrying about what will happen if the levee that protects him and his home is washed away . <p> If it keeps on rainin levees- goin to break If it keeps on rainin levees goin to break And the water gon na come in , well have no place to stay Well all last night I sat on the levee and moan Well all last night I sat on the levee and moan Thinkin bout my baby and my happy home <p> Levee continued to be a standalone snapshot , depicting the fear and damage of the flood from a first-person perspective for four decades before its explosion in popularity . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unprecedented meteoric fame , went into the studio to record their fourth album . Much of their musical library thus far had been heavily based on original delta blues , about which the band members were fanatical . A mournful , forty-year old song on breaking levees in the Mississippi Delta was a natural fit . <p> The band set up in Headley Grange , a house-turned-studio , and famously placed John Bonhams drums in a hallway/stairwell which captured a unique " heaviness " that has since been repeated ( and sampled ) countless times . As the band fed the music to the on-loan Rolling Stones mobile recording van outside , they played a slow-burning , goosebump-raising cover of Levee , adding a haunting , backwards-echoed harmonica and subtly bringing in new sounds every twelve bars . The track became a massive hit and nearly immediately solidified the songs place in music culture . <p> Since their 1970 release , the song has given rise to countless different interpretations and variations .

Terry Dolans unreleased , self-titled , 1972 Warner Bros. album will hit the streets on November 25th , 2016 . <p> By 1968 , Terry Dolan had become a fixture at hip San Francisco clubs like the Matrix and Keystone Korner , and was soon playing colleges , festivals and larger concert venues , opening for big names , including B.B. King , Elvin Bishop , Blue Cheer , and Taj Mahal . However , Dolan never achieved the mega-stardom of many of his peers from the 1960s San Francisco rock scene . One of the reasons for this was Warner Bros. inexplicable cancellation of his superb self-titled , debut album , a mere two months before its release date . This lost- gem is finally getting its due with a release on High Moon Records ( Vinyl &amp; CD ) on- November 25th. - Terry Dolan , - featuring- an all star cast- " - including Nicky Hopkins ( The Rolling Stones , The Kinks ) , John Cipollina ( Quicksilver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Band ) and Neal Schon ( Santana , Journey ) - " - is the missing link between the increasingly electric instrumentation of the San Francisco singer-songwriters , and the era of 70s arena rock gods . The album captures the dual nature of Terry himself , an East Coast folkie with a penchant for soul-stirring rock n roll , his music is equally influenced by Leadbelly , Buddy Holly , and the late-60s San Francisco rock scene . Amazingly , the chemistry captured on the album 's eight- indelible- tracks , and six bonus tracks , have never seen the light of day , until now . <p> The conception of- Terry Dolan- is a story in two parts , and about two producers ; one for each side of this unreleased masterpiece : <p> Side A : - Terry Dolan moved to San Francisco from Weston , Connecticut- in- 1965 , at the tender age of 21 , and quickly made a name for himself with his wild , electric energy and passionate performances . Based on the strength of a demo for his song " Inlaws &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with Warner Bros. in 1971. - Dolan tapped renowned , British session pianist Hopkins to produce , ( the only time he ever did so for another artist ) , and play keyboards on the album .

Greg Douglass ( who would go on to co-write " Jungle Love " with Turner , and join The Steve Miller Band ) and John Cipollina ( from the pioneering- Quicksilver- Messenger- Service ) , - shared guitar duties . Rounding out the group were and June , Bonnie , and Anita Pointer , aka The Pointer Sisters , singing backing vocals . The ensuing sessions created the mix of folk-infused , high-octane rock that became the Terry Dolan sound , but with only four of the album 's eight songs tracked and mixed , Hopkins was called on tour by The Rolling Stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - The unexpected departure of the producer/pianist Hopkins was a major setback , but Dolan found a solution the the form of Pete Sears , another virtuoso Englishman who 's numerous credits included Rod Stewart 's early solo albums . Sears would produce the album 's second side and brought on guitarist Neal Schon , who would soon co-found Journey , and drummer David Weber . Greg Douglass returned on guitar . Even considering the six-month break and pressure from Warner Bros , it is no stretch to call Sears the " secret weapon " of Dolan 's unreleased debut album . He shepherded the final four tracks and arranged the album into a cohesive and dynamic release . By September 1972 , the album was completed and Warner 's assigned it a catalog number : BS 2669 . The record was slated for a February , 1973 release , however , with no explanation ever provided , just two months before it was to hit the record racks of the world , the album was cancelled , and Dolan was dropped by the label . Adding insult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . He was naturally devastated , but determined to forge ahead . <p> Less than six months after being dropped by Warner 's , Dolan formed Terry &amp; The Pirates , who 's revolving and evolving lineup ( featuring many of the musicians on his record ) became a beloved fixture of the Bay Area music scene over the next 30 years . When he passed away on January 15th , 2012 , Dolans unreleased album had still only been heard by a handful of people . Now , 43 years later , the music still brims with soul and passion , and with this first-time-ever release of Terry Dolan 's debut album , the world can finally hear how those early sessions , along with- the friendships , collaborations , and glorious hours of music they spawned over the years , still echo across the ages . <p> " An historic gem " incredible that WB left it on the vine .

@@61383203 @1383203/ <h> 10 Things You Did n't  Know About Magic Sam <p> Editors Note : Tomorrow marks the 47th anniversary of the all-too-early death of a West Side Chicago guitar master . In honor of his gifted influence on the world of electric blues music , we offer 10 things you may not know about Samuel Maghett , better known to the world as Magic Sam . <p> 1 . Samuel Gene Maghett was born in Grenada County , Mississippi on February 14th , 1937 , but his birthplace now lies submerged beneath Grenada Lake . He spent his youngest years in Hendersonville , and that town , along with Redgrass and Graysport , were flooded when he was still very young . The Army Corps of Engineers constructed a total of four lakes to help control flooding along the Yazoo River Basin as a direct result of the Great Flood of 1927 . <p> 2 . Willie Dixon once said , " Most of the guys were playing the straight 12-bar blues thing , but the harmonies that he carried with the chords was a different thing altogether . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his youth . Where Sam was raised , square dances and fiddle music were the popular fare of the African American communities . When he first moved to Chicago , blues guitarist Syl Johnson , who was his next door neighbor , helped teach him blues and boogie music which he adapted into his already , " hillbilly style . " <p> 3 . While there is some debate about when Magic Sam actually moved to the Windy City , ( Wikipedia states 1956 , while his Mississippi Blues Trail marker and Syl Johnson both say six years earlier ) , there is no argument that he was already an accomplished guitarist when he arrived . He spent hours in his youth creating and playing diddley bows , cigar box guitars , and anything with strings that he could play . His obsession with music far outweighed his interest in farming with his share cropper family , which garnered him whippings , and later beatings , from his father . Neighbors eventually reached out to members of Maghetts family in Chicago , and his Aunt Lily , along with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harris , intervened and brought the young man North . <p> 4 . Even at his tender age , Magic Sam wasted no time in diving headlong into the music scene upon his arrival . Whether it was in the Maxwell Street Market or the notorious blues clubs of the time , he was known to cut heads with the likes of Muddy Waters , Elmore James , Freddie King , and Bo Diddley . He learned the Chicago style and combined it with his hillbilly musical roots , the sounds of the Delta , and even some Memphis influences , which created , in him , a force to be reckoned with . <p> 5 . While the major sound of Chicagos electric blues of the 50s and 60s was coming from the citys South Side , artists such as Magic Sam , Otis Rush and Buddy Guy were the vanguards of a new movement . These were the creators of the West Side sound , which brought screaming electric guitars to the forefront of the music . Although Guy and Rush may have been more flamboyant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top string bends , combined with a voice that could make the great Bobby " Blue " Bland cry , brought a power and soulful feeling never before heard .

Rock and Roll was the music of the time , and Sam struggled for several years . He was also the victim of horrendous management throughout his career . <p> 7 . In 1962 , he made an " electrifying " entrance to the stage . It was during a Muddy Waters performance at the original Alex Club , on Chicagos West Side . Waters called for the young man to join him on the stage , and in his haste , Sam tripped over an electric cord and sent sparks flying . Delmark Records founder , Bob Koester , was in the audience that night , and later said , " His playing and singing were even more electrifying .

He was finally believing in himself and his abilities once again . After recording this second LP for Koester and company , he not only thought it was the best album hed ever recorded , he said that it was , " the best album I 've heard . " Recorded in October and November of 1968 , Black Magic was released just days before Sams death . <p> 9 . When it came to " Magic " in Chicago , Sam was n't the only one to bear that name .

Just when things were finally looking up for Magic Sam , he died , suddenly , of a heart attack on December 1st , 1969 , at the age of 32 .

@@61383206 @1383206/ <h> Singer Whitney Houston Dead at 48 <p> LOS ANGELES ( AP ) " Whitney Houston , who reigned as pop musics queen until her majestic voice and regal image were ravaged by drug use , erratic behavior and a tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown , has died . She was 48 . <p> Publicist Kristen Foster said Saturday that the singer had died , but the cause and the location of her death were unknown . <p> At her peak , Houston the golden girl of the music industry . From the middle 1980s to the late 1990s , she was one of the worlds best-selling artists . She wowed audiences with effortless , powerful , and peerless vocals that were rooted in the black church but made palatable to the masses with a pop sheen . <p> Her success carried her beyond music to movies , where she starred in hits like The Bodyguard and Waiting to Exhale . <p> She had the he perfect voice , and the perfect image : a gorgeous singer who had sex appeal but was never overtly sexual , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger singers , from Christina Aguilera to Mariah Carey , who when she first came out sounded so much like Houston that many thought it was Houston . <p> But by the end of her career , Houston became a stunning cautionary tale of the toll of drug use . Her album sales plummeted and the hits stopped coming ; her once serene image was shattered by a wild demeanor and bizarre public appearances . She confessed to abusing cocaine , marijuana and pills , and her once pristine voice became raspy and hoarse , unable to hit the high notes as she had during her prime . <p> " The biggest devil is me . I 'm either my best friend or my worst enemy , " Houston told ABCs Diane Sawyer in an infamous 2002 interview with then-husband Brown by her side . <p> It was a tragic fall for a superstar who was one of the top-selling artists in pop music history , with more than 55 million records sold in the United States alone . <p> She seemed to be born into greatness . She was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s pop diva Dionne Warwick and the goddaughter of Aretha Franklin . <p> Houston first started singing in the church as a child . In her teens , she sang backup for Chaka Khan , Jermaine Jackson and others , in addition to modeling . It was around that time when music mogul Clive Davis first heard Houston perform . <p> " The time that I first saw her singing in her mothers act in a club it was such a stunning impact , " Davis told Good Morning America . <p> " To hear this young girl breathe such fire into this song . I mean , it really sent the proverbial tingles up my spine , " he added . <p> Before long , the rest of the country would feel it , too . Houston made her album debut in 1985 with " Whitney Houston , " which sold millions and spawned hit after hit . Saving All My Love for You brought her her first Grammy , for best female pop vocal . How Will I Know , You Give Good Love and The Greatest Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album , " Whitney , " came out in 1987 and included hits like Where Do Broken Hearts Go and I Wan na Dance With Somebody . <p> The New York Times wrote that Houston " possesses one of her generations most powerful gospel-trained voices , but she eschews many of the churchier mannerisms of her forerunners . She uses ornamental gospel phrasing only sparingly , and instead of projecting an earthy , tearful vulnerability , communicates cool self-assurance and strength , building pop ballads to majestic , sustained peaks of intensity . " <p> Her decision not to follow the more soulful inflections of singers like Franklin drew criticism by some who saw her as playing down her black roots to go pop and reach white audiences . The criticism would become a constant refrain through much of her career . She was even booed during the Soul Train Awards " in 1989 . <p> " Sometimes it gets down to that , you know ? " she told Katie Couric in 1996 . " You 're not black enough for them . I do n't  know . You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken you away from them . " <p> Some saw her 1992 marriage to former New Edition member and soul crooner Bobby Brown as an attempt to refute those critics . It seemed to be an odd union ; she was seen as pops pure princess while he had a bad-boy image , and already had children of his own . ( The couple had a daughter , Bobbi Kristina , in 1993 . ) Over the years , he would be arrested several times , on charges ranging from DUI to failure to pay child support . <p> But Houston said their true personalities were not as far apart as people may have believed . <p> " When you love , you love . I mean , do you stop loving somebody because you have different images ? You know , Bobby and I basically come from the same place , " she told Rolling Stone in 1993 . " You see somebody , and you deal with their image , that 's their image . Its part of them , its not the whole picture . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel . I can get down and dirty . I can get raunchy . " <p> It would take several years , however , for the public to see that side of Houston . Her moving 1991 rendition of The Star Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl , amid the firstGulf War , set a new standard and once again reaffirmed her as Americas sweetheart . <p> In 1992 , she became a star in the acting world with The Bodyguard . Despite mixed reviews , the story of a singer ( Houston ) guarded by a former Secret Service agent ( Kevin Costner ) was an international success . <p> It also gave her perhaps her most memorable hit : a searing , stunning rendition of Dolly Partons " I Will Always Love You , " which sat atop the charts for weeks . It was Grammys record of the year and best female pop vocal , and the Bodyguard soundtrack was named album of the year . <p> She returned to the big screen in 1995-96 with Waiting to Exhale and The Preachers Wife . Both spawned soundtrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Is Your Love , " in 1998 , brought her a Grammy for best female R&amp;B vocal for the cut " Its Not Right But Its Okay . " <p> But during these career and personal highs , Houston was using drugs . In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2010 , she said by the time The Preachers Wife was released , " ( doing drugs ) was an everyday thing . I would do my work , but after I did my work , for a whole year or two , it was every day . I was n't happy by that point in time . I was losing myself . " <p> In the interview , Houston blamed her rocky marriage to Brown , which included a charge of domestic abuse against Brown in 1993 . They divorced in 2007 . <p> Houston would go to rehab twice before she would declare herself drug-free to Winfrey in 2010 . But in the interim , there were missed concert dates , a stop at an airport due to drugs , and public meltdowns . <p> She was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors spread she had died the next day . Her crude behavior and jittery appearance on Browns reality show , Being Bobby Brown , was an example of her sad decline . Her Sawyer interview , where she declared " crack is whack , " was often parodied . She dropped out of the spotlight for a few years . <p> Houston staged what seemed to be a successful comeback with the 2009 album " I Look To You . " The album debuted on the top of the charts , and would eventually go platinum . <p> Things soon fell apart . A concert to promote the album on Good Morning America went awry as Houstons voice sounded ragged and off-key . She blamed an interview with Winfrey for straining her voice . <p> A world tour launched overseas , however , only confirmed suspicions that Houston had lost her treasured gift , as she failed to hit notes and left many fans unimpressed ; some walked out . Canceled concert dates raised speculation that she may have been abusing drugs , but she denied those claims and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Presley was , in effect , the countrys first great rockstar . He was also one of the countrys most prominent tragic losses ; a early rock victim to drugs though there would be many others . But before Elvis truly meteoric rise to international super-stardom , he was a young man from Tupelo , Mississippi , a town nestled deep in the heart of the Mississippi Delta , who only wanted to play the blues that he had listened to and fell in love with on the radio . <p> Elvis received his first guitar in 1946 for his eleventh birthday , and- continued- to avidly play . Despite bullying , rejections from bands &amp; teachers , and what he described as an intense shyness , he continued to overcome and hone his craft . As a teenager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including B.B. King &amp; Arthur Crudup , Presley found himself drawn to the thriving blues scene that was developing around Beale Street in Memphis . The young man spent hours in record stores , emulating many of the country , gospel , and blues singers and players of the day . He was said to have spent some nights in the juke joints , and he recalled avidly listening to the " black " radio stations playing blues , during the era of still-rampant racism in the south . His apathy towards color boundaries became a defining characteristic , and along with his refusal to round out his music , opting to leave it rough and in the style of many black blues performers of the day , aided in breaking down racial barriers . <p> pullquoteIf I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel , I could make a billion dollars . <p> Sam Phillips- /pullquoteSun Studio is located in a relatively unusually shaped building on Union Avenue , in Memphis , Tennessee , just a jog away from Beale. today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building , and hundreds of tourists flock to the Rock n Roll mecca every day to pay homage . In 1953 , however , Sam Phillips , who owned the then-unassuming building and its Sun Records label , was simply looking to develop any good talent that he found , and was constantly on the hunt for a particular kind of talent . " If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel , " said Phillips , " I could make a billion dollars . " Blues , and any music made by African Americans , was still considered to be taboo for white people in the deeply segregated south . But Phillips was convinced that there was something special about the blues , and that all it would take to help break down that racial barrier was to give white people someone white that they would listen to , - that did the same thing . <p> In August of that year , Phillips found what he would call the second greatest discovery of his life ; Elvis- Presley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording that he claimed was for his mothers birthday though he almost certainly had a loftier goal of being discovered , since his mothers birthday was still 6 months away . He recorded two ballads and went on his way . Almost a year later , Phillips called Elvis back in to Sun Studio to play , as a try-out . The session was going poorly , as Elvis sang different songs from different genres . Finally , at the end of a frustrating day , Presley wildly launched into song , transforming into a jumping , dancing , guitar-playing force as he began playing the blues . He had launched into " Thats All Right , Mama " , - an Arthur " Big Boy " Crudup song that he had long enjoyed on the radio . Phillips flipped the recorders on and had the first hit from a man that would shoot to international super-stardom like no other person in history had .

After he sold Presleys contract , Phillips never enjoyed the same musical success . However , he invested heavily in a start-up hotel business called Holiday Inn , which quickly netted him a fortune . <p> Elvis became a sensational hit , and after being drafted into the military for a modest hiatus , he went on to pop and film , enjoying commercial success and widespread fame on unprecedented levels .

@@61383237 @1383237/ <h> TBT- Why We Owe Chuck Berry So Much <p> Editors Note : This week , Throwback Thursday looks back on the contributions of " Father of Rock and Roll . " <p> Every now and then someone comes along , grabs the universe by the tail , and shakes it , waking it up to the dawn of a new adventure . Beethoven . Mozart . Robert Johnson . Django Reinhardt . Muddy Waters . Miles Davis . Bob Dylan . These talented individuals each brought a new vision for music to the world , enriching the human experience in the process . Their vision opened previously unexplored paths of learning , discovery , and spiritual joy for others to travel for themselves . <p> In some instances , the work of these gypsy journeymen gives birth to a movement . Robert Johnson was the amalgamation of the great Delta blues players , and it can be argued that his work was a basic building block of the blues , folk , and even rock genres . Django Reinhardt brought Gypsy Swing to the fore , and along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an instrument in the performance of popular music . Christian was also among the first to play a guitar through an amplifier , convincing even the doubtful Benny Goodman that this had merit . Muddy Waters brought the delta music of Mississippi with him to Chicago as did so many before him . In a stroke of genius , and also as an eventual necessity , he too would plug his guitar into an amplifier , and the blues would never be the same . <p> Today , Chuck Berry is generally regarded as the " Father of Rock and Roll . " From 1955 until 1962 , he was writing , performing , and recording a string of hits on the Chess label that included " Maybellene , " " Roll Over Beethoven , " " Rock and Roll Music , " " School Days , " " Sweet Little Sixteen , " and " Johnny B. Goode . " <p> After being released from prison in 1963 after serving one and one-half years following his conviction in what many consider a racially driven trial for violating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his songs . Among these was the Beach Boys hit " Surfin U.S.A. , " which had " borrowed " the melody from his " Sweet Little Sixteen . " He was also still quite popular because top tier British groups such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had been performing their own versions of his songs . <p> He wrote new songs including " No Particular Place to Go , " " You Never Can Tell , " and " Nadine . " He released five albums for his Mercury label between 1966 and 1969 , including a live album , Live at Fillmore Auditorium , which had the Steve Miller Band backing him ! He would do live concert shows and overseas tours as well . In 1970 he returned to the Chess label , where he had his only number one hit , a live version of him performing " My Ding-a-Ling . " Over the years he has continued to perform , and just this week , he announced on his birthday he is releasing a new studio album next year . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release , Rock It . <p> So what makes him so special that to this day , Keith Richards is never on tour without having Chuck Berrys music with him ? Never . Ted Nugent has said , " If you do n't  know every Chuck Berry lick , you ca n't play rock guitar . " John Lennon opined , " If you tried to give rock and roll another name , you might call it Chuck Berry . " <p> As Miles Davis had freed musicians from the norm with his 1959 masterpiece , Kind of Blue , which saw musicians not basing the song structure on chord changes , but instead taking a basic theme and then free-form soloing , Berry freed guitarists by dropping out of his rhythm playing to solo , and then seamlessly dropping back into the rhythm . Prior to this , this had only been done in- Gypsy jazz , and swing orchestras , but Berry was doing it in a morphing of country , swing , rockabilly , and rhythm and blues . And he did it continuously , with ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rock and Roll . " <p> In addition to switching between rhythm and soloing pretty-as-you-please , and combining many styles of music into a coherent , cohesive new sound , he had people , black and white , dancing to his beat . Then to top that off , he was entertaining them with stage panache such as his " duck walk " while he played . The crowd was moving and grooving , and so was he . They fed off of each other . It can not be overstated just how much of an achievement it was having his music enthusiastically received by both white and black audiences . So-called " Race Records " and " Race Music " was a very real thing , and to be able to breach that was pretty substantial . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

The group was founded by Godsmack veterans , drummer , Shannon Larkin and guitarist , Tony Rombola . Then they added Brian Carpenter on bass , and Ray " Rafer John " Cerbone as lead vocalist . We had to take to a listen to this . <p> The two longtime band mates discovered their mutual love for the blues while they were writing together back in 2010 . Both musicians , tired of the constant metal playing , put together a side project , and jammed whenever they could. - They added Carpenter when he won a talent contest and met Cerbone in a biker bar . The stage was set . From there they morphed into their current incarnation , signing a contract with Provogue Records , the blues branch of the Mascot Label Group . <p> Larkin best describes their approach as , " a little heavier , a little darker , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on to say , " We wanted to make something deep that will provoke thought . It had to be evil though . We 're not trying to make it happy . It 's called blues for a reason ! " <p> They unequivocally succeeded , as this album is indeed , dark , heavy , and filled with demonic imagery . Although not quite how you would expect . The opening track , " Evil Is As Evil Does , " is a swampy , southern rocker that brings to mind what the famous devil song-writing Johnsons , Robert and Tommy , may be performing if they lived in this century . <p> From there it drops into a somber , Chicago style blues track describing the grip , and consequences of addiction . " Junkie Hell , " pulls no punches with lyrics such as , " Man , she was the queen of the prom , now she 's just a crack whore . " It evokes graphic images with no apologies , though the title should have given us a clue . <p> Some songs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . " Devil Plays a Strat , " is an obvious nod to Charlie Daniels , " Devil Went Down to Georgia , " albeit Ol Scratch wins this one . " I Think Not , " begins as a sweet , jazz-infused , I got done wrong song , but once again , the tables get turned , hard . <p> One of our favorite tracks is " Whiskey in My Coffee . " This is a sly , rockabilly meets surf guitar , shuffle describing a standard morning on the road for a hard core , road weary musician , facing yet another day . The band has released it as an instant gratification track , which can be heard on their website by following the link below . <p> " Blues Are Fallin From the Sky " is another favored tune , with its musical change-up midway through and its crying guitar . Written on a lonely , rainy day while on tour , this is string bending blues that even the most staunch of purists will recognize , regardless of its rock backdrop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their genre jump , Rombola brought in Memphis guitar great , Eric " Raw Dawg " Gales , to play on the fiery , " The Tower . " Gales is no stranger to the hard , jagged edge of the blues , and meshed , hand in glove , with the band . <p> With all of their references to the devil , evil , and darkness on this self-titled offering , there is something else that makes it haunting . Ray Cerbones voice is unnervingly similar to that of the late , Jim Morrison . Nowhere is that more evident than on the final , bonus track . The only cover song out of the twelve is " Musics Over , " their take on the Doors " When the Musics Over , " from the album Strange Days .

In our ongoing Wednesday series , we offer ten things you may not know about Malcolm John " Mac " Rebennack , Jr. , better known as Dr. John . <p> 1 . Where the name came from Malcolm John Rebennack , Jr. , " Mac " was born and raised in New Orleans , Louisiana . Although he came from the predominantly middle class 3rd Ward , growing up in the Crescent City surrounded him with Louisiana voodoo culture . At one point , he found that a distant family member had been arrested , along with a Senegalese prince , named Jean Montanet , AKA John Montaine , AKA " Doctor John , " for running a voodoo operation out of a whorehouse in the mid 1800s . Montanets specialty was as a healer , selling gris-gris protection amulets . After his move to Los Angeles in the 1960s , Rebennack , always the showman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tripper . His debut album release in 1968 was appropriately titled , Gris-Gris . <p> 2 . His early influences Almost everyone in Rebennacks family , it seemed , played piano and his Aunt Andre taught him to play as well . However , guitar was his first love , and he was good at it , learning licks from local guitarists including Earl King . He also started young , both writing and composing . He wrote his first song at age 14 , and while still in Louisiana , wrote songs for , and accompanied artists including Art Neville , Joe Tex , Frankie Ford , Allen Toussaint , and his personal hero , Professor Longhair . At the age of 16 , he was hired as an A&amp;R man by Johnny Vincent , for his Ace Records label . The youngest in history , his record stands to this day . <p> 3 . Injury and instrument change Prior to a show , a motel manager was pistol whipping Macs long-time friend and lead vocalist , Ronnie Barron , over a tryst that Barron was having with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun away from the man , put his hand over the barrel and the man shot , nearly taking the ring finger of Macs left hand completely off . Although emergency surgery saved his finger , it healed at an awkward angle , making it difficult to fret a guitar . He did play bass for a short time , but eventually concentrated on piano and organ . <p> 4 . The seedy side of the Big Easy Although already a successful songwriter , musician and producer , Dr. John did live on the wild side of the music scene . A heroin habit , which had him in its grip until 1989 , helped his removal from Jesuit High School . His bands played in bucket of blood joints and strip clubs along Canal Street and Jackson Avenue . For a time in the 1950s , he even ran a brothel , and sold narcotics , which got him a two year sentence in federal prison . " It was pretty great , " he would later say of the gut bucket music scene . " We worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did sessions during the day . I 've always thought that my chops were a lot better then than they ever have been since . " <p> 5 . Wild times as the Night Tripper When performing as Dr. John The Night Tripper , Rebennacks shows were over the top elaborate . He would , much like Screamin Jay Hawkins , appear on stage in a puff of smoke , dressed in elaborate costumes reminiscent of Mardi Gras , with beads , feathers and bones . Sometimes only in body paint . His lyrics contained voodoo chants , and he would douse the audience in glitter . There were snakes and gris-gris dancers . For some time a man named Prince Kiyama toured with the band , and during the performance would bite the head off a live chicken and drink the blood . That all came to a screeching halt when they were arrested after a show in St. Louis , Missouri for " lewd and lascivious performance and cruelty to animals . " In his own unique version of the language , Dr. John later described it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> 6 . Session work For a short time after his arrival in Los Angeles , Dr. John was a member of the Phil Spector Wall of Sound Orchestra , better known today as The Wrecking Crew . They were a group of A-list session musicians that backed nearly every record coming out of Southern California in the 1960s . Other notable musicians from crew included Carol Kaye , Tommy Tedesco , Leon Russell , and Glen Campbell . Always highly sought after for session work , Rebennack has appeared on albums by Canned Heat , the Rolling Stones , James Taylor and Carly Simon , Papa John Creach , Van Morrison , Leon Redbone , BB King , Levon Helm , Gregg Allman , Maria Muldaur , and many others . He also appeared on The Last Waltz , singing , " Such a Night , " from his hit 1973 album , In the Right Place . <p> 7 . Influence in pop culture Dr. John is an influential character , to say the least . One of the lyrics from his most recognized song , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the title of the Emerson , Lake &amp; Palmer album , Brain Salad Surgery , in 1973 . He wrote , and originally sang the , " Love That Chicken , " jingle for Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits . Although written by Steve Geyer and Mike Post , the title song , " My Opinionation , " for the 90s sitcom , Blossom , was performed by Dr. John . The highly recognized Bonnaroo Music Festival , takes its name from Macs 1974 album , Desitively Bonnaroo . He also partly inspired the Muppets character , Dr. Teeth , leader of the all muppet band , The Electric Mayhem . <p> 8 . First ever BMA Dr. John has been nominated for a dozen Grammy awards over the course of his career , and has won six of them . Let the record show , however , that the very first W.C. Handy Award for Blues Album of the Year in 1980 , went to Professor Longhairs , Crawfish Fiesta , on which Dr. John played guitar . <p> 9 . The Katrina aftermath Although Rebennack had relocated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrina wrought on his beloved hometown in 2005 , left him angry with the politicians and devastated by their lack of concern . Only days after the storm , he performed the Bobby Charles song , " Walkin to New Orleans , " to close the Shelter from the Storm : A Concert for the Gulf Coast telethon which raised money for the Red Cross and Salvation Army relief efforts . In November of that year , he released the 4 song EP , Sippiana Hericane , to benefit the New Orleans Musicians Clinic , Salvation Army , and the Jazz Foundation of America . He also led the way in raising funds to assist displaced musicians . <p> 10 . His first gig ever Young Malcolm Rebennacks first gig was n't musical . His mother , a fashion model herself , got his cherubic face on boxes of Ivory Soap . Hard to believe that , looking at his rather imposing figure now . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61383252 @1383252/ <h> The Apocalypse Blues Revue Debut Album Set For Release <p> The new , blues rock band , TheApocalypse Blues Revue , will be releasing their eponymous debut album this month . The group was founded by Godsmack veterans , drummer , Shannon Larkin and guitarist , Tony Rombola . Then they added Brian Carpenter on bass , and Ray " Rafer John " Cerbone as lead vocalist . We had to take to a listen to this . <p> The two longtime band mates discovered their mutual love for the blues while they were writing together back in 2010 . Both musicians , tired of the constant metal playing , put together a side project , and jammed whenever they could. - They added Carpenter when he won a talent contest and met Cerbone in a biker bar . The stage was set . From there they morphed into their current incarnation , signing a contract with Provogue Records , the blues branch of the Mascot Label Group . <p> Larkin best describes their approach as , " a little heavier , a little darker , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on to say , " We wanted to make something deep that will provoke thought . It had to be evil though . We 're not trying to make it happy . It 's called blues for a reason ! " <p> They unequivocally succeeded , as this album is indeed , dark , heavy , and filled with demonic imagery . Although not quite how you would expect . The opening track , " Evil Is As Evil Does , " is a swampy , southern rocker that brings to mind what the famous devil song-writing Johnsons , Robert and Tommy , may be performing if they lived in this century . <p> From there it drops into a somber , Chicago style blues track describing the grip , and consequences of addiction . " Junkie Hell , " pulls no punches with lyrics such as , " Man , she was the queen of the prom , now she 's just a crack whore . " It evokes graphic images with no apologies , though the title should have given us a clue . <p> Some songs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . " Devil Plays a Strat , " is an obvious nod to Charlie Daniels , " Devil Went Down to Georgia , " albeit Ol Scratch wins this one . " I Think Not , " begins as a sweet , jazz-infused , I got done wrong song , but once again , the tables get turned , hard . <p> One of our favorite tracks is " Whiskey in My Coffee . " This is a sly , rockabilly meets surf guitar , shuffle describing a standard morning on the road for a hard core , road weary musician , facing yet another day . The band has released it as an instant gratification track , which can be heard on their website by following the link below . <p> " Blues Are Fallin From the Sky " is another favored tune , with its musical change-up midway through and its crying guitar . Written on a lonely , rainy day while on tour , this is string bending blues that even the most staunch of purists will recognize , regardless of its rock backdrop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their genre jump , Rombola brought in Memphis guitar great , Eric " Raw Dawg " Gales , to play on the fiery , " The Tower . " Gales is no stranger to the hard , jagged edge of the blues , and meshed , hand in glove , with the band . <p> With all of their references to the devil , evil , and darkness on this self-titled offering , there is something else that makes it haunting . Ray Cerbones voice is unnervingly similar to that of the late , Jim Morrison . Nowhere is that more evident than on the final , bonus track . The only cover song out of the twelve is " Musics Over , " their take on the Doors " When the Musics Over , " from the album Strange Days . Morrison and company would often perform this 11 minute epic as an encore , and TheApocalypse Blues Revue rightfully puts their truncated , 6 minute version at the tail end .

@@61383253 @1383253/ <h> 10 Things You Did n't  Know About Dr. John <p> Editors Note : We celebrated the 76th birthday of one of New Orleans favorite sons just two days ago . In our ongoing Wednesday series , we offer ten things you may not know about Malcolm John " Mac " Rebennack , Jr. , better known as Dr. John . <p> 1 . Where the name came from Malcolm John Rebennack , Jr. , " Mac " was born and raised in New Orleans , Louisiana . Although he came from the predominantly middle class 3rd Ward , growing up in the Crescent City surrounded him with Louisiana voodoo culture . At one point , he found that a distant family member had been arrested , along with a Senegalese prince , named Jean Montanet , AKA John Montaine , AKA " Doctor John , " for running a voodoo operation out of a whorehouse in the mid 1800s . Montanets specialty was as a healer , selling gris-gris protection amulets . After his move to Los Angeles in the 1960s , Rebennack , always the showman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tripper . His debut album release in 1968 was appropriately titled , Gris-Gris . <p> 2 . His early influences Almost everyone in Rebennacks family , it seemed , played piano and his Aunt Andre taught him to play as well . However , guitar was his first love , and he was good at it , learning licks from local guitarists including Earl King . He also started young , both writing and composing . He wrote his first song at age 14 , and while still in Louisiana , wrote songs for , and accompanied artists including Art Neville , Joe Tex , Frankie Ford , Allen Toussaint , and his personal hero , Professor Longhair . At the age of 16 , he was hired as an A&amp;R man by Johnny Vincent , for his Ace Records label . The youngest in history , his record stands to this day . <p> 3 . Injury and instrument change Prior to a show , a motel manager was pistol whipping Macs long-time friend and lead vocalist , Ronnie Barron , over a tryst that Barron was having with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun away from the man , put his hand over the barrel and the man shot , nearly taking the ring finger of Macs left hand completely off . Although emergency surgery saved his finger , it healed at an awkward angle , making it difficult to fret a guitar . He did play bass for a short time , but eventually concentrated on piano and organ . <p> 4 . The seedy side of the Big Easy Although already a successful songwriter , musician and producer , Dr. John did live on the wild side of the music scene . A heroin habit , which had him in its grip until 1989 , helped his removal from Jesuit High School . His bands played in bucket of blood joints and strip clubs along Canal Street and Jackson Avenue . For a time in the 1950s , he even ran a brothel , and sold narcotics , which got him a two year sentence in federal prison . " It was pretty great , " he would later say of the gut bucket music scene . " We worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did sessions during the day . I 've always thought that my chops were a lot better then than they ever have been since . " <p> 5 . Wild times as the Night Tripper When performing as Dr. John The Night Tripper , Rebennacks shows were over the top elaborate . He would , much like Screamin Jay Hawkins , appear on stage in a puff of smoke , dressed in elaborate costumes reminiscent of Mardi Gras , with beads , feathers and bones . Sometimes only in body paint . His lyrics contained voodoo chants , and he would douse the audience in glitter . There were snakes and gris-gris dancers . For some time a man named Prince Kiyama toured with the band , and during the performance would bite the head off a live chicken and drink the blood . That all came to a screeching halt when they were arrested after a show in St. Louis , Missouri for " lewd and lascivious performance and cruelty to animals . " In his own unique version of the language , Dr. John later described it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> 6 . Session work For a short time after his arrival in Los Angeles , Dr. John was a member of the Phil Spector Wall of Sound Orchestra , better known today as The Wrecking Crew . They were a group of A-list session musicians that backed nearly every record coming out of Southern California in the 1960s . Other notable musicians from crew included Carol Kaye , Tommy Tedesco , Leon Russell , and Glen Campbell . Always highly sought after for session work , Rebennack has appeared on albums by Canned Heat , the Rolling Stones , James Taylor and Carly Simon , Papa John Creach , Van Morrison , Leon Redbone , BB King , Levon Helm , Gregg Allman , Maria Muldaur , and many others . He also appeared on The Last Waltz , singing , " Such a Night , " from his hit 1973 album , In the Right Place . <p> 7 . Influence in pop culture Dr. John is an influential character , to say the least . One of the lyrics from his most recognized song , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the title of the Emerson , Lake &amp; Palmer album , Brain Salad Surgery , in 1973 . He wrote , and originally sang the , " Love That Chicken , " jingle for Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits . Although written by Steve Geyer and Mike Post , the title song , " My Opinionation , " for the 90s sitcom , Blossom , was performed by Dr. John . The highly recognized Bonnaroo Music Festival , takes its name from Macs 1974 album , Desitively Bonnaroo . He also partly inspired the Muppets character , Dr. Teeth , leader of the all muppet band , The Electric Mayhem . <p> 8 . First ever BMA Dr. John has been nominated for a dozen Grammy awards over the course of his career , and has won six of them . Let the record show , however , that the very first W.C. Handy Award for Blues Album of the Year in 1980 , went to Professor Longhairs , Crawfish Fiesta , on which Dr. John played guitar . <p> 9 . The Katrina aftermath Although Rebennack had relocated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrina wrought on his beloved hometown in 2005 , left him angry with the politicians and devastated by their lack of concern . Only days after the storm , he performed the Bobby Charles song , " Walkin to New Orleans , " to close the Shelter from the Storm : A Concert for the Gulf Coast telethon which raised money for the Red Cross and Salvation Army relief efforts . In November of that year , he released the 4 song EP , Sippiana Hericane , to benefit the New Orleans Musicians Clinic , Salvation Army , and the Jazz Foundation of America . He also led the way in raising funds to assist displaced musicians . <p> 10 . His first gig ever Young Malcolm Rebennacks first gig was n't musical . His mother , a fashion model herself , got his cherubic face on boxes of Ivory Soap . Hard to believe that , looking at his rather imposing figure now . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Her drummer Go-Go and bass player Chris looked to be enjoying themselves in the moment , gazing out to see the older couples laughing , delightfully flipping the birdie , and one lady took so much pleasure in the moment that she held up both hands and shook them defiantly as if she were reliving rebellious teenage years . <p> This on-stage action is a telling glimmer of Samantha Fishs friendship with fellow Blues artist Mike Zito , whom she lovingly describes as a sibling . <p> " Man , " she said . " He s like my big brother . He s been so helpful to me , and he s believed in me from the start , and you know , were a good team . Its good to have people like that , friends in the industry that are looking out for you . " <p> She met Zito through Knucklehead Saloon in Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the time came to pursue music professionally , she began to go to jams and started quitting her jobs , tried to get gigs and put bands together . " Mike Zito and Frank Hicks are really the ones who helped hooked me up , " she said . " They got me with the agency , booked the Girls with Guitars tour and got me with the record label . " Zito has since produced Girls With Guitars and Fishs solo albums , - The Runaway and Black Wind Howlin . " He s just a great guy . He s been helping me with my guitar stuff . I think he s hands down one of the best out there . I 've got a lot to learn from him . " <p> It was in Kansas City , where powerful names like Big Joe Turner and jazz cat Charlie Parker were born , that the roots of her musical ambitions were planted , but they did n't  exactly begin on the guitar . " As far as musically , " she said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained the inane quality of the first drum set her parents got her and was apologetic about what she probably did to their ears . " It looked really , really cool . I was like , I really want to be in a rock band ! I wan na play the drums . " <p> It was n't too much longer until she started on the guitar . She made it a point to go to jams and meet new people , fresh musicians like her , all while working her jobs . " When I put my band thing together , we ended up getting this weekly jam at a little bar in Kansas City called Hannibals . It became a huge jam , man . It took me a couple years , but I think our biggest night was forty jammers show up . On average , we were having twenty to twenty-five people a night coming up to play . It was a hot little thing for a while . That was kinda my first professional spot . " <p> Growing up , Fish listened to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to : The Rolling Stones , Tom Petty , and songwriters like Tom Waits and John Hiatt . When she began teaching herself how to play a guitar , she really wanted to perform like one legend . <p> " I wanted to be like Angus Young . I used to watch this Live at Donington DVD . I could kinda see what he was doing , but then I found out about Stevie Ray Vaughn , and then I wanted to be the girl version of Stevie Ray . " <p> From there , she started traveling backwards , listening to the older Blues , and found herself falling in love with the greats , such as Freddie King , Howlin Wolf , and Muddy Waters , and then even further back she became entranced with Skip James and Charlie Patton , the delta blues , and the gritty , raw blues . " I think that for me is where I started to shape the genre I wanted to go into . " <p> After a short chat about the dreadful drive back to Kansas City in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could only think about how terrifying driving the van was the back end fishtailing all over black ice and having to drive slow for nearly seven hours to get back home with the band . Not all gigs were like that one though . When she describes her first gig , she let 's out a painful chuckle and groans at the thought . " It was pretty bad , " she laughed . " Frank Hicks at Knucklehead Studios called me in to do this favor for him . Do n't  laugh at me because this was not a Blues gig . Hannah Montana had a show in Kansas City . It was Miley Cyrus when she was doing the Hannah Montana thing , and the Ticket brokers had all bought the tickets up and jacked all the prices up so a lot the young kids could n't go . So Frank had his nieces , and they were all having a big Hannah Montana party at Knuckleheads and they asked me to come out , because I 'm a blonde girl that played guitar , and I learned a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ate me alive . They hated me . " <p> " I could not come close to their Hannah Montana , Goddess , whatever . I had little kids come up to me and say You 're not as good as Hannah Montana. It was like something out of a sitcom , very much a Seinfeld moment . " <p> Samantha Fishs most recent album , Black Wind Howlin , released back in September , is Fishs most ambitious project to date . " I think its my best record , " she said . " I 'm really proud of it . Its a little different . I think its a little more rockin , and there 's a couple more curveballs on it . " Another Zito produced album , it was backed by Charlie Wooton and Yonrico Scott and was recorded down at Dockside Studios , a beautiful compound right on the Louisiana bayou . Speaking about the album , Fish spent some time finding her voice and figuring out the sounds in her mind . " It takes a long time to connect with that , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me yet . " <p> Being a big fan of lyricist such as Hiatt and Waits , Fish has focused on the imaginative storytelling aspect of songwriting . " Ive been working really hard on writing , " she said . " I think the songwriting is better , the playing is better , but I leave it up to the audience to decide if they like it . " <p> Fish described her guitar style as a work in progress . " Its true , " she said . " Every guitar player looks at it that way . Its a mash up of my influences and the things I want to sound like , but I do n't  feel like I 'm trying to sound like Stevie Ray Vaughn or Keith Richards . I mean , I 've had people come up to me that have told that I have a sound , which I think is a really big compliment . " Her guitar style is prevalent in her song " Black Wind Howlin ' " , and " Go to Hell " captures the pure fret board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , I really like , always liked , " Black Wind Howlin " because I get to rock out on the guitar .

But you know the ballads are really fun too . Its just great when they 're dancing , and then suddenly it becomes one of your favorite songs . I love playing my original works though . We played a show in Kansas City and people were actually singing the words to the original tunes , and I was like , wow . It was amazing . That was very uplifting .

He also gave the youngster his first guitar , placing it on a shelf that he could n't reach , and telling him that if he could attain it , he could keep it . Richards devised a makeshift tower of books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to reach the treasured instrument . He practiced at home , with his favorite records of the time , which included albums by Billie Holiday , Louie Armstrong , Ella Fitzgerald , and Big Bill Broonzy . At the age of 13 , he saw the documentary film , Low Light and Blue Smoke , on British television . The image and sound of Broonzy , alone with a guitar , left a lasting love of the blues on the young teen . <p> 2 . Although obviously most famous for his career with the Rolling Stones , Keith has spent some quality time in the studio as a blues sideman as well . Some of the most famous blues albums , to which Richards has contributed , include , John Lee Hooker , Mr. Lucky ; The Neville Brothers , Uptown ; Bo Diddley , A Man Amongst Men ; BB King , Deuces Wild ; Hubert Sumlin , About Them Shoes ; Buddy Guy , Bring Em In ; and Les Paul &amp; Friends , American Made World Played . Richards has also released three solo albums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks , only one of them charted the song , " Happy , " from Exile on Main Street , hit #22 on the Billboard Hot 100 . <p> 3 . There are over 3,000 guitars in Keefs collection , but there are a couple that are his go to instruments . Both are Fender Telecasters ; a 1953 named , " Micawber , " and a 1954 which he calls , " Malcolm . " He also has a trademark string setup for both axes . He only uses Ernie Ball strings , and these two guitars are always in five-string open tuning ( G , D , G , B , D , with the low E string removed ) . The strings for these set ups are custom made by Ernie Ball , as far as the gauging goes , and are not for sale to anyone else . <p> 4 . Known as a master of the electric guitar , Richards is more than adept on acoustic guitars as well . In fact , the original recordings of the songs , " Jumpin Jack Flash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any electric guitars on them . The iconic sound was created by Keef laying down several layers of acoustic guitar , in different tunings , that he filtered through a portable cassette recorder . Most nights , Richards was awake while everyone else in the hotel was asleep , and he developed this method so as not to disturb other guests . <p> 5 . Speaking of sleep , Richards claims to have written the guitar riff for , " Satisfaction , " in his sleep . A pretty amazing feat considering that he very rarely slept at all . According to his 2010 autobiography , Life , he claims to have only slept , on average , two nights per week during the Stones heyday . " This means that I have been conscious for at least three lifetimes , " he wrote . Nikola Tesla was known to only sleep two hours per night , and Thomas Edison slept for three . Leonard da Vinci , its said , slept for approximately 1.5 hours per day , but did it in intervals of 15 minute naps every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added productivity to his 67 year life . Were thinking Keith is on to something . His personal record is 9 days without sleep , at the end of which , he fell asleep standing up , crashing against the edge of a speaker , and waking in a pool of blood . <p> 6 . During his lifetime , and decades long career , Keef has had his share of injuries , and near misses . They began when he was just an infant . His mother and he evacuated their London neighborhood due to a Nazi bomb raid . They returned to their home to find baby Keiths crib had been destroyed . There were at least three times he nearly died by fire . Once , he and famed session musician , Bobby Keys , accidentally set fire to a bathroom at the Playboy Mansion ; again during the recording of Exile on Main Street , he and his girlfriend , Anita Pallenberg , fell asleep , Richards with a lit cigarette , which caught the bed on fire ; and another time when mice chewing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He s also been electrocuted on stage , fallen from a palm tree , had a pile of books fall on him at his home library , and was poisoned while on tour in Switzerland , when someone put strychnine in his heroin . <p> 7 . Even trying to be good , he s sometimes bad . While a teenager , Richards spent two years in the Boy Scouts . An avid collector , he claimed that the only reason he joined was so he could wear a knife . What he did n't  know , at the time , was that he had to accumulate several badges before gaining that " honor . " His days as a scout ended when he smuggled a couple bottles of whiskey into a Jamboree , and ended up fist-fighting other boys . He may have lasted longer , had one punch not missed its mark . He swung at another scout , and hit a tent pole , fracturing a bone in his hand . <p> 8 . Keith Richards has received a few punches in his life as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berry . The story goes that after a show , Berry had gone to collect the nights pay . Richards was in the dressing room and Berrys Gibson ES model guitar was laid out on its case . It seemed to call out to him , Richards has said , so he picked it up and strummed a E chord . Berry came in yelling , " Nobody touches my guitar , " and promptly slugged Richards in the face . Berry had never forgiven Richards , and other British rockers for allegedly stealing his licks and making millions , although Richards is his #1 fan , and served as musical producer for the film , Hail ! Hail ! Rock n Roll . Keith has said that he did receive an apology some months later , with Berry saying , " Keith , I did n't  know it was you . " <p> 9 . In his autobiography , Richards wrote , " I 'm a good driver . " One may call that statement into question , considering that he failed his drivers test three times , and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then , of course , there was the incident when he was driving back from a gig in Knebworth , England with his seven-year-old son , Marlon , in the back seat . Apparently Richards fell asleep at the wheel , and crashed his Bentley into a tree . Marlon and he sustained only minor injuries , but when police found LSD in Richards jacket , he was immediately arrested . " I mean , nobodys perfect , " he later said . " At least we did n't  hit anybody . " <p> 10 . You do n't  mess around with Keith . After the notorious Redlands drug raid that nearly landed Richards a year-and-a-half prison sentence , he found out that it was the British tabloid , News of the World , which was shut down in 2011 after several phone tapping allegations , that had tipped off the police . What was worse , was that it was his long-time Belgian chauffeur , who had contacted the paper . Richards was livid that the well paid employee could be bought off by a tabloid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richards only response , " As I heard it , he never walked the same again .

But now hell sing Johnny Cashs " Folsom Prison " himself , so its great to see him progress so far in such a short amount of time with that ! <p> Then our oldest brother , Nick , plays guitar and sings and he just- shreds- it , just kills it . And there 's a part of the show where he gets on a steel guitar ( its not a National but it is a dobro , ) and hell hop behind the drum set and hell do the kick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hell do some Johnny Winter and some original stuff , and hell just do some of the hill country blues .

I 've seen him play that before and its really fun to watch ! <p> Yeah ! When the breeze is going just right it sends you back to childhood sitting on the porch . Its pretty cool . <p> All that 's missing is a little bit of moonshine somewhere. - Tell me about the Kansas City blues scene ! You cant hardly talk about the Kansas City Blues and , these days , KC music without you guys being mentioned . Thats got to feel pretty good . hows the KC blues scene these days ? <p> Its so awesome ! I do n't  get out to the jams these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because I 'm on tour but I 've got a son .

There 's so many musicians , not just that were born here , but have moved to this area , and its always been a great , great music scene as far as I can remember . <p> My parents were always active in the jams and benefits , and were really just active in the blues community , so growing up at such a young age , I 've had the privilege of watching it for a number of years , and when we go out of town , Kansas City has a well known reputation for the birth of swing and 18th and Vine Famous Jazz location So , when we go out to California or something , when they ask where were from and we say Kansas City , theyll get excited ! " Kansas City ! OK , here we go ! " <p> And its really cool because Kansas City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Samantha Fish is on the rise , and Levee Town is another great act we 've got Lee McBee here , and he s a traditional blues GOD ( at least to me anyways ) , and to have him in this town is just such an honor . Its just awesome ! <p> So , its great . And any night of the week you can go out and find a great jam that you know , its not that they " only let the good musicians " jam by any means , its just that the jams themselves are such an incredible time ! There 's all qualities of musicians , from hobbyists to people who are really pursuing a career in it ! Its such a diverse music scene , and its just a great time . We actually host a jam on Wednesdays , and we were off-and-on touring and we got to host last night and it was just an incredible vibe ! <p> I hear they 've got a great newsletter . Everybodys been talking about their newsletter , in fact . <p> Yes ! Theyve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its really turned into a more of a magazine rather than just a simple newsletter or pamphlet . They 're getting some really great writers in there and a lot more relevant content ! They 're really tightening it up ! Especially over the last 5 years . <p> You guys got a big break in the IBC win ! Now you 've gone from that to the cover of blues magazines and nominations for the 2012 Blues Music Awards <p> The nominations were really , completely unexpected ! I was just talking about that last night . We were in the same categories as acts that we opened up for ; like bands we look up to ! Like Susan Tedeschi , she 's one of my vocal heroes of the modern day . Just to be up with them in the same category , Band of the Year , to be in the running with Tommy Castro , its really - its obviously the highlight of my career so far , and to be regarded as peers is an amazing feeling . Just being recognized is such a great feeling its pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek and Susan were running up and down from the stage all night ! <p> When I saw the categories , because we were nominated for Band of the Year and Bass Player . I looked and said , Tedeschi Trucks is going to win Band of the Year , and they did . And the bass instrumentalist and I said Biscuit Miller is going to take that , and he did ! And in that category I 'm up against cats that have been playing longer than I 've been alive ! So its been really cool and humbling at the same time ! <p> And at the BMAs , you guys were up on stage playing in front of thousands of these hardcore blues fans too ! Right there in the cocktail dresses and the tuxes and everything ! Which was really cool ! All these big musicians , from Tab Benoit to Tedeschi Trucks were playing . To have you guys among them must have also been a big deal ! <p> Yeah , to get to play on top of it was just icing on the cake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another unexpected thing , when they asked us to perform , they asked , " would you be willing to do a fifteen minute performance at the Blues Music Awards , " and I had to say " huh , let me think about it YEAH ! No , we prefer to just hang of course well do it ! " <p> So you 've got Wrong Side of the Blues , which is a really celebrated album . What 's next for you guys ! ? <p> Well well be starting preproduction for our next record , here . Were going to do another record with Johnny Lee Schell- at Ultratone Studios out in L.A. <p> So its going to be the same team , and its going to be all new original songs , and were going to start preproduction for that , I believe in August ! So hopefully , were closing on this ! Were hoping to release a new album early next year. - We think its about time . Weve got some pretty great tunes under our belt , and its definitely time for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so <p> Exciting ! I know a lot of people are anxious for new TUF stuff ! So do you have any ideas for the direction of this one ? - <p> Without giving too much away , Wrong Side , that was kind of closure for me I was going through the songs they speak for themselves , and I was putting a lot of things to rest with my divorce and that relationship gone bad , and so I think that this next album is definitely some of the songs Ive written are a bit more grooving , and its not that the last songs are sad or anything like that , but Its definitely going to have a lighter feel , but its going to be part of a harder blues . Itll still be a TUF album ! Our sounds not going to change by any means ! Were just going to keep it the same direction that we 've been going and hopefully itll be better and well keep progressing , keep learning and building upon what we have ! <p> Very cool ! So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek in Slater , Missouri on June 30th ! <p> Its going to be a great time ! I 'm really looking forward to being in such great- female company , with Cee Cee James , Sharon Lewis and - I might have to see if we can work some all-girl jam at the end of our set ! Maybe we can get some of the other girls up ! Well see ! 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Muddy is one of the most prolific embodiments of the Blues that there ever was . His larger-than-life sound has played a hugely influential role in the style of countless musicians . The nuances in his guitar playing and his deep , rough voice made Muddy into an un-imitatable force that drove Chicago Blues , and subsequently Rock n Roll , to unheard of heights . <p> McKinley Morganfield , Muddys real name , was born to a Mississippi sharecropper , reportedly in the town of Rolling Fork , Mississippi . His mother died when he was only three years old , and he moved to the outskirts of Clarksdale , Mississippi , to Stovalls Plantation . He was given the nickname " Muddy " because of his penchant for playing in the mud as a child . Like so many from the Delta , Muddy grew up sharecropping himself , tending to cotton fields for hardly a dollar per week . In the fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Influenced strongly by the Blues giant Son House , who lived nearby , Muddy began to play the guitar at 17 . He quickly picked up the delta style and mastered the bottleneck slide , which would help to define his electric style later in life . It did n't  take long for him to start playing parties &amp; jukes with his friend Sunnyland Sims , who would later play a pivotal role in Muddys bullet-train to fame . In 1941 , while looking for the Delta legend Robert Johnson , ( who had already been dead for 3 years ) , famed folklorist Alan Lomax recorded Muddy for the first time in his life . Mud later equated this experience to hearing himself for the first time . He was recorded again by Lomax in 1943 , and that year , inspired by his recordings , he boarded a train from Clarksdale , to Chicago , Illinois to play his guitar . <p> Muddy at the 1972 Ann Arbor Blues &amp; Jazz Festiva <p> Muddys trip to Chicago is often seen as the symbolic birth of the Chicago-style electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greats such as Sonny Boy Williamson ( I ) and Big Bill Broonzy . In 1944 , Muddy picked up his first electric guitar , playing his delta style with af very electric sound . In 1947 , after years of playing clubs and venues , he played guitar for his old friend from the delta , Sunnyland Slim , for Aristrocrat Records , which would soon change its name and become the most famous Blues record label in existence , Chess Records . Leonard Chess , who would , along with his brother , become the sole owner(s) of the soon-to-be Chess Records , released Muddys first record on Aristocrat : " I Ca n't Be Satisfied " , with a B-side of " Feel Like Going Home " . It sold out in less than a day . His first single began Muddys international popularity and placed him as the beating heart and hard-driving soul of Chess Records for decades to come . <p> In the early 1950s , Muddy Waters and his band , arguably the best Blues supergroup to have ever existed , were on top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in harmonica great Little Walter , brought in Otis Spann , still one of the unmistakably best Blues pianists in existence , and Jimmy Rogers on second guitar . Leonard Chess hired delta Blues bassist Willie Dixon , who quickly became a Chess star , penning hundreds of songs for the Chess artists . <p> ( L to R ) Willie Dixon , Muddy Waters , Buddy Guy <p> Howlin Wolf was discovered deep in the Delta and brought to Chess as well , rivaling Muddy as one of Chesss biggest starts . This magical combination of artists shot the Chess repertoire to epic proportions . It was in this " golden age of Blues " from the early 1950s to the 1960s that the Muddy Waters Band recorded some of their most famous songs . The music , such as " Mannish Boy " , " Hoochie Coochie Man " , " I Just Want To Make Love To You " , and Shes Nineteen Years Old " , among many others , all of which continue to be an integral part in any Blues musicians supply , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the entire group reached its peak , Muddys band members rotated several times as both Otis Spann and Little Walter left the band at different times to pursue very successful solo careers . Muddys band acted as a launch pad for many artists careers in the coming years . In 1958 , Muddy toured England with Spann . Their tour exposed young Englanders to the hard-driving blues style , and helped solidify the coming massive popularity of Blues across the pond . It was an enthusiasm which would spawn such massive groups as Eric Clapton , Rory Gallagher , The Yardbirds , Led Zepplin , and The Rolling Stones , who named their band after his song " Rolling Stone " , and , during a U.S. tour , came specifically to Chess Records to record in the same place as their hero . Muddys appearance at the 1960 Newport Folk Festival led to his first live album , and helped to generate the hard-driving electric Blues exposure to the growing folk revivals enthusiasm . <p> Unfortunately , it was the folk-revival that seemed to wane Muddys career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a low point . Pressured by Chess to meet the demands of the trends , he released several folk and soul-inspired albums that were less than well-recieved . Chess Records solidarity too began to falter , and in 1969 the brothers sold the company , with Muddys long time friend and employer Lenoard Chess dying of a heart attack later that year . In 1977 , Blues-Rocker Johnny Winter began a fruitful collaboration with Muddy , who signed to Winters label Blue Sky Records . His time with Winter created a new energy in his career . He released his critically acclaimed , Grammy winning album Hard Again that same year , and the next year released one of his most timeless albums , I 'm Ready . For several years Muddy enjoyed a large following of mostly white fans , which the genres popularity seemed to shift to , and he toured continuously with Johnny Winter . In 1980 , Muddy was one of the innagural inductees into the Blues Hall of Fame . On the night of April 30th , 1983 , Muddy passed away in his sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth century . <p> " Muddywood " , a guitar made of wood from Muddy Waters Stovall Plantation cabin by Billy Gibbons , of ZZ Top <p> Muddy Waters continues to be one of the most renoun , celebrated , beloved Blues men of all time .

He has been a six-time Blues Foundations W.C. Handy Award winner , and his legacy has been felt through the likes of both Bluesmen and Rock pioneers across the world . Muddy forever changed the face of music as we know it , and he did so with style . His bloodline legacy is survived by his Bluesman son Big Bill Morganfield , who has enjoyed standing on his own ground and adopting his unique interpretation of the Blues , which he shares with the world in avid concerts and frequent albums , his latest being Born Lover , released in 2009. 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61383333 @1383333/ <h> 10 Things You Did n't  Know About Hubert Sumlin <p> November 16th , marks what would have been Hubert Sumlins 85th birthday . To celebrate , we offer 10 things you may not know about the Chicago blues guitar great . <p> 1 . His first meeting with Howlin Wolf With the exception of a 6 month hiatus , Sumlin was Howlin Wolfs guitarist for a total of 23 years . He joined Wolfs band in 1954 and played with them until Wolfs death in 1976 . However , according to Sumlin , the two had first met much earlier . When Hubert was not yet a teenager , the story goes , he was standing on some crates of Coca Cola , peering into a club where Wolf was playing . Someone snatched the crates and he tumbled into the roadhouse , landing on Wolfs head . The manager tried to throw him out , but Wolf insisted that the boy sit onstage . After the gig , Wolf drove him home and asked his mother not to punish him . Sumlin followed the big mans career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his playing style and got even better As many southern guitar players began , Sumlin started playing a homemade version of a diddley bow , using one wire attached to the side of his house . He began playing six string guitar at the age of 6 , after his mother spent an entire weeks salary of $5.00 to buy him one . He played with a pick for many years , and then one morning , just put the pick down and began playing with his fingers . He realized he was playing better than ever , with more soul , and a better sound . He never played with a pick again . Unlike artists such as Albert Collins , and Jimmy Rogers , Sumlin has never played with a capo . He thought it limited his playing and he believed he should play his instrument to its fullest . For many years , in order to achieve their signature tone , both Sumlin , and guitarist , Jody Williams , would play matching Kay guitars . <p> 3 . His time with Muddy Waters For approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Wolfs arch rival , Muddy Waters . Although many people thought it was because of a fight theyd had after a show , Sumlin said it was as simple as Waters offering him more money . In fact , Waters tripled what Wolf was paying him at the time . He did , however , learn quite a bit from Jimmy Rogers during his tenure . Sumlin developed his unique style by watching other guitarists , and borrowing notes and licks that he saw them play . <p> 4 . The fist fight with Wolf Although he described his relationship with Howlin Wolf as that of a father and son , the two were known for having some knock down , drag out , fights . One , in particular , took place after a gig , when Sumlin had wandered off with a cute girl that had been giving him the eye all evening . When he returned , Wolf was furious at having to load Sumlins gear and began cursing him out in front of the band . Embarrassed , Sumlin waited for Wolf , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sucker punched him . Wolf slowly turned and back-handed Sumlin with enough force to send him sprawling down the loading ramp , spitting out teeth . The next morning , Sumlins wife woke him and said Wolf had been sitting in his car , out front , all night . When Sumlin went outside , Wolf apologized , and gave him enough money to fix his dental work . When Wolf died in 1976 , his funeral program listed Sumlin as his son . <p> 5 . Jazz influence and classical training When Sumlin was young , he wanted to be a jazz guitarist , admiring the playing of Charlie Christian in particular . He made the switch to blues guitar after hearing artists like Charley Patton , Robert Johnson and Peetie Wheatstraw . Later he came to the realization that both Wolf and Waters had played with these legends , took what they were doing and electrified it . Not being able to read music or identify notes , Wolf sent Hubert to the Chicago Conservatory of Music . There , he studied under a teacher who played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from blues to opera and taught Sumlin scales , as well as how to identify the notes on a piano and a guitar . <p> 6 . The London Sessions In 1970 , a Chess Records producer approached Eric Clapton and Mike Bloomfield about recording with Howlin Wolf . Once the deal was secured , and plans were underway to record in London , Marshall Chess did not want to pay the extra expense of sending Sumlin along . Upon hearing this news , Clapton replied , " If Huberts not there , I do n't  record . " Chess conceded and Sumlin accompanied Wolf to London , where the album was recorded in six days . Artists including Ian Stewart , Charlie Watts , Ringo Starr , Steve Winwood , and Bill Wyman all participated and the recording went on even with Wolf receiving dialysis right in the studio . Clapton and Sumlin became fast friends during that time , with Eric even gifting Hubert one of his favorite guitars . A couple years later , at the Montreaux Jazz Festival , Sumlin gifted it back . <p> 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jeff Beck , and Keith Richards , Jimi Hendrix often credited Sumlin as an influence to his playing . Although they only met once , in Liverpool , before ever cutting an album , Hendrix experimented a great deal with distortion . It was something that Sumlin had been helping to pioneer since the 1950s . Hubert created some of the first distortion guitar by playing his 56 Gibson Les Paul through a combination of an early Echoplex pedal and a Wabash amp that had 15 ? speakers . <p> 8 . Solo Work After Wolfs death , Sumlin played with the remaining members of his band , dubbed The Wolf Pack , for four more years . He moved from Chicago for a while and spent time in Texas , where he left an impression on two young guitar slingers , Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan . He had actually begun recording solo albums as far back as 1964 , but released 14 more after 1980 , with his last being , About Them Shoes , on the Tone-Cool label in 2004 . It was that year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recorded whenever possible , including guest appearances on recordings with JW-Jones , and Elliot Sharp . Winning several BMA awards , he was nominated for 4 Grammy Awards as well , and was placed 43rd in a 2011 Rolling Stone poll of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time . <p> 9 . Final performances One of Hubert Sumlins last performances was his appearance in the documentary film , Take Me to the River . Released in 2014 , much of the footage was recorded on earlier dates , including a portion of the film depicting Sumlin giving lessons on his note bursts and cliff hanger breaks to fellow guitarists , Eric Gales , and Ian Siegal . A recognized master , Hubert mentored the two artists at the St. Blues Guitar Workshop in Memphis , Tennessee , using as his catalyst , the epic Delta blues standard , " Sitting on Top of the World . " His final recordings , just 13 days before his death in 2011 , were for the album , Cracking the Code , by Stephen Dale Petit . Petit traveled to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the song , " Get You Off . " Sumlins death on December 4th , both shook and inspired Petit . He gathered other guest musicians including Dr. John , Chris Barber and Mick Taylor to join him on a track titled , " Huberts Blues . " In tribute to Sumlin , " HCS 4eva " ( Hubert Charles Sumlin ) is etched into the run out groove of all vinyl copies of the album . <p> 10 . Last request For the last 10 years of his life , Sumlin called Totowa , New Jersey , home . After the death of his wife in 1999 , he moved in with his manager and caretaker , Toni Ann Mamary . Among her many duties to the Blues Hall of Famer , was to fulfill his last request . She did just that , when lying on his death bed , Sumlin turned to her and asked for his guitar . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Shortly afterwards , it was confirmed that Warren Haynes would also be departing . Both musicians have highly successful touring bands independent of the Brothers , with Trucks winning a Grammy in 2012 . <p> Trucks and Haynes were both influential lead guitarists with The Allman Brothers .

Haynes , the roaring guitar genius behind Govt Mule , has been with the band since 1989 . <p> The move comes shortly after ( incorrect ) news from a Rolling Stone Magazine article , from a statement by Gregg Allman , that longtime bassist Oteil Burbridge would be leaving the band . Burbridge and Butch Trucks adamantly denied the rumors , which appear to have simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Haynes have released a joint statement about their departures , as well as personal statements : <p> For 25 years and 15 years respectively , we 've had the honor and pleasure of playing , living , learning , and traveling with the Allman Brothers Band , one of the truly legendary rock and roll bands .

We are both preparing to dig even deeper into our various creative and musical endeavors and , as a result , 2014 will be our final year as part of the band .

Five years ago the 45th seemed like a lofty goal but I thought if we could make it to that milestone it would be a logical time to move on . <p> While I 've shared many magical moments on stage with the Allman Brothers Band in the last decade plus , I feel that my solo project and the Tedeschi Trucks Band is where my future and creative energy lies .

It 's a difficult decision to make , and I do n't make it lightly . <p> I 'm proud to have made a small contribution to the masterful music they have created over the past forty years , and will continue to create . Now seems like a good time to go out on a high note with a great 45th anniversary in 2014 , and the mutual respect and friendship of the other 6 members of ABB . <p> Warren Haynes Statement : <p> " I joined the Allman Brothers Band in 1989 , at age 28 , for a reunion tour with no promise or expectations of it going any further .

Being part of the ABB has opened a lot of doors for me and that 's something I do n't  take for granted nor do I take for granted the friendship and musical relationships I have with each of the members .

I build several models , and the process varies from model to model , so there is no set process that covers all avenues . Thas what makes these things so unique . I build solid bodies , hollow bodies , acoustics and some really weird hybrid monsters . <p> I 've personally played one of your lap steels and its an amazing thing to touch and play with ; mother-of-pearl inlays and brilliant finishes . It seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these . How long does it take ? What do you have to do to get them perfect ? <p> Each instrument varies in time as far as the build goes . Each knee has its own personality , and depending on the model , options , inlays , etc. , it may change dramatically . I do n't  think I have any less than 30 or 40 man hours in each instrument , and much , much more in some . As far as getting them perfect , I just work on them until I 'm satisfied . <p> What got you into making these instruments in the first place ? Did you just pick up and start building them ? <p> I began building the Sipsey River Steels when my brother kept insisting that I build him a lap steel . I had been building my own basses for some time , so he figured that I could just as easily build him a lap . In late summer 2008 , me and my son took a day trip to West Alabama with my flat bottom boat where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something to do . A farmer had cut a path through some cypress knees to allow his cows a path to the river , and there was a pile of knees on the bank . I threw a couple of them in the boat , figuring that at some point , I 'd make something with them . After several months , I decided to try and make a lap steel out of one of them , and the rest is history . <p> I hear your steels are really getting out there . Magazines , musicians , festivals and the like seem to be taking notice . Tell me about what 's been going on lately ? Are you making any steels for anyone of note ? <p> A lot has been happening with local newspapers , TV , and some festivals . These things really seem to draw attention wherever they are . They are so different as well as sounding incredible , and the combination seems to be volatile . They were featured in Guitar Player magazine Sept. 2010 issue in the new gear section as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured in Premeire guitars online magazine . I sent one of the original prototypes to award winning Australian lap player , Andrew Winton , and he made an 8 minute promo video for Youtube at his own discretion . I 'm currently finishing a 13 string monster that we co-designed , and will be sending it over in a week or two . I am also beginning a build for a very prominent ( huge ) player in Nashville . Hopefully that he will love it , play it , and expose it to a larger audience . This thing is still in its infancy , and obviously , I 'm hoping that in the next year or two , that I 'll be able to build instruments exclusively and lose my day job . Its a little hectic juggling the two , and building instruments is my passion . <p> Where can people buy one of your lap steels and what can they expect from the process ? <p> I can be reached through my website , **27;27;TOOLONG . As far as the process , I send pictures of various slabs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , choose their model , options and any ideas they might have , and we design and build their one of a kind SRS. its pretty simple , really . <p> Where can people see your steels ? Will you be at festivals , trade shows , etc ? <p> My steels can be seen on my website , as well as festivals that I might be doing which I post as they happen on my FB page which is **38;56;TOOLONG We also use my instruments in our band , 2blu and the Lucky Stiffs . We have incorporated the steels into one very unique aspect of the band , in which we use primarily all of my stuff , like the steel , upright 6 string bass , various percussion instruments , etc . We have written several songs around the instruments . Its kind of a delta blues/americana/country smorgasbord of weirdness that is really different and enjoyable . Our band website is www.2blumusic.com <p> I 'm limited on how many trade shows that I can do at this point , so I guess I 'll do what I can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of further notice . So far , they seem to be pretty much taking care of themselves . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

@@61383344 @1383344/ <h> The 27 Club <p> After the death of Amy Winehouse at age 27 , articles and inferences about the 27 club have inevitably arisen . Winehouse , after all , was a world famous Jazz-infused singer , and drew comparisons to Etta James and other powerful female vocalists . An unsettling number of greats have passed , often under mysterious circumstances , at the age of 27 . Eric Clapton was the first to use the phrase " 27 club " , mentioning that , because of drugs , alcohol , and self-destructive behavior , he narrowly avoided becoming a member. - While time will tell if the talented young soul singers legacy stands as tall as many other members of the- macabre society , there is no denying the coincidental and often eerie link between the age of twenty seven and the fall of many greats. - The unfortunate club , who 's membership requirements include death , has strong , undeniable ties to the blues , beginning with the hotly debated demise of its " founding member " , the ghost-like bluesman Robert Johnson . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Robert Johnson - a man who 's life spawned many supernatural legends . Much of what is known about Johnson , aside from recording 29 of the most influential songs of the 20th century , is unknown . However , a long persistent legend has Johnson as the subject of a Faustian deal , selling his soul to the devil at a rural country crossroads in exchange for the ability to play blues better than anyone alive . By various accounts , the blues hero was said to have a deep love for alcohol and women , and had his fill of both . After a night playing in a juke joint in Greenwood , Mississippi , Johnson allegedly died under mysterious , still unsolved- circumstances- at the young age of 27 . There has been a widely accepted but hotly contested theory that the musical legend was poisoned by a jealous husband and spent days dying . With likely all eyewitnesses dead , and nearly no recorded documents , it will almost certainly never be known what happened to Johnson that fateful night . Some say the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story well-known to blues enthusiasts , as is the link between the many greats who were strongly influenced by him and then died in similar veins at 27. - Brian Jones was a founding member of the Rolling Stones , and often cited as contributing a major portion of the defining sound of the early Stones through his creative use of various instruments . Jones was a fanatical student of Robert Johnsons recordings , - and tried hard to keep the band firmly planted in the blues . Jones increasingly erratic behavior- estranged- him from his bandmates and lead to his being ejected from the Stones at the height of their popularity . Very shortly afterwards , Jones was found dead at the bottom of his swimming pool . Rumors persisted and books were written about Jones alleged murder or mysterious death , and little is known about the actual events leading to Jones passing . <p> Perhaps the most famous death at age 27 was the mighty Jimi Hendrix . As a young man , Hendrix listened to records of his fathers from a number of blues greats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He forged an early musical career on the chitlin circuit , backing blues and soul acts before setting out on his own . Much of Hendrixs music was firmly blues , and he can easily be seen as one of the greatest links between blues and rock . In mid-September 1970 , Hendrix was found dead at an apartment in London . The woman he had been seeing made a number of conflicting statements in the months and years after his death , and later committed suicide . The doctor who had attended to Jimi made several likely false claims about Jimis death , and was later stripped of his medical license for making unrelated but similar statements . In the time after his death , books have been published and accusations of Jimis murder have arisen , though the true story likely died with his former girlfriend . <p> Less than 30 days after the death of Hendrix , another blues to rock great of the sixties was found dead under unknown circumstances at the age of 27 . Janis Joplin , one of the most- celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outcast in her younger life , and found comfort in the strong blueswomen of the 20s , 30s , and 40s , whom she was strongly influenced by during her musical career . While she had a long and well known debilitating drug addiction , she managed to create a strong repertoire- of blues-based music , including a number of traditional blues covers . On the morning of October 9th , Joplin was found dead and alone in a hotel room , presumably of a Heroine overdose . <p> Jim Morrison and his band , The Doors , were- psychedelic- rock that used the heavy percussion and drone of the blues to great effect . Morrison was known as an " American Poet " for his lyrics , fronting The Doors with wild performances and years of self-destructive behavior . While visiting Paris , he was found dead . As with so many others , the circumstances surrounding his death will likely forever remain a mystery . Cover-ups , contradicting reports , the unrelated death of witnesses , and hushed stories of murder surround the demise of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kurt Cobain will forever stand as the torch of grunge and the disdain of a young generation . His iconic music has been widely influential , - his- self-destructive behavior well known , and his death remains shrouded in conspiracy and mystery . Cobain , like Joplin , was drawn to the music of Leadbelly , often citing the blues and folk musician as his favorite artist . Before his Death , Cobain has expressed his intent to create an album of Leadbelly covers . It was never to be , though . In early April , Kurt disappeared , and several days later was found dead by a shotgun wound to the head . In the aftermath of his death , extremely strong opinions have been widely voiced , with books and documentaries touting accusations of murder and cover-ups . The evidence and facts surrounding Cobains death have become so muddy and speculated upon that the true circumstances around his death will likely never be known . <p> While the most popular artists are often the ones the most- adamantly- discussed and cited , a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the list . The combined content of the song that these amazing " club members " created has left one of the most influential impacts in musical history , and their legends and deaths have remained nearly as much a discussed part of their legacy and the music that they created . While it is easy to speculate on what these artists may have created if they werent subjected to an early passing , the music they did create will continue to be played and leave a lasting impression on generations to come . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

" He s a founding member of the Rolling Stones , and Rolling Stone Magazine lists him as number 4th on its list of 100 best guitarists . He is an inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , having been inducted into the hall as a member of the Rolling Stones in 1989 . He and his childhood friend Mick Jagger are among the greatest songwriting partnerships in rock and roll , alongside Lennon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know the blues there 's no point in picking up the guitar and playing rock and roll or any other form of popular music . <p> From the day on the train when Richards met Jagger , who was carrying that Chess Records album containing the music of Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters , and their friendship began in earnest , they have always been about the blues . Sure , they may have taken a side trip into rock and roll ( " I know , its only rock and roll , but I like it ! " ) , but for these two stalwarts of music in the modern era , blues has always been the bedrock that everything else was built upon . <p> For the Glimmer Twins though , those forays into rock and roll have been magnificent , and for the most part , they have enjoyed them immensely . Over the years , as a group , the Stones have made folk music rock , country music rock and shake , and certainly , they have made blues rock the rafters as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , water and warmth , music is the next necessity of life . <p> You cant go into a shop and ask for a lead guitar . You 're a guitar player , and you play a guitar . <p> Richards has not issued an abundance of solo material over the years . Main Offender arrived in 1992 , Talk Is Cheap in 1988 , and Crosseyed Heart just recently , in 2015 . And of course , there 's his cult-classic , Live at the Hollywood Palladium , December- 15 , 1988 , issued in the United States in December of 1991 . As great as seeing the Rolling Stones was , witnessing the short lived X-Pensive Winos tour that was actually in support of Richards Talk Is Cheap album , was an experience in Existentialism , without restraints or boundaries . <p> The X-Pensive Winos were Richards , Steve Jordan , Charley Drayton , Ivan Neville , Waddy Wachtel , Sarah Dash , and natch , Bobby Keys nails things down on the saxophone . The spontaneity , vigor , and playing here while at times borders on post-punk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These folks are on the wire , without a net , and clearly , they are enthralled , having the time of their lives , and so is the audience . The set included the hits , " Take It So Hard , " and " I Could Have Stood You Up , " and Stones classics " Happy , " and " Too Rude . " <p> Now , many would argue that this is not the best of Keith Richards , and while that is a discussion that could be had , one thing is certain : This is exactly what is best about Richards and why he is so important to modern music , still , five decades on . It is precisely that " I do n't  give a fuck about the rules " attitude that has worked so well for Richards . No constraints , preconditions , and nothing is off the table . All this does n't  mean that he was n't still going to be a consummate musician . <p> If you 're going to kick authority in the teeth , you might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts content that " The Stones havent made a good record since blah blah blah , yada yada yada . " Whatever . There is a reason that Richards has been called " The Human Riff . " Time after time , he has done for guitar what " Hoagy " Carmichael , and Count Basie did for piano ; create catchy hooks that served as foundations upon which compositions could build standards of excellence , popularity , and emotional satisfaction . <p> I do n't think you stop growing until they start shovelling the dirt in . <p> While it is still true today that " The Stones in a club is still the ultimate rush ! " , Keith Richards has been a pioneering force for music to constantly expand its boundaries , continuing to grow and move ever forward . Fearless , inspired , always willing to try something new , what he is most concerned with is that the music is genuine , and says something real . <p> Thanks for the last five decades of music you have shared with us Keith ! 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

That was when , through the use of a- Kickstarter campaign , he got his fans response to the idea of a blues album . They responded in droves , and the album , Deja Blues was born . <p> I did my last album , " Hoey says , " to prove to myself that I could play authentic blues , and now that I feel more at home there , I felt it was time to mix my favorite guitar styles into something seamless , organic , and powerful . " This new creation , scheduled for release July 29th , on- Provogue/Mascot Label Group is all of those things and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the album took a long time to create . Hoey shared the reason for that , " Only because I was waiting for the right music and right lyrics . " Wait . Did he say lyrics ? By golly he did , and , according to him , that is also what makes this a landmark album in his eyes . Made up of 11 original tracks , only the final song , " Soul Surfer , " is an instrumental . The other ten cuts all feature his vocals as well as the blazing guitar he is best known for . His voice is strong , mature , and contains enough gravel to make it authentic . <p> The first track , " Boxcar Blues , " is described as Robert Johnson meets Led Zeppelin and begins with an electrified , open D-tuned , resonator guitar . His distorted , filtered vocals hit in just a few seconds with the opening lyrics , " Early in the morning , " done with a cry that is pure , vintage Delta . The vocal opening was the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many times he tried , he could n't improve on it . " It was just so real , " Hoey explained , " and that 's what the blues is about .

The dance floor packing , " Whos Your Daddy " is a nod to Brian Setzer , " This Time Tomorrow , " is a tribute to Robin Trower , and , his partner in rhyme , Lita Ford , makes a guest appearance on the power ballad , " Coming Home " . <p> His reverence is most sincere on the song , " Steamroller , " which is a tribute to the late , great Johnny Winter .

So , I went over to the amp , and I took the presence control knob , and I pulled the whole thing off . Robert Johnson did not have a presence control . Then I went over and turned all the treble off . Elmore James did n't  have a treble control . " <p> When describing how he channeled Winters unique vocal style , he explained that it was partly due to a fluke . His resonator guitar was perched right underneath his microphone stand so that when he sang , the vocals echoed through the reverb of the resonator and echoed back into the vocal mic .

The Gospel music on the DVD drips with raw power , and its not surprising to see why people are often judged on their " blues singer " abilities based on how they can sing gospel .

The first musical numbers the Stirrers did , the announcer had mentioned the recent departure of then-gospel star Sam Cooke . The last number the same announcer , - noticeably- older , mentions Cookes tragically early passing . <p> Overall , gospel is some of the most powerful music in American history , and the " Classic Moments in Jubilee Showcase " spotlights the cream of the crop . From the stirring Roebuck " Pops " Staples- to the overtly powerful- Jessy Dixon , the music will raise the hair on the backs of necks and lift spirits .

@@61383395 @1383395/ <h> Dudley Taft 's New " Skin and Bones " Towers Over Blues Rock <p> There are dozens of blues/rock bands in the current musical landscape , but hearing Dudley Taft is akin to ones first sighting of Mt . Ranier above his hometown of Seattle . At first , its shrouded in a bit of mystery , a little distant , then BANG , it towers over absolutely everything . Much like seeing the half-million year old volcano in person ( no picture or video can truly do it justice ) , the truth of Taft has always been in his live performances . <p> For that reason , this latest release , Skin and Bones , on his American Blues Artist Group label was intentionally done with a raw , almost live , feel instead of a pristine studio finish . Inspired by the recording practices of Neil Young , Taft says , " get the song worked up , and use one of the first takes . You can do overdubs , but do n't fuss over the little blemishes . More of the real personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft on guitar and lead vocals , Jason Patterson on drums and John Kessler providing the bass , the album was recorded in Tafts home studio over three sessions lasting a year . They worked out the arrangements on the fly , with the rhythm section right there and then overdubbed some stuff later . The " some stuff " includes lofting background vocals by Rachel Williams and Ashley Christensen as well the legendary organ work of Double Trouble veteran , Reese Wynans . <p> Taft , himself , is a gear head rock and roller whose previous projects had straight up rock hits and toured with acts such as Candlebox and Alice in Chains . However , he has a deep love and respect for more traditional blues artists including Elmore James , Lightning Hopkins and Hubert Sumlin . He also tends to empathically absorb the feelings of the places he visits and people he meets , using them as seed for future writing . This fourth album from the band clearly displays this outlook . <p> From the opening title track which emits the atmosphere of New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of visiting the great music city and birthplace of funk , R&amp;B , blues and rock and roll , without his wife by his side , the tone is set and you begin to hang on to your seat for what will surely be an E Ticket ride . <p> The true to form , Texas flavored cover of Johnny Winters " Leland Mississippi Blues " is a tribute to the master blues/rock guitarist , whereas " Fuzzy Dice " is an homage to the good luck charms , originally used in World War II bombers , that graced the rearview mirrors of hot rods for decades and " Ai n't  About the Money " ponders the question of how tough it may be for a gangster to leave the lifestyle . <p> With all his hardcore , expletive-spitting , razor sharpness , Taft is also a loving husband and pays deference to his wife in song , including " Without You " and " Mojo Woman " without losing even the smallest bit of gleaming keenness for which he is both known and loved . <p> Skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tafts use of different playing techniques and styles , his combination of finger and flat picking , complicated jazz chords , use of the slide , a Buzzmaster fuzz pedal and even over the counter pill bottles as shakers all add to the warts and all milieu . His inspirations come from sources as varied as his playing . Led Zeppelin , Queens of the Stone Age , ZZ Top and a bit of " Space Cake " all seem to have lent a hand in the writing . <p> To us , Skin and Bones is an oxymoron , intentional or not , for this album . Dudley Taft may have trimmed some fat , but there is still plenty of meat to go around the table . Released on October 16th , Skin and Bones should be at the top of your to-get list . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

I noticed there were a lot lately since I turned down the advertising they offered at $300 a week all the positive posts were filtered ! " <p> Well that caught my eye . Actually anything that has the 4 letter word Yelp in it- catches my eye , after the story I wrote last year about Louie Gs in Fife . Louie had also fallen victim to what some have called very sleazy business practices . <p> This time it was Jazzbones , which hosts some of the best blues shows in the northwest . It all started when Danno ( Rankin ) made an inquiry to Yelp 6 months ago to see about getting some better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that call did was awaken the Yelp sales beast and the cold calls began . After telling a few different sales people that the $300 a week they wanted from him was just too much for a club to pay , it appears that some of the positive comments have been filtered and then replaced with more negative comments . This makes sense since Yelp has been accused of this for years and in fact has admitted that this is part of their " Business model " . <p> Yelp " which allows the general public to review businesses , posting comments about their experiences at the establishment and rating the business " has been under attack for years because of their questionable business practices , which some call downright extortion . They have also been accused of hiring people to leave negative reviews on the pages of businesses that decide not to advertise . <p> East Bay Express reporter Kathleen Richards published a story in September of 2009 detailing some of the problems businesses in the Bay Area were having with Yelp sales calls . <p> In the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews on their sites after declining to advertise with Yelp at the cost of $299 a month . The story claimed that negative reviews were often placed near the top of the list of reviews after the business owners declined to pay the monthly fees . Some owners even claim that Yelp added negative reviews and deleted positive ones . This has been confirmed by countless other bunisses since the story first broke . All you need is the internet and Google to see what this company is about . <p> At the end of the day Rankin really just wants for Jazzbones what most of the other businesses that are being targeted by Yelp want , to be removed from their site . Unfortunately , Yelp does not allow for businesses to be removed and therein lies the big problem , being included on a website the businesses want no part of . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Like the Beck group they are also perfectly willing to make themselves a two- ( or , more accurately , one-a-half ) man show . It would seem that , if they 're to help fill the void created by the demise of Cream , they will have to find a producer ( and editor ) and some material worthy of their collective attention . " <p> These days , Led Zeppelin I is generally hailed as a masterpiece , and we cant think of any of our friends that have not owned at least one copy in one format or another . Ranked number 29 on the Rolling Stone Magazine list " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grammy Hall of Fame the following year . Jimmy Page has said that it took only 36 hours to record at a cost of approximately $3500 US . <p> One would have to marvel at this turn of events , perhaps , unless of course one was raised on Led Zeppelin . Those that were , either passed their used LPs down to their younger brothers and sisters when they bought new copies ( or CDs ) , or they bought them their own copies to revel in . Either way , it was a sacred bond between family members . Friends made sure friends knew who Zeppelin was . <p> Released on January 12th , 1969 on the Atlantic label , Led Zeppelin I ran just over 44 minutes . Three of the nine songs on the album were covers : - " I Ca n't quit You Baby " and " You Shook Me " were both Willie Dixon songs , and " Babe I 'm Gon na Leave You " was originally written by Anne Bredon . For the most part , the music here is hard edged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very aspect of their music that the group was named for . Even at that , there were moments of finesse and delicacy .

There is a deftness to the music , and even the lighter moments show a strength of direction and conviction . The music is also primal , which is another reason it is so satisfying , as it has always been . <p> Another facet of the music here that is a huge contribution to its success is the level of musicianship . John Paul Jones uses the bass for so much more than timekeeping , just as Paul McCartney had begun to do in the mid-sixties . There are places where the bass line has as much import as Pages guitar .

Like the Beck group they are also perfectly willing to make themselves a two- ( or , more accurately , one-a-half ) man show . It would seem that , if they 're to help fill the void created by the demise of Cream , they will have to find a producer ( and editor ) and some material worthy of their collective attention . " <p> These days , Led Zeppelin I is generally hailed as a masterpiece , and we cant think of any of our friends that have not owned at least one copy in one format or another . Ranked number 29 on the Rolling Stone Magazine list " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grammy Hall of Fame the following year . Jimmy Page has said that it took only 36 hours to record at a cost of approximately $3500 US . <p> One would have to marvel at this turn of events , perhaps , unless of course one was raised on Led Zeppelin . Those that were , either passed their used LPs down to their younger brothers and sisters when they bought new copies ( or CDs ) , or they bought them their own copies to revel in . Either way , it was a sacred bond between family members . Friends made sure friends knew who Zeppelin was . <p> Released on January 12th , 1969 on the Atlantic label , Led Zeppelin I ran just over 44 minutes . Three of the nine songs on the album were covers : - " I Ca n't quit You Baby " and " You Shook Me " were both Willie Dixon songs , and " Babe I 'm Gon na Leave You " was originally written by Anne Bredon . For the most part , the music here is hard edged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very aspect of their music that the group was named for . Even at that , there were moments of finesse and delicacy . Indeed , this hard and soft , this Yin and Yang , was the chiaroscuro Jimmy Page had sought to achieve . <p> This chiaroscuro is what creates the dynamic tension throughout much of the Led Zeppelin catalog ; the coiling and building , and then the release . There is a deftness to the music , and even the lighter moments show a strength of direction and conviction . The music is also primal , which is another reason it is so satisfying , as it has always been . <p> Another facet of the music here that is a huge contribution to its success is the level of musicianship . John Paul Jones uses the bass for so much more than timekeeping , just as Paul McCartney had begun to do in the mid-sixties . There are places where the bass line has as much import as Pages guitar . Speaking of Page , one can say what they will but his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminating , inspiring , and took our breath away . Bonhams drumming was like nothing that had been heard before . Even Keith Moons sticks could n't hold a candle to what Bonham was doing ; he could play three rhythm lines at once , playing lines within the lines . His playing was the stuff of wonder , genius , vision , and an insanely gifted artist . Of course , a young Robert Plant brought the perfect voice for these proceedings , and indeed , it was every bit an instrument as much as Jimmys guitar , Jones bass , and Bonzos drums . <p> Led Zeppelin I was a glimpse of things to come , a starting point . This was the dock from which a thrilling new ship launched , preparing its passengers for the incredible ride ahead . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Regular readers might recognize the name Lee is an extremely talented blues pianist who 's been blowing up the blues community the past couple years . We reviewed his album Big Boogie Voodoo in October and- interviewed him back in November . Turns out he can write too , so Lee will be contributing monthly articles on New Orleans blues and the Blues Piano ! <p> James Booker at New Orleans Jazz Festival , 1978 . Image courtesy of The Historic New Orleans Collection <p> In a region glutted with flamboyant musicians , - James Bookers reputation as both a genius and a flake- reached legendary proportions . On stage he was quite- a sight . Wearing a chrome-studded patch over his left- eye and donning a funky brocaded military coat or- cape , he performed with an improvisational frenzy that made lesser musicians- run for cover . A classically trained pianist who was regarded as the equal of- such R&amp;B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and- Jelly Roll Morton , Booker was a major influence on Dr. John and personally tutored- Harry Connick Jr . <p> Booker best described his free-flowing stride piano style as " Spiders on- the Keys . " His work with the left-hand was often so dominant that the addition- of a bass guitar was superfluous . By contrast , his right hand creations- contained seamless classical allusions and jazz-drenched boogie phrases . Yet- for all his gifts , the eccentric Booker experienced limited commercial success , - and drugs and alcohol blunted his talent before extinguishing his life . <p> James Carroll Booker III was born in New Orleans on December 17 , - 1939 . His father was a dancer from Bryan , Texas , who decided to change his- lifes work by becoming a Baptist minister and relocating to New Orleans . His- mother was raised in Mississippi , and she sang with the Baptist church Gospel- choir . With such a strong religious influence , it 's not surprising that as a kid , - James wanted to become a priest when he grew older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a relative in St. Louis while he was still a- baby . A child prodigy , he began taking classical instruction on the piano at age- six and , according to legend , began to outpace his instructors on the instrument. - At the age of 10 , he asked his mother for a trumpet . Instead , she purchased a- saxophone for him . This did n't upset the young J.C . ( as he was called by his- family ) as he was still able to teach himself the instrument ! That same year , - James was hit by a speeding ambulance and dragged for nearly 30 feet . His leg- was broken in eight places , and as a result , he would forever walk with a limp . But , - even worse , he was given morphine for the pain . This was an early introduction- to drugs , which would play a hard role throughout his life . Years later , James- would tell his friends that he became hooked on morphine during the recovery- process , setting into motion decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the youngsters instrumental brilliance . By 12 , he had- mastered the piano . He could sit down and play Bachs three-part inventions , - not hammering it like a child but playing it with all the sophistication that would have made Bach proud . <p> James ' father died in 1953 and he returned to New Orleans , along with- his sister , to live with their mother . Enrolled at Xavier Preparatory School , he- was classmates with Allen Toussaint and Art Neville . He was a very intelligent- student , especially in math , Spanish and music classes . And , while still in- school , he put together his first band , Booker Boy and the Rhythmaires , which- also included Art Neville . <p> About the same time , his sister Betty Jean was performing as a Gospel- singer at the radio station WMRY every Sunday afternoon . James began to- hang out at the studio while his sister was on the air . Soon the station- managers discovered that he could play the piano and James became a regular- performer himself on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was- quite impressive , often performing complicated numbers by composers such as- Bach and Rachmaninoff . Eventually , the entire Booker Boy and the- Rhythmaires became the featured artists on the show . Impressed by the- broadcasts , Dave Bartholomew signed the young keyboard ace to Imperial- Records in 1954 . Billed as " Little Booker , " he released his first single , " Doing- the Hambone . " At 14 James was the youngest artist ever to record for the- label . The single did n't sell very well , but Bartholomew did see promise in the- young pianist , Especially with his ability to play in the styles of many popular- artists of the time . One of Imperials biggest stars was Fats Domino , who was- constantly in demand for live performances . Bartholomew decided to use- Booker in the studio to record the piano tracks for Fats Domino , so when Fats- returned home , all the hit-maker needed to do was to lay down the vocal parts. - Bookers talents were also noticed by Paul Gayten , Chess Records A&amp;R man- and a performer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scheduled a- session for Booker and Art Neville . They were to be billed as Arthur and- Booker , but Neville was unable to make the date and was replaced by Arthur- Booker ( no relation to James ) . The single " Heavenly Angel " was released , but- much like - " Hambone " , it did n't  catch on either . <p> Over the next few years , James went on the road , playing with many of the popular bands of the day . Unlike Fats Dominos constant life on the road , - Huey " Piano " Smith did not like to travel at all . Again , because of James gift- for sounding like other performers , he went on tour throughout the South- making appearances as Huey Smith . It was a win-win situation for both of- them , and sometimes he even performed local gigs when Smith accidentally- double-booked himself . James also did several tours with people like Earl King , - Shirley &amp; Lee and Joe Tex . <p> It was through Joe Tex , Booker was introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with Ace Records . But , the- partnership did not last long . Booker had recorded " Teenage Rock " and " Open- The Door " for Ace , but still did not receive much fanfare . A third number was- recorded and Booker discovered Vincent dubbing it with Joe Texs vocals over- his own . That was enough for him , and he dissolved their contract based on the- grounds that he was under-aged and could not legally sign it for himself. - Disenchanted with the recording industry , Booker left New Orleans and enrolled- in Baton Rouges Southern University in 1960 . <p> Involvement with heavy drugs began to take its toll on Booker , - so he returned to performing in order to make money to supply his habit . Traveling to Houston , he began working for Don Robey at the Duke/Peacock label . H e recorded an organ-driven instrumental single titled " Gonzo , " - named for a character in the film " The Pusher . " The single hit the charts on- November 13 , 1960 , and remained there for 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the only time in his career where he would chart as- a solo performer . <p> Throughout the 1960s , James Booker would work with a number of- reputed artists on tour and in the studio . Among these were Little Richard , - Bobby Bland , Junior Parker , Lloyd Price , Wilson Pickett and B.B. King . He- traveled to New York , where he recorded for Atlantic Records with Jerry- Wexler , on albums by King Curtis and Aretha Franklin ( who included Bookers- own composition , " So Swell When Youre Well " ) . Wexler also spent time- recording James as a solo artist , but these tracks have never been released. - During the late 1960s , Booker also worked with his life-long friend , - Mac Rebennack , known better as Dr. John . The two had known each other- since the 1950s , often working together in Cosimo Matassas New Orleans- studios with Dave Bartholomew . Bookers stage presence started becoming- more eccentric also , wearing wigs , capes , eye patches and even a glass eye for- his missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on who- tells it . Some say it was drug-related , but Dr. John claims in his autobiography- that Booker lost the eye after pulling a scam on some record producers theyd- written arrangements for . Booker had somehow conned the producers into- paying for their services three times and was pushing his luck with a fourth- attempt . The producers caught on , though , and had Booker beaten up so badly- that he lost the eye . Booker was said to comment afterward , " If I lost the other- eye , too , then I might be able to play as well as Ray Charles or Art Tatum. " - Booker was always a handful for Dr. John . He consistently upstaged- the other performers in the band , and was quite open with his homosexuality , - often hitting on those assigned to share his room or to bringing men to the- room who he picked up on the road , much to the horror of his roommates. - Drugs also took their toll on his dependency to make shows . Finally , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks pay . Dr. John claims- that once he left the band , James went to Joe Tex , Fats Domino and Marvin- Gaye each , and agreed to take a role in their respective bands . He was given- two-weeks advance pay from each , only to run off back to New Orleans . <p> The famous Dew Drop Inn in New Orleans <p> There his life- took a drastic change. - Outside of the citys- famed Dew Drop Inn , - Booker was arrested- for possession of- heroin and was- sentenced to serve- two years at Angola- Prison . While an- inmate , he worked in- the prisons library- and also developed a- musical program- within the system . His- efforts paid off , and he- was granted parole after only serving six months . When he returned to New- Orleans , he found that the music scene had hit a slump and was not very- prosperous . Seeking work , he violated his parole by leaving the state and moved to New York , and later Los Angeles , working as a session man on- recordings by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Brown , - and T-Bone Walker . After being cleared of parole violations in 1975 , he- returned to New Orleans to resume his own recording career . Now singing as- well as playing , he scored an immediate critical success with Junco Partner , his- first album for the Island Records subsidiary Hannibal . Starting out with- Bookers instrumental take on Chopin ( Black Minuet Waltz ' ) and rolling through- Leadbellys Good Night Irene ' sets the listener up for the best of Booker . The- title song in Bookers rendition , is a lyrically disturbing work , touching on the- grip of heroin and cocaine on this talented mans life , summoned by a rolling lefthand bass lines and right-hand filigree . He appeared at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage- Festival in 1975 , where he drew the attention of record scouts . Booker was- suddenly regarded as the talented musician that he always had been . He began tutoring a- young politicians son by the name of Harry Connick , Jr. , whom Booker saw a- resemblance to himself as a child prodigy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its fine showing of Bookers dexterity , performing- music ranging from Chopin to Earl King , alongside his own material ( something- that came quite easily for Booker , as he often combined classical and modern- music in his stage act , as well , often within the same song ) . - This also led to Bookers traveling to Europe for the first time , to appear- in several festivals . His performance at the Boogie Woogie and Ragtime Piano- Contest in Zurich , Switzerland was recorded in 1976 , and released as - New- Orleans Piano Wizard : Live ! The recording was a triumph for Booker , honored- with the Grand Prix de Disque de Jazz award as best live album in 1977 . He- followed that up with more European shows the next year , including the- illustrious Montreux International Jazz Festival . <p> When Booker returned home , he was a changed man . He no longer- adorned the extravagant capes or eye patches , - and his mental condition was- beginning to fail . He often checked himself into the mental ward at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows were becoming more and- more erratic . Though he was now a featured performer at the Maple Leaf Bar , - working with the astounding team of Johnny Vidacovich on drums , bass player- John Singleton , and saxophonist Alvin " Red " Tyler , the shows did not always- come across . When they did , Booker was arguably the best the city had ever- seen ( captured magnificently on the posthumous releases , Resurrection Of- The Bayou Maharajah and Spiders On The Keys ) . But , too often , he would- refuse to play , or would walk off-stage mid-set and occasionally even vomited- onto his own piano keys . The crowds began to disappear . <p> Rounder Records decided to record Booker in 1982 . The sessions almost- seemed doomed before anything even took place . A week prior to the session- dates , Booker collapsed in a seizure and was admitted to Charity Hospital . His- condition seemed to worsen , and he was transferred to Southern Baptist- Hospital where it was determined that his liver had suffered irreparable- damage after years of alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the recording dates , but the first day he refused to play , the- second he appeared unable to , and , on the third , he returned in spirits as if he- had never been sick in his life . that day he laid down more than enough tracks for the- album that would become Classified . Two days later , Booker disappeared , - only to be found several days later jailed for disturbing the peace . <p> Booker tried to take on a more acceptable lifestyle . He took a job with City- Hall as a clerk , typing and filing in 1983 . But , he soon began drinking again- despite his liver ailment , - and lost the job . He still had his Maple Leaf gigs , but- he began missing them altogether . The last show he performed there was on- October 31 , 1983 , with only five patrons in attendance . For the next show on- November 7th , he did n't  show up at all . <p> On November 8 , 1983 , James Booker took a deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven to Charity Hospital and left in the emergency- waiting room in a wheelchair where he sat undiscovered for nearly a half - hour .

The funeral for James Carroll Booker III was- sparsely attended with very few floral arrangements . He was laid to rest in a- family plot at Providence Memorial Park in nearby Metarie , Louisiana .

How do we get everybody here to come out to this event ?

" <p> Blues-based is putting it mildly . The 100-plus acts that play the annual gig are mostly from the South ; Mississippi in particular , ranging from teenagers to those in their 90s. - It is the real deal in Delta blues and unlike anything else in the world . <p> Stolle is quick to say , " The beauty of it is , that we mix all these people together based around the blues and small town fair components .

In providing context for these findings , Marie explores what historically readied this generation particularly for blues music and its subtle mood-enhancing , cathartic qualities . <p> The book further highlights how blues is uniquely powerful at expressing paradoxical emotional realities that are difficult to put into words . Involvement with blues offers respite from a mindset that has left an entire generation as emotional refugees , feeling that they work hard , follow the rules for engagement professionally and privately , and still often " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Blues interaction offers another way of relating in which non-competitive qualities are front and center .

He is once again touring the US and internationally with his band , and Marie will donate all proceeds from The Blues Why it Still Hurts so Good , to the HART Fund , serving musicians without health insurance . <p> In her words : <p> It is important for Walter and I to give back to the community that literally and figuratively bought stock in Walter 's liver .

This being the case , the crowd was small when opener Bobby Lee Rodgers took to the stage , which was a shame because Rodgers played a great set !

Any time Sumlins name comes up among musicians , everyone discusses his playing , basically summed up with Jimmy Pages comment , " I love Hubert Sumlin . He always played the right thing at the right time . " After this discussion , almost without exception , everyone smiles and someone says " Yeah . Everyone loves Hubert . " <p> He was born Hubert Charles Sumlin on November 16 , 1931 in Greenwood , Mississippi , but he was raised in Hughes , Arkansas . The future guitar hero began playing the instrument at eight years old . He first encountered Chester Arthur Burnett , a.k.a. , Howlin Wolf , as a youngster when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Sumlin accepted Wolfs invitation to come to come to Chicago and be his second guitar . When Jody Williams , Wolfs lead guitarist left in 1955 , Sumlin became the lead guitarist . Except for a relatively brief spell when he played with the great Muddy Waters , he was the main guitarist for Wolf for the rest of his career . <p> In The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music , Paul Du Noyer describes Sumlins playing as " wrenched , shattering bursts of notes , sudden cliff-hanger silences and daring rhythmic suspensions . " Indeed , he was known for bursts of joy emanating assertively his fretboard , being barely contained in the listening space in which he was performing . His guitar expressions were boundless excursions into aspects of the blues vernacular that reached into a listeners very heart , tugging its strings , and saying " Hello . That 's right ; let it out . Its gon na be alright . " Like Miles Davis , he also believed that silence was an instrument too , saying as much as the played notes . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and Sumlin were friends , and had great respect for each other and each others abilities . " We were like father and son , although we had some tremendous fights . He knocked my teeth out , and I knocked his out . None of it mattered ; we always got right back together . " <p> As Howlin Wolf was a link to the past artists such as Robert Johnson , Sumlins work with him was cited as an inspiration by a whole new generation of artists including Eric Clapton , Keith Richards , Jimi Hendrix , Jimmie Vaughan , Robert Cray , and others . <p> Perhaps what so endeared Sumlin to everyone was his humility and sense of humor . Always ready to show players a new lick or two , he was just as eager to learn from them . <p> Inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 2008 , Sumlin was nominated for four Grammy Awards between 1999 and 2010 . He also earned several Blues Music Awards . Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 43 in on their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert Sumlin left us on December 4th , 2011 , at 80 years old .

His passing left a huge hole in the fabric of the music community that is still felt today , but his music lives and brings joy to all who hear it . Upon his passing , Mick Jagger and Keith Richards paid for his funeral expenses . <p> Of his playing Sumlin said , " When I 'm reaching an audience , I feel it . " As to doing what he did , he summed it up like this : " Do anything you wan na do " but from the heart . Music is a thing from the heart , from the soul , just like anything else you do , man .

American Blues Scene was fortunate enough to attend the St. Petersburg show . <p> Attending any outdoor music event in Florida is an experience to be remembered .

Two stages were set up side by side down front so that as one act finished , the next would begin . For the most part , this worked fairly well . <p> The event did start a tad bit late due to people not being admitted until about 10 minutes prior to start time . This being the case , the crowd was small when opener Bobby Lee Rodgers took to the stage , which was a shame because Rodgers played a great set !

Any time Sumlins name comes up among musicians , everyone discusses his playing , basically summed up with Jimmy Pages comment , " I love Hubert Sumlin . He always played the right thing at the right time . " After this discussion , almost without exception , everyone smiles and someone says " Yeah . Everyone loves Hubert . " <p> He was born Hubert Charles Sumlin on November 16 , 1931 in Greenwood , Mississippi , but he was raised in Hughes , Arkansas . The future guitar hero began playing the instrument at eight years old . He first encountered Chester Arthur Burnett , a.k.a. , Howlin Wolf , as a youngster when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Sumlin accepted Wolfs invitation to come to come to Chicago and be his second guitar . When Jody Williams , Wolfs lead guitarist left in 1955 , Sumlin became the lead guitarist . Except for a relatively brief spell when he played with the great Muddy Waters , he was the main guitarist for Wolf for the rest of his career . <p> In The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music , Paul Du Noyer describes Sumlins playing as " wrenched , shattering bursts of notes , sudden cliff-hanger silences and daring rhythmic suspensions . " Indeed , he was known for bursts of joy emanating assertively his fretboard , being barely contained in the listening space in which he was performing . His guitar expressions were boundless excursions into aspects of the blues vernacular that reached into a listeners very heart , tugging its strings , and saying " Hello . That 's right ; let it out . Its gon na be alright . " Like Miles Davis , he also believed that silence was an instrument too , saying as much as the played notes . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and Sumlin were friends , and had great respect for each other and each others abilities . " We were like father and son , although we had some tremendous fights . He knocked my teeth out , and I knocked his out . None of it mattered ; we always got right back together . " <p> As Howlin Wolf was a link to the past artists such as Robert Johnson , Sumlins work with him was cited as an inspiration by a whole new generation of artists including Eric Clapton , Keith Richards , Jimi Hendrix , Jimmie Vaughan , Robert Cray , and others . <p> Perhaps what so endeared Sumlin to everyone was his humility and sense of humor . Always ready to show players a new lick or two , he was just as eager to learn from them . <p> Inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 2008 , Sumlin was nominated for four Grammy Awards between 1999 and 2010 . He also earned several Blues Music Awards . Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 43 in on their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert Sumlin left us on December 4th , 2011 , at 80 years old . Even today , following in his steps on the fretboard is a necessary journey for any blues guitarist , especially one seeking to understand Chicago blues . His passing left a huge hole in the fabric of the music community that is still felt today , but his music lives and brings joy to all who hear it . Upon his passing , Mick Jagger and Keith Richards paid for his funeral expenses . <p> Of his playing Sumlin said , " When I 'm reaching an audience , I feel it . " As to doing what he did , he summed it up like this : " Do anything you wan na do " but from the heart . Music is a thing from the heart , from the soul , just like anything else you do , man .

There 's the rock of Wolfmother , and the insane skills of guitarist extraordinaire Tommy Emmanuel . Indeed , there is no shortage of great music being written and performed in Australia , finding its way to the rest of the world . <p> There is a new wave of Australian music gaining traction in America . This wave is washing over our shores and across our vast sonic landscape carrying new forms of rock and blues along with it . <p> For those who clamor for a new interpretation of the blues instead of trying to replicate Muddy Waters material note-for-note for the one millionth time , artists like Peter D.

I was also inspired by a pretty wide range of players and styles like Little Walter , Sugar Blue , and Stevie Wonder who guide me in my harmonica playing . " <p> Although he was born in the United Kingdom , he would grow up in Perth , in Western Australia , where there was a vibrant music scene , with blues and folk being especially ubiquitous . It was his grandfather who first introduced him to the harp . Later , he would move to Melbourne , Victoria , releasing his first album , Tears of Ice .

He would also release several albums with the Blind Pig label including Day by Day , and Stand Together , both of which cemented his ever-growing reputation as an outstanding harp player . <p> Eventually , Harper established a home in the US in Grass Lake , Michigan . Recently , Harper and his Detroit-based band Midwest Kind , have released their latest album Show Your Love , on his own Bluharp Records label . Harper wanted to ensure that the material on this new album would appeal to the widest possible audience , so he and the band " road tested " the songs , playing them for venue and festival goers during their touring adventures . The verdict ? Harper and company are serving up a new , world perspective on blues , and fans and critics alike are eating it up ! <p> Another Australian , Ivor S.K. brings his unique vision to acoustic , delta-inspired blues .

It can be ( and in a lot of instances it is ) argued that blues and jazz indeed had their earliest beginnings in Congo Square . <p> His love and respect for the city and its musical history is apparent in the music he gives us . Listeners fall into his work , losing themselves in the sparsely recorded and produced compositions , traveling a timeless road that opens before them .

So , every year , we try to utilize as many of the surviving juke joints as possible in Clarksdale for the nighttime portion of the event . We also typically feature a different juke joint venue on our poster each year . Authentic jukes in this years 8th annual fest include Reds Lounge , Club 2000 , Messengers , Delta Blues Room , Anniebelles Lounge and Petes Grill . Were also using the historic New Roxy theater building where acts like Sam Cooke once performed and world-famous Ground Zero Blues Club , which emulates a juke joint . To help attendees make it to as many of the nighttime venues as possible , we also have 4 nighttime shuttle buses and a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you into 19 venues for over 20 acts plus unlimited rides on the shuttles . Editors note : yes , he really means an actual train ! It runs from downtown Clarksdale to the Shack up Inn , a wildly popular visitor destination , a couple of miles away . <p> How long has Juke Joint Fest been going on , and what motivated you to start the festival ? <p> A stage in front of Miss Dell 's General Store on Delta Avenue <p> Local Clarksdale businessman Bubba OKeefe and I started Juke Joint Festival 8 years ago . We wanted to add a spring event for both locals and tourists , promote the Deltas indigenous blues music and acts , and raise awareness to the plight of our disappearing juke joint culture . Every year , the fest has gotten bigger and better . Also , since we started the festival , more jukes and clubs have begun booking more regular live music . And more businesses have opened up downtown . It all works together annual festivals and day-to-day businesses . We need both . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the top along with dozens of fantastic volunteers and lots of very helpful sponsors and supporters . <p> Which acts and special things should folks watch out for when they 're at Juke Joint ? <p> There are so many great acts and special events going on in and around Juke Joint Festival this year , but here are a few things to put on the essential list : <p> If you ask this question to folks in Clarksdale , they will tell you that this has grown to be the towns biggest single yearly event . Whether or not that is actually true does n't  really matter . What they 're really saying both blues fans and non-fans , both tourist businesses and " traditional " businesses is that they see footsteps and positive results from the festival . It impacts them , personally and professionally , more than any other event or happening in the town or the region . Sales tax receipts are way up . All of the hotels rooms are booked . Folks eat , shop , drink , listen to music , gas up cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultural exchange that goes on . Its infectious and leads to more events , more businesses , and more return visitors . When we go to the Mayor and City Commissioners each year to ask official permission to shut down all the downtown streets and put on the massive blues event , they smile when we walk into the board room and , honestly , ask US what WE need . Juke Joint Festivals success lies in the fact that it is a positive event that appeals to locals and tourists from all walks of life . It is very inclusive and provides Clarksdale with a platform to reach the world . Clarksdale is an awesome little town with a lot of living blues culture and true Southern hospitality . Juke Fest is our invitation to come down yall and check it out for yourselves .

@@61383581 @1383581/ <h> Remembering the Fillmore East The Church of Rock and Roll <p> The legendary concert promoter , Bill Graham , had a grand vision . His dream included concert venues on both coasts that would be destination points for music lovers to see the greatest acts of their time . Graham was already running two venues in San Francisco . The Fillmore Auditorium sat on the corner of Fillmore Street and Geary Boulevard while the Fillmore West , formerly the Carousel Ballroom , took up residence at 10 South Van Ness Avenue . <p> He then set his sights on New York City . On the Lower East Side of Manhattan , now known as the East Village , sat an already historic theater , The Commodore . Originally a Yiddish performance venue built in the mid-1920s , The Commodore had undergone some changes , becoming The Village movie theater and eventually falling into disrepair . It had a deceptively small marquee and entrance facade , but held almost 2,700 people when Graham took it over in 1967 . <p> On March 8th , 1968 , The Fillmore East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts being Big Brother and the Holding Company , Tim Buckley and Albert King . Graham made sure that as many people as possible would see his shows by booking triple-bill acts for two shows each , several nights a week . Bands were booked , and expected to play shows at 8 pm and again at 11 pm on Friday and Saturday nights . He would also regularly alternate acts between his East and West coast venues . <p> An integral part of many of the shows was the addition of psychedelic art lighting projected on a backdrop behind the performers . The most renowned crew providing these effects was the The Joshua Light Show , created by electrical engineer and theater lighting student , Joshua White . His five person team used a combination of film , slide and overhead projectors , color wheels , water and oil colors and glass crystals to create a trailblazing liquid light show . So talented were these technicians and so popular their work , that they were often paid as much as headlining acts and received billing along with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and the sell-out crowds . It seemed that everyone from Frank Zappa to Howdy Doody creator , Buffalo Bob Smith played The Fillmore East . The location became so well liked that National Education Television brought their cameras out and recorded a show for broadcast in 1970 . <p> The list of artists who played the Fillmore East reads like a who 's who of popular music . Jazz greats Miles Davis , Buddy Rich , Dizzy Gillespie and Nina Simone all played there . Early heavy metal band Black Sabbath , shared the same weekend stage as the J. Geils Band . One could see acoustic blues man John Hammond , Louisiana fiddle player , Doug Kershaw , and blues rock giants Ten Years After all in one night . Imagine , if you will , spending a June evening to witness Albert King and Chuck Berry open for The Who . The hodgepodge mixture of artists and genres on any given night was as much part of the charm as the near acoustic perfection of the facility . <p> Graham , master promoter that he was , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " 3 Kings " on various dates , Buddy Guy , Junior Wells , Bobby " Blue " Bland , Johnny Winter , John Mayall , Paul Butterfield , Luther Allison , Odetta , and a host of other blues giants took their turns on stage during the Fillmores three year run . <p> Of course there were groups who played there more than others . Taj Mahal played 8 shows at the theater , the Grateful Dead played a total of 43 , and the blues dripping pioneers of southern rock , the Allman Brothers Band played so often that they became known as " Bill Grahams House Band . " That , obviously , included the weekend of March 12th and 13th , 1971 , when the Allmans recorded their iconic , first live album , At Fillmore East . <p> They were not the only band to do so , however . The acoustics at the auditorium were so exceptional that no fewer than 33 bands recorded live albums there .

As stated earlier , guitar luminary , Albert King was on the bill for the very first show and he also played the very last , along with the J. Geils Band and the Allman Brothers . Special , surprise guests Edgar Winters White Trash , Mountain , Country Joe McDonald and the Beach Boys also performed at the invitation only performance , simulcast on New York radio stations WPLJ and WNEW . Stating financial reasons and a " need to find himself , " Graham forever closed the doors . <p> Although several investors tried to regain the glory days of the rock church , they were unsuccessful with both concert venues and nightclubs .

In 1928 the family emigrated to the United States , changing their name to Chess .

How did you get interested in this ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 as the year of the blues . It occurred to me that , while that 's a very nice idea , inherently any year of the blues has an expiration date . It seemed obvious that they sold us pretty short with that initiative and it occurred to me then there ought to be some sort of annual celebration of the blues , not just in America but possibly worldwide . I waited a few more years , and I did n't notice anyone taking the initiative . <p> Then a few months ago I happened to be reading the Sunday paper , and they announced it was International Lefty Day . It occurred to me right then and there I 'm tired of living in a world that has an International Lefty Day and a National Empanada Day and no International Blues Music Day . It was a wake-up call to me to see if I could get something started . I sat down and started the FaceBook petition group . I just added all my friends and asked them to add their friends , and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over a month . We 're approaching our first big goal of 10,000 members in just a few short months . It definitely caught on quick and appears to be very widely supported . <p> Have you heard from folks around the world in support of this effort ? <p> Absolutely . Some of the first interviews I did were in Polish and German magazines . On radio , public service announcements have been picked up in several countries . Our group members consist of thousands of supporters , fans , musicians , and societies all over the world . I 'm sure there 's upwards of 40 countries involved at this point . The excitement in other countries is as big as it is here in the U.S. <p> Having said that , I think everybody understands that the origins of the music are here . As we develop the idea into an actual event , we 'll do our part to remind people of the importance of the origins of the music and how all the classic and iconic artists came from the U.S. , but ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's celebrated , played , and promoted in many many countries and , now with social networking , there 's no reason for it not to be an international effort and celebration . <p> You had told me that once you get 10,000 members on the FaceBook page , you had some concrete steps you were going to take then . What are some of your plans once you hit that milestone ? <p> You have to first understand that this idea is a dream . How the dream comes to fruition remains to be seen . I know that I 'm going to have to reach out to a lot of institutions that can play a supportive role , and I figure our best bet of garnering that support will be to show them a petition with 10,000 supporting members from around the world . <p> I want to be sure we have that strong statement to make when we reach out to those organizations , but I can tell you already that we 've heard from blues societies all over the United States and countries around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Blues Music Day . <p> If I had to sum it up , I 'd say the first thing I 'm going to do is reach out to the blues societies and institutions that want to get involved in organizing events for this day , because that 's the biggest thing " having worldwide events for people to go celebrate the blues . Because this is grassroots and we the blues community are the ones ultimately going to declare this day , it 's also we -the blues community that I 've got to organize the events around . For that we do n't need any outside permission , but we do need support , especially when we take things to the next level of trying to get the United States Congress , the United Nations , and other governments around the world to endorse it in an official way . That 's more of a long-term process . <p> The short-term process is to keep spreading the word about the initiative , pick a date that 's widely supported , and associate with organizations around the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day . That will be what Year One looks like . I know as president of the New York City Blues Society , I 'm going to plan a tremendous event here in NYC for my part for the inauguration . We 're planning some media spectacles , you could say , to draw some attention to the cause . Through these associations with these other blues organizations , we will come up with creative programming ideas that will not just be small-scale blues events , but hopefully will bring in media attention ; events that could potentially grow from year to year . <p> When I first started the group , one of the questions we posed was the date . We heard from a lot of people who felt that it should land on this or that blues legend 's birthday . Ultimately since you 'll never get anyone to agree on one birthday , and also since having it on one birthday will distract from the fact that this is an International Blues Music Day ; it 's not a memorial for one blues legend . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present and future of the genre and everything about the genre . <p> Having it on Robert Johnson 's birthday would turn it into a Robert Johnson memorial . I had to think of a way to bring people together on a day that was n't an obvious date . First of all we know we want to have warm weather , so winter is out . Having it in early spring brings a nice sense of renewal " sort of leads into the blues festival season and Blues Music Awards . This would be a great way to help bring awareness to all those other events as well . We have n't decided officially on a date . It was deductive reasoning . We may end up pushing it to mid-summer ; it remains to be seen . <p> I want to hear from people who know more than I do about these kinds of things . I want to speak to the Blues Foundation and some of the larger blues societies around the world and see how they feel about it . The most important thing is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can agree on . The first task that lies before us once we reach 10,000 members is stamping down that date . Then we have something we can start organizing for . We could have it on the first Saturday in April " having it on Saturday opens up a whole weekend of events , but then it falls on a different day every year . <p> The Blues Foundation seems like a natural fit as a supporter of the idea . Have you heard from anybody from that organization ? <p> I have n't reached out to any of the relevant large institutions yet , because I 'm waiting for us to reach 10,000 members . I can tell you that three-quarters of the Blues Foundation board members are already in the group , so they essentially have signed the petition . We probably also have about 3000 members of the Blues Foundation in our group , so I think it 's safe to assume from the top down and the bottom up , The Blues Foundation supports the idea at least in spirit . <p> As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't know until I actually speak to them , but I 'm very confident that they 'll support the idea and help us possibly figure out a good day to land on and ultimately help us promote it . Maybe they could even get involved in sponsoring an event on their own . The reason I 'm not concerned about the Blues Foundation involvement is the fact that this initiative starts with the fans and musicians , the supporters around the world , so there 's no one organization that can stop us and there 's also very little reason to think any organization would n't support this idea because there 's no downside to it . It helps everybody . <p> The potential effects of it are so great that I would be overly shocked if anybody involved in the blues genre as a fan or the blues industry did n't support this . I have n't come across it yet and we literally have a who 's who of the industry , as well as many legends in the group . There 's every reason to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day at a time and do what needs to be done . <p> What do you think is the universal appeal of an inherently American music form ? <p> It 's undeniable that it 's influenced many other genres of music . You might as well ask me why rock and roll appeals to people all over the world . I think people have had enough time to get into the fact that rock and roll was born out of the blues as they 've gone on their own journeys of blues discoveries . If you just look at the U.K. for example , the British Invasion of the past and the many artists coming out presently , it 's just something that really caught on .

The way to do that is to get the word out about the FaceBook petition group so when we do have to speak to the powers that be , we can show them how widely supported this initiative is . <p> Add your friends to the group ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keep this grassroots word of mouth growing .

We 'll know where to find everybody and be ready to go . <p> We 're also launching a wonderful interactive website for International Blues Music Day as soon as we land on a date . Once we launch the website , there will be ways to support the idea , whether it 's associating as an organizer or sponsoring an event in your own country , city , or town ; playing at an event ; or contributing ideas . There will be several calls to action in the near future , but we 're not ready to announce those yet . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

In our office , blues music graces the airwaves nearly 24 hours a day , from hundreds of albums that have been sent to us . Its hard enough to pick which incredible albums we can review with our limited time constraints , but picking the ten best ? Well , we took a stab at it then woke up at 3:00 in the morning with cold sweats about who we forgot . Thank god this only happens once a year ! <p> Mikes Thoughts on his List : Top ten lists are silly &amp; arguably pointless . For example , this one ! Its just my opinion . And my opinion will probably change in ten minutes or so . But right now , I feel like these were the best blues albums of 2012 . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's considered blues these days covers a huge spectrum of music from acoustic blues to Southern Soul to blues rock . There 's great music being made in all these- sub-genres and they 're all represented in the list . But it was a particularly strong year for albums that manages to stay within a traditional blues band context and still advance the sound . <h> Mikes List <p> Linsey Alexander Been There Done That I 'd never heard of Linsey Alexander before this record was released , but he s been on the Chicago blues scene for decades mixing soulful grooves with deep blues . His voice occasionally brings Otis Rush to mind . Its great to discover new artists making music this good . <p> Gary Clark Jr . Blak and Blue One of the most inventive young talents can play Hendrix-inspired rock , blues or whatever else he wants . This is a superb collection of songs and Clark is at his best when playing the blues . Its not all blues , but it should appeal to almost all blues fans . <p> Reverend Peyton 's Big Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charley Patton album , the Rev went with all originals on this release . There 's almost no one playing the blues with as much energy as Peyton and this set of songs is a perfect showcase for the trios rambunctious sound mixing blues with other traditional roots music . <p> Boo Hanks with Don Flemons Buffalo Junction Another amazing piedmont blues player recording for Music Maker . - Its great to hear someone still playing in the style ( and with the spirit ) of Blind Boy Fuller and Blind Blake . - Now in his eighties , Hanks sounds great . The Carolina Chocolate Drops Don Flemons adds bones , harmonica , or whatevers necessary to fill out the music and urge Hanks along . <p> Carl Marshall Going Back to the Blues Marshall has been a star on the Southern Soul circuit for years . He digs a little deeper into the blues on this one . Its a traditional sound , but filled with modern flourishes ( even the vocoder sounds good ) . In Marshalls hands it all sounds natural and filled with soul . Guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of the blues . <p> Heritage Blues Orchestra and still i rise This set of traditional songs is played with arrangements that make them totally modern in unique ways . The horn section adds a New Orleans jazz feel to several numbers , but everything here is pure blues . This is a- different- kind of sound , simultaneously spirited and- melancholy . The vocals of Bill Sims , Jr. , Junior Mack , and Chaney Sims all sound like somebody speaking comfortably in a language theyve always known . <p> Otis Taylor Contraband Another amazing album of dark hypnotic blues from Otis Taylor . Taylor explores race , slavery , history , war , and love through amazing individual stories . Its easy to get lost in this music , but the lyrics always bring me back to the world we live in . <p> Lurrie Bell The Devil Ai n't Got No Music . These are all songs about religion : some are traditional gospel , others explore how religion is perceived and practiced from the viewpoint of a bluesman . As always , Lurrie sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything Lurrie Bell has recorded , but this one is special . <p> Shemekia Copeland 33 G " Another really solid album from Shemekia featuring songs from an eclectic group of sources including some particularly strong ones from manager John Hahn . At age 33 , she seems to have hit upon that perfect balance of soul and rocking , using her incredible vocal strength without trying to overpower the songs . <p> We Juke Up in Here soundtrack This documentary explored what 's remaining of- Mississippi- juke joint culture . The good news is that every second of raw blues music featured in the film is amazing . The CD is only available with the DVD , which in our opinion is the only way to go anyways . Highlights includes songs from Louis " Gearshifter " Youngblood and Big A and the All-Stars. 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

His sound is reminiscent of the colorful tones of James Cotton , one of his many idols , and he brings a new and youthful vigor to traditional blues and makes it his own but he did n't  grow up on the blues . <p> " I was n't really subjected to a lot of black music , " he said . " We did n't  have guitars or harmonicas or anything like that . I was fifteen , you know that was back in 1997 , and Blues Traveler was on top 40 radio , which is what most teenagers listened to .

There are stories about musicians who have a voice and a talent , so they venture to a bigger city , one that fits their particular taste in music and their style to pursue their passion , and this is what Santini did . Memphis opened up a whole new world to him . <p> What do you think of Little Walter ? You know , he was an innovator of the instrument . He got to play big sounds on harmonica and amplifying them , and you know , he s often credited as possibly being the first guy to amplify his harmonica , which I do n't  believe is true , but his tone and what he was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Big Pete ?

I especially love his older stuff . That stuff is incredible . The way he plays harmonica was with a lot of reckless abandon , but he makes it work . He has a lot of energy to it , he blows hard , he has a great tone , and I love his energy ! <p> And tell me about Kim Wilson . I 'd say Kim was one of the greatest true living harp players today .

" There 's a lot of great talent . Victor Wainright and JP Soars , all those guys . I like what they 're doing right now . They 're doing a great job getting music out , and as far as harmonica players , Dennis Gruenling is definitely one of my favorites . " <p> For the day , Santini was traveling through Indianapolis on a tour , and that night he and the band would be performing at Buddy Guys Legends , and then afterward , they were heading to Wisconsin . " The years shaping up , " he said optimistically . " We have a 3 week tour down in Florida in March and a handful of festivals coming up . 2013 was an incredible year ; the album was released , the radio play , the Blues Blast Award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts for three months in a row !

" A lot of people are asking when the next record is coming out , " he says . " I 'm hoping to focus on that a little bit more soon . " <p> Having nominations for two blues Music Awards this year , the Contemporary blues Album and Harmonica Player of the Year , its amazing to know that the moment his career took a step forward was when , after he saw the kind of harmonica John Hopper was playing , he asked his mom to go the music store so he could buy a harmonica. 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Of course , I eventually found out about his rock royalty bloodlines and that made the story all the better since I 've been a life long Allman Brothers fan . Then in 2011 , he was part of forming- the phenomenal supergroup , Royal Southern Brotherhood , and watching them rise up these last few years has been a blast . <p> On Devons 2013 album Turquoise , he gave us a taste of what he is capable of , and though he is his own man and his own musician , there is no mistaking where he got his talent from- - at least genetically .

Its not too far removed from the original and that totally worked for me with him showing that he can tackle legendary tunes and own them . <p> Musical genius and Grammy winner Tom Hambridge ( Buddy Guy , Johnny Winter , James Cotton , George Thorogood ) was brought in to work his magic on Ragged &amp; Dirty , and did he ever .

@@61383706 @1383706/ <h> Rolling Stones Announce Their New Blues Album Release <p> As we reported six months ago , the Rolling Stones have returned to their blues roots . Yesterday , the band announced the release of their 30th studio album , Blue &amp; Lonesome , on the Polydor label . Their first studio release in over a decade will drop world-wide on December 2nd , 2016 , however , it is available for- pre-order now . <p> It took only three days for Mick and the boys to record the new release , probably because the material is over 50 years old and they 've been playing it that long themselves . With some help from touring sidemen , bassist Darryl Jones , and keyboardists Chuck Leavell and Matt Clifford , Blue &amp; Lonesome was recorded at British Grove Studios in West London . That 's near the very same neighborhood where they cut their teeth on the blues back in the early 60s , playing the pubs in Richmond and Eel Pie Island . <p> As luck would have it , old friend of the band , Eric Clapton , happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new album at the time . What 's another British blues lover to do but make his way over and contribute to a couple of tracks . <p> Speaking of tracks , the new blues album contains 12 cuts of classic blues , but not necessarily what one would expect . These are deep cuts , mostly in the vein of Chicago blues , by artists long admired by the band covering them . <p> There are four Little Walter covers , " Just Your Fool , " " Blue and Lonesome , " " I Got to Go , " and " Hate to See You Go . " Howlin Wolf contributes two tracks , " Commit a Crime , " and " Just Like I Treat You . " They borrow some West Side blues with Magic Sams " All Your Love . " To further offset the Chess Records heavy line-up , they cover Eddie Taylors " Ride Em on Down , " and Jimmy Reeds , " Little Rain . " With a nod down South , they cover , " Hoodoo Blues , " by Lightnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Johnny Taylors , " Everybody Knows About My Good Thing . " Besides the obvious , these songs all have one thing in common . The original artists who waxed them have all taken up residence in Blues Heaven . That 's where the final track makes a statement . Its a cover of " I Ca n't Quit You Baby , " originally recorded by , the very much alive , Otis Rush . <p> These are n't  the same rehashed hits that have been covered time and again . The Stones have made a conscious decision to release music that , as Mark Guarino of The Guardian puts it , " favors expression over expectation . " <p> Another decision , made by the Glimmer Twins , along with co-producer , Don Was , was the approach to the material . It should be recorded live , in the studio , with no overdubs . So it happened , which explains the three day recording time . Was also said , " This album is manifest testament to the purity of their love for making music , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they do . " <p> The cover art is a stroke of marketing genius . The iconic " Tongue and Lip " logo , created in 1971 by award winning graphic artist , John Pasche , has simply been turned blue . Its plastered on the website , and has begun appearing everywhere , letting fans know that the Stones are up to something , and its blues . <p> Blue &amp; Lonesome will be available on vinyl ( Double LP ) , CD and digital download . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

This musicians contributions to blues , country , and rock music have been immense . In fact , still to this day , most people are not fully aware of all that he contributed to the world of music . <p> A originator and the leading proponent of the Tulsa Sound , which draws on country , jazz , blues , rockabilly , and soul , it was largely Cale who brought awareness to this genre . His compositions have been covered by everyone from Eric Clapton to Bobby Bare , Santana , Lynyrd Skynyrd , and Johnny Cash . <p> In 1970 , both Cale and Clapton were at a common juncture in their respective musical journeys , for differing reasons . Clapton for his part , had become disenchanted with the whole " guitar hero " scenario , and the self-indulgence and fretboard gymnastics of the era . He longed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that still yielded quality music . In Cales music , this is what he found . Cale on the other hand , was not finding the commercial or financial success he was working towards . Everything changed for both when Clapton recorded " After Midnight " on his Eric Clapton album . " After Midnight " became a Top-20 hit , bringing Cale recognition , fans , and royalties . Clapton found a new musical direction to peruse that was honest , personally satisfying , and engendered the simpler , more relaxed approach he was looking for . Over the years , each gave the other credit for what they had done for the other . <p> As time went on , Cale and Clapton collaborated on projects together such as Crossroads , and 2006s Grammy Award winning The Road to Escondido . They developed a friendship , and delighted in the time they shared making music together . Given all this , when Cale passed last year , Clapton wanted to honor and thank his friend with a tribute to his music , showcasing both the arrangements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albums though , is to convey the music of that artist without producing an album that is cliche . Also , do you have artists put their own spin on the songs or does everyone try to remain as close as possible to the original material ? <p> With The Breeze ( An Appreciation of JJ Cale ) , on Bushbranch/Surfdog , Clapton gathered friends and fellow musicians that enjoyed Cales music , and wanted to pay tribute to him as well . Clapton decided that as a whole , the musicians would stay as close as possible to the sound of the original material as possible , believing that even so , each musicians personality would still shine through . <p> Along with Clapton , guests on this album include Mark Knopfler , John Mayer , Don White , and Willie Nelson ( with his faithful companion , " Trigger " ) . Also on board are Derek Trucks , Albert Lee , and Cales wife , Christine Lakeland . <p> Clapton and company have produced an album that is successful on many levels . The performances are superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Breeze , " and " Do n't  Wait " with the expected brilliant guitar fills and solos , or the country aura of " Crying Eyes , " everything is just as we would expect it to be . These are loose feeling , precisely delivered yarns that instantly make us smile . Other exciting performances include the fun " Rock and Roll Records , " an inspired take on " Cajun Moon , " and a beautiful performance of " Magnolia , " featuring John Mayer . <p> A very satisfying aspect of The Breeze is that the sound is mixed in such a way as to be exactly how Cale mixed his material . There 's the easy driving shuffle with a great bass beat , along with layers of instruments woven into an elegant quilt of sound , with vocals that- melt into the mix . 189485 @qwx599485 189486 @qwx599486

Yesterday , the band announced the release of their 30th studio album , Blue &amp; Lonesome , on the Polydor label . Their first studio release in over a decade will drop world-wide on December 2nd , 2016 , however , it is available for- pre-order now . <p> It took only three days for Mick and the boys to record the new release , probably because the material is over 50 years old and they 've been playing it that long themselves . With some help from touring sidemen , bassist Darryl Jones , and keyboardists Chuck Leavell and Matt Clifford , Blue &amp; Lonesome was recorded at British Grove Studios in West London .

Its a cover of " I Ca n't Quit You Baby , " originally recorded by , the very much alive , Otis Rush . <p> These are n't  the same rehashed hits that have been covered time and again . The Stones have made a conscious decision to release music that , as Mark Guarino of The Guardian puts it , " favors expression over expectation .

Clapton found a new musical direction to peruse that was honest , personally satisfying , and engendered the simpler , more relaxed approach he was looking for .

His latest release , - Jericho Road ( Stony Plain Records ) , maintains the high standard Bibb has set for his work . <p> As Bibb says on his website , " The title refers to the road between Jerusalem and Jericho where the Good Samaritan , a traveler of a despised race , stopped to help a stranger in need after better-off religious leaders had passed by and done nothing . On April 3 , 1968 , the night before his death , Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King urged us to follow the example of- the Good Samaritan , saying : Ultimately , you can not save yourself without saving others. If this record has a theme , that 's it in a nutshell : have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs , some co-written with Glen Scott , who also produced . The 13 songs here clock in at 59 minutes and when the album is over , we are left wanting more . Bibb uses a whole host of musicians throughout the album , and the playing is consistently superb . An album full of captivating textures , - Jericho Road never disappoints . Standout tracks include " Freedom Train , " which is full of body , texture , and will have you tapping your feet . It is incredibly light , with melody lines and backing vocals that weave in and out of each other ; just a really good time . " Let The Mothers Step In " starts off slow and sparse , and builds into a track with a full bodied sound that approaches soul , again with great vocals and rhythm . " Have A Heart " almost has a light jazzy vibe to it , with the always on time vocals of Ruthie Foster . " Death Row Blues " is a tight acoustic blues without the dreary , dark feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shimmering guitar line , and implores us to " get together and get the Lords work done . " " With My Master I Am One " has Bibb playing resophonic , acoustic , and electric guitars , and the result is mesmerizing . " She Got Mine " is rife with great picking , and a nice foot-tapping beat that will have you dancing along to it . " Good Like You " has killer backing vocals , exquisite horn fills , and an awesome wah guitar riff . " One Day At A Time " is perfect : silky smooth vocals , stunning acoustic playing from everyone , and it will have you feeling like you are walking barefoot in the rain . <p> This is the liveliest " Roots " album we 've heard in a long time . Brilliant lyrics , superb musicianship , and the sound quality is pristine. - If all church music was this good , we 'd never leave ! ( When is the last time you heard a roots album with wah-wah on it ? ) Take this for a spin today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 189485 @qwx599485 189486
