@@34419390 @3419390/ <p> The overwhelming majority of dance music is written in 4/4 time ; a- very large- proportion- also- sticks rigidly to a four-to-the-floor kick drum pattern . Those conventions are informed by decades of western musical traditions and the stylistic tropes of countless 20th-century popular music genres " - from blues to rocknroll , disco to soul . The net result is that writing music in 4/4 is a default choice for virtually all contemporary dance music genres . <p> Breaking away to an alternative time signature " anything other than- 4/4 " might seem like a risky- choice . There are , of course , a number of- very good reasons why 4/4 is still the safest time signature for anyone writing club music . Firstly , dancers in most club environments are likely to- respond favourably to familiar 4/4 grooves . However , do n't  underestimate- listeners receptiveness to different- grooves . Its much easier to nod your head to a non-4/4 beat than it is to sit and analyse it . Dancers probably are n't  counting the notes ; if the grooves good , theyll dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything- else . <p> Secondly , and perhaps more importantly , DJs are far more likely to play tracks that mix easily with other music . If your tracks are in 5/4 , its going to take a lot of effort to work them into a set " there 's a good chance most DJs will just leave your records out of their box rather than jumping through hoops to try and fit them into a mix . But while DJ friendliness is obviously important , it shouldnt- necessarily- be the overriding factor when making creative decisions . Dance music would soon become highly derivative if all producers stuck rigidly to- a series of club-focused conventions and de facto rules . <p> In this instalment of Passing Notes , well take a closer look at a number of tracks which use alternative time signatures . We can only scratch the surface of the infinite- possibilities in terms of time signatures , but by examining- a handful of the most common options we can explain how and why breaking away from 4/4 can be a highly rewarding creative challenge . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signatures are represented using two numbers , one on top of the other : <p> The image above shows a 6/8 time signature . The top number tells us that there are six beats in the bar . The bottom number tells us that these beats are eighth notes ( or quavers ) . Hence , there are six quavers to a bar . <p> A question that immediately arises when looking at this signature , is how is that different from a 3/4 signature . Surely , six eighth notes is the same as three quarter notes ? However , while it is true that a bar of each of the two signatures at the same tempo will last the same length of time , the two time signatures are different. - 6/8 differs 3/4 due to the accent or emphasis of the beat . <p> In a 6/8 signature , the natural accent is on the first- and fourth- quavers : <p> 1-2-3-4-5-6 <p> whereas if we played quavers in a 3/4 signature , the emphasis would occur on the first , third and fifth : <p> 1-2-3-4-5-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quavers in a slightly different way : <p> 1-and-2-and-3-and <p> We can see and hear the difference in the example below . The first two bars are in a 3/4 time signature , while the second two are in 6/8 : <p> Note how the placement of the snare drums and the emphasis of the hi-hats creates a small but noticeable shift in feel from one time signature to the other . <p> Other times signatures are defined in similar ways. - To get a feel for counting the beat , a classic example is The Dave Brubeck Quartets 1959 track Take Five , which- takes its name from its- 5/4 time signature . <p> By counting along " 1-2-3-4-5-1-2-3-4-5 " , you should be able to follow the time signature of the track . If you have trouble catching the timing , focus on Brubecks- piano vamp , which- is one bar long and repeats throughout most of the track . <p> With the basics explained , let 's take a look at how those principles apply in dance music <h> Related <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507

@@34419393 @3419393/ <p> We have more sounds at our disposal than ever before . Even if your studio extends no further than a laptop and a DAW you 're likely to have access to thousands of bundled drum sounds . If you have an extensive sample collection you can multiply that figure by ten . <p> With so many sounds , the law of averages says you should be able to find the perfect drum to fit most grooves/tracks . And even if a sound 's not 100% right some tweaks to its envelope setting or tuning is usually enough to help it fit the sonic bill . <p> But sometimes however many sounds you audition , none of them quite works . The kick drum has oomph but not crunch ; the snare has whack without crack . Or maybe you 're a sample-eschewing sound designer who prefers every sound in their mix to be sculpted by hand . <p> In either case , there are two approaches to building original drum hits : <p> by synthesising your own sounds <p> by layering existing samples to make unique hybrids that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the art and craft of drum layering . <h> THINKING AS ONE <p> Many producers end up panicking over drum layering after their first few attempts end with muddy , ill-defined results . This is often because they like a drum sound so layer it onto existing drum/s and wonder why the beat does n't instantly sound better " two kick drums , they think , should by default be better than one . <p> That thinking is a shortcut to disaster . Layering must be approached with care , with an understanding of the dangers and with a clear idea of what each constituent sound is going to add to the composite final . Which is all to say , only layer when there is a good reason for doing so . <h> PHASE <p> The main hidden danger when layering drum sounds is phase cancellation , which occurs when the layered samples ' waveforms are out of phase with each other . <p> Two identical signals are completely out of phase ( aka with negative polarity ) when their waveforms directly mirror each other . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the real world , when layering complex drum sounds , you are not going to end up with silence . But , especially if the opening- transients of a waveform set off in opposite directions , frequencies in the composite layered sound can become quieter , giving a brittle , weak sound . <p> Two samples with negative phase " note the way the two waveforms set off in opposite directions . <p> While phase cancellation can affect any layered sound , it is most noticeable when layering kicks , where even a slight drop of energy in the opening transients can badly affect the low end . <p> One way of checking to see if samples risk cancellation is to zoom in on their waveforms , as in Fig 16 left . If they set off going in the same direction you are usually safe . <p> A simple shortcut if they do n't is to use a DAW 's polarity inversion button , often ( erroneously ) labelled as phase inversion . <p> The same waveforms wih the second 's polarity flipped . They will- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many plugins that also allow you to do the job , like Sonalksis ' FreeG plugin . <p> Deciding whether the kicks work best with the polarity of one sample inverted is a simple case of trial and error : invert the polarity and if it sounds better stick with it . <p> It does n't particularly matter whether you invert the polarity of the first or second kick ; the effect is pretty much identical . Bear in mind that inverting both has virtually the same effect as inverting neither . <h> EQ : TRIMMING THE FAT <p> The final area to focus on is the frequency range each constituent sample occupies . When mixing two or more sounds together there 's no point each one contributing the same frequencies to the composite . If too many frequencies overlap the end result will be muddy and ill-defined . <p> To avoid frequency doubling and masking , use EQ bracketing to carve away the unwanted frequencies in each sound , making space for them to sit together . <p> If you are layering a bass-heavy 808- kick drum ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mid-tone clout ) , for example , you might choose to roll away the higher frequencies of the 808 while cutting the lower frequencies of the live drum for the best of both worlds " a layered kick with a subby low-end and a weighty mid punch , but without congested crossover . <p> If you 're struggling to separate layers using EQ alone , try using different reverb treatments for each layer . Instead of straight hall or room settings , audition early reflection programs and short reverb and chamber IRs . Placing different layers in different spaces aids separation . <h> TIMING <p> When layering , the timing of the start of each sample is critical . Sometimes you 'll want the combined layered hit to be a single unified sound ( in the case of a kick drum , for example ) . At other times you may want obviously staggered layers ( in the example of a lazy disco clap/snare hybrid ) . <p> In both cases the trick to getting an effective layered sound is zooming in on the opening transients then shifting each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound or so that they hit at perceptively different times . <p> Note : - altering sample start times directly impacts on the phase relation between the samples , so , again , flip either sample 's polarity to see what difference it makes . <p> One quick and easy way of ensuring opening transients do n't hit at the same time in each layer is to employ a transient designer or compressor to change the transient make-up of the opening portion . To shift a hard-edged live snare sample slightly back from the opening portion of a layered analogue snare , for example , simply lengthen its attack . A similar approach can be taken to rebalance the energy make-up of a layer 's sustain or release . <h> BUSSING <p> When you 're happy with a layered sound , route each composite sound to a single drum bus ( kick drum group ' for example ) . Doing this not only allows you to EQ and/or compress the layered drum as if it were one sound " giving it a single gel of glue " it also makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you like the layered sound enough , bounce it out as a single hit and add it to your sample library . <h> KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT <p> With the theory out the way it 's worth making the most important point about drum layering last : layering is a lot easier when you have a clear intention in mind . <p> If you have a live kick drum sample you like but it does n't have the necessary low-end for the dancefloor , knowing that you need to layer it with an 808-style kick will help deliver results fast . Once you 've made that call all you need to do is layer in an 808 bass drum , align the sample starts , retune , check phase , perform EQ tweaks ( cutting lows from the live kick and highs from the 808 ) and you 'll have the sound you 're after . <p> Endless tweaking while layering wastes hours in the studio . A clear vision focusses attention on the task at hand . <h> Layered clap/snare combo " the old school way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percussive energy from the snare and spectrum-filling noise from the clap , creating a big , impactful sound that can really punch through a mix . Drag Clap.wav and Snare.wav onto separate audio tracks and make sure both audio clips are unwarped . <h> Step 2 <p> Zoom in to the start of the two clips . You 'll see the clap ( on top ) has multiple transients , only reaching its body as the snare has almost finished . This is fine if you 're after a loose , organic feel but it 's not right for tight , punchy sounds . <h> Step 3 <p> The most elegant way to make the two sounds gel is to change the start point of the clap . Drag the clap clip 's Start Marker to the beginning of the second transient . This gives a good balance of impact and natural feel . ( An alternative for a looser feel is to drag the clap 's start back in time . ) <h> Step 4 <p> The clap has a long , mono reverb tail .

An eclectic blend of house , techno , disco , funk , hip-hop and soul , the overall sound of the EP is strongly influenced by the music- that Vynehall was exposed to growing up , a memory based largely on all the cassette tapes that his mother used to play in the car on the daily school run . Harking back to the likes of Funky Jams , Mr Scruff and DJ Shadow , Vynehall felt compelled to make- a release that flowed from one track to another , kind of like the mixtapes in the car on the way to school . That said , It 's Just ( House of Dupree ) seems to have emerged as one of the standout tracks , having had plenty of dancefloor exposure . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EP , the overall sound palette is quite lo-fi . There 's lashings of tape delay on the main elements , along with a heavy reliance on filtered samples , tape hiss and vinyl crackle for added atmosphere . As far as Its Just- is concerned , the main tonal components are a sampled synth arpeggio and vocal hook , bassline and plenty of strings ( some sampled , some credited to Eagles For Hands , aka Laurie Ross , who plays cello on the track ) . <h> Intro- &amp; Ball Culture Influences <p> The filtered orchestral break heard over the intro is from the much-plundered Salsoul Orchestra 's Ohh I Love It ( Love Break ) : <p> Interestingly enough , in this case it 's been sampled part-and-parcel with the voiceover that accompanies it , the whole thing having been lifted from the soundtrack of a 1989 documentary about ball culture called Voguing : The Message : <p> The voiceover is by Willi Ninja , one of the more prominent dancers from the scene , who also featured in the cult classic- Paris Is Burning- documentary : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a three-note synth arpeggio playing a spread major triad ( also known as a broken chord ) . On the recording it was sampled from , this is originally an A major chord . The sample is taken from the Isley Brothers ' 1980 ballad Do n't Say Goodnight ( It 's Time for Love ) , also notably sampled by J Dilla for So Far To Go , featuring Common and DAngelo . <p> What 's interesting about Vynehalls use of the sample- is the way- delay effects are applied . The original Isley Brothers record also featured a delay effect on this part , which has been trimmed off here and replaced by a delay synced to the tempo of the new track . How can we tell this ? Because the part is played by a sample across three different notes ( F# , Ab and Bb ) . You can hear the rates at which the notes occur is slightly slower at- the lower pitch- compared to the higher version- " yet the delay effect remains in sync with the song , making this less of an issue .

When it comes to sequencers , they can mean the difference between a perfect groove and a sloppy mess . We talk to drum machine pioneer Roger Linn to discover the secrets of perfect musical timing and find out why the swing of his MPC sampler series remains so highly rated . <p> While researching our recent Passing Notes feature on DAW and drum machine swing , we found ourselves returning to the same few questions over and over again . Do dedicated hardware drum machines and samplers offer better timing and swing than software-based alternatives ? Does swing do exactly the same thing in all DAWs and sequencers ? What else contributes to the groove of a beat or loop ? <p> Perhaps above all else , one of the main questions we found ourselves asking was why the earlier models in Akais MPC series of sampling workstations are still considered to be among the best around when it comes to groove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ingrained in electronic music folklore that its considered almost heretical to question it " especially among large chunks of the hip hop production community . But can it really be that hardware sold a quarter of a century ago is somehow better than the latest DAWs and drum software ? <p> Over a series of emails with Roger we discussed sequencer swing and drum machine timing , starting with the question of the MPCs magical groove and moving on to the importance of tight timing and whether its better to play beats in real time than to program them with quantisation . <p> only one person could give us definitive answers to all our queries : the inventor of swing , quantisation , the LinnDrum , the MPC and the DSI Tempest . <p> Rogers insight into sequencing , swing and timing helps shed light on some of the most commonly debated intricacies of electronic music production . Some of his answers may also come as a surprise to anyone who believes there 's something unique about the groove of the MPC . <p> Attack Magazine : The main idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our office about the magic of the 80s MPCs. 25 years on from the release of the MPC60 , its still held in incredibly high regard and there 's a mystique attached to the timing . MPC swing is the watchword for tight , funky timing . Can we start by talking about the MPCs " - particularly the MPC60 and MPC3000 " - and why they 're so highly revered ? Are they actually measurably better in some way than other sequencers or is it a bit of an urban myth which has snowballed since the 80s ? <p> Roger Linn : There are a few factors that have contributed to natural , human-feeling grooves in my drum machines . In order of importance : <p> 1 . Swing . <p> Swing " applied to quantized 16th-note beats " is a big part of it . My implementation of swing has always been very simple : I merely delay the second 16th note within each 8th note . In other words , I delay all the even-numbered 16th notes within the beat ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount in terms of the ratio of time duration between the first and second 16th notes within each 8th note . For example , 50% is no swing , meaning that both 16th notes within each 8th note are given equal timing . And 66% means perfect triplet swing , meaning that the first 16th note of each pair gets 2/3 of the time , and the second 16th note gets 1/3 , so the second 16th note falls on a perfect 8th note triplet . The fun comes in the in-between settings . For example , a 90 BPM swing groove will feel looser at 62% than at a perfect swing setting of 66% . And for straight 16th-note beats ( no swing ) , a swing setting of 54% will loosen up the feel without it sounding like swing . Between 50% and around 70% are lots of wonderful little settings that , for a particular beat and tempo , can change a rigid beat into something that makes people move . And unlike the MPCs , my new Tempest drum machine makes it very easy to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob in real time while the beat plays . I first introduced swing " as well as recording quantization " in my 1979 drum machine , the LM-1 Drum Computer . <p> 2 . Natural dynamic response on drum pads . <p> When a real drummer plays a great-sounding groove containing 16th-note hi-hats , he varies the loudness of each hi-hat hit in a way that he has developed over years of practice . If he were to play each note at exactly the same volume , hed sound like a bad drum machine beat . So to create a natural-sounding 16th note hi-hat part on a drum machine , you need drum pads with accurate and natural-feeling dynamic response ( something I introduced on my Linn9000 drum machine in 1984 ) and you need good drumming skills . If so , then when you program in a hi-hat part with good dynamics from note to note , it plays back as you intended . <p> 3 . Pressure-sensitive note repeat ( also called roll ) . <p> Good pad dynamic response is important , but not everyone has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi-hat part into a drum machine in real time . This is why I introduced the pressure-sensitive note- repeat feature ( sometimes called roll ) in the Linn9000 and have had it in every drum machine since . The note repeat feature allows you to program repeating notes " such as 16th note hi-hats " merely by varying your finger pressure on the hi-hat pad in real time as the beat or metronome plays . At the moment of each successive 16th note , a new hi-hat note is recorded into the beat , and your finger pressure at that moment is used as the velocity level for the new note . This requires far less skill to create a natural-sounding groove . In fact , simply by varying your finger pressure from light to medium continuously and somewhat randomly , you 'll end up with a very natural-sounding hi-hat part . <p> 4 . The playback timing should be very accurate . <p> In my drum machines , I wrote the software in such a way that the notes play exactly at the correct timing location . And for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the samples were closely trimmed to minimize any delay at the start . I 've heard lots of theories over the years about other timing tricks , like introducing random timing variations into the notes of the beat , or delaying the snare on 2 and 4 , but I 've never found these to do much good . In fact , I 'd suggest that if the note dynamics and swing are right , then the groove works best when the notes are played at exactly the perfect time slots . <p> 5 . You need good beats . <p> All the swing , dynamics and other tricks wont do you any good unless you come up with a good beat in the first place . On all my drum machines , I 've tried to provide factory sounds and beats that sound great and provide excellent examples of what can be done . Even on my AdrenaLinn III Guitar Processor , which includes a simple and very limited drum machine , its 190 included factory beats have very good grooves . In making these beats , I listened to hundreds of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drummers feels and recreate them as drum machine beats . I suggest this same approach in learning how to create great drum machine grooves . <p> 6 . I try not to let the technology get in the way of music-making . <p> On all my drum machines , I tried to design them to be easy to use so you could take it out of the box , turn it on and start making beats . I 've seen some products that make you read manuals and set up all kinds of complex and unnecessary settings before you can start . By the time you 've done this , your inspiration is usually gone and you 've set up a mental association between the product and suffering . I think perhaps one reason people have made so many great beats on my products is that when they have the idea , they can record it into the machine right away . <p> That 's about it . Not much magic , just good solid engineering and creative beat-making . If some people think my products have a special magic , I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just happened to create a magical recording years ago on one of my drum machines , and in their minds my products will always be associated with great grooves . Years later if they decide to buy a new drum machine , they may see my name on the panel and think : " I can research this thoroughly or I can just buy Rogers product because I trust that if he did it before , hell do it again .

In this extended instalment of Passing Notes we explain what the swing setting does and how you can use it to add groove to your drums and more . <p> The oldest swinger in town : the shuffle/swing function as we now know it was first introduced in Roger Linns 1979 LM-1 Drum Computer ( click images to enlarge ) <p> From changing the feel of a sequenced drum pattern to creating a completely new groove for an entire track , the swing setting found in most sequencers and drum machines can be an extremely powerful tool , but many producers find it difficult to understand exactly what it does and how it works . In this Passing Notes , were going to examine what swing is , take a look at how it works in different DAWs , and provide some examples of how it sounds in action . <h> What is swing ? <p> The word swing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to different people. - To a jazz drummer , swing probably means something quite different to its usage in an electronic music context . Although the terms are related , they 're not quite the same . However , understanding the origins of the term in jazz and with live musicians is a useful starting point in order to understand how the swing function works in software and electronic music hardware . <p> In jazz , swing timing often refers to a specific rhythm and notation convention , whereby the first beat is twice as long as the second , then the third beat is the same length as the first , and so on . Its effectively a variation on triplets or 6/8 timing , often written in common time ( 4/4 ) for simplicitys sake , with the swing timing added by the musicians . The timing itself gave its name to swing music , the 1930s offshoot of jazz based on those same lopsided rhythms . <p> ( If you want to know more about this jazz-centric convention of swing timing " which is by no means essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine " - How Music Works- has a good basic primer . ) <p> In a broader sense , swinging eventually came to be used to describe any rhythm with an off-kilter groove . Drummers swing the beat to add a groove , introducing a slightly irregular feel to the timing of the rhythm. - Its important not to confuse swing with sloppy , imprecise timing " were not talking about inaccuracy here . Instead , its about the deliberate , subtle timing variations which musicians introduce to the way they play notes . <p> The term is mainly used in reference to drumming simply because drummers set the groove of any group and generally play repetitive rhythmic patterns , but swing could also be applied to the timing of any other instrument . <h> Swing in electronic music <p> So how do we apply this idea of loose , fluid timing to electronic music ? The earliest sequencers and drum machines played using completely rigid timing , with evenly spaced gaps in between each division of the bar . Programming was typically achieved via a step sequencer or real-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roland TR-808 , for instance , each of the 16 steps in a programmed beat is played with perfectly straight timing . <p> The swing function as we now know it " originally known as shuffle , a term still used by some hardware manufacturers and software developers " was first introduced in Roger Linns 1979- LM-1 Drum Computer . Linn realised that he could approximate the effect of a human drummer playing in swing timing by quantising each drum beat to the nearest step and then delaying the playback of every other - step in the sequencer ( to see how Linn introduced his auto-correct and shuffle features , take a look at the LM-1 manual ) . But this effect was useful for more than just jazz-style triplet-derived swing timing ; different delay times could replicate a variety of lazy , swinging grooves . The longer the delay , the more obvious the effect . <p> Linns system used percentages to express the amount of swing applied to every second step . ( At this point let 's assume were talking about the most commonly used form of swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertain to the degree that every second 16th note is positioned in relation to the beats either side of it . So 50% swing refers to straight timing , where every second step is played exactly half way between the two beats either side of it . <p> By the mid 80s , this implementation of swing had been adopted by most other manufacturers . Adding swing to a drum beat or to melodic elements can introduce a more human feel to a pattern , but just as importantly , even the smallest amount of swing can enhance a groove in a uniquely and inexplicably appealing way . <p> Even though MIDI sequencing is now accurate enough to record and replay the nuances of a live MIDI drum performance very precisely , few of us have the accuracy with drum pads to achieve the same effect as quantised beats with swing applied . We could debate the relative merits of real human timing versus computer timing for days on end , but its missing the point ; human timing works well in some cases , but quantised beats and swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance music . <h> Related <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507 <p> The short answer is no , MPCs do n't  do anything differently . But there 's a little bit more to it than that . As luck would have it , we have an interview with the man himself , Roger Linn , coming tomorrow which should explain everything . <p> Thanks for the feedback . Obviously we 'd love to go into more detail about each DAW but things would quickly get out of hand . In basic terms , Ableton uses a mixture of the Linn/Logic convention where 50% = straight timing and the Cubase/FL Studio convention where 0% = straight timing . It depends which groove you pick from the groove pool . Things are made a little more complex by the different ways in which Ableton allows you to apply the groove you 've chosen . <p> great article and great site for information in general . really surprised me to start digging into the articles and actually find them all to be well thought out and very much right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock basically rock n roll , and up until recently had always kind of ignored electronic music , or at very best its sometimes seemed like good , danceable wallpaper . <p> of course , like anything , once you for whatever reason become interested in it , whole new realizations begin forming and you see the subtle stuff that makes it either good or bad . so what a great bunch of articles to run into while i am learning all this stuff brand new to me . <p> so thank you and keep it up , great writing and solid take on things . <p> for topic on hand , just writing to mention also , that people should never overlook the use of compression to alter a groove . I was really shocked when I first realized how dramatically you could change a drummers push or pull on the beat by messing with attack release times and compression ratio/knee . <p> not really about drum machine swing at all but just adding on to the very last part about what else is similar . <p> Awesome article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment but one thing i do n't  understand about the terminology used is when you say 50% swing = straight timing does this mean swing is basically " OFF " ? and the hats have not been affected at all ? <p> Also another newbie comment why use swing when you can just draw the hat positions exactly where you want ? i.e. more flexibility . Its a genuine question , i 'm just trying to understand the advantages of using swing , i can see some time is saved , but why else ? Because does n't  using swing also mean that each of the hats are offset exactly by the same amount ( 66% for example ) . Wouldnt the hi hat pattern sound better if the first hat was 66% off , the second 60% off ( for example ) . Or is the swing feature doing this already ? <p> @Attack Mpc do have something different , : ) , its the crystals used inside the old machines , you see , there are some small things that make the difference , but people do not realise that , same as the korg emx/esx 1

Follow these guidelines and you 'll be well on the way to low-frequency perfection . <p> If there 's one thing which unites almost all electronic music producers , its the quest for the perfect bassline . Its hardly surprising when you consider how many things there are to get right : the melody itself ; the synth sound ; effects ; compression ; EQ ; interaction with the kick drum and other elements . No wonder producers of virtually every genre of dance music obsess over bass . Here well offer ten bass tips which will make life easier for producers of any genre of electronic music . From synthesis to mixdown , here 's how to approach the bottom end . <p> Note that these tips are n't  in the order " every bassline needs a slightly different approach . Were not suggesting you should ( necessarily ) follow all the tips in this order for every bass . <h> 1 . Start with the right sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to make it sound good than it is just to get it right at the source . This one might sound obvious , but its one of the most important guidelines when creating bass sounds : do n't  make life difficult for yourself by starting with a poor sound and then trying to fix it . Take a step back , get the sound right in your synth or sampler first , then move forward . <p> Exactly what constitutes a good sound is , of course , totally subjective . Some tracks might call for a super aggressive bass sound which dominates the mix . On other occasions , something more subtle and mellow works best . Its good to have a rough idea what kind of sound you 're aiming for before you start so you 're not just fumbling around aimlessly until you discover something suitable . It also means having an awareness of the genre within which you 're working , and the basslines context in relation to other mix elements . We certainly are n't  suggesting you should be a slave to genre conventions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what tends to work best " - and allow you to break the rules to create something new . <p> In terms of sound sources , one of the simplest approaches is to take an audio sample of an existing bass note and load it into your favourite sampler . here 's a simple example in Logics built-in EXS24 sampler plugin : <p> The downside to this approach is that while you can make some tweaks ( depending on the capabilities of your sampler ) , you cant easily alter the subtleties of the tone or make the sound longer " so limitations are apparent from the start . As such , sampled bass sounds tend to be most suited to cases where you absolutely must use a sound from an existing audio recording . <p> Perhaps the most obviously versatile source of a good bass sound is a decent subtractive synth " whether hardware or software . Here were using Steinbergs Retrologue , one of the excellent synth plugins built into Cubase : <p> As you 'd expect , a synth provides a lot more flexibility than a sampler , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying processes such as filtering and modulation to your choice of oscillator sources . <p> The shape of the sound is as important as its overall harmonic make-up . Subtractive synthesis ( as used by all analogue or analogue-style synths ) is generally best for more traditional bass sounds . This was the main synthesis approach used during the 70s , so there 's an inherently retro character to many ( if not necessarily all ) subtractive synths . <p> Massive has been particularly popular in dubstep over the last few years , providing the bottom end for hundreds of tracks . By modulating the wavetable oscillator with an LFO we can create all kinds of wobble effects : <p> Synthesis approaches like Massives wavetable options or FM8s frequency modulation architecture are generally best suited to more modern , aggressive sounds . <p> If you 're creating bass sounds from scratch , remember that a bassline does n't  exist in isolation " it has to fit well within the context of a track , and this has an effect on what you can do with other elements .

Bruce Aisher investigates the psychoacoustics of rhythm- programming . <p> When programmable drum machines became a commercial reality in the early 1980s , two opposing arguments became popular . The first suggested that these early digital drum machines ( such as the Linn LM-1 and Oberheim DMX ) sounded nothing like a real drummer in other words , they sounded like machines . The second argument claimed that drum machines would put human drummers out of work . <p> The reality is that drummers are still very much around , and that the metronomic timekeeping of drum machines and their DAW-based counterparts helped foster whole new genres of music . The convergence continues with tools to make human recordings sound tighter and techniques to make machine-based rhythms less metronomic . <p> Clearly , a quick and useful way to turn a drum beat into a groove is to apply swing in order to push and pull the placement of drums in a bar . We examined the effects of DAW and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing for different rhythm elements enhances the usefulness of this approach . <p> Swing is predominantly about timing , but in this article- we 're going to look at how an understanding of certain psychoacoustic principles can affect our perception of the groove and timing of the beat . In other words , how changes in the level , length , tonality and pitch of parts of a rhythm alter the feel . <h> Randomisation <p> Some basic algorithms for creating a more human ' programmed beat rely on randomising the velocity and timing of individual hits . To hear the effects , let 's start with totally rigid velocity and timing : <p> This is fine as far as it goes , but in many cases it simply sounds untidy . However , it 's easy to forget that technology itself often far from perfect . Jitter- ( an irregularity in clocking ) is inherent in MIDI , which is only capable of transmitting one note at a time . This means that no drum sounds triggered over the MIDI protocol- will ever play simultaneously . Faster interfacing such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published by the AES as far back as 1994 showed that even the internal clocks on hardware drum machines were wildly variable as far as accuracy was concerned .

Is a backlash against lazy Ableton sets responsible for the most exciting live shows in decades ? Kristan Caryl investigates . <p> " The set is never the same . " Skudge performing live . <p> Live electronic music is nothing new . Back in the late 80s acts like The Orb and 808 State were quick to spot the potential of taking their music-making machines up on stage . In the 90s live electronica became so popular that even the traditionally guitar obsessed Glastonbury invited The Chemical Brothers to headline their main stage . And in the noughties , although the medium had largely switched from hardware to software , hardly could you glance at flyer without that little word being splattered all over it , sandwiched between a pair of brackets to show that this was more than just a standard DJ set : this was live . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more popular . A new generation of techno artists are embracing the old-school all-hardware approach , whether its the distorted purist assault of Blawan and Pariahs Karenn project , the slightly housier techno leanings of Juju &amp; Jordash or the stripped-down grooves of Skudge . Naturally , the proliferation of live sets also makes the definition of live even more ambiguous and sometimes even divisive . After all , a DJ set is technically a form of- live performance , whereas many live shows are planned down to the last note . And what about the music itself ? Hardware is the choice of all the coolest cats , but does banging a few beats out on a 909 really make for a better sonic experience ? Let 's get to the core of the matter : why has the laptop-free live show come back into vogue , just what is live ' , and does it really matter ? <h> " Shitty plip-plop techno " <p> Live shows are no longer the preserve of the underground : you 're as likely to find a laptop rocker turning up to the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware hits from the side of a truck . As such , playing live has become a trend ; something to which the young bucks aspire so as to stand out . Ironically , though , so many live sets end up conforming to the pseudo-live norm in which artists turn up , plug in and trigger a load of pre-recorded loops in a carefully programmed sequence , often recreating whole tracks verbatim . <p> One of the factors driving this trend is the emergence of new tools which allow artists to approach live performance in different ways . The- most notable is Ableton Live , the software package which has had the single biggest impact on the way dance music is produced and performed over the last decade . Its clip-based approach makes it easy for samples , loops and pre-sequenced MIDI parts to be triggered on the fly , all in sync with each other .

I think Ableton got a bad name from the people who used it early on , yet Legowelt was talking in a recent interview about the difference between using an MPC and Ableton : in a lot of ways Ableton can be more live than an MPC because you have more freedom and control in your set .

@@34419419 @3419419/ <h> How To EQ A Mix <p> EQ is one of the three fundamental tools used to shape the mix . Bruce Aisher explains how to use it to clean up a track . <p> Many tools are available to us when mixing a track , but one of the most important is EQ . <p> EQ can be used in all kinds of subtle ( and not so subtle ) ways , but at its most basic , it offers a highly effective way of cleaning up mix elements to help them sit together better . <p> One of the most important tasks when mixing a track is to make the most of the bandwidth we have available to us . That means making space for every element in a mix . EQ plays two main roles in this process . <p> The first is to make each of our elements sound good in isolation . That might mean subtly boosting the upper midrange of a vocal to increase presence or the low end of a synth part to give it more weight . <p> The second " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make space for all the elements to fit together . If multiple elements of a mix occupy similar frequency ranges and attempt to fit into the same space , the result will often sound muddy , muddled and unclear . Its this process which were going to focus on in this walkthrough , starting with a bad mix and using subtractive EQing to clean it up . <p> As with the kick , let 's roll off the very low frequencies first . Next , we can use the EQ to notch out an area between approximately 200 and 250 Hz . In many cases we can make a cut like this to reduce muddiness in the low end without affecting the overall character of the sound . 
@@34419421 @3419421/ <p> Club culture could often be said to reflect our communities and societies at any given point in time . Clubs are hotbeds of expression , creativity and fashion . At their best , they 're breeding grounds for what the future will look like . Think back to disco , the new romantics or acid house " they all told the far wider story years prior to the mainstream 's love affair . <p> In 2016 , UK clubland found itself in an era of turmoil . And if we can say anything about 2016 in the wider world it was certainly turbulent . So as we embrace 2017 I look to see if things have changed . Fabric has reopened , other new London venues have been announced , nightclubs have suffered attacks and Trump is about to take office in the US . We may be about to enter a new fight back from oppressed subcultures and nightlife in general , and London is perfectly positioned to be at the forefront . <p> Firstly , let me reveal my position : I love nightclubs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute any security would possibly consider letting me in . I actually forced my dad to take me to see Carl Cox at Star Club in Ibiza aged 14 and played my first DJ set in a club aged 16 . I fell in love with everything : the sound , the atmosphere , dancing , the flyers and the culture . When my friends and I were 18 or 19 we went to the same club nearly every week , sometimes twice in one weekend . We drove to other cities in pursuit of the best nights and planned our next attendance weeks in advance . It was common behaviour in the late 90s and I 'm sure my story is one that can be replicated by clubbers all over the country . Clubland in the UK felt like a way of life . The question is : are the current generation of 18- and 19-year-olds as inspired ? Will there be the number of clubs left for them to love ? <p> With clubs a subject very close to my heart , I explore some of the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From why club culture in the UK changed so much over the last decade to whether- London has lost its position as leader of global nightlife to cities like Amsterdam and Berlin . <p> I remember the shape of UK dance music culture really started changing in the late 90s , when festivals turned from being something that mainly free-spirited folk or muddy rock fans enjoyed into slick , highly produced affairs . I grew up near Winchester , and the arrival of Creamfields in 1998 was the biggest event in our local lives at the time . People I recognised from the pub " - people with no interest in dance music " were now at a dance festival . That 's what festivals have done : opened up dance music to everyone and anyone . It was the blueprint for the future . A regular clubber or a casual fan could now get hundreds of DJs and live dance acts in exchange for one ticket . But the weekly club night suffered as a consequence . <p> It suffered again in late 2005 when 24-hour licensing arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you had to wait two hours before they opened again " - the idea sounds quite ridiculous now , but it 's what made a pub a pub and a club a club . As soon as the bars in any town could stay open until 1am and people could dance in the same place they 'd been drinking all night , we all got confused . Suddenly the idea of paying -15 to get into a club and keep the night going past 11pm did n't seem to work anymore , and running any venue as a strictly late-night space became less attractive for the owners . <p> The impact of these changes in club culture probably hit London hardest . At some point , various cities have had moments when they mattered most in global clubland " a cultural impact . When it happens , the promoters and nights raise the bar , making the competition better . New York has been there many times , and London too . Paris is currently going through good times . Amsterdam is there right now , and Berlin never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading role in defining club culture and I was lucky enough to enjoy the tail end of the last golden era , playing venues such as Fabric , The Cross , The End , The Key and Ministry Of Sound " these were all great clubs , completely designed around the late night experience . <p> But maybe we have n't moved forward quickly enough the last few years and the government has n't been encouraging enough ether " and the result is that other cities have filled the void . The recently closed Trouw in Amsterdam was a club that felt truly like an innovation : an artistic space , with a restaurant ( great food too ) , new ways of displaying sound , light and positioning the DJ . Amsterdam took note , and the clubs got better and better . The Dutch government backed Amsterdam Dance Event too , and the results of that investment are easy to see across Amsterdam 's nightlife . Berghain in Berlin is another bastion of innovation , with resident DJs at its heart and recently declared a high culture venue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these two cities lead the charge in European clubbing right now . <p> There is no doubt London clubs have n't had the support of authorities and local government in recent years , but did they ever ? The recent decline of London clubs runs deeper . Noise complaints are a big factor in recent times , but they 're only a symptom . I 've seen first hand how venues that once seemed almost isolated in their environment are now surrounded by towering new flats . As property prices rise through the roof , disregarded spaces that only seemed suitable for nightclubs become areas where people want to live . To a developer , that warehouse on an industrial estate in Hackney now starts looking more attractive as 50 new flats . It 's a battle that seems hard to fight , in a city so populated and with not enough homes . <p> These bigger cultural changes have really put pressure on the idea of clubs as a leisure pursuit too . Just like record shops , clubs find themselves on the fringes of communities , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 20 years ago . People 's habits are changing , and it may be that our nightlife just has n't changed with them . But there is a possibility that as the world gets more complicated , we will return to the late night venues . Just like in the troublesome 80s , the simplicity of dancing and good times in dark rooms never seemed so inviting . <p> Perhaps the solution to some of our problems is to focus on that idea of community . Maybe we all need to learn to nurture local talent again . While dance music is now truly global , creating a localised environment for opportunity is essential . Local record shops and clubs in towns across the UK gave birth to DJs , producers and promoters who then went on to national and international success . They enabled them to build networks and experiment , learning their trade along the way . Giving a platform for local promoters to build infrastructure can do so much to build our foundations for the future . <p> In recent years , promoters of major events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly focused on booking a long list of top names to sell tickets in increasingly bigger venues . Festivals are now at the top of their game and there appears to be an insatiable appetite for them too . The supporting DJ residents , a staple of any respected club , just do n't have the ability to fit on the bill . Now 90- or even 60-minute sets are order of the day often at big events , with headliners ' doing warm-ups . We forgot what made clubs great in the first place : great residents plus great sound and light , great local networks and community . That 's why the temporary closure of Fabric was met with such heartbreak " - they believe in each one of these . The club 's temporary closure was a good reminder for electronic music how much we hold those values deep down . Only when they are taken away do we realise what we may have lost . <p> Promoters and festivals do so much to innovate and take risks that it would be unfair to say it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself needs to learn to nurture the nightclub again . DJs , managers and agents have become excited by the big fees that large events and festivals can offer . If you can play for thousands on a festival stage somewhere in Dubai , why bother playing a small club in Birmingham for a fraction of the fee ? Things are starting to adjust and you can see bigger DJs like Eats Everything or Annie Mac doing small club tours and many hot acts stopping at Sub Club in Glasgow just for the experience rather than fee . It 's more than likely we will look back on the whole EDM stadium era as a small glitch in the dance music history . A few years where we forgot what the music was designed for . Much like drinking a cocktail from your mum and dad 's drink cabinet " - fun and exciting at the time , but not really something you want to do again . <p> So what to the future ? <p> The point about community and talent is an important one . While we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivals or bring back all the clubs we 've lost , we can invest in a healthy scene that builds from the ground up . One of the reasons I love the UK 's scene in particular is it 's great at being creative and pushing the boundaries " - for example , we have the most liberal and musically supportive national radio stations in the world thanks to the BBC . On all levels , investing in young talent and nurturing the next generation of DJs and producers is absolutely essential . <p> If we look again to Amsterdam and Berlin , both feel like they have created a culture of residents and local music , then exported it . If London has the patience or finance to do the same , only time will tell . The same goes for other cities and towns " - we ca n't forget those regional towns that are full of the next generation , ready to mix things up . We need to have a platform where they can do that in clubs . Most importantly we need risk takers than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create something completely new . <p> There are so many examples of fine clubs and promoters in the UK that it would be disrespectful not to expect great things from all those who continue to make amazing parties . They know it is n't just about the club ; it 's about the music , the artwork , the access , the community , the respect , the owners and the artists . <p> I remain optimistic and excited about the future of UK nightlife and 2017 . I think this is the year we fall back in love with nightclubs all over again . <p> It 's about everyone ( myself included ) rethinking what we want our electronic music scene to become so that we can support and help to grow true creativity and excitement . It 's unlikely to be me driving to a club on the fringes of Birmingham for a night out but I hope there is a whole new generation ready to do so . So often with UK subcultures , you see the best of them when they are on the ropes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember why nightlife exists : for freedom , for fun , for expression and experimentation . As an alternative to mediocrity . <p> I have the feeling we are witnessing that comeback right now with our approach not only to music , but drugs , gender and equality . The outsiders , the misfits and the dissidents are taking back the clubs . Long may they flourish .

Dance music theory expert Oliver Curry deconstructs two classic examples and shows how to use them in your own music . <p> In this edition of Passing Notes , we 're going to take a look at polyrhythms . A polyrhythm is the use of two or more simultaneous rhythms in different time signatures . As we 'll see , these rhythmic contrasts can be incorporated into any elements of a track . Well take a look at examples from Aphex Twin and Zomby two of the finest exponents of polyrhythms see how they can also work in house and techno , then construct an example from scratch . <p> Without undertaking the near-impossible task of recreating the sounds of the original , we can use basic examples to look at a couple of key rhythmic components to the track and see how they combine to such an effective result . <p> The kick , snare and synth patterns that start at 0:51 are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first four bars of the audio below . However , the quiet offbeat hi-hats that come in during the second- four bars of the sample are in a 6/8 . In this very stripped down recreation , we can hear how a hi-hat rhythm in 6/8 can affect the feel of the piece in 4/4 : <p> Here , the hi-hats are highlighted in red , the kick in yellow and the snares in blue . By setting the piano-roll grid to 48th notes , we can read our sequencer in both 6/8 and 4/4 easily. - ( Every three 48ths will give you 16ths , thus keeping the part in 4/4 . Every four 48ths is a 12th , which will divide the beats into 3rds . If you 're scratching your head , do n't  worry the important point to remember is that both 6/8 and 4/4 fall perfectly on the gridlines with the grid divisions set to 48ths- . ) <p> There are numerous other elements to Windowlicker that also use this contrast of rhythms . The main vocal melodies , for example , are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll underneath on the 16ths , very low in the mix . <h> One Foot Ahead Of The Other <p> Let 's look now at Zomby 's track Helter Skelter ' , from 2009s- One Foot Ahead Of The Other EP <p> In particular , we 're looking at the section starting at 0:13 .

@@34419427 @3419427/ <p> You could argue that basslines are second only to the beat itself in defining the character of dance music . Given that so many dance tracks rely on the classic four-to-the floor kick drum patterns , the way in which the bassline interacts with this other low-frequency component is so important that different approaches to bassline programming may be the defining characteristic of a whole sub-genre- " just look at- acid house , for example . <p> In this piece we 're not going to tell you what basslines to choose . Instead we 'll examine some classic approaches to bass programming , and look at some of the tracks that help demonstrate " and may have even defined " a specific approach . <p> This is by no means a definitive list of bass types , and in reality the bassline in any given track may straddle two or more of those discussed here , but our eight categories encompass the vast majority of dance basslines . <p> In essence , this is all about the archetypes of dance basslines . Let 's dive into this pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 The off-beat bass <p> This has been a staple of a number of dance genres over the years , with its roots probably lying in disco , - synth pop and hi-NRG . <p> Bass notes are placed between each kick drum to deliver a simple driving rhythm that provides a pulsing backdrop to pads , arpeggiated synths and simple melodic motifs . <p> A nice example of this approach at work can be found in the Larse Vocal mix of Hallelujah Anyway ' by Candi Staton . The simple rhythm and chord shifts are- supported by the pulsing bass moving between only two notes : <p> In this style , bass notes are usually of medium length with a recognisable sharp attack and moderately filtered decay . A good place to start is with a sawtooth waveform . Use- an ADSR envelope to subtly sweep a low-pass filter 's cutoff downwards .

Side-chain compression on the bass ( triggered by the kick drum ) pushes down the level of those bass notes that arrive at the same time as a kick . This gives the impression of a simple old-school trance bassline.

Many- drummers have their own preferences when it comes to tuning their kicks , toms and snares , but this is often independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kits to play songs in different keys , so its always a compromise between pitch , tone , resonance and damping . <p> Realistic drum plugins such as Toontracks EZdrummer follow a similar approach , with the drum samples simply tuned to sound good ( click images to enlarge ) : <p> However , for electronic music production , we usually want more control over the pitch of our drum samples . One of the easiest methods is to transpose all the drums in one go something that 's very easy to do when using sampled drum hits from one plugin . By adjusting all the drums simultaneously you can try and find the frequencies which work best in the context of a track . <p> Although its more complicated to do this if your drum hits are placed on audio tracks , you can always copy individual elements to a sampler for more immediate control . FXpansion Geist , NI Battery and Steinberg 's Groove Agent ONE are relatively simple but effective drum samplers : <h> Can You Kick It ? <p> So far so good , but why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retuning a kick drum to fit the key of a specific track . The ease with which this can be done really depends on the various musical elements used . <p> What were looking for here is a sweet spot where the kick sounds in tune with the bass and their frequencies do n't  clash . This wont necessarily mean pitching up or down by whole semitones you 'll probably need to use the fine tuning control to adjust by cents ( fractions of a semitone ) . <p> Kicks with a more clearly discernible pitch such as long , booming 808s will usually require more care than shorter , clickier samples . As an aside , consider the fact that the TR-808 does n't  actually have a pitch control for the kick drum . Many owners of the real thing find themselves restricted to writing tracks in the same key in order to make the rest of the elements work with the 808s kick . <p> A neat trick for making the job a little easier here is to transpose the kick upwards by one or two octaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same amount . It tends to be easier to determine the pitch of the drum hit and hear how nicely it interacts with bass notes when its transposed up an octave or two . <p> here 's how the kick sounds transposed up an octave ready for retuning : <h> How Low Can You Go ? <p> Some tracks make a feature of the drums and their tuning the kick may even become the bassline ( again , a great trick with sampled 808 kicks ) . Here we 've mapped a kick drum across the keyboard in Groove Agent ONE :

A rhythm is said to be syncopated when off beats are emphasised . The definition of syncopation varies from that of swing " which we discussed in a recent instalment of Passing Notes " in that swing describes the shifting of off beats by varying amounts , whereas syncopation describes accentuating them in some way but not necessarily affecting the timing . ( Note that its also possible to use swing and syncopation simultaneously as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways in which syncopation can be added to a rhythm " it can be done with velocity , volume , timbre , interaction between different instrument parts , or by leaving gaps in a melody or rhythm line for emphasis . <h> Eye Of The Tiger <p> Our first example might not be the coolest , but its the perfect demonstration of syncopation in action : were going to examine the intro to Survivors Eye Of The Tiger : <p> It 's a convenient example because the guitar plays muted 16ths , clearly accentuating the first 16th of each beat ( highlighted in orange on the piano roll below , where the yellow notes represent the quieter guitar notes ) . <p> When the other guitar and drums come in , we can clearly hear that they accentuate off beats in addition to the downbeats played by the first guitar : <h> Kansas City Stomps <p> For a more complex example in an entirely different style , let 's check out a piece which uses both swing and syncopation in vast quantities : Jelly Roll Morton 's 1928 floor-filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece is certainly heavily swung , but the incredible rhythm of this track is hugely exaggerated by the syncopation . <p> Listen to the sparse clarinet line that comes in at 0:24 and how it works in conjunction with the off-beat snares . Less is most definitely more in this instance : the staccato notes at the beginning of the solo are n't just played with great rhythm , it 's the sparseness of the melody along with the timing that really creates the syncopated groove . More notes , no matter how swung , would quite likely detract from the rhythm . <h> Levon Vincent " Games Dub <p> Bringing things slightly more up to date , let 's check out the sparse , atmospheric intro of Games Dub by Levon Vincent . <p> In our Passing Notes feature on disco chords , we looked at Lost In Music by Sister Sledge , and how the piano chords playing the quarter beats either side of the off beat gave the snare more space , as well as giving the piano line a catchy syncopation . <p> Similarly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the beat rather than the downbeats on which the kick sounds .

@@34419442 @3419442/ <p> There are many approaches to dynamic gain control using compression , from compressing instruments at the recording stage , through compressing individual tracks or buses in the mix , to compressing the master bus itself . The latter is an essential part of most mixdowns , but its easy to get wrong . <p> Producers have tended to fall into two camps when it comes to processing the master bus , with some advocating its use from an early stage ( some do it from the very start , - their- compressor of choice permanently parked on the master bus ) , to those who see it as something best left to the mastering engineer. - Remember also that even this is n't necessarily the end of the story ; the final master may then be subjected to additional compression or limiting by a broadcaster or club rig . <p> Which is all to say that , at the very least , compression decisions should be taken with care and an awareness of what you 're comparing your own material to . In this article well consider exactly what were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to achieve cohesive , punchy mixes using stereo compression across the mix bus . <h> What does mix bus compression do ? <p> As with any form of compression , mix bus processing effectively flattens the peaks of your signal , reducing dynamic range . <p> At this point its worth a quick refresher on perceived loudness. - When we can glance at the level meters in our DAW to check that were not overloading anything , these generally only give us an indication of peak level . Peak level meters give us little idea of loudness , or to be more accurate , our perception of loudness . <p> Its perfectly possible to have two tracks that both peak at just below 0dBFS ( a digital system 's maximum achievable level ) , and for one to be noticeably quieter than the other . This is because loudness is dependent on a range of factors , including sound pressure level and duration of sound , which means that by manipulating the dynamics of a track we can make it appear louder without overloading the signal chain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tracks can gleaned by looking at their waveforms side by side in a DAW . The louder track will be much denser . here 's an audio track before processing , peaking at just below -1 dBFS : <p> Mix bus compression will play a part in increasing the apparent loudness of our tracks , but as well see itll also increase punchiness and help to glue the individual elements together a subtle effect which makes the whole track seem more cohesive . <h> How does mix compression work ? <p> Audio compression as applied to the mix bus needs to be considered in a different way to compression on individual mix elements ( or even sub-grouped mix stems ) . <p> A compressor , at its most basic , is an automatic volume control whose operation is dependent on the level of the incoming signal. - This means that the more sounds that are mixed together prior to its use , the more that any one sound in the mix can determine the compressor 's overall effect . <p> Low frequency material requires more energy to be heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mixed louder in dance music in order to achieve greater impact. - As a result , the bass elements in a mix are most likely to push the compressor into action . <p> The last of these three clips demonstrates the most extreme form of compression , with the bass drum kicking ' the compressor into heavy gain reduction . <p> There are ways around this pumping ' effect , though when used appropriately , and in moderation , this side-effect of the compression process can be beneficial . And used to extremes you can get seriously pumping mixes without the use of a sidechain . <h> Hands-on <p> Let 's start with the UAD Precision Buss Compressor , a relatively simple broadband compressor ( the most common type to apply across the full frequency range if you do n't  have the UAD plugin , use your DAWs stereo mix compressor ) . <p> Set it for a 2:1 ratio with a medium to fast attack and moderate release as shown in the screenshot below . Slowly lower the threshold ( the level at which the compressor kicks-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compression . <p> Next move on to the release setting . This , perhaps more than the other controls , needs to done whilst listening to the track. - The aim is to get the compressor to work in tandem with the groove of the music , so that the gain reduction is applied during peaks , but has time to recover before them . <p> ( Incidentally , a nifty trick if you cant hear the impact your tweaks to the release time are having on the material is to either increase the ratio or adjust the threshold value temporarily so that the effect of the compressor becomes considerably more obvious . This will allow you to make informed adjustments to the release and attack values that work with the nature of the material you 're working on . When you 've got the right settings you can the return the threshold and/or ratio settings to where they were before . ) <p> Faster , busier tracks will require shorter release times. - Making the release too long here will merely lower the level of the whole track , acting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time also benefits from a little tweaking . If the attack setting is too fast , the transients of each sound will be squashed and the track will start to lose punch , especially with higher gain reduction settings .

People who know a lot of things ; people who 've written books on the subject of recording and processing audio , have perpetuated this myth by writing about it , repeating it and passing it along as established fact so that you can read it passed off as fact in countless blogs and forums . <p> The only problem is that it 's completely , utterly incorrect . <p> in the pursuit of truth , justice , and all that is good in the world , I give you the correct definition of attack <p> And so , in the pursuit of truth , justice , and all that is good in the world , I give you the correct definition of attack : <p> Attack is the length of time it takes a compressor to apply roughly two-thirds of the targeted amount of gain reduction . <p> I say roughly two-thirds ' because there is no agreed-upon , industry-accepted standard for what this spec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no two compressor designers will agree on exactly how to define , and therefore measure , attack . My definition above is within the ballpark of most thinking , so I 'm running with it . <p> To understand this definition of attack better , you need to get some basics of compression established first . Let 's say your compressor is set with a threshold of -10dB and a ratio of 3:1 . If you feed this compressor a signal at -11dB , nothing happens because the signal is lower than the -10dB threshold . <p> But if that signal jumps to -1dB things get interesting . Most notably , the instant the signal reaches -10dB the compressor begins attacking it . There is no delay whatsoever in this response , which belies the myth that attack is the time it takes a compressor to respond once a signal crosses threshold . <p> With a -1dB signal and a -10dB threshold , the signal is 9dB over threshold. - Our 3:1 ratio means that for every 3dB coming in over threshold , the comp wants to allow 1dB out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over threshold , our hypothetical 3:1 comp wants to compress those incoming 9dB into 3dB at the output , which would require 6dB of gain reduction . <p> Given that attack is the time it takes a compressor to apply roughly 2/3 of the targeted gain reduction , the attack in this case indicates how fast the comp will apply the first 4dB of the target 6dB of reduction . <p> If you do n't follow the math of this illustration , do n't worry . For now it 's enough to know that the compressor starts applying gain reduction as soon as the signal crosses the threshold . Which means that attack is not a delay before action , nor is it even a measurement of time per se ; instead , it is a rate , a measurement of the speed at which the process of gain reduction is occurring . <h> Myth #2 : Release is the time it takes a compressor to release compression- after the signal drops below threshold <p> Without going into detail , let me just say that the above definition is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assign a single value to . ( Which is a story for another column . ) <p> The correct definition of release will come as no surprise given what you 've read above : <p> Release is the time it takes a compressor to restore two-thirds of the reduced gain to the compressed signal . <p> Restoring reduced gain ' is a very carefully chosen set of words . I characterised release in those terms because it 's useful to think of compression as a two-way street . <p> it 's useful to think of compression as a two-way street . <p> When a compressor attacks , it is applying gain reduction " it is lowering the signal level . <p> But gain reduction is only half the picture , because for every dB of gain a compressor takes away , at some point it has to put it back . And that process " let 's call it gain restoration ' " is the business of release . The faster your release , the faster the compressor restores the gain it took away when attacking . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely academic way ? <p> Attack is the length of time it takes a compressor to apply roughly two-thirds of the targeted gain reduction . <p> Release is the length of time it takes a compressor to restore roughly two-thirds of that reduced gain . <p> This gives us a good grounding to tackle more compression myths . <h> Myth #3 : A compressor wont release until the signal drops below the threshold <p> If you 've been paying attention , it should already be obvious why this statement is false . <p> The explanation lies in the fact that aside from generating ancillary effects like distortion and colouration from transformers and tubes , attacking and releasing a signal are the only two things a compressor can do . <p> Put a little differently : any time the gain reduction meter on a compressor is moving , it is either attacking or releasing the signal . <p> Fascinating ! Taking it a step further : <p> Any time the gain reduction meter is increasing ( i.e. , the comp is reducing the gain of the signal ) , the compressor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is decreasing ( i.e. , the comp is restoring the gain of the signal ) , the compressor is releasing . <p> So while the well-intentioned myth-spreaders out there would have you believe that attack and release are only relevant when a signal crosses the threshold " attack on the way up and release on the way down " what I am telling you is that nothing could be further from the truth . Instead , once a signal is over the threshold , both attack and release are constantly at play . <p> Any time the gain reduction meter is increasing , the compressor is attacking . <p> There 's a simple way to confirm this . Feed a drum loop into a compressor and set it up so that the signal is always over threshold and the gain reduction meter is dancing between say 6 and 12dB of reduction . In this instance the compressor is constantly attacking and releasing the signal , as indicated by the dance of the meter . <p> If the myths were true " if attack only happened when a signal crosses above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below threshold " adjusting the attack and release knobs in the above scenario would n't make any difference because the signal is perpetually over the threshold but turn the attack and release knobs and you will very clearly hear the sound of the continuous compression changing . Give it a try . <p> I think most people who use compressors on a regular basis already understand the above on an intuitive level , but some never make the connection that the behaviors they 're hearing ( and seeing on the meters ) do n't comport with the conventional " and flawed " wisdom .

The basic compressors in most DAWs tend to look pretty similar . Heres Cubases example : <p> In this guise and in very basic terms if the input signal level goes above a given threshold , the output signal will be reduced ( attenuated ) . The speed and amount by which the output is attenuated are determined by the compressor design and adjustable settings such as ratio , attack and release . <p> As you would expect , this is called- downward compression , as the resulting signal is pushed down in level effectively making the louder elements quieter , whilst leaving the quite bits untouched . <h> New York , New York <p> There is also such as technique as- upward compression , where the opposite happens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other elements stay the same . The most common technique is known as- parallel compression , due to the way in which it is achieved . <p> Whilst the term upward compression somehow sounds counter-intuitive it is quite easy to achieve simply blend a compressed signal with an uncompressed version of the same thing ( hence the name parallel , as the two signals are processed separately and then mixed back together ) . The easiest way to do this is in a DAW is to duplicate the track in question <p> or to route a track to a- bus- onto which compression is applied . <p> Parallel compression ( sometimes called- New York compression due to its popularity with New York mix engineers ) , is a great way of achieving a subtle dynamic lift , and is far less noticeable in action when compared to its downward ' cousin. - Parallel compression can be used on a variety of sounds , but its probably most popular on drums . <p> Let 's compare the same drum loop using parallel compression . First off , here 's the very heavily compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect the compressor element of the signal chain should be set with a very low threshold , to give almost continuous gain reduction . Attack time should be as fast as possible and with a medium release ( about 300 ms ) . Ratios of around 2.5:1 tend to work well , but you can experiment in each direction for a more subtle or dramatic effect . If you have the choice , set the compressor to peak ' mode ( as opposed to RMS ) . Gain make-up is a matter of taste , as this determines how much of this compressed signal gets mixed with the original version . On its own it will sound very , very squashed ! <p> Heres Cubases compressor set up for heavy parallel compression ( note that the compression ratio is just 2.5:1 , but the gain reduction is still huge nearly 30 dB because of the very low threshold setting ) . <p> Some plugins even have parallel compression capabilities built-in in fact , all this requires is an integrated- mix amount- control , as seen in the UAD Precision Buss Compressor :

@@34419454 @3419454/ <p> Sampled chords are a key component of countless techno and deep house tracks , but the whole idea of sampling a chord then replaying it at different pitches might initially seem a little strange . Why not just play the chord with a real instrument ? Wouldnt that give more flexibility ? <p> To understand why the technique became popular , we have to look back to its roots in the mid 1980s . Rather than one definitive reason why so many producers adopted this technique , there are a handful of overlapping , related causes . Firstly , many early house producers did n't  necessarily have the keyboard skills to play complex chord progressions manually and sequencing technology was in its infancy . <p> Secondly , in the days when gear was relatively much more expensive than it is now and the days of soft synths and virtually unlimited multi-track recording were a distant dream , loading synth sounds into a sampler freed the synth up to play another part . <p> Thirdly , chords could be sampled from existing tracks ( often jazz , funk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing recording . <p> Finally , although its a subtly different sound and technique , its worth mentioning that a number of affordable 80s synths including the Roland Alpha Juno and Korg Poly-800 featured chord memory functions which allowed chords to be played with a single finger ( a technique which became particularly popular in rave and hardcore in the late 80s and early 90s ) . <p> At the most basic level , sampling a chord from an existing track or from a synth or acoustic instrument can be a great way to play otherwise difficult or unusual progressions . However , as we 'll also see , the technique also introduces a distinctive sound as the chord gets pitched up and down the keyboard . <h> Bicep Feel It <p> For an excellent example of sampled chords in action , let 's start by listening to Bicep 's Feel It ' , released as a free download last summer : <p> The track samples a minor 7 chord at Eb ( it sounds as if it 's most likely voiced with the minor 7th , Db , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gb , Bb ) . We can hear that throughout the track the chord switches from Eb minor 7 to identically voiced Ab minor 7 chords either side of it . Pictured below is a piano roll of the chords played at 2:50 . You can see how the intervals between notes are identical . <p> Here 's how the chord sequence sounds when played in using a basic organ patch : <p> However , in the track we can also hear how the timbre of the chords played is affected as the sampled chord gets pitched up and down . This is most obviously apparent at 3:19 , when the chords descend in pitch without the drums and bassline . Note how the sampler slows the recorded sound down in order to reduce the pitch , introducing a grainy feel and slowing the envelope of the sound . <p> As the sampler pitches the audio further away from its original pitch , the harmonics are shifted accordingly , resulting in a very distinctive sound .

Compressing individual drums can give definition to each element , but compressing all of them together can act like a sonic gel , and may also improve the overall groove , giving the whole drum part a better ebb and flow . <p> What settings to use is really a matter of taste and is perhaps determined by how audible you want the final result to be . For example , we could use a clean-sounding compressor like a modern VCA design to nudge the drum mix in by a few dB at the peaks . The most common approach with this method would be to employ a fast attack and moderately fast ( or automatic ) release . Ratio can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use what seems like quite a low setting . Somewhere around 2:1 to 4:1 can often be very effective for subtle processing . Heavier compression and limiting may be best left for the overall mix ( if at all ) . <p> The second approach would be to go in with all guns blazing and deliberately squash the hell out of the drums to create an extreme effect . This typically works best on sparse rhythmic parts .

@@34419458 @3419458/ <p> Main room house is largely characterised by big , emotional minor chord progressions . In this edition of Passing Notes , we 're going back to basics and looking at the natural minor scale and some simple examples of minor chord progressions . <p> Firstly , we 'll look at the natural minor scale ( which is also the Aeolian mode ) . We 've used an A minor scale , simply because it just uses the white notes on our keyboard " A , B , C , D , E , F , G , A : <p> In many cases these chords are simplified into triads ( three-note chords ) by omitting the 7ths : - A minor " B diminished " C major " D minor " E minor " F major " G major " A minor <p> These chords " and their equivalents in other keys " form the basis of the vast majority of main room house tracks . <p> ( Remember that the exact chords will change depending on what key your tracks in .

In 2008 , he co-founded- the- London Contemporary Orchestra with fellow conductor Hugh Brunt . Since then , the pair have worked to redefine the way we consider orchestral- music , collaborating- with artists and composers from- Actress to- Terry Riley along the way . <p> We spoke to- Robert about- the parallels- between conducting and electronic production , the sometimes uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working with Justice . <p> Attack : How did- you get into- conducting ? <p> Robert Ames : I started music at a pretty young age , like a lot of people do in this country " you just pick up an instrument at school . I was conducting from a fairly young age as well , which is probably less normal " I think I was conducting when I was 13- years old . I went to the Royal Academy of Music , where I did the whole music college thing , and then I started the LCO off in 2008 with my co-director Hugh Brunt . <p> For those who do n't  know , what is the LCO ? <p> The London Contemporary Orchestra . We 're an orchestra , but more a collective of musicians who put on gigs in London , primarily of new music , and we 're really privileged to get to do some exciting collaborations , recordings and film work , and to play in some great venues . This year we worked with Justice on their album Woman , with Radiohead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endless and Blonde . <p> Those are all huge projects . How did they- come about ? <p> With the Radiohead album , it was from working with Jonny Greenwood for a couple of years . We actually worked with him on the score for the Paul Thomas Anderson film The Master , then started gigging with him a bit . We put together a show with him playing guitar and ondes Martenot with a load of string players from the LCO , doing a combination of his music and some really old Baroque music as well , like Purcell and people like that . The Radiohead recording came out of that . <p> Justice- was a completely different connection , a singer-songwriter called Mara Carlyle who had us on her album and we 've been working with her for a bit since . She got us in to do the strings and take care of the choir parts . <p> Where do you record ? <p> A Moon Shaped Pool was at RAK Studio. - The Frank Ocean tracks we recorded at Abbey Road , - so London again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real privilege- to be able to work with artists with a big enough budget to record at places like Abbey Road and RAK . <p> Yeah , they 're beautiful rooms with people working in them who are amazing at what they do , which makes for a really pleasant process . <p> What was involved in- the Justice sessions ? <p> They- were interesting from a strings point of view because the guys really knew what they wanted . They were very keen to get those super-tight disco string sounds , and on the album you can hear that the strings are a super-tight sounding group , most of the time playing in octaves or all playing a melody line without any harmonies . We spent a lot of time trying to get that right , trying to find that slightly nostalgic string disco sound . It was tough actually , getting that right " it sounds kind of simple but there 's a real clarity to that sound which was hard work to achieve . <p> I 'm assuming they attended the recording ? <p> Yeah , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of one of the sessions where I did have things to say but it was really more about getting- the thoughts they had out to the musicians , because they felt really strongly about how it should sound and you can hear it in their music . They were treating their strings with the precision and the transparency of all the sounds in their tracks " they wanted to get that- accuracy they 'd get when they 're playing electronic instruments , but from acoustic instruments , which was a really fun challenge to get right . <p> A- lot of the time orchestral music and dance- music are quite uneasy bedfellows . Dance music , pop music and rock music in general really . People often tag an orchestra onto a rock band- or use it- pretty much just as a focal point for- a live performance and it does n't  really work .

We did a show at The Barbican with Actress recently and we worked with him from the ground up to write new material . That worked really well because his music always sounds a bit orchestral and has so many interesting colours in it , so much depth to it and so much texture in it already. - For me thats- very different from orchestrating a 90s banger , if you know what I mean .

You 've got a whole generation of musicians who 've known electronic sounds since birth . <p> Yeah . With the LCO group , a lot of our musicians are kind of mid-to-late-20s , so a lot of the stuff we 're working on is music they listen to themselves . They 've grown up being Radiohead fans , they know who Frank Ocean is and they probably like Justice 's first album " it 's probably what they were out getting drunk to when they were 18-year-olds , you know ? They 're the right age for that , so we 've already got an understanding and a feel for the music , which is a great head start . <p> I think classical musicians now , the younger generation seem to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more .

I do n't know ! Maybe it was being a teenage megalomaniac <p> what really excited me about conducting was probably the same thing that composers get really excited about . I 've never composed my own music , but with a symphony orchestra you have an insane palette of colours to work with <p> Is there a bit of that to the conductor 's mentality in general ?

It 's interesting where conducting is right now : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the big character standing in front of a big group of musicians , dictating how something sounds .

I think when I was young , what really excited me about it was probably the same thing that composers get really excited about . I 've never composed my own music , but- with a symphony orchestra you have an insane palette of colours to work with , and so many variables . With a piece of music there are so many possibilities for what you can do with that number of people and those instruments , I think that 's probably what excited me about it . <p> That palette of sounds is a really good- comparison with the palette of electronic sounds a producer works with . <p> It really excites me at the moment actually . What LCO does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ways of getting them to work on acoustic instruments , which is a really interesting thing to do . It 's been an obsession in electronic synthesis to try and emulate string sounds , but it 's got to the stage for us where it 's more interesting to flip that and try to use acoustic instruments to emulate sounds that have been produced electronically . <p> Conducting is even more abstract than producing electronic tracks . We have to say something , or show something with our hands , which is being translated by another human being <p> I think you can- compare- conducting to- electronic music production and engineering too . Both bring a human element into parts of the music creation- process that some might dismiss as being defined by other things . In the case of electronic music production , people might say its defined by the equipment , and in the case of conducting , people might say its defined by the musicians in- the orchestra . What does a conductor bring to the- process ? <p> Conducting is this mad thing in music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a voice . You 're sort of leading rehearsals , and facilitating the music and how something should sound , but you 're not doing anything concrete . It is quite abstract , and I 'd say it 's even more abstract than producing electronic tracks because you can press a button on a computer to change how something sounds , but we have to say something , or show something with our hands , which is being translated by another human being who tries to do that musically with his or her instrument . It is a strange thing . I think the role of it has changed now . A conductor is n't dictating the big picture from beginning to end any more , but trying to find a way to create something beautiful with the people in the room at the time . <p> It 's almost like you 're playing the humans instead of the instruments ?

In some cases genres can even be defined by the sonics and style of their kick , snare and claps alone . <p> On the face of it you might think its simply a matter of choosing a couple of appropriate clap or snare sounds , placing them on the 2nd and 4th beats of the bar and job done ' .

The beauty here is that its possible to give your productions your own personalised sonic stamp armed only with a few of the choice tricks discussed below . <h> Start with the right sounds <p> Assuming your kick drums already in place , let 's get the snare going . To begin with its sometimes better to start with a full-sounding snare , rather than anything too weak and simple . This should give you plenty of scope for some shaping and tweaking later . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First layer it in exactly the same place as the original snare . The clap sound in this case has an altogether different tone and shape to the snare . Claps tend to have less fullness to them , with a staggered attack phase . What we want here is something that complements our snare , rather than treading on its toes in sonic terms . <p> Next we can add some additional width to the sound , by inserting a stereo delay . The key here is to use two short ( but different ) delay times for the left and right channels . If possible , try some low and high cut on the delay feed , and keep its mix balance to less than about 30% . <p> Now we turn our attention to the clap . A useful trick for widening the stereo image of a sound is to duplicate it across two tracks , pan the tracks left and right respectively and apply complimentary EQ to each . In other words , at frequencies where one is boosted , the other should be cut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this automatically for you .

Since then , the company has moved- with the times and evolved to become an entirely different prospect : an all-round provider of everything from samples and soundware to books , training courses and plugins . <p> We caught up with Sharooz and SM general manager Barry McManus to discuss the progression- of the sample industry over the last decade and what they have planned for the years to come . <p> Attack : - A lot has changed over the last ten years . When you launched the company back in 2006 , most people were buying sample DVDs rather than downloading sample packs . What are the other big changes you 've seen in the industry ? <p> Sharooz Raoofi : There have been huge changes , mostly in line with the wider music and pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on . Ten years ago , packs- were much more expensive and less curated . There was n't really a focus on niche . A generic house or techno pack usually sounded nothing like the records in that genre and was just a bunch of generic 909 loops . When digital really started to dominate , there was this whole race to the bottom ' model where you might be able to get 2 GB of sounds for $10 . We 've been very careful to avoid that " it 's impossible to expect proper quality control and guarantee copyright-free sounds if one goes down that route . The other biggest change of course is that are just so many more developers out there , and many of them peddle wares that just are n't fit for purpose . I pay so little attention to the competition . Nothing in the space excites or inspires me as much as what my own team are doing . <p> Barry McManus : Whilst the delivery mechanism might have changed , the core of what we do remains the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enhance producers ' creativity . Electronic music has and always will constantly evolve new sounds , new technology but our passion and ethos remains the same so its easy to roll with those changes in the industry no matter how big or small . I suppose the emergence of iOS as viable alternative to traditional DAW setups is an interesting one that will only continue to grow in influence and I 'm pretty excited about that . <p> How much do you think people 's attitudes to using samples have changed over the last decade ? Is there more of a focus on stamping your own identity on samples rather than just using sounds straight out of a pack ? <p> Barry McManus : People have always used samples . Royalty-free or not , sampling has been one of the backbones of electronic music for decades . So in that sense I do n't think attitudes have shifted that much . With sample packs specifically I just think as the quality and variety of products in the industry has increased its become seen as a more accepted form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would imagine it 's a fairly standard part of almost every serious producer 's armoury to have a large collection of samples .

It 's hugely flattering to me every time I discover a track I like uses one of our sounds . It 's not a guilty secret for producers to admit using samples and I 'm firm believer that it has significantly improved the overall quality of electronic music records over the last decade . <p> Barry McManus : - I think in general sample providers have responded to what people want , which is sounds that are n't cookie-cutter drag-and-drop fodder but instead high-quality , versatile elements that are raw enough in terms of processing to reward experimentation . <p> I think in general sample providers have responded to what people want , which is sounds that are n't cookie-cutter drag-and-drop fodder <p> The sample market is more crowded than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest ? <p> Barry McManus : Obviously we keep an eye on what our competitors are doing , but the best way we can set ourselves apart from others is by focusing on ourselves " our standards and our passions , as that 's what has got us to this point . We 're always looking to innovate " whether its optimising sounds for specific DAWs or workstations or developing instruments and plugins " but whatever we do we just try and make sure its engrained with the SM ethos that has set us apart since day one . <p> Sharooz Raoofi : For me its quality , quality and quality .

It 's a huge challenge to have any digital retail store or service stick around for that long and it 's a massive testament to our customers and their loyalty that we are still here . <p> Barry McManus : We 've had some misses as well , especially with the more faddy EDM trends . Melbourne Bounce did n't exactly resonate with our audience . <p> I think but there are digital retailers that have cheapened soundware by offering up ridiculously large bundles for next to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what do you think are the worst trends in soundware in recent years ? <p> Sharooz Raoofi : I mentioned it earlier I think but there are digital retailers that have cheapened soundware by offering up ridiculously large bundles for next to nothing . No one can expect a quality product from that . And the producers are getting a terrible deal . Producing soundware takes significant time and careful skill , therefore proper content costs money to produce . <p> DAW-based sample library searches and breaking packs down into individual samples are both ideas that have been floated to us in the past . I 've frowned upon both as I feel the purchase and transaction process for shopping individual samples is unconducive to workflow . I 'd stick to carefully curated full pack content over individual sample purchases all day long . <p> What have you got planned for the near future ? Big changes or a continuation of what you 've been doing ? <p> Sharooz Raoofi : We have some fairly sizeable changes coming up .

How do you decide which musical trends are just short-lived fads and which ones are important new genres to focus on ? <p> Barry McManus : There 's no hard and fast rule on that we just create sounds we believe in , whether they 're short-lived or not . If it excites us musically then we 'll go for it . <p> Music-making technology has evolved almost too quickly for the human imagination , in terms of recycled feature sets with layers of added complexity . <p> How far can you look into the next decade and predict what 's going to happen for the business ? Are you planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always impossible to do so and , contrary to conventional wisdom , I do n't often plan too far ahead .

Our R&amp;D begins and ends with the fact we 're all actively involved in one strand or another of the electronic music industry , constantly playing with new gear and making music whenever and however we can . For me Sample Magic is a part of my greater identity that is , simply put , an appreciation of electronic music , keeping it exciting and relevant , and making tools that inspire those making the music to inspire those who listen to and dance to the music . As long as we can continue to make those tools , regardless of their format , that is the only vision for the future I can steadfastly adhere to . <p> Looking forward another ten years , 2026 sounds like the future . What 's the future for sample companies ? <p> Sharooz Raoofi : Music-making technology has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of recycled feature sets with layers of added complexity . I find many plugins gimmicky and unconducive to workflow because the learning curve is so steep . It 's overwhelming .

@@34419478 @3419478/ <p> We 've covered the basics of arpeggiators before , but there 's a lot more potential to this- humble tool- than you might think .

The chord progression remains the same , but the way the arpeggiator interprets the pattern changes quite dramatically . <p> The beauty of this approach is that it comes up with unexpected results . The MIDI pattern we 've ended up with in the final screenshot above looks a bit of a mess , but the arpeggiator makes sense of it all .

To be honest , I find most prepared piano music dull and uninteresting . <p> For those who are n't  familiar with the concept of prepared piano , can you talk a little about what it is and the history of its use in music ? <p> It 's the practice of adding objects to the piano , such as bolts , screws , nuts and rubber . The sound it makes is usually percussive , and you often lose the original pitch of the key . It actually goes back to the 16th century , but was really invented in its modern form by the composer John Cage , while composing music for a choreographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can you tell us about some of the specific ways you prepare your own pianos ? What do you do to create these sounds ? Is it a trial-and-error process , happy accidents or a more structured approach to creating particular timbres ? <p> The kick involves a lot of Blu-Tack and a ruler , the snares and hi-hat bolts and washers , some felt for muted bass notes . I held normal drums as a yardstick which I had to equal and sonically surpass in some way . If the sounds were just clever copies , they would ultimately be useless " there had to be something new and unique about them to justify their existence . The difficult technical stuff is in how I get the sounds out of the strings and into the PA . That 's where the sweat , toil and frustration lies . I had to build my own hardware , and it took a long time . I have humbuckers the size of ladybirds <p> Preparations are just one factor . Extended techniques are just as important : hitting the strings , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final stages of putting another element in place , which involves using the feedback caused by the soundboard and PA as an acoustically generated oscillator that I control and shape into rhythms and tones . The piano , room and PA becomes one huge instrument . It is early stages yet " - I think I have already blown one of my Genelecs , and it completely ran amok in a gig in Holland last weekend " but when it works it sounds spectacular . <p> Diagram of the- feedback system , using the piano , room and PA as a controllable oscillator <p> How many pianos do you use ? I saw the portable electro-acoustic piano you set up recently . Do you have a lot of different instruments on the go at any given time ? <p> I have separate rigs : a normal grand piano , a supposedly portable 150kg grand , the Yamaha CP-80 " perhaps one of the greatest electro acoustic instruments ever built " and a modified clavichord , a little keyboard from the 16th century that is compact enough to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound as big as the others , and can quite easily bring a PA to its knees . They all sound different , and I am currently working on a CP-80 and clavichord album . I am particularly excited about my clavichord , as it is now largely a forgotten , obsolete instrument . Resurrecting it for a new audience is a great feeling , even if it is very technically challenging to pull off . <p> Everything you do is played live , in real time , with no looping or overdubs . Is that purely so that you can perform all the tracks in a live setting or is there more to it ? Are you never tempted to loop , say , a kick drum-style sound so you can free up your fingers for more parts over the top of it ? <p> No . It always sounds better when I record in one take , to a stereo file , with no mixing . Maybe because the whole piece is created in real time , as a whole , all the parts work together as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece : bass , middle , treble , foreground and background , simultaneously . Sometimes adding is the easy way out of a problem " if the sound is good , you do n't need to add more . <p> How much does the setting of the performance affect the way people react to it ? Do you think the type of venue you play in " and the way you 're presented on stage " has an effect on peoples expectations and responses to the music ? <p> That 's a deep question , but basically yes , it does , and the setting is a big part of the musical experience . You can either go with it , or deliberately against it . <p> What kind of responses have you had playing live in a more dancefloor-focused club setting , like XOYO ? How do people react to the spectacle ? Is that dancefloor setting something that particularly interests you given your own interests in more traditional forms of techno ? <p> I would like to do something like that again , and do it better . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs and bars for centuries . <p> I 'm not particularly driven to seek dancefloor situations out , but then I 'm not driven to perform in public in general . It 's very stressful , and usually falls short of what I intended . Most of the traditional techno-inspired tracks I perform only at home and are technical studies used to improve my timing and concentration . Much more fun than scales . <p> When people attempt to fuse dance music with classical music " or just acoustic instruments " it often ends up as a very cliched attempt to make dance music seem more serious . I 'm thinking of things like the BBC Ibiza Prom or Hacienda Classical . What are your thoughts on that ? <p> It depends what side you come at this from . I hear a lot of contemporary electronic and dance music that is successfully using sounds and textures that used to be found only in classical and experimental music . Richard Devine and Autechre relate to Parmegiani and Stockhausen . <p> How do you avoid that kind of cliche ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination .

They 're not quite as well-known as some of the other names on this list , particualry in Europe , where distribution has n't  always been particularly widespread . The California company was founded in 1981 and became best known for its work modifying and then cloning Minimoogs , leading to the creation of rack synths such as the Midimoog and eventually the current range , including the almighty CODE polysynth . <p> The Boomstar series sees SE make a break from rack units to introduce a range of monophonic desktop modules , all with shared DNA but subtly different flavours of sound . Each Boomstar features discrete circuitry , with two oscillators , two envelope generators and an LFO . The key difference between the options is in the filter circuit : the Boomstar is available in six different flavours : the SE80 , with a Yamaha CS-80-derived multi-mode filter ; the 700 , with a MiniKorg VCF ; the 5089 , featuring the classic Moog 24dB ladder design ; the 4075 , with aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oberheim 12dB filter ; and the 3003 , recreating the TB-303 's classic acid sound . <p> The Boomstars are also semi-modular , featuring a small number of patch points for interfacing with other gear .

The idea was to create a beatless composition , introducing different sounds and textures that will appear in the songs afterwards , to serve as a kind of announcement . While browsing on my hard disks I found this nice melody that I made couple of years ago while messing around with Nodal generative music software and used it as a backbone for the rest of composition . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed up by the System 100s melody surrounded by Juno-106 strings . I just love how the chorus works on the Juno " it feels like its hugging all the sounds together . In the middle part , the song drops into a piano solo that I recorded with Logics EXS Steinway Grand piano accompanied with a JD990 oboe pad serving as a kind of counterpoint . The whole piece is underpinned with a deep Moog Minitaur bass that slowly drifts between two main keys . This up and down motion is also reflected in the structure of the arrangement , moving from fast to slow and back . The song ends unresolved with an SH-101 solo , leaving the listener with an expectation as to what will follow next . <p> Roland Juno-106 and JX-8P <h> The Lattice <p> I have a small setup at home where I can practise . During one session , an idea for Lattice came into existence . I had a sequencer running broken chords that I could transpose with my left hand and another one running gate pulses which I used to trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played a simple downward chord progression while experimenting with different rising and falling melodic patterns . This phenomenon " where harmony is reinforcing melody and vice versa " gave me the idea for the song title . <p> When I went- back to my studio I continued to work on the arrangement , adding drums and supporting string layers . I went for simple 909 and CR-78 drums with a dominating phased shaker cutting out of the mix . I deliberately kept percussion sounds hard panned left and right , out of middle range as much as possible , to leave more space for sounds " especially the Juno-106 string section that appears in- the last third of the track . <h> Before it all ends <p> I remember coming back home from Ibiza after playing in DC-10 and had this groove locked in my head . The next day I wrote it down using the System 100 for heavy bass and dropping a couple of Motown drum loops on top . I saved it on my disk but as I was working on other project at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home when everybody was asleep I was playing- around with a new Yamaha P10 piano that we bought for my daughter . I was enjoying it so much that I plugged in my MIDI recorder and recorded a couple of nice takes . Back in the studio , I found that forgotten groove and it fitted perfectly with the takes I brought from home . <p> As the song gradually evolved as an idea , it came to have a Carpenter-style breakdown with an epic synth line . For this kind of occasion I always go for the- Prophet-600 . To add dimension , I recorded couple of takes in different octaves , mixing them down in hard left and right pan positions . In situations like this I prefer this technique over chorus since the P600 is always slightly detuned , so you can never get two identical takes and the result is a huge stereo width of sound . <p> For FX sweeps I used a System 100 oscillator in combination with noise generator , and just recorded a bunch of takes while tweaking pitch frequency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of times as an ending track and it really gets peoples attention , especially when the main theme hits in the breakdown . <p> DSI Prophet-600 and Roland Jupiter-4 <h> Midnight orchestra <p> While experimenting with chords , I noticed a really nice and somewhat unusual feel when transposing all notes from the chord one half step down . It is a quite big jump if you look at it in a circle of fifths , but still I found this nice chord progression that follows this half step rule and could also resolve from major to minor chords in the same key . <p> I plugged in some synths and played around , and after while had a really nice theme that worked in this harmony . I decided to go with a simple , dry-sounding mix of elements to get more emphasis on tones that are interacting . I- tried to fill space with as many synths as the mix could hold " this is by far the most simultaneous synths I 've ever used in one track , a real constellation of sounds scattered around in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the song everything drops to- a Moog Minitaur bass arpeggio with the main synth on top in an almost random pattern , helping release some of the memorised notes from first half of the track . This unloading is crucial for the listener to be able to stay focused on the parts that will follow . <p> When the- main theme returns and all the elements are introduced again , I topped up everything with Yamaha TG77 Stabs . I really love this synth " its one of my FM favorites , always able to cut right through very busy mixes . This track is made as a kind of homage to Kraftwerk , my childhood heroes . <h> Mist <p> When I was in Tokyo last time , coping with jet lag , one early morning I visited Yoyogi park to calm myself down and just sat- on a bench and listened to crickets .

For the crickets I used Logics EFM1 synth , serving as a dominating rhythmic element , constantly modulating , turning from noise to sound . For the main theme I went for Logics Retro Synth in wavetable mode " sonically it is an almost perfect replica of the legendary PPG Wave . <p> The talking drum percussions are done with Stylus RMX and for pattern manipulation I used the built-in chaos designer . The fantastic thing is that you can map a MIDI controller to practically any parameter and create very realistic drum pattern variations that sound like you have a real percussionist under the hood .

At the time , I stumbled upon this paper from Godfried Toussaint describing how to use Euclidean algorithm to generate music rhythms .

These machines are just brilliant " they can turn any sound into something wonderful . <p> Once I had a nice atmosphere going on , I powered up my Matrix 6 and did a session recording with different solo approaches .

It describes a conversation between man and woman , waking up in bed early in the morning , both confronted with feelings of separation and uncertainty . By trying to adapt this story to music I used two lead sounds , one in steady repetitive motion defining a main melodic pattern and the other that is appearing and disappearing " - at the same time , when playing together , they both create an interplay in harmony . <p> This song was challenging to get right since there are many layers that are playing together . After a couple of pilot mixes , I realised that this interaction must be played in one take with the ability to switch between different chord groups , so I ordered a foot controller with octave keys , to be able to use my feet along with my hands . For the two leads I used DSI Tetra and the Roland System 100 . Tetra is such a powerful synthesiser " I use it extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . It is one of the recent new synths that can stand side by side with big boys like Prophet or Moog . For drums I used the LinnDrum to get classic 80s feel " it just fits right for this song .

And that 's no exaggeration . Look at the synths you use on a daily basis " whether hardware or software , chances are they 've been influenced in some way by Daves designs , from 1970s classics like the Sequential Circuits Pro One and Prophet 5 onwards . <p> Thinking of buying a new hardware synth or drum machine ? Even if you 're not considering one of Daves own products , we guarantee that every manufacturer on the market has one eye on keeping pace with Dave Smith Instruments. - Oh , and did we mention he was one of the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware and software as it enters its fourth decade ? <p> During our conversation , Dave offered characteristically straight-talking opinions on the development of synthesis , the legacy of the MIDI protocol and why synths today offer more bang for the buck than ever before . <p> - <p> Attack : Let 's start with a pretty obvious topic . Alongside MIDI , your name is most commonly associated with analogue synthesis . Youve made the occasional foray into digital synthesis methods , including the digital oscillators in the Evolvers and the Tempest " - and you 've never been afraid to incorporate groundbreaking digital control methods into your products " - but its still analogue which you 're best known for . Its hard to believe that were still having this discussion in 2013 , but I ca n't think of many people who are in a better position than you to offer an informed opinion on the seemingly endless analogue versus digital debate . Where do you stand on that now ? In terms of synthesis , is there any debate left to have , or is it now simply a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching a consensus that digital does some things well , analogue does other things well and they 're not necessarily in competition with each other ? <p> Dave Smith : Musical instruments are ( or should be ) more than the technology used to build them . It should be all about playing music . Some people get way too wrapped up in technology debates , when it should simply be : Do you like the way the instrument sounds , does it have personality , do you bond with it ? In my instruments , I make decisions based on what I think will sound the best and produce an instrument that musicians will want to play . To me , the key is in the analog filters ; in the Prophet 12 we have digital oscillators simply because analog were not precise enough and did not give us all the features we wanted . But , we still have analog low-pass and high-pass filters , and the signal path is analog from that point on . <p> How do you feel about digital emulations of your analogue gear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They sound OK as long as the real thing is not nearby , and they can be convenient if you want to work in the box . But , software does not have the look and feel of a real musical instrument . And they become disposable instruments . This may be why some software companies are now making analog hardware synths . <p> Some people get way too wrapped up in technology debates . <p> Are you ever tempted to produce another digital synth , or even a soft synth ? <p> At the moment I have no plans for either , for reasons mentioned above . <p> Thirty years on from the release of the Juno-6 , people still argue that DCOs are n't  proper analogue . You seem to be committed to DCOs now . Can you explain that decision to people who still lust after the sound of VCOs ? <p> The early DCOs got a bad rap since they were not very well implemented . Some do n't realize that a DCO is completely analog in the signal generation ; a capacitor gets charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape in the oscillator . The only difference is that the timing of the capacitor reset comes from digital circuitry . Best of both worlds ; you never have to deal with tuning problems ( which even now still plague most VCO synths ) , but you have 100% analog signal . <p> Is there ever any temptation to make another VCO-based synth to satisfy vintage purists ? <p> Not really ; I prefer to move forward with interesting ideas for new instruments , rather than follow some set of rules . <p> At this stage is there anywhere new left to go with analogue synthesis or are we going to see small , incremental improvements on a formula which is already pretty much complete ? You seem the kind of person who 's always looking to improve things and move forward . <p> Definitely . The basic **27;28;TOOLONG structure has passed the test of time , from the first modular in the 60s through digital and soft synths that mostly emulate that architecture . We have a lot of ideas to work within that framework while producing new and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think are the greatest achievements of your career so far ? <p> Hmmm Mostly just producing a lot of different instruments in the last 35 years that have been played by a lot of great musicians in a bunch of great recordings and live shows . That 's ultimately the goal as a synth designer . <p> The basic oscillator/filter/ amplifier structure has passed the test of time , from the first modular in the 60s ... We have a lot of ideas to work within that framework . <p> One of your greatest contributions to electronic music is your involvement in the creation of the MIDI protocol . Thirty years on , how do you feel MIDI stands up today ? Are there signs that it might become outdated at some point ? Is it time for us to try to move on to a new protocol , or do you think its got a lot more life left in it ? - What do you think of the improvements offered by protocols like OSC ? <p> It 's still used every day , by everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or over USB .

And by emulations , we really mean painstakingly accurate modelling of the behaviour of those classic units " a huge step up from some of the lacklustre imitations passed off as emulations over the years . <p> Its not so long since most of us were happy if a plugin compressor , synth or drum machine emulation looked like the original hardware and sounded , well , vaguely- similar . <p> There are , of course , still countless plugins which take that approach , but over the last decade a much more authentic type of emulation has emerged .

How many emulations of subtly different versions of the same unit are necessary ? Is emulation now so accurate that it really warrants this kind of approach ? - Then , to compound matters further , software development veterans Cakewalk released another new LA-2A emulation in the form of their CA-2A plugin . And still an old nagging doubt played on our minds : are emulations of 40-year-old analogue units really the best tools for dance music production ? <p> We realised it was time to call in a self-confessed LA-2A fan whose all-round knowledge of production and engineering , compression , analogue hardware and audio software development is second to none : Gregory Scott of Kush Audio . The brief ? Not a traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some serious detail about the various LA-2A models , teach us a few things about compression and discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of modelled compressors in general . <p> are emulations of 40-year-old analogue units really the best tools for dance music production ? <p> Gregory Scott writes : <p> When I was asked by Attack- to write about the latest LA-2A plugin suite from Universal Audio , my eyebrows went up in surprise , because I 'm not a professional reviewer ; what I am is a designer and manufacturer of boutique analogue hardware . But I also create the kinds of spendy plugins that get reviewed , and while my company is one tenth the size of Universal Audio , I 'm nevertheless a direct competitor . <p> A feature written by a competitor of the product being tested ? I was intrigued ! But I love a challenge so I said yes to writing the feature as long as I could be honest about the fact that I 'm a competitor and share the full truth of whatever I discovered as I explored the possible uses and applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , so I bought an Apollo ( short review : love it ) and Universal Audio gave me one-year licences for the LA-2A suite . <p> So I invite you now to join me as I recount my journey of rediscovering an old familiar friend and learning that , while many of my doubts about using this tool for dance music were justified , many were not , and depending on the kind of music you make and sounds and textures you favour , these plugins could be an indispensable and inspiring part of your toolkit . <h> What 's an LA-2A anyway ? <p> The simplest answer to that question is : a compressor a signal processor that reduces the dynamic range of a signal . That 's great , but for those of us whod rather make music that has sounds than process signals that have dynamic range , perhaps the better question is : how does a compressor help me with my art ? Now there 's a question I can sink my teeth into . <p> A compressor , viewed from a more artistic perspective , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movement , energy , intensity , focus , size , density , depth , and tone of a sound . It can also be used to glue multiple sounds into a more coherent whole by unifying their different tones , and coordinating their disparate movements into a more collective , singular motion . <p> The LA-2A falls into the category of hardware compressors known as optos , short for optical . Optos got their name because there is a contraption inside them which literally has a light bulb next to a light-detecting material ; the more you turn up the compression knob , the louder the sound that 's fed to the compressors brain ( aka the detector ) . The louder that sound , the brighter the bulb gets and , in response , the more intense the effect of the compressor becomes , the more it clamps down and reduces the difference between the softest and loudest parts of a sound . This optical mechanism was simultaneously crude and ingenious , and to this day it produces some of the most natural , pleasing , easy-to-use compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present " I can count at least 20 different brands and models off the top of my head " the LA-2A is undeniably one of the most famous , most ubiquitous and ( for some of the vintage units that are older than I am ) most coveted pieces of high-end analogue gear in existence . <p> The LA-2A is undeniably one of the most famous , most ubiquitous and most coveted pieces of analogue gear in existence . <p> Why ? If you 've ever used the hardware , you already know the answer to that . There 's a magic to its sound : a thick , quintessentially warm , slightly hazy cloud of analogue goodness that makes things sound better just by passing through the tubes and transformers ; the compression is just a bonus , and for many sounds its quite a bonus indeed . Not every sound works or is served by the magic of LA-2As , but when it works there 's nothing that does quite the same thing .

@@34419497 @3419497/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Passing Notes <h> Counterpoint <p> Oliver Curry explains the theory of counterpoint , with help from JS Bach , Steve Reich , The Orb , Lorn and childrens nursery rhymes . <p> Counterpoint refers to the relationship between two or more distinct , independent melodies playing simultaneously , complementing each other . It is the independent aspect of the melodies which separates the idea of counterpoint from that of accompaniment or harmony " the melodic parts involved in any contrapuntal relationship are distinct melodies in their own right . <p> Certain forms of counterpoint in classical music have often followed a number of rules relating to aspects of the melodies in question such as which notes could be placed where in the phrase , how many notes one melody plays per each note of the other melody and the specific intervals that should ( or should not ) occur between the separate melodies . <p> However , whilst some of these are often still adhered to in dance music , in this Passing Notes we are n't  going to focus on the rules , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of counterpoint melodies to electronic tracks . <h> Classical and contemporary examples <p> Counterpoint has been employed in western music for well over 1,000 years . The first written examples appear in Musica enchiriadis , a Latin treatise on music published in the late 9th century , although its reasonable to assume that counterpoint had been employed even before then . <p> Counterpoint appears in numerous movements of classical music , but the technique was notably employed in the baroque music of the late 17th and early 18th centuries ; Johann Sebastian Bachs compositions in particular provide countless examples . Let 's consider this performance of Bachs Prelude and Fugue in A minor ( BWV 543 ) , written for church organ around 1708 : <p> Note how the layers of melody overlap and interact within the same key , creating harmonies as the piece progresses . What 's important to understand here is that the separate melodic lines are n't  simply playing identical patterns ; this should be relatively easy to follow by watching the movement of organist John Scott Whiteleys left and right hands. - ( At this stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interplay of these contrasting parts , but if you 'd like to visualise the complexity of counterpoint with multiple voices of polyphony , - Stephen Malinowskis videos- are a good starting point . ) <p> Although the melodies must contrast at any given time in the arrangement for it to be considered counterpoint , one of the most simple and effective ways of creating counterpoint is to duplicate a melodic line of , say , four bars but to separate the two identical melodies by a bar . Bachs compositions regularly use this technique , in which a melodic line is echoed a bar or two later , occasionally in a different octave . The effect is similar to the round technique often employed when singing childrens nursery rhymes . <p> Steve Reichs Electric Counterpoint is an interesting contemporary example . Written for jazz guitarist Pat Metheny and first recorded in 1987 , the minimalist piece is composed for 13 guitars. - The piece can be performed live by an ensemble , or ( as in Methenys case ) as a solo guitarist playing over a pre-recorded multi-track tape of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement how the parts overlap : <p> Reich has influenced many dance music producers ( Electric Counterpoint- itself has been sampled by artists as diverse as The Orb and Nero ) , but what 's interesting here is to consider how the techniques employed in- Electric Counterpoint are commonplace in electronic music regardless of whether Reich is a direct influence : - multi-tracked monophonic parts , repetition , minimalism and- the separation of elements by subtle differences in timbre- are fundamental to so much contemporary electronic music .

So popular , in fact , that Roland brought the TB-303- back to life earlier this year with the release of the AIRA range. - The TB-3 is disqualified from contention for our list- as a result of its virtual analogue sound engine , which means we have to look elsewhere for an alternative . <p> Despite its appearance , the BassBot TT-303 is n't an officially licensed clone of the TB-303 . What we have here is essentially a very well implemented unofficial x0xb0x-style clone of the original , built into a case so close to the TBs that its easily mistaken for the real thing at a quick glance . More importantly , the sound is just as authentic : this is a very- very realistic clone of the classic 303- sound . <p> The TT-303 wont win any prizes for versatility , but then again neither did the TB-303 .

By the early 90s , sampling technology had matured to an impressive level . E-mu followed the Emulator and SP-12/1200 with the Emax and a series of increasingly powerful rack samplers . Ensoniq released the excellent ASR-10 , which offered a plethora of powerful synthesis options . <p> Hardcore , jungle and drum and bass would have turned out very differently without the S series . <p> Over time , the trend shifted away from keyboard-style samplers and toward rack-mount units . In addition to the extensive E-mu range , honourable mentions must go to the Roland S-760 ( an early favourite of Daft Punk ) and Yamaha TX16W ( which spawned its own alternative operating system , Typhoon , now available in emulated form as Cyclone from Sonic Charge ) , but if we had to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for the Akai S series . <p> Look back at photos of dance producers ' studios throughout the 90s and there 's a huge chance you 'll see an Akai sampler nestling in a rack , whether it 's the 12-bit S900 or S950 , the 16-bit S1000 or S2000 , or maybe even an S3000 for those with a little more cash to splash . The S series was particularly popular in the UK , where it helped define entire genres . Hardcore , jungle and drum and bass would have turned out very differently without the S series . <p> Akai persevered with the rack sampler format until the release of the Z8 in 2002 , arguably the most powerful hardware sampler of all time . The Z8 boasted a 20 GB internal hard drive , 24-bit/96 kHz sampling engine , 64-voice polyphony , 512 MB of RAM and a huge selection of built-in effects . If all that sounds like the kind of spec you might expect from a sampler plugin , you 've identified the main problem : the Z8 went on sale just as software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's days were numbered , at least in their traditional form .

All kinds of technical expertise has been utilised to improve the technical performance of- audio recording formats over the last half a century or more , but- more than any other point in that period were now looking back to older hardware to deliver that elusive bit of extra vibe in our music . So- what 's really going on ? What is it that makes these apparently- less accurate recording techniques so appealing ? <p> In this article were working with some of the elements of Sample Magics recent- Vinyl &amp; Tape Drum Hits and Vinyl &amp; Tape Melodic Shots packs in order to take a closer look at- the technical reasons behind- . We 've also managed to procure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparison . <h> Noise <p> Before we dive into specific testing , it 's worth considering one- of the most important ways that analogue recording can alter the sound . Tape in particular is associated with noise in the form of hiss . This varies in terms of its frequency content between tape machines , and dependent on the type- of tape used . Many- people consider hiss to add character , but its generally considered a problem , though better machines tend to have- increased headroom ( see our examination- of levels for an explanation ) , minimising the issue . <p> here 's an analysis of the frequency spectrum of white noise : <p> For comparison , here 's a recording of white noise at 15 ips ( inches per second ) : <p> And at the less noisy 30 ips : <p> Before we even- think about hitting the record button , tape guarantees an element of colouration in the form of hiss .

We caught up with Vito for a quick chat about getting the most out of vintage synths , the death of the record shop and why he considers himself " the worst mixer in the world " . <p> Attack : As a former record store owner , what 's your take on the state of the music industry from that perspective ? Is the intimacy of the record store a thing of the past ? Do you think its going to have an effect on the artists and producers of tomorrow ? <p> Vito de Luca : I loved that moment . I had people in the store every Thursday night listening to new stuff , drinking beer . I think I actually made more money selling beer than records <p> Some places still exist but its not bubbling like it was in the past . Itll obviously- have an impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the way that new music will influence them to create something on their own . Browsing through thousands of mp3s on Beatport can be misleading if you do n't  know what youre- looking for . <p> In what way is it misleading ? <p> Its like going to New York for the first time . Its so big and you end up in the wrong restaurants , wrong hotels , wrong areas and it makes your trip bad . On the other- hand , if you have somebody telling you where to eat , where to stay its a game changer . That 's the main difference between real record stores and digital music stores- in general . Not just Beatport , all of them . <p> So do you still use Beatport to find new music ? <p> Sometimes . I use all the websites really , cause I often know what I 'm looking for and some tracks are exclusive to one site or the other . <p> How do you discover new stuff ? <p> Im sent a lot of promos , so that 's a great thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets can stay fresh there are always tracks that you have n't heard before and that- you do n't  know , and you 'll be looking forward to them , trying to dig for them . But also buying , browsing the internet blogs you just have to remain aware of what 's going on . And- DJ friends , that send you stuff , demos , or recommendations . Its a constant flow of music from wich you have to pick the very best that suits you the most . <p> In terms of your own production , you obviously use a lot of hardware synths . In terms of the signal chain and processing , how do you make sure you get the most out of your synths ? <p> I have an API 1608 desk , so everything goes through that , and that 's already something ! The preamps in it are awesome . I do n't  use it much at the mixing stage , cause I have to admit that mixing analogue is a pain , but on the way in I try to use as much hardware as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outboard permanently set up as inserts in Pro Tools , so I can insert them in the DAW as if they were plugins . <p> Which are your favourite synths and drum machines at the moment ? Would you say they play a major role in defining the sound of your music ? <p> Well , yeah , the instruments you use play a major role in the sound of your music ! I 'm rediscovering the 808 lately , and I also recently bought an ARP 2600 but there seems to be a little bug with the envelope section so I 'll have to get it fixed . <p> I got really into the Dave Smith Prophet 08 .

I relocated it there a year after moving to Amsterdam . I needed a compact room after my last room which was too big . I 've left a lot of my old synths back in Scotland .. still pondering what to do about them ! <p> I 'm using Ableton Live 9 as my main DAW , sometimes using Logic Pro X as a sound source ( aggregated into Live ) . <p> Monitors are KRK Rokit RP8 G2 . They are mid-priced , but are one of the best reference units Ive heard for the money . I regard them as temporary items until the Martions arrive ! <h> Related <h> Roland TR-8 <p> I had been touring with my 909 and 808 for a long long time , so when the TR-8 was announced I was praying they had n't  made another MC-303 , but I need not have worried because after hearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nailed it . Completely . And Roland are continuing on this path with other machines like the MX-1 , Promars plug-out and the JD-XA , so things are getting very interesting in the market in 2015 .

Some I 've outgrown and some I 've abandoned or sold , but every now and then you find one that just has everything . The Virus Ti must be one of the most versatile , editable and enjoyable synths around . Its been my go-to machine for many sounds when I 'm looking for something interesting . So much power in such a small package . My only issue with it is the software that comes with it . Oh , and do n't  try to- lift it up unless you want a back operation afterwards . <h> Related <h> Novation Supernova 2 <p> This is on the list by accident . As a standalone synth its been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sadly in 2012 the internal amplifier died on me and replacing the part was more expensive than buying another keyboard second- hand . But , as luck would have it , I 've ended up with the most expensive MIDI- keyboard ever made thanks to Novations forward thinking back then , as well as the most functional controller Ive seen . It has nice long keys for piano playing , it has 5.3 billion rotary encoders and- a paltry 2.4 million sliders . A very happy accident indeed ! <h> Related <h> Roland System-1 <p> My Roland SH-101 was " and maybe still is " my favourite ever machine , so this was always going to be a tough one . When I got my hands on the System-1 , - the SH-101 plug-out had not been released yet , so I spent quite a bit of time getting used to the internal synth engine . Its absolutely worth the money on its own , but I was curious to see how good the SH-101 emulation- was . Eventually the 101 plug-out was released and it was almost identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the SH-2 plug out that followed it .

There are all these stories about classic bits of gear being dirt cheap back then , which are partly true " obviously you 'd be happy to pick up a 303 for anywhere near -75 now " - but the 909 was a serious investment for a 17-year-old kid . <p> Yeah , it was . Definitely . At the time , that was a lot of money for me " - all the money I 'd saved up . If I remember rightly , half the money for the 909 actually came from my college bursary , so I 'd spent half the year 's travel money on a drum machine . But you know , you prioritise things differently when you 're 17 . <p> I 'm sure 17-year-olds still do the same kind of thing these days , but I guess at that time- you had no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend a bit of cash to do it . Is that fair to say ? <p> half the money for the 909 actually came from my college bursary , so I 'd spent half the year 's travel money on a drum machine . <p> There was no other alternative . How many years would it take me to save that kind of money delivering milk ? It 's just not going to happen . <p> Did you consider yourself to be taking it quite seriously already at that point ? <p> From the point when I got that speaker , I already knew what I was going to do for the rest of my life . <p> Wow . <p> My parents knew even earlier . There was nothing else that interested me as a kid except playing little xylophones or hitting- all the pots and pans in the kitchen with wooden spoons . There was n't even ever a doubt about it . <p> So by the time you got a bit more serious about it you were presumably into house and techno by that point ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of music as well . I was doing stuff that was a little bit harder and I made a bit of money from that to build my studio up a bit more . My uncles quite a successful businessman and I asked him if hed help me come up with a business plan so I could get some finance , get a loan from somewhere to buy equipment . This is about 1993 or something like that , I was like 19 at the time . So I managed to get an appointment with the Princes Trust and they were totally blown away by all the plans that I had . They gave me five grand . <p> You pay the loan- back over five years but the interest is n't even worth talking about . The money was all spent within about 24 hours . I went into Sound Control and spent the whole lot in one day . I 've still got the main workstation I bought that day " it 's an Ensoniq ASR-10 " and I wrote my first album completely with that and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in terms of being able to make the music you had in your head ? <p> Yeah , that was the big one . I did n't know how I was going to do it so I was getting a lot of advice from people . Some people were saying get an MPC , some were saying get a workstation , some saying get an Amiga . To be honest , I hated using a computer for music . Way back then , it just was n't good to make music with computers . It was n't the same kind of thing as it is now . I ended up buying both " the MPC and a workstation . <p> I hated using a computer for music . Way back then , it just was n't good to make music with computers . It was n't the same kind of thing as it is now <p> Which MPC was it ? <p> The 2000XL . I still like using it as a drum programmer actually . The pads are really nice and it programs into Ableton really easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite back then or was it more neutral ? <p> Yeah , it was more neutral then . I think the E-mu 1200 , the MPC and the LinnDrum one were all neutral . When I read- Music Technology- at the time you 'd see people like Juan Atkins on the cover with MPCs . Across the board , it was just- the- way to program your drums and sample things . Obviously the hip-hop guys took that as their main music-making machine , so it kind of became famous for that rather than house and techno . It 's still an amazing thing to program on it . <p> I think over time the strength of its reputation for hip-hop has kind of overshadowed the fact it 's good for house and techno as well . <p> I 'd totally agree with that . I actually got the MPC a little bit after the ASR-10 , so I went from using just the 909 , 101 and 303 at home to the ASR , which was incredible because the sampler and the effects processor sounded really good for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that hurt your fingers when you played , but for me it was just awesome to have all that functionality . I just hid myself away for months at a time , learning the machine and basically trying to create a sound for myself . <p> It 's a point worth making that what we know now as computer music did n't really exist until the late 90s at the earliest . I guess it must- have been somewhere between your first and second album that the big revolution took place with DAWs able to handle audio quite well , soft synths starting to arrive and that kind of thing . When did you first make the move into computers ? - I was one- of the last , I think . I only started using a computer around ten years ago and I still did n't think the sounds of soft synths were good enough . I had Junos and Moogs in my studio by that time and when I compared the sounds I was n't that impressed . The idea of using a mouse to control something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things was taking away from the creative , intuitive side of it . I stayed away from it as long as I could but it was Ableton that was the catalyst for me moving over . I became a bit stuck with the ASR-10 and I just could n't do things that I wanted to . <p> When Ableton came out it really blew me away because it was nothing like Cubase " all my friends were using Cubase at the time and it just bored me , I hated that really linear way of working . Ableton created a new space to work in . I did n't actually get it until version 4 , so even that shows you how long it took me to get into it . But I still love using hardware too . The machines that you 've got are n't suddenly rubbish because you 've got something new . Some people get a new thing and use it to death but I like to try and use everything as much as I can .

This alone could maybe cost you G1,500 or so , often more . You had to have these things at home " or have access to them at least " because you had to practise your mixing so you would n't get laughed out of the club , if someone ever let you play . You also had to invest time and money into travelling to wherever you local record shop was and buying records ( G10 per record ! ) " no free downloads in the pre-internet age , so that could be a huge expense as well . You also had to invest time into learning how to mix two records together " no sync , no laptop , just endless trial and error and eventually , after a lot of practice , hopefully getting the hang of it . <p> What this pretty damn large expense of time and money would do was weed out a lot of the people who were n't truly committed or did n't have a real passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to seem cool would soon bow out when they realised the time they 'd have to invest or understand that instead of buying a new car , they 'd be taking the bus because they spent all their money on their decks and weekly record bill . <p> DJs should play what the fuck they love , or give the fuck up ! <p> I think what we have now is a lot of people approaching DJing , but maybe not so many with the same amount of passion and drive . Or rather , the ones with passion and drive are harder to hear above the noise of the pretenders , and I think this is a shame because there are definitely new , younger DJs out there that have taste and style and passion , and it 's very hard for them to be heard , precisely because there is so much noise made by the thousands that just buy a laptop , torrent some tracks , pop on some Beats By Dre headphones and want to be a DJ for a couple of summers <p> Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other DJs .

@@34419515 @3419515/ <h> Choosing A Reverb Plugin <p> As one of the key tools in any mix , reverb is fundamental to the sound of your tracks . Bruce Aisher walks us through the options available for adding ambience to- productions . <p> As one of the oldest , most basic effects used in music production , reverb plays a vital role in shaping the sound of a mix , helping to- glue different elements together , providing a sense of space and contributing to a feeling of three-dimensional sound . With so many options on offer , the sound of a reverb effect can be anything from the most subtle room ambience to a huge , cavernous echo . As a result , selecting the right tool for the job is essential. - Before we start choosing types of reverb to apply to particular sounds , we need to understand the various options on offer and how they differ from each other. - Reverb effects can usually be broken down into two main categories : those which recreate the sound of real ambient spaces and those which recreate the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at how these two strands developed . <h> Early reverb effects <p> The first form of reverb used in recording was achieved simply by playing a sound through a loudspeaker in an echo chamber a reverberant acoustic space and recording the resulting sound back into the mix . One of the more successful early attempts at creating artificial reverb came in the form of the plate reverb a large , loosely suspended sheet of metal with a loudspeaker bolted onto the centre . The speaker would be fed an audio signal and cause the plate to vibrate , whereupon pickups around its edge would send a reverb-like signal back to the mixing desk . <p> Check out this clip of the UA EMT 140 plate reverb plugin in action . Note the density of sound and how it builds up and decays : <p> A cheaper , more portable , version of similar technology became popular in guitar amps in the form of spring reverbs . These simply used a metal spring rather than a plate . The sound is generally distinctly lo-fi , great for adding character but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The modern age <p> The problem with real plates , springs and echo chambers was that their sound could only tweaked in quite subtle ways ; it was very difficult to completely change their sonic characteristics . This all changed with the advent of commercially viable digital reverb in the late 70s . <p> Lexicon , one of the companies at the forefront of this revolution , used digital signal processing technology to create emulations of different reverberant spaces . Various parameters could be tweaked , as well as the basic algorithm on which each space was built : room , hall , etc . <p> The UA Lexicon 224 plugin simulates the look and feel of one of the companys early classics : <p> As technology developed , sophisticated algorithmic reverb hardware eventually enabled the user to tweak a huge range of parameters in order to tailor the sound to their specific requirements . Unsurprisingly , from the earliest days of the DAW , manufacturers sought ways to distil existing hardware reverb technology into the new computer-based format . This in time led to the reverb plugins we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a variety of different flavours of reverb which aim to cover every type of sound the producer might want : <p> Its interesting to note that reverb designers still tend to include plate algorithms in their all-digital designs , as the familiar density and decay of plate effects has became a sought-after sound in its own right . A plate echo algorithm is still a great choice for a classic reverb sound .

Daft Punks Da Funk is a masterpiece in melodic and structural simplicity , with a few clever tricks to boot . <h> The track <h> The arrangement <p> Click to enlarge . <h> What 's happening ? <p> 1 . Eight seconds of crowd ambience leads into the first iteration of both the distorted lead hook and sampled stabs " alongside a complete mix of the layered drum parts . Its an unusual kind of exposition : within the first 10 seconds of the song , almost all major track elements are playing . The caveat is that these parts are all re-sampled " with both the extreme high and low ends of the frequency spectrum filtered- away . <p> within the first 10 seconds of the song , almost all major track elements are playing <p> 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which enters doubly hard after the low-cut resample of the previous section . The beat comprises a noisy sampled loop , replete with original reverb ( taken from Vaughan Mason and Crews Bounce , Rock , Skate , Roll ) layered with a deep , club-friendly kick and a layered 909/white noise clap . As in many Daft Punk productions , the stereo field is kept deliberately narrow . The main exception is the clap , which apparently randomly scatters around the speakers . <p> 3 . At bar 20 , all beat elements are silenced as a sampled drum break ( from Barry Whites I 'm Gon na Love You Just A Little More Baby ) takes centre stage . This is the first and only time it will play . <p> 4 . The beat returns , this time underpinned by the plucked synth bass " an absurdly simple on-the-beat G that in different producers hands might have sound offensively dull . As it is , its role is to anchor the energy only , underpinning the groove and allowing other parts to take the melodic and rhythmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums over the sampled beat : this time a carefully sculpted 808 hi-hat . <p> 5 . In comes the lead riff , weaving effortlessly into the wide area of mix estate available in the middle frequencies . What powers the riff ? Roland SH-101 , Juno-106 , Yamaha CS-15 , MiniKorg 700s ? Who knows- <p> 6 . Da Funk is mostly governed by 8-bar turnarounds , but there are exceptions . here 's the first : a four-bar section in which the bass and layered kick drops out and the sampled stab is reintroduced . Breaking up the length of the loops- like this maintains interest , toying with the expectations of the listener and dancefloor . Note that the bass ends a bar before- the turnaround " its a simple trick to signal the coming change and help ease the transition . <p> 7 . The bass returns . An easily missable detail is the brief muting of the layered clap in bar 44 . <p> 8 . The lead hook ends as the track strips back to basics . The rhythm section now comprises kick and clap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear subsequently during short breaks . <p> 9 . The 808 hi-hat re-enters . Listen carefully and you 'll hear the same random panning on this part as the 909 clap , only subtler " a nice way of bringing unity to disparate parts . <p> 10 . Only Daft Punk could enlist a closed 909 hi-hat to perform solo duties . And here it is : the hi-hat taking brazen centre stage , sculpting a new groove against the driving bass and stabs . At bar 65 an occasional 808 hat , panned right and mixed low , adds a simple response to the 909s call . <p> 11 . The 909 hi-hat continues to carry the groove alongside the stabs as one of the most iconic TB-303 sequences in dance music enters the mix . Its an ever-changing acid line , with the cutoff frequency and resonance always- on the move . It starts out with cutoff dialled low . <p> The 909 hi-hat continues to carry the groove alongside the stabs as one of the most iconic TB-303 sequences in dance music enters the mix <p> 12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mix , you get a chance to listen to how its made : one layer is a 909 clap and the other is what sounds like a white noise hit or a randomly-panned slapback reverb return fed by the clap . <p> 13 . The sampled beat makes a brief reappearance , along with the same subtle 808 hi-hat groove debuted in bar 65 . <p> 14 . As the bass returns , the 909 hi-hat leaves the mix- and the rhythm returns to its stock groove : kick , clap and 808 hat . The lead 303s cutoff frequency is still on the move , ensuring- the listeners attention never wanders . <p> 15 . The opening hook returns so that all three music parts are in the mix . The complete mix is extended for a full 16 bar- section . <p> 16 . An as-yet-unheard element fades in for eight bars : a 16th-note stabby synth sound that plays in the upper registers , is heavily effected and , like the bassline , sticks to just one note . Weve called it insistence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the insistence pads out the mix , spilling into the gaps between the other elements . Its effect is to up the energy of the track a notch further . <p> 18 . The lead hook is cut , leaving the 303 to jostle with the stabs and the insistence , scattering its delays around a strictly defined panning range . <p> 19 . The kick and bass are muted as in bar 109 " a final arrangement flourish as the track heads- for- the finish line . Heavy bus compression allows the insistence to take up the slack . <p> 20 . The lead hook fades in for one last triumphant taste of the limelight before the whole mix is faded out . 
@@34419518 @3419518/ <h> An Introduction To FM Synthesis <p> Often dismissed as overly complex , FM synthesis is n't necessarily as difficult to get to grips with as its reputation might suggest . Join us as we take a look at the general principles of this uniquely powerful- synthesis method . <p> FM ( Frequency Modulation ) synthesis has a reputation for being complicated and long-winded , but this is n't really true in the case of modern software options . While the theory is indeed complex , contemporary FM soft synths are actually very easy to use . What 's more , thanks to their ability to create complex harmonics , FM synths are capable of producing sounds not possible with virtual analogue instruments . <p> When the- Yamaha DX7- arrived in the mid 80s , producers were beguiled by its crystal clear digital tones , and its- electric piano , - bass- and- bell- presets have become pop and dance staples . More recently , Native Instruments ' FM8- " loosely based on the Yamaha DX " has become the instrument of choice for conjuring up cutting-edge bass growls by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard providing the bass tones for dozens of- deep house- tracks . <p> Virtual analogue synths start with oscillators generating harmonically rich waveforms such as square or sawtooth waves , and sculpt away frequencies with filters . FM synths work in reverse : their oscillators ( usually known as operators ) are usually sinusoidal to begin with , and their pitch can be modulated incredibly precisely by other operators . Unlike an LFO , an operator 's pitch is in the audio range , which means rather than a wobbly vibrato effect , this pitch modulation results in the addition of extra harmonics . <h> NI FM8 <p> It 's easy to understand FM 's core principle when you can see and hear it in action for yourself . To demonstrate this we 're going to use Native Instruments ' FM8 if you do n't own this instrument you can download a demo version- here . Load the synth up in your DAW , and click the Expert button on the left to bring up the modulation matrix . <p> Currently one operator , F , is active . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emits a straightforward sine tone . <p> We 're still only hearing the output of operator F , but its being modulated by operator E , which is changing its timbre . The Ratio parameters on the left-hand side of the interface control the pitch of each operator . Drag down on operator E 's Ratio , and you 'll hear the harmonic content of operator F 's output change , and as you near 0.000 you 'll hear the effect of the modulation slow until it becomes vibrato . Increase the ratio above 1.0000 and you 'll hear more and more high frequency harmonics introduced into the signal . You can see this reflected in the harmonic content display at the top right-hand corner of the interface . <p> So , the pitch of operator E controls the harmonic content of operator F. In FM jargon , we 'd describe operator F as the carrier , and operator E as the modulator . All we 've managed to create with our carrier and modulator thus far are some fairly unpleasant screeching noises . The key to making usable sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume level of the modulator over time , the timbre of the carrier will change along with it . This creates something akin to the filter movement in a virtual analogue patch . <p> Left-click operator E in the modulation matrix to bring up all its parameters . Set the operator 's Ratio back to 1.0000 , then turn your attention to the envelope at the bottom of the panel . Drag the white square at the top right and corner of the envelope down to the bottom , creating a curve . <p> This gives us something much more musical and natural-sounding : a synth tone with a characteristic burst of harmonics at the start , giving it a percussive feel . <p> Play the sound back , and turn the Ratio up you 'll hear how the character of the sound changes as you do so . Set the Ratio to- 2.0000 . When played on a lower octave , this gives a raw version of that punchy , smooth FM bass that appears in so many deep house tracks .

The hat on the straight 8ths can be mixed fairly low . <h> Step 4 <p> The loop is completed with a heavily reverbed bass hit that adds accent and low end to the first beat of each bar and glues everything together , filling out further space between the samples .

It 's exactly the same kind of machinery as we were using back then , really . Basically going back 25 years . <p> What equipment are you using ? <p> Graham : It 's a lot of the old Roland gear like we used back then the 808 , the 909 , the 303 and the 101 that we made records with . But , approaching it again now , I 'm questioning whether to use a computer or not . <p> Gerald : I 'm totally using analogue . 303 , 101 , 202 , 727 , 909 Analogue 's kind of what the kids enjoy these days anyway . Everyone 's got a computer , so they want to see someone using the old stuff . For me it 's actually easier to use the old gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 've been practising a bit with it just to make sure I 'm not being overconfident . <p> Graham : Red Bull Music Academy have loaned us a studio for three days this week so we 'll bash it out and decide what to do . It 's very last minute so it could go in different directions . <p> That 's exciting in itself . <p> Graham : Yeah . I mean , we 're trying to avoid doing really cliched stuff with it , but you find when you 've got all this equipment wired together that certain tempos suit the frequencies , if you know what I mean . It 's not about having it really hard and fast . It 's about multi-layering and making almost a tapestry of things . It does dictate it 's own terms to some extent , but we like to mess with that as well . A lot of the time we 're surprising each other . It 's like , Where 's he going ? ' and you have to respond to things . <p> Just seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sense it 's sometimes a bit scary , because the audience comes with expectations , but it 's true to the way that we first used to do acid house . You did n't have a set list , it was very organic . It was about a process rather than a tune . <p> Gerald : The first time we did it we got a few little new grooves together beforehand , but this time I 'm thinking I might try and revisit some of the old stuff from the Newbuild album , so I 've been programming some of that on the 303 , recreating a few bits and pieces . <p> That can be easier said than done with the 303 . How good are you with programming it ? <p> Gerald : I 've been doing it 25 years so I know how to program a tune into it . I used to write all my music with the SH-101 , the 808 and the 303 , so it 's not so hard to do . All you have to do is read the manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haha . Fair point . So how come it 's all Roland gear ? <p> Gerald : When I started out I was just using all Roland stuff because there was n't anything else available . People were throwing it all away so it was really cheap . At one point all I had in my studio was Roland gear . <p> Were you trying to copy the sounds you were hearing from Chicago and Detroit ? <p> Gerald : No , it was just that they were easy to get hold of . I did n't realise that it was the same gear they were using in Chicago until I heard a 303 on a record in about late ' 86 , early ' 87 , and I was like , Oh , shit . I 've got one of them ! ' <p> Graham : It was n't just about trying to emulate American music . I found the hip hop thing at the time to be very much about that . It was n't particularly bringing anything British to the table . <p> Yeah , it probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own identity . That 's an interesting point because the Manchester acid , techno , warehouse scene " whatever you want to call it " soon developed a distinct sound of its own . <p> Graham : It had a sort of UK slant to it . You can still hear that there 's a thread of UK subculture music that 's very much influenced by reggae and dub . When we were growing up in Manchester that 's what you 'd always hear at parties . There was a different cultural mix in Manchester to , say , the Balearic thing that was coming out of London at the time . It reflected that sound system culture .

That disconnect was probably the motivation for a lot of British producers , but you were personally involved with Detroit . How did that first come about ? <p> I was a record collector and I used to buy for Reckless Records , so when I was in America I just went there and met up with them . I felt a part of them . Me and Carl would be sending each other new music and releasing each other 's music . I had a lot of Derrick May 's old studio equipment , so I felt part of it . <p> There was famously a lot of sharing of equipment going on in the early days , although presumably it 's a little bit later when you went over there ? <p> Yeah , it was 1990 . What happened in my case is I went to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Life ' and Big Fun ' - were huge hits . I was wearing a Transmat t-shirt and this guy came up to me and said , Where did you get that t-shirt ? ' I recognised him as Derrick May and we just got chatting . I said I was going to be over in Chicago buying records for the shop and he said I should come to Detroit if I had time . <p> So I went there and met a British guy working for Transmat " - Matt Cogger , who used to do music under the name Neuropolitique " - and as part of payment Derrick used to give him equipment . When it was time for Matt to come back to England he brought it all with him , so we used to share a Kawai K3 , Derrick 's DX100- and- I think we had one of Derrick 's reel-to-reels at one point . That 's how we started making music . <p> There are a lot of myths and legends about the gear those guys were using at the time and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . Was it Kevin Saunderson or Juan Atkins who apparently had the modified DX100 with an analogue filter from an Oberheim synth ? Did you see anything like that ? <p> Derrick 's was definitely just standard , but one thing I do know is that his 808 sounded different to any other 808 I 've ever heard " - he said hed opened it up and adjusted a few trimpots . I used it on Meridian ' and you can hear it on that " - the snare sounds really snappy , unlike any other 808 . <p> I got to see Metroplex Studio in 1990 and pretty much all Juan 's music was based on the Pro-One . Those classic arpeggiated synth lines on all the Model 500 stuff are all Pro-One . That 's quite an important , often overlooked keyboard in the history of techno , actually . <p> Did you pick up tips on making music as well as gear ? <p> No , they would never do that . <p> Really ? <p> Oh yeah . It 's funny " - Derrick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl Craig but he never ever showed you how to do anything . It was all very cryptic sort of advice . Make sure your tracks have a beginning , a middle and an end. Things like that . He would never ever sit down and say , This is how you program something . ' I think he did teach Matt Cogger how to tape edit , splicing and that sort of stuff , because Matt showed me , but he 'd never give you any help . It had to be hard-won with him , and that 's the way it should be . <p> Derrick gave very cryptic advice . ' Make sure your tracks have a beginning , a middle and an end . ' Things like that . <p> When did you actually start making music ? Were you doing anything before you went to Detroit ? <p> One of Kirks modular synth systems : the basis of a single synth voice <p> No , it was 1990 . I came back from Detroit , sold my record collection , got a few grand together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a master keyboard , a DAT machine , a Roland R-5 , which was their latest drum machine at the time , and an Atari 1040 with Opcode Vision . So I had pretty good gear to start with and I locked myself away for six months to read manuals and teach myself . <p> Was it something you 'd wanted to do before then ? <p> No , not at all . It was just looking at Derrick 's setup in Transmat and the Metroplex studio and thinking , How much did this gear cost ? Four or five grand ? That 's doable if I sell all my records ' <p> So you had absolutely no musical leanings before then ? <p> No . I had that conversation with Matt Cogger . I asked him if he could read music or anything and he said , No , this is all about programming .

@@34419530 @3419530/ <h> Tutorials <h> Cold Pads <p> Pads come in all shapes and sizes . Here we explore the chillier end of the sonic spectrum " perfect for those long cold winter nights . <p> When we think of synth pads we often think of- warm , analogue-style sounds , but there 's an alternative approach which is just as interesting. - Colder , darker pads are most typically associated with techno , but they have their place in any genre , from drum and bass and dubstep through to house . A number of different synthesis methods can work well for this kind of sound . FM synths and additive synths are sometimes used , but well stick with subtractive synthesis techniques for their ease of use. - In this case were going to create a complex , heavily modulated pad sound using- Analog , one of the stock synths in Ableton Live 9 Suite ( and available as an upgrade for Live Intro and Standard ) : <h> Sine of the Times <p> Subtractive synthesis by definition usually begins with a harmonically rich waveform , such as a square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a filter in order to subtract certain frequencies and harmonics . Here , however , were going to start with a sine wave , which lacks any additional harmonics . We begin by selecting the sine from the Shape menu for Osc1 : <p> Analog allows you to route each oscillator to one of the two filters . In this case Osc 1 is routed to Filter 1 and Osc 2 ( which well come to later ) is routed to Filter 2 : <p> As there are no harmonics to filter in a pure sine wave , Filter 1 is disabled ( trying to filter a sine wave only changes its volume ) . The amp envelope is set for a slow attack and moderate release . These can be adjusted as necessary later to suit the tempo of the track and the arrangement . <p> Adding subtle vibrato can help to make the sound less sterile and more interesting . Here , the Delay and Attack parameters are set to build the pitch modulation slowly , making the vibrato less predictable and modulating the sound over the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce more harmonics using Unison mode , which doubles the oscillator with another detuned version . We 've also added some automated panning , controlled by one of the LFOs , although this can be left out at this stage and reserved for later if you want to take more control over the stereo spread of the sound at the mixing stage . <p> A delay with feedback is a better alternative to reverb when adding ambience , as it allows us to create a cleaner sound and gives us the option of setting up tempo-synced delay times with ease . Here Lives Filter Delay device creates three different delays " each with subtly different filter settings " panned to the left , centre and right respectively . Removing low-end frequencies in the filter sections helps to keep the sound uncluttered when playing chords across the full frequency range . 
@@34419531 @3419531/ <h> How Compression Works In A Mix <p> Bruce Aisher takes a look at some of the different ways in which compressors can be used across the elements of a mix . <p> Compression is an essential but often misunderstood production tool . Many producers have difficulty getting to grips with the range of different ways compressors can be used : to tame errant dynamics , add punch , glue elements together , provide a sense of rhythmic movement , or just alter the tonality of parts of a mix . <p> Over the coming months were going to be digging deeper into the more complex details of advanced compression , but in this article well lay the foundations with an overview of the different ways compressors can be used in a mix. - Well take the same approach we did with- EQ- and- reverb- in previous articles : starting with a bad mix and showing how compression can be applied to certain elements in order to improve the overall sound . <p> In simple terms , a- compressor is a tool which reduces the dynamic range of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal can then be amplified back to the point where it has the same perceived volume , but the difference in volume between the quiet parts and the loud parts is smaller . <p> In this article we 'll lay the foundations with an overview of the different ways compressors can be used . <p> In practice its quite a bit more complicated than that . The overall effect of compression can vary hugely depending on how the compressors used . At the most basic level , a compressor on an individual sound " say , a kick drum " can shape its amplitude envelope . On a recording of an instrument like a guitar it can level out the dynamics , pulling louder notes back so that they sit more evenly in the mix. - On a sub-group or across the entire mix it can tame dynamics , glue sounds together or create a pumping effect. - To make matters more complex , compressors also all have different characters ; in many cases they 're not used for dynamic control or transient shaping so much as to colour the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a range of different applications to show how some of these processes work . Well return to these applications in forthcoming practical tutorials on how to set compressors to achieve specific results . <h> Taming The Beast <p> Let 's start with a basic track that lacks any dynamic processing. - Heres the track we 're going to tweak : <p> First off , let 's consider one of the most basic uses of compression : levelling out differences between the volumes of notes on a single instrument or part . While electronic sounds such as synths and drum machines are usually relatively easy to manage in terms of level , there can still be a degree of processing required to make them fit- comfortably into a mix. - For an example let 's take this chopped-up synth part : <p> The level of this recording varies somewhat across each bar . Compression can help level out these differences , much like an automatic volume control . ( Click the images where necessary to enlarge them and see the specific settings we 've used in each case " well come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forthcoming tutorials . ) <p> here 's how it sounds when we use an 1176-style compressor plugin to tame the dynamics : <p> We 're using a fast attack time in this example so that we capture the initial transient of each hit. - Though the effect is quite subtle , the synth part is now less likely to get lost in the mix . Its also now easier to decide on the appropriate mix level for the part . <p> Note : the make-up gain control is used to restore the perceived loudness or peak level of the signal to a similar level prior to compression being applied . A/Bing the uncompressed and compressed signal should allow you to hear the change in both dynamics and loudness of the process in action . <p> Its also not uncommon to use two compressors with different thresholds and compression ratios in series to rein in problematic sources in stages , or to emphasise different qualities in the signal . Well take this approach with the second synth part . Here it is before compression : <p> We then apply two compressors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio , a faster attack time and a faster release to suppress the louder peaks . The second is a more moderate setting and a lower threshold to smooth out the peaks which remain after the first compressor has done its work :

UK producers including Paul Woolford , Neville Watson and Tessela were among the people getting excited about the build and retweeting work-in-progress photos of beautiful custom mixing consoles- being installed and rare synths being serviced . <p> Fast forward a few months and " - with the paint still wet on the walls and the smell of solder in the air " - Devon Analogue is now open for business . <p> The studio is the brainchild of Tristan and Elley Grace , a couple with decades of combined experience in dance music , having previously run a record shop on the south coast while actively DJing and producing . <p> We asked Tristan to tell us more about what led the pair to build the studio , the challenges they had to overcome and the most rewarding parts of the process <p> Tristan writes <p> If I had to sum up what Devon Analogue 's all about imagine a holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best analogue and digital equipment , located in a gorgeous part of the country with a relaxed vibe . <p> From day one , when the original idea of the project came about , we were firmly set on creating a location which would allow artists to immerse themselves in music , away from the pulls of their normal lifestyle . The studio sits within the rolling green hills of North Devon , overlooking Exmoor . There 's no better place . You can get on a train in London or Manchester and be here on the doorstep within three hours . It has a magical feel " rural and full of vibes . From the moment you arrive you can live and breathe the project you intend to work on . Plus Devon hustles harder <p> I 've been involved in music since I was about 11 years old , when I used to prop up local record store counters and hoard tape packs , gradually falling into buying records , then DJing . I became heavily influenced by record store and house/techno culture , which developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record shop for four years in Devon . That led to production . I 've been making music for about 15 years and rattling around studios tinkering with analogue equipment and synthesisers ever since . <p> We 've lived here since 2008 and we always had intentions for the spot . The only possible way to fund it was to self-build . The studio site was originally buried under about 500 tons of earth and the building work took around 12 months in total , then another six months for the audio side of the build . It took an incredible amount of effort . We had the idea for the studio for some time " it was just about making it happen without rushing . We designed all aspects of the build ourselves , so we- hope that a personal touch comes through in the working and living space . <p> We did hit quite big delays in the project due to the unexpected loss of Elley 's father Martin , who had been such a driving force in backing us , in terms of involvement within music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had wannabe roadie stories by the dozen , so he could n't wait to get in and have a bash on a drum machine , which sadly did n't happen . This hit us pretty hard and put a stop to the project for a few months , but we came back stronger and more determined . This project is a big nod to him . <p> Residential studios used to be a lot more common- than they are now . The format is something that clicks with me personally and I think it does with others " its all about the pause in the rush of life , to stop , affirm the project direction and crack on . I was hugely inspired by the legendary Ridge Farm Studio . Sadly I never went there as it was before my time , but it had such a- reputation as a- haven to get tracks done . They kept such an organic vibe about the place , while keeping up with groundbreaking technology. - If you have n't ever checked the archives of Ridge Farm theyre- well worth it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Pierre-Olivier Margerand , went on to make classic equipment such as the Boiler , a wild take on the- SSL bus- compressor . We have the Boiler mkII installed and its bonkers ! <p> Any studio is only as good as its workflow , technical install and general environment . These three factors have been crucial for us . We have a hybrid-style setup which combines the best of analogue technology and digital conversion . The setup 's all designed to be as straightforward as possible , allowing artists to work at their chosen pace without technical niggles . <p> One aspect which- recording environments- sometimes neglect- is the workflow of the setup . This is something which took us a long time to crack . We operate a hybrid system to allow the integration of all instruments , synths and drum machines with DAWs of the clients choice . If you plug in your own laptop you get all the benefits of the house system in your own DAW. - We run a MADI-chained conversion system using two Antelope Orions , giving 64 channels in and out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first- to physical patchbays and then on within software I/Os . It promotes a jam-style writing flow , which is great . <p> When deciding on the furniture we needed for the studio , we absolutely did n't want to import a soulless MDF console . The furniture was designed and made by our friend Ollie Richards . Ollie is based locally- and- has an absolutely amazing sense of design and craftsmanship , all the way through to creation . Believe it or not , he had never made studio consoles or racks before ! But I- believe- the room and its vibe has been formed- around his pieces. - Its nice how many people comment on the furniture " we love it . We have another piece due to be started for our Waldorf Wave to sit on . <p> Speaking of which , the Wave is an absolute heart melter in so many ways . We call it the Exmoor Beast . It 's Waldorf 's finest synth , the best example of wavetable synthesis so outrageous I think it bust them ! It was a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got very lucky finding one for the right price as they 've become very rare . When we found it it needed a fair bit of work : dead convertor chips , missing voices and rotaries which had seen better days . We could tell you some stories about the restoration , completed by James Walker of Synth Repair Services . We 've had so many highs and lows over it " - near tears at one point . James has since become a Waldorf Wave restoration expert ! We also have Till Kopper and Werner Schonenbeger from- waldorf-wave.de- to thank " they 're the Wave gurus , and they 've been critical in helping us fault find ! <p> The Chiswick Reach stereo valve compressor is another legendary unit , often used in a lot of mastering houses. - Nigel , the owner of Chiswick Reach , got in touch when he started producing the 25th anniversary units and we had to have one . Its quite a rare classic piece of outboard updated . Its sound is solid , with a glueing- THUMP ! Sit it on your master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main system monitors are Genelec 8050Bs , which sound amazing in the space . The main room design was a painstaking process " within a residential loft-styled facility like ours , you 're balancing the studio and living space to synergise. - During the Genelec calibration we were happy to find- that- our plans worked out , with the frequency response- levels really positive . We knew it sounded right , but there is nothing better than giving us nerds a graph to prove it ! Due to the size and nature of the space , the lower octave was something we wanted to enhance " not that it was significantly missing , but we wanted to be able to add the extra vibe aspect as well as improvements for low-end monitoring . Considering we are in a remote location , isolation is n't an essential . Its nice to gain the fullest signal to create a groove . <p> We installed the Genelec 7370 SAM sub alongside the system and it sounds fantastic . There 's so much added clarity on the top end when you allow the sub to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few extra dB on the tops for good measure when you need to push it ! <p> Once the calibration work was done by Andy Bensley from Source/Genelec , we referenced several tracks , not only to test the bottom-end response but also to hear the full system and imaging improvements . Test tracks included Dillinja 's Deadly ' for deep subs , B12 's Bio-dimension ' for blissed-out techno with all the necessary elements to reference on the system , and Baba Stitlz 's Missing ' .

I 'm actually coming back around to working more with live instrumentalists and slightly larger ensembles , I 've got a few ideas for things in the future around that .

The album in itself was kind of about exploring those territories , to a degree probably finding out what works best . Its been really interesting reading the reviews and how people have interpreted the different songs , some people are bigger fans of the tracks that my voice has n't  been so clear in and other people prefer the more profoundly song-based structure .

First released on Dirtybird back in April , the track has now been licensed by Atlantic and sees a full release on July 14th . <p> Jack came about after Dirtybird boss Claude VonStroke signed Bens track Let 's Get Hot and , over dinner , requested something " with a sleazier vibe " as a B-side . Just over a week later , after coming up with the rough idea for Jack , Ben sent a two-minute unmixed demo to VonStroke to check that he liked it . " He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warehouse Project in Manchester , " Ben recalls via Skype from his home in Amsterdam . " He s normally really funny about demos and sits on stuff for ages , so I was really surprised he did it . The next day he sent me the edit hed done and I went straight back in to finish it . " <h> Simplicity <p> Ben explains his shock at the tracks success : " I never thought it was going to do as well as it has . It was just thrown together . I 've written loads of poppier stuff- " - I wrote Redlights Get Out My Head " but this was just meant to be an underground track . I was n't even thinking about anything commercial or anyone singing along to it , I just thought it sounded sleazy and sexy and that 's what me and Claude had talked about . I suppose that 's probably what people like about it . It has n't  got that intent " - it has n't  got a sing-along chorus . If you hear something that 's made to be commercial you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be hard to argue that Jack is a complex musical composition , but its precisely the fact that each simple element is so precisely honed which makes it all work so well .

" <p> I never thought it was going to do as well as it has . It was just thrown together . <h> Vocals <p> The commercial appeal of the track undoubtedly stems in large part from the vocal hook . Its a fiendishly simple retro-inspired lyric " - " I want your body , everybody wants your body , so let 's Jack " " - which lodges in the listeners brain the first time they hear it . Ben explains that it came to him in the night : " I had this mad dream one night and in the morning I woke up with that in my head and wrote it into my phone . " <p> So who 's the vocalist on the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was really tempted to say it was some old female Chicago singer " I probably should have done . Later that same day I went to the studio and recorded it in a bit of an American accent , then processed the fuck out of it . Ive been doing a lot of processing on vocals recently , weird stuff that 's never really made it out on records . I learned a lot of stuff off Redlight " he s really good at it . " <p> The vocal chain was resolutely high-end , consisting of Bens own Neumann U47 FET into a Neve 1073 , then a Steven Slate Audio Dragon and both channels of a custom-built dual-channel LA-2A clone for good measure . " Once it was recorded I put it back through the 1073 , a Fatso and then the LA-2A again , " Ben continues . " I think its all about resampling and processing again and again . That 's the way you 're going to get a sound that 's hard to find , I think . Just messing with stuff and seeing what works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bit of an American accent , then processed the fuck out of it . <p> Once the vocal was recorded , even more processing took place in the box to get the unique sound . First the signal was run through a pitch shifter ( Ben tells us which one but wont let us reveal his secret ) , then Renaissance EQ , - CLA Vocals , an- L2 , then two- Renaissance DeEssers- ( " it took loads of de-essing " ) . Despite all this effort , Ben seems a little surprised that the vocal has received so much attention . " It was never meant to be the key part , " he explains . Instead , its the simple but devastatingly effective jacking drum pattern and the bassline which drive the tracks momentum .

For an old-school vibe , try experimenting with dark chamber patches or even spring reverb emulations . Aim for a decay time which allows the tail to ease into the next kick . <p> A more advanced programming technique is to slightly tweak the sample settings for the alternate clap hits ( the one that falls with the sixth on-the-floor kick ) altering the samples decay envelope or pitch to generate movement and create a slightly different feel . You might also considering layering an additional subtle snare with alternate claps , again to reinforce the difference . <h> Step 3 <p> Now its time to add a distinctive noise stab a distorted organic percussion sound which helps add to the dark industrial feel of the beat .

If the sound has an obvious pitch then bear in mind you 'll need to- consider how other melodic elements will work alongside it . <h> Step 4 <p> Finally , a heavily compressed 909 open hi-hat is added to the off-beat , with a subtle variation at the end of every couple of bars .

@@34419550 @3419550/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Gear/Software <h> Korg Volca Beats , Bass &amp; Keys <p> Korg 's new Volca boxes offer analogue drums and 303-style synth grooves at an incredible price . Do they live up to the hype ? Greg Scarth puts them to the test . <p> Strange things have been brewing in Korg 's research labs in recent years . At 2010 's Musikmesse conference , the company announced the Monotron , its first analogue product for decades . Since then we 've had the Monotribe , the Monotron Duo and Delay , and finally the MS-20 Mini , a scaled down version of the 70s classic . <p> Unlike certain Japanese rivals , Korg seem to realise that musicians and producers still covet analogue gear . Since the release of the Monotron it 's been obvious that Korg were working toward something bigger : the Monotribe added drums , introduced oscillator auto-tuning for pitch stability , and even included secret , DIY-friendly MIDI support . The MS-20 Mini then proved that it is possible for the Japanese giants to build authentic reissues of older gear . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogue gear . <p> Where are Korg ultimately heading with all of this ? We 're not quite sure . An all-new analogue monosynth ? A budget analogue polysynth ? Either way , the next step is to refine the lessons of the Monotrons , Monotribe and MS-20 into a new range of compact , step sequencer-based grooveboxes : the Volca range . <h> Three Volcas <p> The Volca units come in three flavours , the first of which to grab our attention was the Bass . There 's no denying that this is a unit very similar in spirit to the TB-303 " - a relatively basic three-part monophonic synth triggered by a built-in step sequencer . Its three oscillators can be sequenced together or individually , then fed through a filter derived from the MiniKorg 700S . Theres also- an LFO which can be assigned to any combination of pitch , amplitude and filter cutoff . <p> The Volca Beats has similarities with Korg 's own KPR-77 , but let 's be honest : the first thing you think of when asked to name a small , affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be Roland 's TR-606 . In this case the sound sources are mainly analogue with a handful of sampled sounds thrown in . There 's also a built-in stutter effect . <p> The third and final product in the range is the Volca Keys , which initially seems similar to the Bass . The crucial difference is that the Keys offers a more conventional approach to three-note polyphony . Instead of three separate oscillators , the Keys is based around an oscillator cluster with a selection of six different modes for achieving a range of timbres . The filter is a slightly different variation on the same MiniKorg-derived circuit found in the Bass . The Keys also features a built-in delay effect . <h> Overview <p> Bigger than a Monotron but smaller than a Monotribe , the Volcas clearly fit into the lineage of the classic compact grooveboxes and drum machines . It 's nearly impossible not to make reference to classics like the TB-303 and TR-606 when discussing them , and the comparisons are justified to some extent : the Volcas are affordable , portable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical comparison ? Well , yes and no . Although there are similarities , the Volcas are a little more limited . Where the Electribes can build up entire tracks from multiple synth and drum parts , the Volcas offer fewer options . The Beats can only do drums , the Keys can only play one timbre and part at a time , while the Bass can play three parts simultaneously but all must use the same filter , LFO and envelope settings . <p> The Volcas focus on hands-on performance and real-time manipulation rather than programming full tracks . There 's no song arrangement mode ; you can store eight patterns in each unit , but you 'll have to switch between them manually rather than chaining them together to form a full track arrangement. - If you want to build up more complex multi-part tracks you 'll need to sync multiple units together ; they can sync via a 3.5mm cable or over MIDI ( the Volcas use the same sync signal as the Monotribe , so that can join in too ) . <p> Build quality is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the same league as something like , say , a Maschine or a Push , the Volcas feel like they 'll take a fair amount of abuse . The majority of the knobs are the same splined plastic shafts found on the Monotron and Monotribe , with larger knobs for more important controls such as filter cutoff on the Bass . <p> The Volcas focus on hands-on performance and real-time manipulation rather than programming full tracks . <p> The built-in mono speakers are situated underneath the units , which means they sound very muffled when used on anything but a hard surface ( such as , say , your leg while you sit and watch TV " - let 's be honest , the Volcas are probably going to be used in that kind of setting just as much as they get used for proper studio work ) , but the 3.5mm headphone socket can be used as a line out , which reveals that the sound is a lot more impressive than the built-in speaker might initially suggest . The kick drum on the Beats , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny speaker , but packs a decent punch when hooked up to a proper monitor . <p> The ribbon controllers are a notable step up from the Monotron and Monotribe ; larger , more clearly marked and much easier to use " - 27 keys on the Keys , 16 keys on the Bass , 16 steps on the Beats .

The layout has been tweaked slightly since version 6 ( mainly to accommodate new features ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks and regions running horizontally along the timeline and most key features accessible without any menu-diving . <p> So what else is new ? - The biggest headline feature is probably 64-bit support , - with built-in bridging to allow 32-bit plugins to run alongside 64-bit ones. - Although 64-bit support is particularly big news to anyone working with RAM-intensive virtual instruments , - it 's worth mentioning that Mixcraft itself has very low system requirements , so you do n't  necessarily need a powerful computer or a lot of RAM to use it ; the DAW itself will run on a 1.5 GHz processor and- just 1 GB of RAM . <p> Elsewhere , there are a number of significant new features introduced with version 7 . The new Performance- Panel- works a bit like a slightly simplified version of Abletons Session View , with a grid of slots onto which MIDI and audio clips or- loops can be dropped and then triggered in sync with your project . Its a great addition to the program , especially as it can be used in conjunction with- a pad controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio clips makes use of Mixcrafts new audio warping features , featuring- updated- time-stretching and pitch-shifting algorithms . Warping sounded impressively clean and neutral on a range of loops and samples I tried . <p> The new Performance Panel works a bit like a slightly simplified version of Ableton 's Session View <p> Two new sampler instruments have also been added in version 7 . Alpha is a very basic instrument with just one sample slot , a two-part amp envelope generator , resonant low-pass filter and an LFO for modulation . Omni is a multi-sample instrument with pretty much the same envelope , filter and modulation options for each of its 128 slots. - Mixcrafts promo blurb encourages you to " kick overly complex sampler instruments to the curb " , but it does seem like a more advanced sampler is missing here . Alpha and Omni do the job well enough for simple tasks like one-shots and drum samples , but it would be good to see a more fully featured equivalent join them in a future update . <p> The range of bundled virtual instruments in Mixcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded further this time around with the addition of new virtual instruments and effects from the likes of G-Sonique and AAS . Admittedly , many of Mixcrafts built-in plugins are available elsewhere for very little money , but we 'd probably still- go for the full Pro Studio version , which features a handful of additional synths ( including the very good new Glass Viper plugin , based on digital classics like the Yamaha DX7 and Roland D50 ) and a lot more effects when compared to the cheaper- version . <p> Perhaps unsurprisingly given that company motto we mentioned earlier , the main selling point- boils down to the fact that Mixcraft is so efficient and easy to use that it makes the creative process run smoothly , which can only be a good thing in terms of the end results . Whether its the thorough and well written manual , the ability- to run the program in any of- 16 languages , or the- fact that- Acoustica 's own Mixcraft support forum is one of the more active DAW user forums you 'll come across , with Acoustica staff responding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression is one of a very well thought-out and carefully presented user experience . <p> In summary , Mixcraft 7- may lack some of the- more advanced features- of more expensive DAWs , but its neat , efficient- workflow and overall approach make it a great option for beginners or anyone who simply prefers a more user-friendly DAW.

Hence , a minor 7 chord is a minor triad ( root , minor 3rd and 5th ) with the seventh- note of the minor scale played above it . However , things get a little ( but not much ) more complicated when were looking at chords employing further notes above the 7th , i.e. above the octave . <p> This is where chords such as 9 , 11 , 13 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor/major 9 chord actually refers to the second- note of the scale , but played an octave above . There are a great number of options for voicing chords , but generally speaking , a chord becomes a 9 rather than an add2 , when the 2nd interval is played above the octave . <p> If we use C major as a basic example , we can see in the keyboard diagram below that the terms 9th , 11th- and 13th- simply refer to the second , fourth and sixth- notes of the major scale , played above the octave of the root note C. <p> Below , we can see how the major 9 chord is constructed . The 7th and 9th are added over the C major triad . The major 7th ( B ) is shown in blue , while the 9th- ( D ) is shown in red . <p> As the second- note of the scale is the same in both the minor and major scale , the addition of the same note , D , to the C minor 7 , creates the C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the major and minor 9 chords , starting with the triad , then the 7 and finally the 9 . <p> here 's how it sounds when we play the major triad , then add the major 7 , then the 9 : <h> Related <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507

Errrrmmm , no , its not that . Murat and I just have a very great connection . We 've been friends for so many years , we know each other inside out . Were both sometimes- complicated- and know how to deal with that . Especially- at the time we made Serenity , - we were both going through break-ups and we both are people who turn to music in times of need . So for- Serenity- we were both experiencing the same thing and filtering that through music , and that was a great experience . <p> So is making music therapeutic because it takes your mind off your pain , or because you try and directly channel that pain through the sounds you make ? <p> I think its a bit of both . Laughs Actually , there were times I could n't cope with my emotional life so I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Really ? ! <p> Its because it allows you to not express your own feelings but the feelings of the song , so at a time when I was n't able to fully go there with what was going on with myself , I could basically dry hump the feeling through someone elses song . Laughs I hope you know what I mean . <p> there were times I could n't cope with my emotional life so I went to sing karaoke a couple of times a week . <p> For someone who has spoken about needing time to themselves and not always being comfortable in the company of other people , karaoke seems a crazily brave thing to do. - <p> The thing is its not a classic karaoke with a big stage I go to places where they have small boxes and I go with friends . In Berlin there 's a place , Monster Ronson 's , where you mix and mingle for a fixed entrance fee and that can be surprisingly fun . You end up with shitty people and sing stuff you know will drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you end up with really nice people . I remember a night there was this metal guy he was singing metal ballads , so really not my music , but we got along and were singing Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue together , and it was brilliant ! <p> What do you sing when the choice is yours ? <p> It depends on the situation . There are a couple of happy songs I do . Of course , if you do Human League Do n't  You Want Me that works well and everybody joins in . I just had a night of karaoke with Murat and one of the highlights was Leila K Open Sesame , which is stupid and has ridiculous lyrics but was a lot of fun . <p> Youve talked before about depression , but you seem happy now , laughing all the way through your karaoke anecdotes . Do you feel more at ease with life in Edinburgh ? <p> I feel more happy . I experience life as a- series- of long and slow roads up , and still get times where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in all my life has been a rewarding one . Its only getting better all the time . <p> How does DJing fit into that ? Is it always a welcome release or do you sometimes not feel up to it ? <p> Records have been the friends I go to in the time of need . If I feel bad or had a bad day , - music- lifts me out of that . There are- moments- where you have a shitty- experience- in- the- club- where you- dont- feel happy- because- of- various- factors - if- the- equipment- is- shit , and you struggle , that will put you in a bad mood , and the- music ca n't always- lift me out of that . Or if people treat you disrespectfully . <p> So I imagine the- prospect- of meeting- unknown- promoters- at the- airport- is one of the worst- bits- of the- job for you . <p> Usually its a driver or somebody who 's excited to meet you , and who does n't  like that ! ? Sometimes its- someone- who is under the- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has no interest in drugs , can be quite exhausting .

" All I could say was " no . " In the end I realised he was asking me about stuff that- wasnt- released and he was- trying to catch me saying , " yeah , I know it , " - because he was holding his mobile- phone to- record- what I was saying and was trying to catch me out . It was extremely weird , and rude , and made me think what is going on with these tabloid tactics ? ! That was- surprising- and shocking , but usually I meet nice people and have a good- time . <p> Records have been the friends I go to in the time of need . If I feel bad or had a bad day , music lifts me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're starting with Murat . Why now ? <p> Well we joked that were at the stage in our relationship where its OK to have a baby . Weve worked with lots of labels in the last years and had good and bad experiences , but at some point we thought " why not do it ourselves and have full control ? " Its much easier to do that now than a couple of years ago . <p> Does it mean you 've resolved to release more of your own music ? <p> I , umm , well , at the beginning I thought I would do the second release but now we have such great material from other people that that will go first . I have finished tracks but they do n't  , erm its OK for them to stay in a folder for a couple more months . Maybe by release four there will be something by me . <p> Is it a confidence thing that means you hold your stuff back , or if someone said- something- was- good would you put it out there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Playhouse at that time I never intended to release it with my vocals . In my head Inner City vocalist Paris Grey was singing it . So for me it was more a demo track , but people encouraged me at that time to release it like that . So sure people can encourage me , but its part a confidence thing , it is , ummmm , I think it is about letting go and making agh , this sounds cheesy , but its about making a part of yourself available to everyone . <p> Are you more confident when DJing ? <p> Of course . <p> And are you critical of your DJ sets ? <p> Yes . It does n't  really happen that at the end of the night I think , " hey , I was brilliant ! " Usually there is stuff where I think that went well and this did n't  so much .

To that end , the only thing standing in the way of your creativity is you . <p> As much as our egos would love to deny it , a creative block has roots . Often deep roots . Its not just some invisible force that was dreamed up as a scapegoat for our lack of productivity . You have to do a bit of soul searching and ask yourself : " What is different as of now ?

As a member of Stardust he was responsible for one of the biggest and best dance crossovers of all time in the form of Music Sounds Better With You ' , but despite such incredible success so early in his career he chose not to chase stardom . <p> Braxe " real name Alain Qu+me " admits that he s never felt comfortable in the spotlight . While many of his friends and colleagues from the mid-90s Paris club scene have gone on to become household names , Braxe shunned celebrity in favour of launching his own Vulture Music label and building up a back catalogue of underground classics such as- Intro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now based in the south of France , Alain tells us that he drops his two children off at school each morning and returns to his home studio to- work on music until its time to go back and collect them . Its a regimented routine which sums up his clear and focussed approach to production . Having made music for nearly 20 years , he has a clear idea of his favoured method : a tidy studio , a few essential pieces of equipment and the patience to work until inspiration strikes . Or , as he poetically describes it , " waiting for luck to happen " . <p> Attack : Looking around your studio , you 've got lots of hardware but everything seems to be based around Ableton , is that right ? <p> Alan Braxe : I 've been using Ableton for five years and I 'd love to move to Pro Tools but I 'm working on an important project and I 'm a bit scared because of the learning curve of Pro Tools , so I keep on working on Ableton. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like I consider it as a plugin itself . What I need now is to use something like Pro Tools as a recorder where I can edit audio perfectly . <p> What 's the project you 're working on ? <p> I 'm trying to work on an album with my cousin , DJ Falcon . It 's quite an ambitious project . We 're in the process of writing right now . <p> That sounds- interesting " well come back to it in a bit . Going back to Ableton , it seems like it might have been a natural step for you , coming from making music with the E-mu SP-1200 ? Was it easy to make the transition in terms of the way Ableton works with samples ? <p> I worked on Digital Performer on the Mac for two years and then when I discovered Ableton I was really excited by the clip scenarios and the whole structure of it , being able to do whatever you want with audio . There are so many really exciting things with Ableton which are really different from working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same feeling . When I started with the SP-1200 what I liked was that it was very simple and you could cut and reorganise samples very easily . It 's two different worlds but that 's the link between them . <p> Abletons Granulator device <p> What 's good now with Ableton , especially with Max for Live , is that you can really have control of the audio . I 'm really excited by the idea of treating an audio signal as you would a VCO in a synthesiser. - I just discovered the Granulator instrument two weeks ago and it 's amazing. - The problem now is I 'm a bit done with Ableton for building songs and building structures , but the creative possibilities are really exciting . <p> You mentioned that you 're writing with DJ Falcon . Is writing a separate process for you or do you write , mix and produce all in one go ? <p> There 's no specific rule but what I 've learned over the years is that when you 're working sometimes you 're behind your gear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good the most important thing is to record the idea as quickly as possible . If the music 's coming from hardware what 's important is to stop listening to what you 're doing and record it really cleanly and really perfectly , because you 'll probably never find it again . <p> The writing process is a mixture of capturing stuff which arrives by accident and a more formal way of writing ; a mix of formality and luck . It 's about having a studio which allows you to have access to luck . That 's very important in music , I think . Once luck happens it just turns to a more formal process . <p> Which tracks in your back catalogue were down to luck ? <p> All of them ! This is what I 'm scared about because sometimes you 're working for hours , days , weeks and nothing 's happening then suddenly there 's a kind of magic happening and you do n't know why , you 're not in control of it . Some people are really strong because they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just waiting for luck to fall on me .

There are all kinds of myths about you and other French producers using cheap gear like the Alesis 3630 to get that classic sound back in the 90s . How much of that was true ?

When I started making music Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3630 is a good tool , you should buy it .

At the beginning the 3630 was kind of crucial to obtain the sound I was looking for , but I ca n't work with it any more . I 'm done with it . I worked too much with it . I hate it ! I 'm discovering other compressors and working with compression in a much more subtle way , like over-compressing room mics for drum overheads or just compressing the master a little . I was happy with the 3630 but it 's a learning process and now I can achieve similar results with other compressors . <p> At that time , instruments like the Ensoniq ASR-10 , the Roland S-760 sampler , the 3630 and the SP-12 were kind of crucial in the process . Also we worked with the small eight-channel Mackie mixer a lot and that was part of the sound .

That 's not the case ; you 're not supposed to sweep the frequency while the track plays or use it like you 'd use a filter on a synth . Instead , think of it in EQ terms : it works like a peak filter which can be used to apply a very narrow-bandwidth boost to an adjustable frequency range centred between 20 and 300 Hz . At the same time , frequencies below that peak are rolled off with a steep slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the unit was originally designed to replicate the proximity effect of a directional microphone when recording and mixing vocals , but it works so well on other sources that you 're just as likely to find a use for it on bass , kick drums or even snares as you are on vocals . <p> The VOG 's simplicity is its main advantage . Forget trying to set up a pair of complimentary peak and high-pass filters to tweak the low end of a signal . In fact , forget frequencies , bandwidths and gain amounts altogether and use your ears . With just two knobs ( plus a couple of buttons to adjust the range of the frequency control ) , this is a unit which really encourages you to listen to what 's going on and focus in on the key frequencies of the signal . <p> The VOG is simple , obvious and so effective .

The majority of the companys products are developed and distributed by Justin Webster , who has a background that includes working on Lord of the Rings , The Hobbit and District 9 . While Justin 's background- has perhaps inevitably meant Slapper is a great plugin for film post-production , it also has vast potential as a music processor . <p> Slapper is a multi-tap delay which is now available as both Slapper and Slapper ST ( stereo ) . Since its initial inception in 2015 as a surround sound delay plugin , this latest release has optimised most of its core features for music production " including the audio processing , the filters and the overall user experience . Multi-tap delay can sometimes seem daunting depending on the approach the effect takes , but Slappers user interface does a good job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by- its colourful , object-orientated controls . Each tap can be individually controlled via eight separate parameters , either by moving the controls around the plugin window or by dialling in the required amount within the level meters at the bottom of the screen . Moving the visual controls around is the easiest approach , offering an effective and intuitive take on a potentially complex effect . To get a sense of the plugins sonic potential , it 's a good idea to explore the presets first . Slappers extensive- range of presets includes- tempo-synced settings , ambient echoes and- odd effects . Moving the- circular blocks around the screen to customise the presets allows you to hear the changes in real time and explore the sound of the effect . For vocal samples , the basic exterior slap preset places the sound- comfortably into a mix . For synths , there are a range of settings- that can widen , filter , delay and place elements . <p> Some people like to use delay as an alternative to reverb and Slapper has the ability to create retro reverb-style effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay unit like a Roland Space Echo. - The plugin offers two modes of operation , Tape and Sync . In tape mode , the taps respond in the same way as analogue tape would when vari-speeded ( i.e. pitch and time are interrelated ) . If you automate a change in time , the pitch will also change accordingly . <p> Overall , the purpose of Slapper appears to make programming delays a more visual process , in turn allowing the- user to generate more complex delays . Whilst in many instances having eight delays under one roof might be overwhelming , Slappers visual approach does a fine job of giving the user more- control and creative freedom . In terms of where it sits within the marketplace , there are obvious overlaps with plugins from- Logic 's free Delay Designer through to commercial options such as the Super Tap series by Waves . Slapper does n't  go down the route of extensive modulation controls , but its GUI places it definitively at the more user-friendly end of the scale. - It 's hard to highlight any obvious shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its promise .

Bruce Aisher explores the under-appreciated power of the plugins- wavetables . <p> In the eight years since Native Instruments introduced Massive to the world , it has come to be a cornerstone in the armoury of a significant number of producers . It was widely adopted , in particular , by dubstep and bass music producers , but its become a staple of countless genres . <p> Although well-known for its complex modulation routing abilities , one of Massives greatest strengths is the- flexibility of its wavetable oscillators , which take their inspiration- from features first found in early 80s digital synths . Interestingly though , Native Instruments place its virtual analogue capabilities and huge preset collection well ahead of this on their marketing material . A lot of users do n't  realise the power of Massives oscillators , - but- understanding the wavetable functionality on offer is the key to getting the most out of the synth and creating your own distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts behind the use of wavetables as an oscillator source extend back to the early computer music research of pioneers like Max Mathews and others , it was German musician and synth designer- Wolgang Palm who commercialised the technique in the PPG Wavecomputer 360 , and later the more fully-featured and more widely produced- PPG Wave series . <p> The PPG Wave was not wholly digital . It combined a polyphonic digital oscillator engine with analogue VCAs and filters . This has helped to sustain its reputation as a ( relatively rare ) classic , even though newer fully digital units , such as the Waldorf Blofeld- or the early 90s Korg Wavestation , have far better feature sets on paper . There are now also software options inspired by those original hardware models to choose from , such as Waldorfs PPG Wave 3. v plugin . <p> Waldorfs PPG Wave 3. v is the reincarnation of the legendary PPG Wave Synthesiser <p> So what is a wavetable ? Analogue- synths traditionally used simple , easily created waves as the core of their sound generation .

This in turn allowed harmonically unusual timbres to be harnessed in a relatively straightforward way . <p> A complex digital waveform <p> This evolved into the concept of the wavetable , where a whole series of individual waves could be accessed and played back .

Luckily Attacks production expert Bruce Aisher is here to explain the principles of layering kick samples to create the ultimate blend . <p> As we saw in our walkthrough on clap and snare sounds , layering drum elements is a relatively easy and incredibly effective way to achieve the perfect percussion sound . Its all too easy to find samples which are- nearly right but do n't  quite hit the spot in the context of your mix . Layering two or more samples together allows you to combine the best characteristics of each , creating the ideal custom sound to fit your track . <p> Kick drums , in particular , can benefit from layering in order to conjure up the ultimate kick ' , but a little more care is needed with low-frequency sounds in order to avoid some common potential pitfalls . <h> How Low Can You Go ? <p> For our starting point , let 's take this kick sample with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency content : <p> We can try and boost the higher frequencies to add some click and help the sound cut through the mix , but no amount of EQ seems to work . After all , EQ cant boost something that is n't there in the first place . <p> The obvious solution is to layer this low-end kick with a second sample to add some mid- and high-frequency weight . Weve picked out this sample which should complement it nicely : <p> When deciding which kick samples to layer together , trial and error is the most sensible approach , but you can usually refine your options by thinking about the components of the sound you 're looking for . <p> All the usual descriptive terms can be useful in determining which samples are likely to be complementary . Does your kick lack low-end boom , low-mid body and weight or high-mid click ? Does it have a very fast , percussive attack which could be reinforced by something slightly more mellow ? Does it have a short tail which could be layered with a long boom ? <p> Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a kick sample if they add the desired characteristics . Hi-hats , white noise or rimshots , for example , can be used to add a click . Sub-bass tones can add that low-end boom . <p> ( Note that there are a few different ways of triggering two kick samples simultaneously . You could use multiple instances of a sampler plugin , each placed on its own track for individual processing . You could use one sampler plugin with multiple outputs. - Here were working with samples placed directly onto audio tracks in Cubase simply because it makes the process a little easier to visualise in our screengrabs .

@@34419576 @3419576/ <h> Tone &amp; Colour : What Do Filters Do To Sounds ? <p> Bruce Aisher explores what- filters do to audio signals , visualising the results and explaining what gives particular filters their own distinctive sounds . <p> Audio filters are one of the core building blocks of electronic music and sound equipment . Modern applications span the full signal chain , from synthesisers to microphones , mixers , software- and , - of course , EQs . In other words , filters are everywhere , and used in a multitude of ways . In some cases ( such as synths and EQs ) , they- may offer a considerable degree of hands-on control , while elsewhere a filter may be hidden from view , and used for a less overtly creative use . <p> There are many types of audio filter with an equally large number of ways of implementing their design but here we 'll be focussing on the three basic types found most commonly in synths : low-pass , high-pass and band-pass . The basic difference between them being which frequencies remain unchanged- i.e. those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a multitude of ways . <p> From this , it 's easy to determine that a low-pass filter allows low frequencies through , but has an effect on the high frequencies " in this case , attenuation occurs . So a low-pass filter ( which can also be referred to as a high-cut filter ) - removes higher frequencies . <h> Filters in action <p> The most critical parameter with any filter of this type is its cutoff frequency . In the low-pass filter example above , this is the point above which higher frequencies are made- quieter ( note that , to be precise , the cutoff frequency is actually defined as the point where the signal is attenuated by 3 decibels ) . <p> We can see and hear this in action by using a white noise source and taking note of what happens before and after filtering . We use white noise because it contains frequencies right across the full audio range . here 's how unfiltered white noise looks- on a frequency plot : <p> From this we can determine that the cutoff frequency lies somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-filtering example is that that the audio above 1 kHz is n't completely removed there is noticeable slope to the amount of attenuation . <p> The rate at which it changes is usually measured in decibels- per octave in other words , by how many decibels the level is attenuated when moving an octave up the frequency scale . For example , a 24 dB/octave low-pass filter will attenuate signals present at- 500 Hz by 24 dB- more than it attenuates signals one octave below , at 250 Hz ( assuming the cutoff frequency is set low enough , of course ) . <p> If we flip things around we can look at a high-pass filter in action ( again , this can sometimes be referred to as a low-cut filter ) : <p> There are many ways we can alter the sound of these basic filter types , and we 'll be looking at this in more depth shortly . <p> Were going to focus on the three main filter types for the sake of brevity , but note that there are in fact many other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite of a band-pass ) , formant and comb-filters , plus many more besides . <p> There is even the counterintuitive all-pass filter , which is designed to manipulate the relative phase of different frequencies . However , the main focus here will be on the common filter types found in many synths , with the low-pass as the most important . <h> Related <h> Technique is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507

This is perhaps of most importance in live situations , where recording levels are at their least predictable . <p> This means that whilst we do n't necessarily need a large dynamic range to play back many types of music , it allows us to have more headroom during the recording and mixing process . <p> Given that most of us record at 24-bit and our DAWs mix with something greater , there is little need to push peaks right up to the 0dBFS mark when mixing , especially when going over this point can be so sonically problematic . <h> Loudness <p> As we 've already seen , peak level does n't provide a clear idea of loudness . In reality , our perception of loudness is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as its spectral make-up and density , amongst other factors . <p> In theoretical terms , when applied to music , it can be narrowed down to the difference between average and peak levels the crest factor . However , even then there is a question over which of the various values are captured , and different metering systems have different ways of dealing with this . In fact , when it comes to mixing on a DAW , in many respects we only really need to know that we 're below 0dBFS the built-in meters tell us little about how loud or punchy our track really is . <p> At its simplest , we can make something louder by keeping the peaks in the same place , but raising the quieter bits , and this is exactly what a compressor or limiter enables us to do . In fact , the so-called loudness war ' centres on exactly this deliberately reducing the overall dynamic range of a signal when producing for a medium that is capable of representing a greater range than any other in recording history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use limiting ( or more heavy-handed compression ) to shape our tracks , but its important not to go overboard , especially when delivering tracks to be mastered . Its virtually impossible- to increase dynamic range with any level of success once it 's been reduced by limiters and compressors . Mastering engineers invariably prefer- to work with pre-masters that have n't been heavily processed in terms of dynamics . If you insist on a loud master , chances are they can do a better job of it if you give them dynamic range to work with . <p> Incidentally , it 's been shown that super-compressed ' mixes ( that actually reshape the signal peaks ) running through the average radio processing chain only sound more distorted than lesser ' mixes not louder .

Likewise , Smith 's mastery of analogue synthesis is evident from the likes of the Pro One and Prophet-5 right through to his current range of DCO-based modern classics . <p> First up , let 's take a closer look at the most important feature of the Tempest : its sound . Each of the Tempests voices is ( loosely ) based on the voice architecture employed in the Mopho , with a few changes to make it more suitable for drum synthesis . <p> Flicking through some of the preset sounds , it 's clear that the synth engine is versatile enough to create everything from booming , subby , 808-style kicks to lightning-fast percussive hits .

This is a device which demands that you get to grips with its phenomenally powerful sound engine . <h> Approaches to drum synthesis <p> At this point it 's worth considering how other analogue drum machines generate their sounds and how much versatility they offer . Roland 's classic analogue units " most notably the 606 , 808 and 909 " are based around very simple electronic circuits . <p> ( This is n't to say that the circuits are unsophisticated " the self-damping bridged T-network oscillator used for the TR-808 's kick drum , for instance , is an ingenious use of a relatively uncommon circuit design which uses relatively few components , takes up very little circuit board space but helps define the distinctive sound of the 808 's famous kick . ) <p> The trade-off for the simplicity of the circuits is that they are n't particularly flexible . As standard , the 606 offers no adjustable sound parameters . The 808 allows the user to adjust very little other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the famous snare drum snappy ' control . The 909 raises the stakes slightly with kick drum and snare tuning , but in comparison to the expectations of modern users the analogue x0x drum machines are severely lacking . <p> Modern analogue options such as the Vermona DRM1 , Jomox XBASE 888/999 and Acidlab Miami improve slightly on the traditional model , but each circuit is still based around a fixed architecture , intended for a single purpose . The clap circuit is always going to sound like a noise-based , percussive hit no matter what settings you dial in . That makes things slightly more immediate , but it also means you 're always operating within the restrictive parameters of a fixed framework .

During Attack 's evening visit to his east London studio , Miele explained how he 'd already earned a global reputation producing breakbeat as Madox , but chose to start again from scratch , building his new identity via music blogs and social media . <p> Despite international success as an artist , a producer and a remixer , Miele refers to himself primarily as a DJ . This focus on the club experience and the importance of the dancefloor is reflected in his music , which is characterised by an unashamed element of fun . If you like music to be po-faced , ultra-serious and lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , but the success of tracks like the Balkan-influenced I Was Drunk ' suggests that the formula works . <p> Emphasising the importance of originality and attention to detail throughout , Stef let us in on the secrets of his music , from his roots in southern Italy through to his recent obsession with prog rock and the importance of breaking the rules . <p> Attack : Let 's start by talking about how you first got into music . <p> Riva Starr : The south of Italy has a very strong musical tradition . Naples , where I come from , has a lot of influence from Africa , Spain , Greece and the Balkans . Northern Italy has a type of music we call combat folk " which is almost Celtic in a way " but there 's not a proper root or culture to it because of the history of different people who lived in that area over the centuries . Southern Italy has a very rich musical culture . I was born there and grew up there , so in my music you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did dance music come into your life ? <p> When I was at high school I listened to mix shows on the weekend from one of the big clubs in Naples , then me and some friends decided to start doing parties . We used to do 18 year-old birthday parties : a big cake at midnight , sing Happy Birthday ' then play Gipsy Kings megamixes and all that bullshit ! To get started I made enough money to buy turntables , a mixer and a few records but for a while I was playing five hour sets with about twenty or thirty records , playing the A-side , the B-side , the instrumental , the acapella , trying to make brand new records from them <p> And from there you got into producing your own tracks ? <p> Around the late 80s I got into production . We were really into all the latest technology so we were using an Atari as a sequencer , an Akai S950 sampler and we started making edits with the first digital multi-tracks . I started off doing megamixes and remixes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into proper production . <p> After a while I realised I was basically a DJ rather than a musician , because I can hardly play any chords , so I got into full-time club production making drum and bass as Stefano Miele . I produced a few drum and bass tracks but I was n't really into it . <p> When the nu skool breaks scene exploded with all that stuff from Plump DJs , Meat Katie , Rennie Pilgrem , Tayo and those guys I got inspired to start playing and producing breakbeat . I was probably one of the first in Italy to push breakbeat and I was flying to London every month to buy records at Vinyl Addiction and in Soho . Then I started the Madox project with Mantra Breaks and we were touring worldwide , from Japan to London to America . <p> After four or five years I got bored because the scene was slowly dying . There were no new ideas and no new tracks . We were just playing our own stuff and it was like , You know what ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming from house from guys like VonStroke and Jesse Rose , then all the early fidget house when it was n't that cheesy and it was still very cool . It really convinced me to move to four on the floor beats , so I left Madox behind in 2006 and moved to London . <p> Stefano- in downtime at his London studio . Note the Roland SH-101 in the foreground . <p> Was it a deliberate effort to start all over again with the new project ? <p> I started from scratch . I 'll never forget , I was playing as Madox at Womb in Tokyo one week " one of the biggest and best clubs in the world " and then two weeks later I was playing in a pub in London for 50 quid . It was hard work . In the first two years as Riva Starr I did over 70 remixes , but I started in a good way because the first release was on Dirtybird and then the second was on Front Room . <p> It took me a while to rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basslines to the house music thing , but it 's not easy . Most of the breakbeat producers who moved to house were all doing the same kind of big room electro/fidget thing , but I definitely was n't into that so I tried to make my own style . <p> You can hear in the first few Riva Starr releases that you were still looking for your sound . <p> Yeah . The turning point was Maria ' , the first track I released on Kindisch , the Get Physical sub-label . That was the track that really got me into my sound . Sometimes it 's not easy to do that . If you 're the kind of person who 's played pretty much the same thing for ten years , you might worry about using a sound that 's too different to the rules of the genre . For me , if a sound is good there 's room for it in the track , even if it does n't fit the usual rules . <p> I think the best records have always been the crossover ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of breaking the rules so they go in a safe direction . If I put out a record with a reggae sample or something it does n't mean that I want to go mainstream or commercial or whatever , it 's just that I 'm trying to put some different culture and sensibility in the tracks and make something different . <p> There 's no point in producing stuff that a thousand other DJs are producing . Over the last few years people have started recognising my sound and that 's good for me . Whether it 's in a good or a bad way , I do n't care . <h> The riva rack <h> Roland SH-101 <p> It still sounds so good . For basically the first two years of Riva Starr productions , all the synth sounds and the bass came from this . <h> SSL G series mix buss compressor <p> I use this for drums . I do n't like to put compression on the whole mix . I 'd rather work properly on compressing the drums , bass and kick , then go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mastering . <h> Empirical Labs Distressor <p> I use my Distressor all the time . I 'm going to buy a second one so I can use one for the kick drum and one for the bass .

The New Jersey producers take on dance music has played a key role in defining the classic deep house sound . <p> We caught up with Kerri in London as he made a flying visit to play an extraordinary seven hour DJ set at Loft Studios . Dragging himself out of bed the following day to meet us in the bar of his hotel , Kerri was as gracious , humble and generous as any artist or DJ we 've ever met . Despite only running on a couple of hours sleep , he was genuinely excited to chat about everything from his musical influences to his thoughts on the current dance music scene . <p> In what we think is probably one of the deepest , most revealing interviews Kerri has ever given , we focused our discussion on the events and people who have inspired his music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and Chicago counterparts , and the relentless hunger for technological innovation which has driven his approach to production and DJing . <p> Attack : Let 's start by talking about the way you got into house music . You 've spoken before about growing up around music and how you began DJing in the early 80s , when you were 13 years old , but you did n't start releasing records in your own name until around 1992 . What were you doing in the intervening period ? <p> Kerri Chandler : I was interning in studios from when I was 14 years old . People would come in off the street to rent studio time , but it was just the average Joe who thinks he can make a record and has no idea of the process . A lot of rappers and a lot of R&amp;B singers . We did n't have too many musicians coming in . They did n't have a producer , did n't have a track <p> Being a kid , I was like , OK , I 'll make you something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd bring in a record that they wanted to sound like and I knew the sound so well because I 'd actually watched people like Kool &amp; The Gang in the studio and I knew exactly what they used . I was only supposed to be an engineer but I found myself being more of a producer . Eventually I thought , OK , if I 'm doing all this I might as well make a few things for myself . I had another job on the weekend DJing at Club America , so I 'd make edits and records to play there . <p> What kind of music was this ? <p> This is like ' 86 , ' 87 , so it was disco and early house music . I never really got into the R&amp;B stuff and we never really played rap music at the club . We just played rap stuff around at parties . <p> What was the breakthrough for you in terms of getting serious with house music ? <p> Around ' 88 I made an edit and one of the singers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know Tony well but he started playing things I 'd done on the radio . I realised there was a buzz around it and everything started to fall into place . I met Merlin Bobb who I was a long-time fan of for doing stuff on BLS along with Naeem Johnson . I did n't realise that he was the head of A&amp;R for Atlantic . When I went to Merlin 's office I met another person who 'd go on to become a long-time friend , Jerome Sydenham . Jerome was Merlin 's assistant at the time and we instantly hit it off like brothers . The first time I went there me and Jerome were wearing the same exact clothes " same colours , same shoes . Someone said , Is this your cousin ? ' I just laughed and said , Yeah . ' Ever since then we 've been inseparable . It 's just been an ongoing ride since then , and that 's where the whole Jersey thing comes in . <p> Jersey is obviously an important part of the story . Explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were breaking through . <p> That was the springboard . Tony was kind of the voice of all of us at the time . I guess Frankie Knuckles was Chicago 's voice for those guys . We had Tony and David Morales . Once I met one person and they knew what songs I made , everyone welcomed me in . I guess I was the kid and a lot of people thought I was going to be a flash in the pan . That was a fun part for me , trying to make it understood that I wanted to be around for a long time . <p> People like to pigeonhole those early dance music scenes , so we look for these common trends in Chicago house , Detroit techno , New York garage , New Jersey house and so on . Were those differences apparent to you at the time ? <p> I can tell you from Jersey 's standpoint that they were obvious . In East Orange where we grew up there was nothing to do . I guess it was the same way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our attitude was , rather than going out and shooting someone or robbing someone , let 's make some music and have some parties . <p> All of us were inspired by each other and there were a lot of people making music . We all knew each other . Whitney was the older kid that we 'd all hang out with and go and get candy with . There was Naughty By Nature , who were known as The New Style back then . Latifah " Dana " used to come to the club all the time . Biz Markie always used to be around . Mtume lived just down the block . My mother used to babysit for Steve Arrington from Slave . Pic Conley from Surface was my dad 's friend ; he was there at the house every day . Bernie Worrell was my best friend 's uncle . Lauryn Hill was like the next generation . I had all these influences and people around me who were making music and if I needed to talk to someone they were there . <p> Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common ? <p> There 's only one . Every year on the fourth of July the whole city would come together and we 'd watch the fireworks in the stadium . There 'd be bands on and we 'd get to see all of them . New Edition would be there all the time " and it 's pretty obvious why that was now because of Bobby . Bobby and Whitney was years in the making . I hate to say it but they 'd always come to some place like McDonald 's and the girls would go crazy then the guys would come and beat their asses . They 'd still come back to East Orange and we could never figure out why . <p> The New Jersey music scene was always a gospel-based thing . When you were a kid you had to go to church . In that whole area , all you had was faith .

I 've always been in places where somebody has a gun , somebody 's getting shot and we 're running . It 's daily . There 'd be a war every night . The minute you heard something , everybody got on the ground . It 's routine . The cops would never come while this was happening , they 'd just come to pick up the bodies . That 's where we grew up . <p> So East Orange was pretty tough ? <p> One time a doctor who lived nearby went to get groceries and a gang broke into his house , beat up his wife and murdered her . When he arrived home with the groceries they saw him , ran outside and ran him over with his own car . That was a typical night in East Orange .

Her ex-boyfriend did n't like the idea of us being together at all . This night Tracy was going to stop at Zanzibar first then meet me at Club America . He was at Zanzibar that night and saw her in the club , walked out with her I guess , raped her behind the club , bashed her head open with a rock , stuck a stick up inside of her , then dragged her behind the bushes outside and left her for dead .

A new synth 's announced and we 've written it off or lauded it as the best synth ever before we 've even got our hands on it . <p> On paper , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specification , it 's fairly basic : two oscillators ( which can be played monophonically or duophonically , i.e. up to- two notes simultaneously ) , an LFO , low- and high-pass filters plus two envelope generators ( one a more basic AR design , one a four-stage ADSR ) . You could easily dismiss this module on the basis of the things you wo n't find on the spec sheet : there 's no patch memory , no MIDI control for any parameters , and since this is the desktop module version of the original keyboard , there are n't even any keys . <p> In my mind , the Odyssey will always be linked to Herbie Hancock , a man who 's almost the walking definition of what can happen when technology meets artistry , as evidenced by his rapid adoption of pretty much every new synth and sampler technology introduced throughout the 70s and 80s . In his hands , the Odyssey was one of the most expressive synths around , but for all Herbies- dexterity on the keyboard , the module forces- you to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , you can hook it up to another keyboard via MIDI or CV and play it that way ( and if you want to go down that route then you 'll make a- significant saving- on the price of the keyboard version ) , but the module is- tailor-made for sequencing externally using hardware . <p> The ARP Odyssey is an iconic synth , released in 1972 as a rival to the Minimoog and revived in keyboard form by Korg last year . The new Odyssey module is , as the name suggests , a version without the keyboard and that 's about all as far as the changes go . Korg have resisted the urge to mess with the formula in this case , so the synth architecture and features are exactly as you 'd find them on the keyboard version. - The Odyssey Module is available in two different colours : a mk3-style black-and-orange colour scheme and a mk1-style light grey . Both use the same panel layout and they 're internally identical , but one of the main selling points is the fact that the- low-pass filter is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original Odyssey- used- different VCF circuits , and a three-way slider switch allows you to choose between each of them here . The first- is the original ARP 4023 filter , a funky- 12dB/oct design ; the second and third are both 24dB/oct designs , with the former being a very Moog-esque sound and the latter being slightly more bold- and capable of higher resonance . The ability to choose between them enhances the versatility of the module , but the bottom line is that- all three are big , bold and powerful in slightly different ways . <p> Taken as a whole , its a supremely characterful- instrument which reveals another side when triggered from a good hardware sequencer . The bare-bones MIDI implementation means it is n't necessarily the most obvious choice of synth to sequence via software ( youd probably be better off with something which allows you to edit parameters over MIDI ) , but the old-school approach is the selling point here . ( The Odyssey was already a perfectly good instrument , so it- feels right that it has n't  had too many modern features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SQ-1 or an Arturia BeatStep- might be- the obvious starting points in terms of sequencing , but I also tried sequencing it from the CV output of a Roland SH-101 and over MIDI using an MPC2000XL . Each revealed a slightly different element of the sound , from funky duophonic leads ( particularly good with subtle differences between VCO1 and VCO2 settings ) through to big , bold basslines and resonant , borderline acid sounds with the rev3 filter . <p> Having criticised the scientific approach to assessing musical instruments , it seems more than a little churlish to give it a rating , but so be it . Objectively speaking , the Odyssey module is by definition slightly less versatile than the keyboard version , but it sounds just as good . What our scoring system can never take into account is the undefinable quality of a synth 's musicality , which is where the Odyssey truly shines . This is a synth full of character , which reveals a new side of itself when played using step sequencers and other hardware . Sometimes the specifications only tell half the story .

Designed for home musicians and garage bands with no bass player , it famously shipped without English instructions and the sequencer was notoriously difficult to program . A small , flimsy plastic rectangle adorned with silver buttons and dials , less than 10,000 units of the analogue synthesiser were made before it was deemed a failure by the powers that be and abandoned . <p> Although it was used occasionally on records in the early 80s " Heaven 17 , Chris &amp; Cosey and Charanjit Singh all have notable early 80s tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or famous synthesiser in its early days . However , one mans mistake is another 's opportunity ; the lack of success among the target audience meant the TB-303 was soon available cheaply , and it was n't long before they were picked up by young electronic musicians from the US midwest . <p> From the mid 1980s , house and techno music began to take form , particularly in the cities of Chicago , Detroit and New York . Other Roland electronic instruments provided the backbone of these new dance music revolutions " specifically the TR-808 and TR-909 . In 1985 , a Chicago act named Phuture wrote a track featuring the TB-303 , tweaking the controls of the unit continuously throughout the track , changing and twisting the sound . They called it Acid Tracks , but due to lack of funds it took them nearly two years to cut it to acetate . DJ Ron Hardy then famously played it four times in one night in 1987 at Chicago 's famous Music Box nightclub , clearing the floor on its first play , but having the crowd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name acid house ' and was among the first releases in an explosion of new music led by the TB-303 . Producers like Armando and Frankie Knuckles brought vocals into play , and labels such as Trax started shifting vinyl by the truckload . In the UK , imports of US dance music were making their way over the Atlantic and into DJs record boxes , then out onto dancefloors . Chicago house became hugely popular in Manchester at clubs like the Ha+ienda , while the starker futurist vibes of Detroit techno were most likely to be found in the record shops and warehouses of London . <p> In Manchester , a group called 808 State started writing their own take on acid , influenced by the sounds coming out of America . Their debut album , - Newbuild , released in 1988 , was one of the first definitive British acid releases , and band member Gerald Simpson followed that up the same year with his solo anthem Voodoo Ray . Long before computer sequencers , and with samplers still being rare and expensive , UK acts like Ege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roland equipment all synchronised , practically bringing entire studios into the clubs and on stage . <p> " From what I remember of friends and the general vibe , 86/87 was all a very big rare groove , dressing-up-to-go-out kind of scene , " recalls Paul Wise , aka Placid . " Acid house was a breath of fresh air . No one cared what you looked like or danced like , - and the music was brand new . Nothing had ever sounded like it before . " <p> This wave of acid house music arrived in the UK at the same time as a newly popular drug , ecstasy . Combined with a sense of discontent and detachment within youth culture fuelled by the economic downturn of the death throes of Thatcher 's Britain , it was a perfect storm . The rave scene was created " seen by many as the last of the great sonic rebellions . <p> Acid house was a breath of fresh air . No one cared what you looked like or danced like , and the music was brand new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and punk before it , the rave scene was completely entwined with anti-establishment movements and social groups . Huge numbers of youths followed photocopied directions to secret fields or warehouses where sound systems and acid house awaited . With this came a feeling of comradeship and the desire to dance all night ( helped for many by ecstacy ) , but every silver lining has its dark cloud . The drugs and security of these events were soon capitalised on and controlled by gangsters . These large gatherings , and their criminal element , attracted the unwanted attention of the authorities and the media . The term acid was seized upon by tabloids , mistakenly linked to LSD , and the whole genre tarred by the brush of drug music , with even Top of the Pops bowing to popular pressure and banning acid house music from their programme entirely . <p> " Scenes like this are usually the result of several different elements colliding with a generation at the right time , and something happens that maybe only lasts for a couple of years at best but leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strictly Kev . " The media jumping on it with all their hysteria and misinformation about drugs maybe made it seem bigger than it was , but possibly spread it to places outside of the main cities . " <p> The rave scene outlived acid house in the UK , and acid was heard less and less by the early 90s " with hardcore breakbeats and harsher , heavier sounds taking firm hold , while house music moved into more commercial arenas . But the TB-303 was still alive and well . Acts from Amsterdam , Belgium , and east London were taking the TB-303 and distorting it , pushing the tempo faster in hard techno arenas . There was a lot less experimenting with the sound by this point , and with MDMA becoming rarer amphetamine-based pills were more prevalent on the dance floor , driving a need for speed . <p> " Some 90s acid techno is a bit horrendous when you listen back to it now I blame the producers not using it imaginatively enough , " - says Al Farrier of Manchester duo Shadow Dancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers in 2014 are using it in more wonky , funky ways " because its those sort of acid records that have stood the test of time rather than the fuckin ' avin ' it ! ' ones . " <p> Trance , particularly Goa trance , also adopted the sound of acid , and developed it into deeper ( albeit more monotonous ) territory . Surprisingly , this scene continues strong still to this day , maintaining a solid underground following within the festival circuit , club events like Shoom and Whirl-y-gig and their modern descendents , and of course , groups of kids in fields with campfires and magic mushrooms . And probably someone juggling . <p> " When the acid hits your soul it makes you lose control of your body- Acid sounds so unique you just have to move your feet when you hear it " <p> Acid did rear its head on a couple of occasions in the 90s " the famous screeching distortion of Josh Wink 's Higher State of Consciousness , and Fatboy Slim 's Everybody Needs a 303 at the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many as something that had passed its sell-by date . With samplers and computers expanding production techniques at an astonishing rate and new genres being coined every five minutes , the TB-303 became just another footnote in the eternal march of music . There were a smattering of releases by the likes of Woody McBride and Armando still flying the flag for acid house , but they were very much in the minority . <p> Then , led in no small part by producers like Aphex Twin and Luke Vibert , an acid renaissance took place in the late 90s and early 2000s . Electronic music record labels such as Warp and Rephlex began releasing 303-heavy tracks of a much more experimental nature . Luke Vibert 's anthem I Love Acid was a rallying call , and a new wave of producers " empowered by new , cheaper music software " began picking up TB-303s and fusing their unique sound with styles and genres from across the board : hip-hop , techno , braindance , and even ambient would all be combined ( sometimes all in the same track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on you cunts , let 's have some Aphex Acid ! " on his 2001 album Drukqs , and featured the TB-303 heavily on his Analord vinyl series ( named after the song by Luke Vibert , itself an acid electro track ) . <p> By the late 2000s and beyond , acid was firmly back on the menu . In recent years labels like Cr+me Organization , L.I.E.S . and Killekill have championed output that harked back to the ethos of the early Chicago days , bringing acid up to date and to new ears . Clubland has embraced acid again , with the likes of DJ Pierre and A Guy Called Gerald returning to their roots and playing to huge crowds of acid lovers once more . DJs began to feel comfortable playing shows with tracks from the mid 80s sitting seamlessly alongside brand new releases , and a whole new generation began discovering the sound of the Roland TB-303 . <p> Throughout the years , the 303 had become one of the most sought-after synthesisers in the world . Prices rocketed , driven by the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way onto the market . Digital emulators tried ( and often failed ) to recreate the sound . Hardware kit like the Future Retro 777 and Novation Bass Station had first appeared in the mid 90s but could not quite get it right . <p> By the late 2000s and beyond , acid was firmly back on the menu . <p> A large part of what made the TB-303 particularly unique was its sequencer and the timing of the patterns it created . " Even if you use the 303s sequencer to play a different synth , it still sounds really 303-ish just from the note lengths and the way the slide works , " - says DMX Krew 's Ed Upton. - When the TB-303 's squelchy sound is combined with its internal sequencer , it creates something extremely hard to recreate . Mark Archer of Altern 8 agrees : " Its not just the sound , but the way it was programmed . " <p> Roland themselves took notice of the demand for TB-303s in 1996 and released the MC-303 , but it was hugely derided for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples and a familiar looking layout. - More recently , the x0xb0x and Cyclone TT-303 appeared on the scene . Backwards engineered , they use the closest possible components to the original TB-303 , while adding newer features like MIDI and the ability to save patterns without power or batteries . The x0xb0x was sold as a kit for self-assembly , meaning that without an expert hand at the wheel , many were built with problems . The slightly more expensive TT-303 is a more recent arrival , and even looks almost identical to the TB-303 . For many , it 's the closest available alternative to the real thing without having to shell out vast sums of money for an original model . <p> Fast-forward to 2014 , and Roland have once again taken notice of the huge demand for the TB-303 and released what they call its successor . Part of the AIRA range , based around their 1980s classics , the TB-3 is a digital synthesiser designed very much for live use . There have been rumblings of discontent from purists as the TB-3 lacks analogue circuitry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for tweaking ( its missing the hugely important individual envelope modulation and decay controls ) . However , its cheap price and brand heritage will no doubt see huge sales for Roland as the next generation take their new digital , shiny acid into the clubs and beyond .

If the main draw to a party is the fact that the headliner has a few popular records right now , that should send up red flags immediately . More producers than ever before are out on the road playing DJ gigs to generate income , despite not really being DJs . Sadly , there is zero direct relationship between the quality of a producer 's recorded output and the quality of their DJ sets . Even worse , its now impossible to gain any insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can be as much a product of studio skills as their original tunes. - As such , one would expect it to come out sounding good if they 're already making music on that level . <p> Picking the right DJ is probably the single most defining choice for a party . <p> Weak DJs typically fall into a few common traps which are detrimental to the quality of a party . I 've seen many DJs play what sounded like a planned set . They played exactly one style of music- at one energy level through their whole set , even when the situation called for something to change . I 've watched name DJ headliners clear an entire party out without even trying something different to stem the tide of heads walking out the door .

There are live sets online from hyped DJs that sound as if theyve never mixed two songs together before in their entire lives . The number of DJs I 've seen distorting or clipping the shit out of their music and blasting out the eardrums of the crowd would fill ten more columns the same length as this one . <p> Every DJ has to start somewhere , but that place should not be at a packed party , killing the energy in the room <p> I would n't expect someone to go from zero DJing experience to playing headline slots at parties in just a few years , yet these guys are thrown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is almost always to the detriment of the overall quality of the party , and of course to the promoter 's reputation as well .

These should not be considered optional skills ; they should be the bare minimum when choosing a DJ to play at a party . <p> Promoters need to be strict about their criteria for booking DJs . I have a mental exercise I use for deciding which- DJ to book at a party , or- even whether I should go out to see a DJ perform at a party . I call it the Backyard BBQ Test .

You need- to have knowledge of what you 're doing , and you need- to choose correctly to get the job done properly . Buying into the hype behind a name or choosing a friend of a friend to do a favour all has the same result : a weak party . The- party is central to the whole idea of dance music .

And as long as you acknowledge the originators , DJ Pierre does n't  have a problem. - " I feel like a proud dad knowing acid is even stronger now than ever , " he beams . " I think everything happens for a reason . Phuture was chosen to be the proud parents . I do n't  like the fact that some people try to take credit away from us as the creators of this sound , but there 's no denying it .

" For different people its a different moment but nonetheless , in the right hands , they 're like nuclear weapons . Use smartly or you risk fucking it up completely . There 's a stacked weight of amazing records that have been made out of those breaks sitting there , so if you use these things you need to ensure that it is absolutely necessary " that your use of them is vital .

Supply and demand , no ? If the audience is sick of the state of music , they need just to stop listening and buying it Youll see a big change . The reality scares me because you have generations of young listeners who think mediocrity is actually brilliance . Where does that leave an artist that is seeking to better his or her art ? You want to create Shakespeare but people are only aware of , understand and crave nursery rhymes . " <p> Ultimately , the entire debate essentially all boils down to one simple sentiment .

The System-500 Complete Set includes a 512 twin VCO module , a 521 twin VCF , 530 twin VCA , 540 twin envelope generator and LFO and a 572 effects module , all housed in a bespoke wood and metal flight case with integrated power supply . It 's a full starter setup in one , but it does n't come cheap . Price will be around -1,600 . <p> Roland have also introduced a slightly unusual new module in the form of the A-01 Controller + Generator , which appears to be part of the Boutique range . It 's a small unit ( the same size as the Boutique modules ) with an on-board step sequencer , MIDI ( USB , DIN and Bluetooth ) and CV/gate outputs and a very basic 8-bit monophonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can also sit in the K-25m keyboard unit . <h> Korg <p> The big news from Korg is the Minilogue , a four-voice analogue synth priced at just $500 ( -435 in the UK ) . It already looks likely to be a big- success for Korg , marking a new affordable price point for polyphonic analogue synths . The entire synth architecture- has been developed specially for the Minilogue , rather than revamping old circuit designs , and from what we 've heard so far it sounds excellent . Were hugely excited about it . We 've got one on the way , so expect a full review very soon . <p> Korg are also showing off a prototype of a new Volca unit . The Volca FM comes in a cheeky colour scheme inspired by the Yamaha DX range and features a three-voice FM synth engine with six operators per voice . What 's more , were told it can even load DX7 patches via SysEx . A great addition to the range . Price and availability to be confirmed but wed expect the RRP to be on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instruments &amp; Tom Oberheim <p> Following the unlikely alliance of Korg and ARP for the reissued Odyssey , it 's time for another couple of former rivals to team up . Dave Smith and Tom Oberheim have joined forces to create the OB-6 , based on the synth architecture of Oberheims classic SEM modules . At an RRP of $2,999 , the synth is n't as- expensive- as we might have feared , clocking in at the same price as Smiths own Prophet-6 . <h> TEENAGE ENGINEERING <p> The ever-intriguing Swedish company has introduced three new Pocket Operator synths . The- PO-20 Arcade , PO-24 Office and PO-28 Robot carry on where the previous models left off , introducing new sounds and ways of making music . All three are priced at $59 . Check out the PO-20 below and the rest of the new models here . <p> Meanwhile , over on their website , they 're teasing the new OP-Z , a " wireless 16 track multitimbral synthesiser- with fully sequenceable parameter locks , video synthesis- and the introduction of step components " More info on that one as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly hoping for a polyphonic version of Arturias much-loved MiniBrute , but they delivered something far more unexpected . The MatrixBrute is a monstrous monophonic beast " as flexible as a modular system but offering presets A- dream machine for everyone interested in creating a sound palette of their own . " Based around a huge 16+16 modulation matrix , the full spec looks seriously impressive . Its due on sale in spring but pricing is still to be confirmed. - Be warned : all those front panel controls are likely to come at a price . 
@@34419608 @3419608/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> My Studio <h> Ambivalent <h> Ambivalent My Studio <p> This is my studio . Its a small , small room in my apartment in Berlin . Exact dimensions are 2m x 2m . The room had previously been used as a home office space when I moved into the apartment in 2008 . Two of the walls were glass , so I covered the whole room in audio foam . Expensive but necessary . Thats made up for by the fact that there 's a second , false ceiling , and it only shares one wall with a neighbor , which happens to be made of a half-metre of brick . I cant figure out what the room was originally built for , but its managed to be a convenient ( if imperfect ) solution . <h> Related <h> 909 and Keyboard <p> These two old dogs do a lot of the work here . The Oxygen 8 is n't anything particularly special , but it does what I need it to do , and it 's been with me since the beginning . My studios not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands-on manipulation . The 909 is , well , everything anyone has ever said it is . I cant add much to the volumes of praise and lists of the historic contributions of this machine . I can pick a real 909 or 808 out of any mixdown I hear , and I guess that pushed my gearlust for it over the edge . It 's gotten a lot of use on the Delft material and some on the Amber stuff , but a lot of the unreleased material coming soon has it featured much more explicitly . <h> Related <h> Left Desk Rack <p> This rack is sort of the heart of the operation . Top to bottom , there 's a Neutrik patchbay , a MOTU Midi Express 128 , an Eventide H8000FW , a Universal 4-710d , a UAD Apollo Quad , a Dangerous Music D-Box , an Apogee Big Ben , and a Lexicon MX200 . <p> I 'm skipping the patchbay , as that 's about as sexy as my socks . The Midi Express is n't much sexier , but this is kind of a key part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trendy for interfaces to include MIDI I/O , but this is more robust and reliable , and obviously offers more options . <h> Related <h> Eventide H8000 &amp; Universal Audio 4-710d <p> Next after that is the Eventide . This is sort of like dating someone who is way out of your league , but just too gorgeous to resist . She was way too expensive , probably bad for my overall mental health , and a result of poor impulse control , but sweet ecstasy is she a heart-stopper . It just makes anything sound so glamorous . There are algorithms and DSP in this thing that can make a wet fart sound like Hans Zimmer got paid G30,000 to conduct it out of an orchestra . You can hear it quite clearly on my Amber track Waves of Grain or on my track Snowblind . I know its identifiable because my friend Nyma sent me a comment after one release with just " H8000 " written . He s a love . Hear it here . <p> The Universal Audio 4-710d might be the most irreplaceable piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 710 preamps , but have a phase-aligned pots to blend a tube pre-amp with a solid-state one . Each channel has a built-in 1176-style compressor , with just two time-constants . The fast kicks in at 5 ms and the slow comes in around 100 ms . This beast is really the source of the LA-4A stuff . Even the LA-4A name is a reference to that rich , raw , fat sound of that classic UREI gear . Though Ive always lusted after an LA-4 , itd be hard to beat this unit on quality and functionality . Like I said , any LA-4A track is marinated in this monsters juices , and then seasoned to taste . Hear it here . <p> The UAD Apollo is a solid , transparent and powerful interface . I 'm not crazy about some facets of how the I/O is apportioned , particularly the ADAT setup , but its all made up for by the incredible plugins . More on those later . <p> Below that is a Dangerous Music D-Box , which is relatively more flexible than how I currently use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my most crucial pieces , and adds so much to all my tracks . Using this for analogue summing changed my mixes dramatically about two years ago . Obviously I do n't  have space for a big console , but even if I did , I 'm not sure I 'd go to the effort . This gives me rich analogue summing , but requires a lot- less hassle . Someones gon na slate me for that , but none of this is a statement of superiority , just my personal situation . <p> The Apogee Big Ben runs Word Clock signal to the Apollo , the H8000 and the 4-710d . You cant hear it on anything , but you would definitely notice if it was n't there . A thankless watchman , keeping the realm in order , asking for no glory . I pour out my beer for you , Ben . Thank you for your service . <p> The Lexicon MX200 ai n't  as fancy as its more famous cousins , but its got all the same algorithms , and since I run it over S/PDIF , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense gets lost in the analogue/digital debates . The truth is , naturally , its all how you use it . This is an affordable , excellent piece of gear , and a great way to get some extra DSP and rich reverb . You can hear this on nearly all my records , including R U OK , which you can find here . <h> Related <h> Moog Minitaur <p> The Minitaur has some sort of evil magic that makes basses come out absolutely massive . I cant really say a lot more about what it does than to point at two tracks where it features heavily : tracks I made with Michael L Penman . Apt and Shimmer both have basslines that take over a room like a cloud of smoke . Serious air-pressure changes from this thing . Also nice to get that rich Moog ladder filter sound if you want it , or if you just want to rattle peoples organs . Hear it here . <h> Related <h> Desktop Synths <p> The Mopho is n't particularly special , but its been on a fair number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and analogue , but a nightmare to program or manipulate . <p> The Boss VT-1 is cheesy but fun . Back when I was doing pitched-down vocals , it could add a bit more grit , mainly because its pretty dirty . <p> The MXL mic is a cheap condenser I picked up early on when I started . Some clearance bargain or something . All my vocal tracks started there , such as this . <h> Related <h> Alesis iO Dock <h> Related <h> Elektron Analog Four <p> The Analog Four is something I 'd recommend to anyone looking for a versatile , powerful , connectible , feature-rich synth with a near-limitless set of capabilities . Its been on a ton of my stuff , most notably the bassline on the LA-4A track America Kid . <h> Related <h> Roland TB-303 <p> Some obscure Japanese thing I traded for a pack of gum and some old drink tickets . Nothing to see here . Please move along . <p> In all seriousness , I do n't know what to say about it . Owning one of these was a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , having it has been even better than I hoped it would be . It 's basically all over everything I 've made since I got it , and it never ceases to surprise and amaze me . <h> Related <h> Jomox AirBase 99 , Oberheim Matrix 1000 &amp; Korg Volca Keys <p> The Jomox AirBase 99 is a dope piece that 's often overlooked , and ultimately wound up discontinued . The desktop AirBase models get all the love , but this has all the same guts . Again , space is a premium in my studio , and before I got the 909 , this made all kinds of fat Roland-style drum sounds . Not as popular as a 707 , but way more analogue ; not as legendary as a 909 , but way more practical . <p> The Oberheim Matrix 1000 is my go-to poly . I never had the knack for that Oberheim sound , but once I got this , I understood why it made its way into so many studios . Its perfect for making something elegant , musical or weird . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amber alias , which you can find here . <p> In my opinion , the Korg Volca series synths are the inheritors of the Roland x0x units . Made for affordability and simplicity , they offer a lot of bang for their buck . You can hear this on my LA-4A track Flare here . <h> Related <h> Vermona DRM 1 Mk II <p> The next rack sits to my right while I 'm working , and I nearly always have a hand on this badboy , the Vermona DRM1 . Technically this is a Mark II , but it seems like it was the last stage before they switched to the Mark III . Its all-analogue , which would draw some comparisons to the 808 , but truthfully , its maybe the same species , but another animal . I usually end up patching this direct into the tube pre , because it can sound super raw when you push it hard . This one was pretty crucial to the Amber tracks , as well as my track Cartesia on the recent Ambivalent EP on Delft . <p> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual outs are TRS insert enabled . This means you can patch a voice out to an effect , and return it direct on the same channel to go back through the master output . Super handy for simple live effect , like pedals , as seen here with the Boss DD-6 . <p> One of the most distinguishing things about these units is the clap . Somewhere close to an 808 , and yet something else entirely . I used this clap constantly on all the Amber material I made last year . You can hear it really well on Keep It Gone here . <h> Related <h> Right Rack Continued <p> Next up is the Studio Electronics SE-1X . This is actually on loan to me , though I have n't used it in ages . Diverse and fat , Moog-style sounds . This made the bassline on Down , and the lead on Witchfinder here . <p> The next piece above that is a Novation A-Station . This was an update for the classic old Bass Station . This made the lead synth lines on all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last , but not least , this synth provides the most power for the lowest cost . Its a Freebase FB-383 . I got it in a pretty beat-up state for G80 , and it is one of the meanest , rawest , fattest things I 've ever heard . They made these as 303 emulations , but if you abuse it , it can do so much more . Evidence is on my track Red Ones here . <h> Related <h> Adam P11A Monitors <p> My monitors are the Adam P11As . They sound good , maybe a little too good . I compensate by placing them poorly in a haphazard and ineffective arrangement . I 'm clever like that . Being serious though , Ive seen people go nuts trying to perfect their room or buy fancy , overpriced monitors . No setup is better than the one you know , and have tested in combination with other rooms and systems . I 've never had a professional monitor setup , and here I am talking to Attack Magazine about my production . Local boy made good . Making something now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But maybe that 's my old punk rock roots showing . <h> Related <h> UAD Plugins <p> The UAD plugs are a massive part of my gear . Like I said , its not about digital versus analogue , its about smart choices about both . I 'm unlikely to ever get my hands on a Fairchild compressor , so you wo n't catch me snobbing on about the differences from the real gear . And its not just emulations the Brainworx mastering EQ has completely revamped my mixing chain . And I do n't  know anyone who has the budget or the real estate for an EMT 140 or 250 , but I 've got them both " or as close as I need to be to owning them . <h> Related <h> Floor cables <p> This is a picture of my floor . You can absolutely hear this on every one of my records , as the chaos , disorganisation , ambivalence and impatience represented in this tangle seeps out of every corner of my music . Ca n't stop , wo n't stop .

" - have become so ingrained in the canon of house music that they 're still played to this day . <p> You could easily argue that MKs early 90s production style is currently more in vogue than ever. - Having been lured out of self-imposed exile by Jamie Jones , Lee Foss and their Hot Creations crew , Marc finds himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from the likes of underground heroes Bicep and Huxley right up to the top of the charts with Disclosure and Duke Dumont . <p> MK destroys the cliche of the producer who lives and breathes dance music . He openly admits that he gave up on house in 1996 , when he moved to LA to work for Will Smith and produce pop hits for the likes of Rihanna , Jay-Z , Pitbull and Snoop Dogg . Finally , a decade and a half later , he s come home . <p> We managed to catch Marc at his London hotel between DJ gigs in Milan and Manchester for a chat about what modern producers can learn from his 90s production techniques , the new approach he took for his contribution to Defecteds In The House mix- series , - and why Hot Creations booked him to DJ at their party without realising that he did n't  actually know how to DJ . <p> Attack : So you were pretty much off the radar for over a decade as far as house music was concerned . For those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Marc Kinchen : Around 96 the scene started to slow down in New York a little bit . The sound started to change and what labels wanted from me started getting boring . I was dealing with a lot of major label remixes . They knew that this Nightcrawlers record I did was huge and they wanted every mix to kind of feel like that . If I turned in something that I thought was dope , theyd say , Well it does n't  sound like Nightcrawlers , though. I started getting a lot of that . I wanted to be this big Quincy Jones type of producer anyway , so I figured I should step away from dance and try to do more mainstream stuff . I wanted to be that producer- who everybody goes to and pays $80,000 a track . Doing house music was n't going to get me there , as far as what I thought back then. - I did n't  know how big dance music was going to be . <p> I decided to focus on writing songs and doing tracks that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jay Brown , who 's with Jay-Z right now . Jay managed me for a couple of years and got me on all the right projects . That 's how I ended up working with Quincy Jones , Snoop Dogg , Jay-Z and a bunch of big artists straight away . But then , you know , the grass is always greener on the other side . So once I got to the other side I 'm like , Ohhh , this is n't that fun ! When the dance thing started coming back in my direction , the time was right . The sound started getting back to where I could jump back in and at least try to fit in . That 's kind of where it turned . <p> I wanted to be that producer who everybody goes to and pays $80,000 a track . <p> Its funny that you talk about fitting in because the kind of sound that you were doing back in 96 has come back around all over again . It must feel kind of like coming back home for you ? <p> Yeah , its weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left but when I came back the sound was my thing . So its almost like I 've been stuck in a tomb for a while . I 'm like , Oh , OK . This is cool . This is just where I left off . I can still use my old equipment ! <p> You did n't  keep up with house while you were working on other stuff ? <p> Not at all . Its funny because a couple of years ago Jamie Jones and Lee Foss dug me up . They obviously knew who I was and they assumed that I was kind of just hanging around . They asked me to DJ at a Hot Creations party with them . This was in 2010 , I think . I had no idea who they were . My manager , Marcy , told me they were really cool and that I should do it . That was kind of my foot back into it from the 90s . It feels like I 've been in a coma . <p> So it just felt right straight away ? <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rust off and start to be current with what 's being played again , production-wise . After that first year I felt right at home . <p> And you 've worked quite a lot with the Hot Creations guys over the last couple of years ? <p> Its been really good . After I did that party with them they told me they had a new single coming out called Forward Motion and they wanted me to remix it . I do n't  think I listened to the stems for like four or five months . Like I said , when they asked me I did n't  even know who they were . So then by the time the summer came around , the song came out . I was even playing the song . Then I looked back at my stems and I was like , Oh shit , this is the song they wanted me to remix . This is a really cool song ! Because the originals so great I wanted to do a mix which did the original justice .

Its potentially for the Hot Natured album but I do n't  know what I did that 's on there . I know I have songs with them. - Lee and I work a lot together . I think we 've done about four projects together . We worked on the EP with Anabel Englund , then we decided to start a group called Pleasure State , which is the three of us .

Kristan Caryl talks to artists and DJs including Bicep , Todd Edwards , Larry Heard , Brendon Moeller , DJ Pierre and Eats Everything to find out . <p> Bicep : " A lot more people in their early 20s understand who Kerri Chandler is now than they did 3 years ago . " <p> You do n't  have to be an industry insider to notice that were treading water in an endless sea of revivalism . From fiery forum debates to fierce Facebook rants , adoringly received re-issues to reformed retro acts , a casual observer of dance music might understandably argue that our creative reserves have run dry . They probably have n't ( yet ) " there 's still plenty of genuinely original new music to be found in every electronic sub-genre " but certainly some of the most popular movements of the last 12 months have been all too familiar for those of a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerseys Zanzibar club in 92 , there 's a good chance that by now you 've lived and relived the 90s house experience so many times it feels trite , tired and testing . <p> And that 's just one style of dance music ; similar retro movements have mined everything from Detroit techno to grime for inspiration . We 've even seen hints of a revivalist old-school dubstep scene emerging , looking back less than a decade to the good old days of FWD and DMZ . <p> Of course , there is a good side to all this revivalism in that it allows a new generation of fans to discover the classics . As Bicep put it , " a lot more people in their early twenties understand who Kerri Chandler is now than they did three years ago " .

Why does revivalism occur ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? We spoke to a range of early- innovators , late adopters and genre pin-ups to find out . <p> There comes a time when enough is enough , and it seems that time is now . <h> " Its always been about cycles " <p> In many cases , revivals are brought about by the newest generation of producers " teenagers giddy with excitement as they discover music they were too young to experience first time round . For Altern8 founder Mark Archer , the reasons why the process keeps repeating itself are obvious : " Kids get into music and look back to stuff their older brothers were into . Theyve often been brought up on the music of their parents , so when they get into production that 's what they turn to . Even when I was into funk and soul in the mid to late 80s , there was a guy called- Ben Liebrand- whod remix Hot Chocolate from only ten years previous . Its always been about cycles . " <p> Chicago house icon Larry Heard certainly seems to agree , readily admitting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was largely an attempt to imitate existing disco sounds using the synths and drum machines which were available to him . " It was easier and harder back then , " he explains . " You were starting with a blank slate . There was n't a concept of new music in my head , it was more just a stripped-down interpretation of the disco music we were hearing that I was trying to make , " he says before adding the crucial detail . " The reason it sounded so different was because it was made with machines rather than a full orchestra . " <p> Brendon Moeller : " In order to come up with something new , you need to first master what others have mastered . " <p> Garage pioneer Todd Edwards agrees that all new producers start making music by imitating the artists that inspire them , and admits to taking big cues from Masters At Work , Todd Terry , MK and Enya , whilst dub techno godfather Brendon Moeller cites The Orbs Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld- as his day dot. - " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , you end up trying out everybody elses tricks , " says Moeller . " In order to come up with something new , you need to first master what others have mastered , just like Hendrix and The Rolling Stones spent ten years playing the blues then came out the other side so fluid and free to create . For newcomers it becomes a rush when you fucking finally get your bassline to sound like Rhythm &amp; Sound and get nice cavernous reverb and the right texture . You tend not to realise that this is only the first step and you must go on to make it your own rather than leave it where it is . " <p> In order to be able to do that you need to learn the language , to develop your own voice , and in turn to start your own conversation . As Pittsburgh Track Authority member Thomas Cox puts it : " People with a first grade level of education are going to speak and write like first graders , while those with PhDs will speak and write like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music ? " <p> Playing around with instruments and production tools is all part of this process , but Heard believes it starts much earlier , with a musical education . " I started buying 45s when I was nine or ten years old , " he says . " Because you only a have few you play them over and over and over , which means you 're studying the production without knowing it . I 'm pretty much home-schooled by listening to the records I bought . I had artists that I would practise a song of theirs for my own personal development . I was appreciating a whole lot of different people ; I was n't just focussed on one . " <p> Paul Woolford : " Only do what brings pleasure . " <p> The enduring stylistic chameleon that is Paul Woolford believes that taking pleasure from what you do is key , not only when starting out , but forevermore . Rather than toiling away trying to recreate that exact hi-hat pattern , just jam : " I started in my teenage years with home keyboards , basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You just do what gives you pleasure at that age , and this is basically all you need to keep in mind forever : - only do what brings pleasure . " <p> If anyone can give out advice on how to be original , how to go from being a slavish ape to a lone ranger , it is surely acid patriarch DJ Pierre . " I do n't  think you should set out to create your own sound , " he says . " That way it becomes too heady ; there 's no heart or soul . I think great sounds and styles happen naturally , from within , not from outside in . Once you understand who you are as an artist then you can accomplish so much . We were created to create . "

What 's less often discussed is the impact on clubs and the DJs who play in them . <p> Just a few years ago , even the most hardcore vinyl DJs- had to contend with poor vinyl setups in clubs. - You 've likely heard- the horror stories many times over : " We turned up and the decks were being used as a CDJ stand , " they cry . " How can we play on 1210s with no needles ? " So , given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the resurgence of the format- manifesting itself in booths around the world ? And if so , have said nightspots started to up their game in response ? In speaking to vinyl freaks Soul Clap , and clubs that range from small and intimate to large and cavernous , we hope to find out- more about the current state of club vinyl systems , whether vinyl really works as- well as digital in club environments and exactly how booths and sound systems are fine-tuned for optimal playback . <p> Starting with a club known for doing things the right way , Fabric 's technical manager Sanjeev Bhardwaj opens with an obvious point , but one that clearly evades many : " The club is set up and tailored to every DJ , " he says . " This is done by asking for their tech specs before the night . " Although it 's not actually possible to tailor a sound system for a specific format , he concedes that " all medians have to be considered and accounted for on their own merits . Everything must sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me wrong , I cant make a 128kbs MP3 sound as good as vinyl , otherwise I would be loaded . " <p> As a larger and more spacious club , one of the main potential pitfalls of Fabrics- setup might be feedback , but the booths have been set up and built in a way that minimises that as much as possible . " There are many things we consider , from turntable setup to the positioning of turntables and what they rest on . All our turntables use the Isonoe feet- and that 's a major upgrade that helps with feedback and stability . " <p> Depending on who is playing and when , Fabric will cater as much as possible to a certain DJ 's requirements . Recently , for example , Sanj completely stripped the booth in Room One to accommodate Richie Hawtin and all his hyper-specific kit , but he himself says that despite all the technological advancements and the budget he has available to him to fine-tune the Fabric system , he still prefers vinyl and thinks it 's the way to go when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nothing will ever beat the sound of crackling vinyl to me " staring at it and hoping it wo n't skip is part of the fun of DJing , " he reckons . " When I set up for Serato and Traktor , it just brings in one extra element to the chain " a computer . These crash every now and then . Vinyl , on the other side , is what it is : if kept clean , it works every time . " And with that Sanj touches on the problem he encounters most when dealing with DJs that play vinyl . <p> nothing will ever beat the sound of crackling vinyl " staring at it and hoping it wo n't skip is part of the fun of DJing <p> " The only recurring problems are simple to resolve : clean your records before playing them ! How a vinyl DJ can turn up to a club without a record cleaner still baffles me , but luckily we have one or two in the club . " <p> At the opposite end of the scale is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a handful of people and is primarily set up for DJs to spin records . " To me it 's the perfect medium for playing music , " says proprietor Jacob Kelly . " I have n't anything against other formats , but I just prefer everything about vinyl . You know that when you buy a piece of wax its been through a long process to get it sounding right . I prefer playing with it as it 's more tactile and I have more of a relationship with it due to storing it all around my house ! " <p> The booth in The 212 is a beautifully hand crafted , boutique affair- with custom slots for everything . " I designed it around playing vinyl first , but every surface in the booth has its own purpose for controllers , CD wallets , record in and out " boxes and places for laptops . I wanted it to be as user friendly as possible , and of a very high quality . I have owned an Urei 1620 rotary mixer and three-band isolator for some years now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mint Technics 1200s and CDJ1000s that will soon be upgraded to CDJ2000s . I use Ortofon Concorde carts , the decks are on stabilisers and there is no feedback at The 212 . As for the soundsystem , it was hand pieced together by me . The tops are vintage d&amp;b horns , the subs are Funktion One but in specialised cabinets , and there 's a sub in the DJ booth along with a normal monitor . The most important thing is making sure that everything you have works to its best quality : there 's no point having all the equipment but- having a dodgy lead or shit needles .

My dad was only trying to make a point to me because of the dark , low place I was in my life at that time . Life is full of ups and downs . I hope the album will be a source of encouragement for those who listen and appreciate this idea . <p> Why so long since the last album ? What kick started you to write this one and what has changed in your life , how have your tastes and skills evolved , since the last one ? <p> I just felt it was time to release a body of work that represents an idea bigger than myself . It 's not about promoting Terrence Parker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope and inspiration . In today 's world we all need some encouragement . Musically the sound is more mature . I think those who have been following my music over the years will be able to notice the growth in my sound . <p> Was there an idea in your head of how you wanted it to sound from the start ? Was it written as a complete album ? It seems a very polished and poised collection . <p> Thank you for your kind compliment . Yes , it is actually a collection of music recorded over a period of one year . I did n't  set out to make an album from start to finish " instead it was created over time by God leading me through each production . <p> It 's not about promoting Terrence Parker . Instead it 's the idea of sharing music and lyrics of hope and inspiration . In today 's world we all need some encouragement . <p> The album seems to have a very accessible , pop friendly sheen to it " was that ever intentional or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess it is just the way the music came out .

Why do you find solace in such beliefs , and have they ever been questioned ? <p> That 's a first . I have never heard anyone say such track titles were old-school ! I would n't say I am a religious person . By definition , one could religiously go to Starbucks every morning to get a coffee .

Is that a reflection of the lives of the people who make it , do you think , or more a quest to be credible , cool and edgy ? <p> House music has its roots in gospel as well as many other genres but I think in some ways the feel-good factor has been overlooked as the years have gone by and house has expanded to so many forms and styles . The music has always been there , however other forms of the music have gained more attention ( perhaps because of our current culture ) . The truth is most people who go out to clubs are going to enjoy themselves and to escape the trials and tribulations of everyday life .

Oliver Curry explains how to add a hint of that classic Studio 54 vibe to your own house tracks . <p> As one of the funkiest forms of house music , disco house has its roots firmly planted in disco itself , soul and funk . In this edition of Passing Notes we 'll examine two simple melodic techniques used in writing a classic disco bassline and explain how they can be applied to disco house tracks in order to give a truly authentic funky groove . <p> Let 's start by taking a look at a classic disco bassline . We 'll focus on Sister Sledge 's 1979 hit He 's The Greatest Dancer ' , written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic : <p> Focussing on the intro , here 's what Edwards ' bassline looks like when sequenced : <p> Like a huge number of disco basslines , this one is based around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale omitting the 2nd and 6th notes . Omitting the 2nd and 6th notes of the full minor scale gives the minor pentatonic a slightly bluesy feel . It sounds like this : <h> Leading notes <p> The minor pentatonic scale is a great starting point for a disco house bassline , but in this case things are slightly more complex . You 'll notice that the bassline also contains the notes C# and F# . These notes ( highlighted in red ) are not in the natural minor scale , but are known as leading notes ( sometimes also referred to as leading tones ) . <p> You can see that the red notes are all one semitone below the note which follows , leading up to the next note in the scale . The table below shows the pentatonic scale in yellow , the leading notes in red : <p> Using the pentatonic minor scale with added leading notes , let 's bring the theory into a modern disco house context . Check out the simple bassline sequenced below , with the leading notes again highlighted in red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the following note , a semitone higher , while some lead down the scale . <p> And , for comparison , check out how the bassline sounds if we replace the leading notes with the nearest note in the standard minor pentatonic scale . We can clearly hear that removing the leading notes detracts from the character and movement of the bassline . <p> A working knowledge of minor pentatonic scales and leading notes might not get you to quite the same level as a legend like Bernard Edwards , but these simple tricks will help inject your basslines with a hint of authentic disco credibility . <h> Related <p> Author Oliver Curry 18th July , 2012 <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507

@@34419630 @3419630/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Columns <h> Thomas Cox : Should We Be So Festive ? <p> Thomas Cox- explores the problems with the growing influence of festivals and argues that we should choose to attend- events that support the long-term health of- dance music . <p> The summer is upon us , and festival season is once again in full swing . As the years go by , these festivals are becoming more and more a part of underground dance music , whether that- be through more generalised music festivals booking dance acts or the increasing numbers of dance-specific events . Despite their popularity , it seems as though very little is thought about the long-term effects this might have on the music , or on the social role- festival culture might play . Now , with the number of music festivals reaching an all-time peak , seems like a good time to dig into some of these ideas . <p> Some people might argue that bigger crowds and wider exposure are necessarily bad things , but I do n't agree . <p> One of the most positive aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of festivals in and of themselves . People clearly have come to enjoy this method of presentation , leading to huge attendances at established festivals and thus even bigger exposure ( and of course paychecks ) for artists . Some people might argue that bigger crowds and wider exposure are- necessarily bad things , but I do n't agree . Dating back to the beginnings of techno and house , mainstream media like FM radio was a huge " and very positive " influence on dance music culture . The exposure DJs and artists receive from festivals could have a similarly positive impact , but the key to ensuring it- has the best results is in the quality of the presentation as well as the integrity of the music being presented . This is where perhaps the biggest problems with festivals come in . <p> The presentation of dance music is a major aspect of how the music is meant to be consumed , from soundsystems to lighting and the rest of the surrounding- environment . How many of the people running festivals understand- how to present dance music properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance music they 're quite simply the most important element after the music itself . Festival soundsystems can never compare to a well-tuned club system , while the placement of a festival stage in an acoustically poor location can ruin even the best soundsystem . When compared to the heavily planned and expertly executed infrastructures of the best clubs around the world , it 's easy to see how even some of the best and most knowledgeable festivals can still encounter problems in presenting dance music properly . <p> EDM has pretty much sold itself on the ' stadium ready ' nature of its music and experience . <p> Another hallmark of dance music is the way in which individual performances are consumed . Ideally , a DJ set should be an extended affair , giving the artist time to create an atmosphere and take the crowd on a journey . This is defeated by the typical festival setup in a number of ways . When there are many stages playing music at one time , this can lead to DJs trying to play more hype music to compete with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue is the tendency for festivals to book name artists in volume , reducing their set length , which also leads to the " all bangers all the time " mentality . Just this week , the backlash against Ricardo Villalobos 's set at Cocoon in the Park shows the results of a DJ who is n't interested in playing that- game . I 'm no fan of Mr Villalobos , but this set of his would n't have elicited anything like this response in a typical dance music setting . <p> EDM has pretty much sold itself on the stadium ready nature of its music and experience . Aside from a handful of exceptions , underground dance music repeatedly tries to distance itself from this , but to me it seems like festivals are the primary factor which could push more underground music- into a similar style of consumption . Its already well known that there 's often a difference between what a big name DJ would play at a festival mainstage and what they would play in a nightclub " what does that say about the festival experience if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper dance music setting ? I 'm not much of a believer in the gateway drug theory of dance music , which states that people will hear and enjoy bad music and eventually find their way to better things . Hitting people- with the best music , - presented as well as possible , is the best way- to create new lifelong fans of dance music . <p> At the top of the bill you 'll often find the most unimaginative , dull and undeserving names . Are you comfortable with those artists being the ambassadors for dance music ? <p> This is all before we actually arrive at the artists being booked for a lot of these festivals . Sure , the festivals at the top of the game are undoubtedly giving some opportunities to up-and-coming artists as well as the truly deserving artists in underground dance genres . But at the top of the bill for many festivals youll- often find the most unimaginative , dull and- undeserving names " and that goes for many of the bigger European festivals as well as the obvious North American examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dance music , playing to huge crowds of people who might not really know much about it ? <p> Finally , we arrive at the type of people attracted to music festivals . Aside from fans who are looking to get value for their money in seeing many name artists on one bill , you 're also going to get lots of inexperienced young partygoers . These kids- know that festivals are good places to get fucked up on drugs while away from their parents . The symbiotic nature of illicit substances and dance music is not something that can be denied , so I 'm not going to sit here and condemn their usage , but frequent news reports of- teenagers overdosing at electronic music festivals- are- not going to do any favours for dance music 's future , nor its ability to be taken seriously by anyone other than anti-drug authorities . There 's clearly a much bigger debate around this- problem , but having watched the demise- of the American rave scene due to exactly this issue , I can tell you that in the end it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that type of negative media coverage than- the short-term money and publicity are worth . Our house and techno cultures here in the US are only- now starting to really become a force , over a decade and a half on from the death of the rave scene . <p> When choosing which festivals to- support this and every other festival season , I urge you to think about these issues . Consider- how this will all play out for the music you love and the people behind it . If you 're in the music for the long run , this should all be very important to you . The long-term impact of festival culture may not be as positive as the short-term boom would suggest . <p> Thomas Cox has been causing trouble on teh interwebs since 1996 and representing Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania since birth .

@@34419633 @3419633/ <h> Passing Notes <h> Lessons From Disco <p> Dance music theory expert Oliver Curry examines how classic disco uses chord inversions and careful placement of instruments to great effect , and explains how the same principles can be applied to virtually any genre . <p> In this edition of Passing Notes were focussing on disco chords , but the lessons well learn do n't  just apply to disco ( or even , necessarily , just to chords ) . - The classic disco chord sound is not only characterised by the notes used in constructing the chord but also by its voicing and timing " the placement of the chord in the bar and its rhythmic interaction with other elements . Its these techniques which well examine to understand how they add groove and feel to the chord progression . <h> Voicing and inversion <p> The term voicing is used to describe the arrangement of the notes within a chord . As with a lot of dance music , the primary chords we hear used in disco tracks are minor and major triads and 7s , which we discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of how different voicings can be applied , we 've written a simple piano chord progression in the key of C minor : Cm7 , Fm7 , Abmaj7 , Ebmaj7 . <p> In this first example we can see the chords are all constructed in root position , using the root of the chord as the bass note ( played in two octaves ) , then the 3rd , 5th and 7th in ascending pitch order . <p> The human ear tends to hear the highest notes in a chord progression as a form of melody . We can see that the top notes of our chords make large jumps , which could make our progression sound a little disjointed . <p> The solution to this potential problem is to voice the chords differently and use chord inversions . A chord can be said to be inverted when the lowest note is n't the root ( were treating the root note an octave down as a separate bass note rather than part of the chord played by the right hand ) . A simple example would be a C major triad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ( as opposed to the standard C , E , G ) . By moving the C up an octave we 've created an inversion . We also examined this technique in our Breakdown feature on Tensnakes Coma Cat . <p> Below , we 've voiced the same chord progression differently , inverting chords so that the changes in the perceived melody line do n't  stand out so much . This technique is useful whenever a chord progression needs to feel more relaxed , or whenever you want to shift attention away from the implied melody of the chords and onto another instrument or a vocal . <p> Each chord played comprises the same notes as it did previously , and the chord names are all the same . The difference here is that some notes already playing in the left hand part have been removed from the right hand ( i.e. the C and Eb in the first and last chords ) . Also we can see and hear - how the inversion of the second- chord , Fm7 , allows the F to be the highest note in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chord voicing and inversions , let 's look at Sister Sledges Lost In Music " written by Chics Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards " to see how this simple technique can help maintain continuity . <p> This is how the basic piano chords are played in the tracks verses , starting at 1:06 : <p> The chords are Dm7 , C , Gm-&gt;G , Bbmaj7 , C , Dm7 . The G chord- slides from a minor to major 3rd , a technique commonly used in jazz , gospel , blues and soul. - Note again how the highest notes of each chord form a tighter , closer progression than they would if the chords were formed in the root position . In root position the chords would look and sound like this : <p> We can hear how the chords played in root position have a loose , disjointed and less natural feel . Voicing the chords to sit in a smaller frequency range also gives other instrumental parts more room in the mix . <h> Related <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while inversions refer to what part of the chord is on the bottom , the specific term for voicing the melodic lines so that they are n't  disjointed is " voice leading " . You 'll find this a lot in baroque/classical music and ( as Oliver points out in this article ) still applies today . I also think contrary motion is really cool and adds a lot of interest . ( When your bass line goes down and your melody goes up or vice versa . ) <p> Oliver can you make a tutorial or give tips about how to make those disco strings that play at the beginning of each bar ? What notes should be played ? What sort of attack/release or compression creates an authentic feel ? Ca n't quite get them right . <p> Thank you ! I was always unsure about where to invert the chords ! I always thought it was , as you put it , " sit in a smaller frequency range " .

Plus : an exclusive stream of Waves Of Grain , the title track from his new EP . <p> For many producers , a long-term deal at a major independent label sounds like the holy grail : the security of an agreement to release all music on one imprint , the support of a consistent team and the strength in numbers which comes from being surrounded by high-profile artists all pulling in the same direction . <p> Those benefits are all true to some extent , but the reality is n't always entirely positive . <p> Kevin McHugh had been associated with Richie Hawtins Minus label " and the broader collective of artists around it " for nearly a decade , having joined the fold through his work on the Plastikman live show . McHugh quietly left Minus to work with other labels and announced this month that he s also leaving the Clonk booking agency ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We grabbed Kevin for a chat about the reasons he no longer felt Minus was the best place for him , the pros and cons of being associated with such a high-profile label , - and his new house-focused project , Amber ( check out an exclusive stream of the new Amber material below ) . <p> Attack : Let 's kick off by discussing the fact that you 've left Richie Hawtin 's Minus collective , which you 'd been associated with for pretty much the whole of your career as Ambivalent . What were the reasons behind the move ? <p> Kevin McHugh : I actually left Minus at the end of 2012 . With the structure the label had for many years , the only way to work with other labels was to leave the core group . I had agreed when I signed to the label in late 2006 to give music exclusively to Minus , in return for a management-type arrangement . When I left , I told Rich that I was n't going to go out and make a big show of leaving , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a personal decision and I did n't  feel the need to announce that I was doing something most techno artists do , which is work with multiple labels. - We decided I would continue with his booking agency as it just made sense for everyone . Since then , I 've put out two EPs on Octopus , a collaborative EP with Michael L Penman on Ovum , a compilation track on Cocoon and remixes on Turbo , Octopus and Greta . A lot of it has built on what I was doing before I left the label , but lately I 'm starting to expand into sounds and projects I could n't release before I left . <p> Was there something specific that spurred the decision or was it something you 'd been considering for a while ? <p> I 'd been struggling for a while to balance my own artistic goals with the trajectory of the label . For a long time it still made sense to find the crossovers between what I wanted to make , and where Minus was going . But I seemed to keep missing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapping a lot of my music in order to stay part of it . The label exists to represent Rich and his goals , and I understand that . When I first joined the group it seemed to be much more about developing the artists whod been signed , but eventually I reached a point where it started to feel that I was forgoing too many other opportunities to stay with the group . I think one of the hardest parts of leaving has been separating from the other artists involved . Guys like Hobo , Matador- and- Gaiser have been some of my dearest friends and artists I deeply admire , and it was quite difficult to adjust to the idea that I wont play shows with them much any more . But friendships last much longer than most things in the music business , so I 'm sure I 'll see them a lot . <p> The only way to work with other labels was to leave the core group ... I did n't feel the need to announce it . <p> Were there times when you felt unfairly pigeonholed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure I can say its unfair because anyone who signs to a label that big should know they 're trading a bit of their identity for a piece of a bigger platform , although I did n't  really think it would be so when I joined . Maybe that was naive , but it was also a different time then . But yeah , I often felt it was a struggle to get people to see my work on its own , instead of just seeing it as being authored by the label . I do n't  think that 's a situation unique to me , or to Minus . I would imagine that if you spoke to artists on a lot of the more successful collective labels , youd hear that they struggle with having joined to develop themselves as artists , and ultimately find they 're just a part of someone elses larger vision . <p> I think its something that 's become a big focus of audiences , and its really particular to this music . When the drummer from Slayer plays a solo show , fans do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there seems to be this focus on the branding and packaging of music so much that you see reviews of music saying things like " itd be great if it was n't on label " or talking about a record as though it had been made by the label , barely even mentioning the artist . <p> Anyone who signs to a label that big should know they 're trading a bit of their identity for a piece of a bigger platform . <p> Are there other downsides to being involved in such a major collective and label ? Fitting into release schedules , for instance ? <p> To focus only on the downsides would probably make it look like its completely negative . In truth , I grew a lot because of my involvement with Minus , and the negatives only outweighed the positives at the end of the story . But yes , there are a lot of things that are n't  apparent from the outside which become difficult , just as there are a lot of things going on behind the curtains in anyones life . Release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a years release calendar can get filled before everyone has a chance to get on . It happens everywhere , but when that outlet is your only option , and when taking your music elsewhere would mean leaving your agency , your friends and everything else you 've worked for , the pressure is rather strong . And a label with one person at the helm who is so busy with their own ambitious schedule ca n't really look after the artists as well . A lot of these labels are steered by very successful artists themselves , and everyone associated with them will benefit , but everything in the group is directed up to the top of the chain . Its just impossible to stay under that type of setup and call your own tune .

Yes . OK then .

Everyone knows that with the advancements in technology this has opened the door for many more people to consume , produce , listen to and not often enough buy music . Yes , there are still some people that buy their records ! Because anyone in the world with a computer and an internet connection has access to an incredibly large virtual music shop this has seen clubland adapt massively from the days when vinyl was the sole medium for DJs to perform with . It was often the norm that only a select few had access to certain records months before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-inch that drove dancefloors insane . <p> Nowadays promoters do n't  book DJs , they book artists , so unless you 've had a string of steady releases on respected labels or have been lucky enough to have one track PRed to fuck and blow up the blogosphere or dance music publications you 're going to find it hard to get regular gigs or make a career out of electronic music . I 'm not saying this is a bad thing and I 'm not saying that this is a good thing , its simply the way the world is in 2012 and you have to be able to adapt to how the times of changed or get left behind . <p> Nowadays promoters do n't book DJs , they book artists <p> You asked me if DJ culture is under threat and clubbing becoming stale . Well , DJ culture , clubbing and in fact our very own day-to-day life culture is just evolving . Whether you decide to evolve with its up to you . Personally what I consider a good DJ to be is a record collector that manages to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a promoter thinks a good DJ is someone worth booking purely on the merit that they will bring x amount of people to a club due to their track being a Beatport top seller then thatss up to them .

@@34419640 @3419640/ <h> Realistic Analogue Synths in NI Massive <p> Synth Secrets is a series of programming tutorials in which we show how to make a range of classic and new synth sounds using plugins such as Massive , Sylenth and Diva . <p> Digital soft synths are routinely criticised for exhibiting a stale or lifeless sonic character , particularly when compared to the classic analogue synths of the 70s and 80s . However , digital synths can be just as expressive as their much-exalted hardware counterparts . Sometimes you just have to work a little harder to get there . <p> In this instalment of- Synth Secrets , were going to demonstrate this by applying just a few tricks and tweaks to a preset designed within Native Instruments ' Massive. - Heres the sound were aiming for : <h> Step 1 <p> Our base preset uses all three of Massive 's oscillators , with the Reducer ' , Electric ' and Vulgar ' waveforms selected in OSC1 , OSC2 and OSC3 respectively . Were- keeping OSC1 and OSC2- at root pitch , then pushing OSC3- up an- octave . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as to thicken things up . <p> The sound is pretty lifeless at the moment , so let 's move swiftly on to injecting some movement and energy into it . <h> Step 2 <p> Well start by- experimenting with- Massives filter section , loading- up an instance of the Daft ' filter on the first of its two slots . This- is a low-pass filter type , so we can use it to gradually pull away the upper harmonics in the- sound . <p> We do this by dropping the ENV1 modulation source onto Filter 1s- cutoff modulation slot , setting the- cutoff to around 10 o'clock , increasing- modulation and resonance , then beginning to shape the envelope itself . Here 's how this sounds : <p> We 've quickly added some flow to the chords , which start off reasonably brightly then darken up over the course of their note durations . We can add some extra resonant warmth by putting Massive 's filters in series , meaning the sound will be fed from Filter 1 into Filter 2 . <p> We select the Daft filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modulation amount as shown below . <h> Step 3 <p> We can add even more movement and analogue-style instability to- the sound by taking advantage of an acoustic phenomenon known as beating ' , wherein two identically pitched sounds are detuned from one another , resulting in a subtle phasing effect . <p> You do n't need to detune the oscillators by much to get the effect , so well- push- the pitch of OSC2- down by just 2 cents and OSC3- up by 1 cent . You can hear the beating even with this- subtle detuning in place : <p> For- an even stronger effect than this , we- can use Massive 's Unisono function to add detuned- copies of our- three base oscillators . This will give us- a much fuller sound to work with. - To do this , well set- the detune amount to 6 cents and drag- the slider slowly- to the right until we- hit a sweet spot " in this case , - somewhere around- 15% of the full amount works well : <h> Step 4 <p> Things are starting to shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and weight . Firstly , within the same Voicing tab , we can turn on the Wavetable Position function and push the slider up to around 40% . <p> Every selectable wavetable within Massive actually contains a blend of waveforms , which you can move- through using the Wt-position dial on each- oscillator . The Wavetable Position setting- within the Voicing tab separates out the individual wavetable positions for the oscillators per Unisono layer , so we can end up with a much fuller effect resulting from the blend of different waveforms , rather than simple duplicates of the three base oscillators . <p> Were- also going to add some bass EQ and a touch of treble , as well as- increasing the- Feedback setting- to around 9 o'clock , which feeds some of the output of the three base oscillators back into the amplifier section . This adds weight as well as muddying the sound , so you need to be careful with the amount " a little mud is a good thing for our purposes here , but we do n't  want to go overboard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two effects inserts , plus further subtle distortion from the Phase Modulation Oscillator , gives us this : <h> Step 5 <p> Now that we 've got a fuller spectral- distribution to our- sound , we also want- to give it some stereo width . Going back to the Voicing tab , we can dial in a subtle Pan Position shift to the left , which spreads out our- Unisono layers from the centre of the stereo image , widening the sound just a touch . <p> Adding a bit of Massive 's Reverb Small ' and Chorus Ensemble ' send effects helps to place the sound in a small virtual space , as well as bringing up some welcome warble to the phases of all the oscillator signals present . Here 's how things are shaping up now : <h> Step 6 <p> Finally , Massive offers up some interesting modulation options that are dependent on the MIDI notes being used to trigger it , giving you expressive control to change the sound it produces per note . <p> Weve- added a small amount- of velocity sensitivity to key areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts , as well as the random function . This introduces true unpredictability to the sound , giving you a different result every time a new note is triggered were- using it pretty subtly here but it helps to give the sound more of a life of its own . <p> To- heighten the warbly , tape-style flutter effect here , weve- added some simple LFO modulation to the pitches of the three oscillators , from 65 up to 125 cents , and were- controlling the speed of the LFO with another LFO plus a little random modulation . This makes sure the- vari-speed effect will shift and change from note to note , rather than remaining a static modulation . <p> Dialling in just a little bit of tape noise to finish things off gives us the final result : <p> So , there you go : six steps is all that 's between you and warm , expressive and sort-of-analogue sound . The results are a long way from the typically cold , harsh sounds associated with digital synths.

@@34419643 @3419643/ <h> Passing Notes <h> Deep House Chords <p> Our composition expert explains a simple technique which will help you create deep house chord progressions with ease . <p> Practically every genre of music relies on its own set of techniques , tricks and quick cheats to help create a distinctive sound . One of the trademark characteristics of deep house is its use of jazz-influenced minor and major 7chords , helping to give tracks a strong chord-led feel . In this article we 'll explain exactly what 7 chords are , how to construct them and finally how to use them in your own productions . <p> A 7 chord contains the root note , the 3rd , the 5th and the 7th of the scale . Going back to basics , a scale can either be major or minor . The difference between major and minor scales can be seen and heard here : <p> The presence of the major or minor 3rd determines which note forms the corresponding 7th of the chord . As shown above , in a natural C minor scale , the 7th is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7th is B. So , the C major 7 chord would contain C , E , G and B : <h> 7s in deep house <p> Let 's put this theory into practice with a very basic four-bar deep house loop . In our first example we hear just two chords : an F major 7 and an E minor 7 . Here in the piano roll for the loop we 've colour-coded the notes : root ( purple ) , 3rd ( blue ) , 5th ( yellow ) and 7th ( green ) . <h> Masters at Work <p> Now let 's look at a more complex example . This time , we 'll focus on the MAW Dub mix of Masters At Work 's deep house classic To Be In Love , first released in 1997 and remixed and re-released countless times since . <p> Here we 've transcribed the string loop from the intro , colour-coded as before : root , 3rd , 5th , 7th . Notes highlighted in red are n't in the basic chords , but are added on top to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , we can see that the basis for this chord progression is the sequence F minor 7 , Ab major 7 , C minor 7 . To make the progression cleaner and easier to follow , we could even get away with deleting some of the notes : <p> All the chords are still constructed using the root , minor 3rd , 5th and minor 7th , but we can see that the structure has been changed slightly . For the A minor 7 chords , we 've moved the 7th down an octave . Altering the chords ' structure in this way keeps the notes closer together , helping the loop flow ' and creating the descending E , D , C melody on top . <p> To help you get started creating your own progressions , here 's a list of all possible major 7 chords . To convert any of them into the minor 7 chord of the same root , simply lower both the 3rd and 7th a semitone . <p> Adding a few 7 chords into your progressions is one of the simplest tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house feel . <h> Related <p> Author Oliver Curry 27th June , 2012 <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507 
@@34419644 @3419644/ <h> Creative Distortion <p> Distortion is one of the fundamental signal processing tools we have at our disposal . Mix expert Bruce Aisher explains how we can use distortion effects in musically creative ways . <p> In its broader signal processing sense , distortion is the generic term for virtually anything which changes the shape of a signal , usually in an undesirable way . However , in audio terms " and especially in production terms " it generally refers to the deliberate introduction of an effect or process which shapes the wave and makes the sound somehow dirtier . <p> Any audio system ( whether analogue or digital ) has a limit to the signal levels it can comfortably handle . Attempting to push a signal beyond that limit will usually result in distortion . In some cases " such as most valve-based circuits and many solid-state analogue circuits " the resulting distortion is generally perceived as quite a pleasant sound . At very low levels , that could be something like tape saturation or a warm overdrive effect created by gently pushing an analogue circuit . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distortion . <p> Digital distortion tends to be harsher , rougher and less pleasing to the ear ( but that does n't  necessarily mean it ca n't be useful in music production ) . <h> Sine Of The Times <p> The easiest way to demonstrate what happens when a signal distorts is to begin with a sine wave ( click the images to enlarge ) . <p> The sine wave sounds clear and pure , with no harmonics other than the fundamental frequency : <p> By applying a distortion plugin , its easy to see ( and hear ) the effect of adding distortion . If we increase the gain setting on the plugin , we replicate the effect of overdriving a circuit by increasing the level of the signal being fed through it . <p> We can increase the amplitude of parts of the wave that are at a relatively low level , but the peaks can not get any higher than the circuits maximum level . This means that as we increase the gain the peaks are in effect limited and appear to be chopped off " turning our sine into a different , more square shape .

Their ability to painstakingly recreate the sound of iconic drum machines , presented in well designed Kontakt instruments , has been their speciality . Revolution is no exception , featuring 14 of the worlds most sought-after vintage drum machines , a suite of effects , a multi-track sequencer and more . <p> The drum machines are presented within a 14-voice mixer , allowing users to mix and match any combination in order- to build their own modular setup . The names of the modules on offer give major clues as to- the sources of the samples from various Roland , Linn , Oberheim , E-mu and Sequential Circuits units : RV-78 , RV-8000 , RV-808 , RV-909 , RV-606 , RVDRUM , RVDX , RVULATOR , RVTRAKS , RVSP12 , RV-707 , RV-505 and RVBOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the GUIs for each module will be . <p> The mixer features individual volume , pan , delay send , reverb send , solo and mute controls for each sound , but more importantly you can also click on the title button at the top of the mixer to edit or swap out the module . I instantly warmed to the idea of mixing and matching modules in this way , combining an 808 bass drum with 909 toms , a LinnDrum clap and 606 hi-hats . Hitting on an original idea in this oversaturated world of plugins is no easy feat , but- I think Wave Alchemy have something unique with Revolution . Maybe this idea could be expanded in a future update , with more modules being added , or even offer a completely modular option , where you can pick and choose how many drum voices and modules or effects- you add in . <p> The editing controls on each module are impressive , most notably the Character knob . This differs depending on the module , but options include Analog , Digital , Tape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Analog ( and most of the others ) creates a round robin signal path , with the samples constantly alternating , each hit slightly different from the last , just as you would experience using the hardware . Along with this , other character styles were created by tracking through- various samplers , Studer tape machines , high-end boutique hardware and valve- processors . There 's even a Digital option for machine gun-style triggering . <p> A choice of 20 different filters types can be applied to any drum voice , featuring a range of low-pass , band-pass and high-pass options , along with envelope and pitch controls . On the far right of this section we get some randomisation controls for sample start , volume , pan and tune , providing further options to introduce- subtle inconsistencies in the sample playback . <p> At the bottom of the Revolution interface- you 'll find- a Roland x0x-style step sequencer with rate control , transport , swing and chase controls . Programming patterns in this way is extremely fun and intuitive and offers that free-flowing , live jam approach to laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents . Clicking on the SEQ button reveals the Global Sequencer page , where you can apply more precise and dynamic control to various aspects of your patterns . As well as copying , duplicating and clearing patterns , you can also change the sequence length and apply slop ' for humanised playback " great for drum flams or stacked hits . There are some useful- shortcuts for quick and creative programming , along with some handy presets to get you going , but the only thing I missed from the global sequencer page is- an undo option ; it 's easy to clear complete patterns by accident , but there 's no way- to reverse that action . <p> Rounding out the sound design options , you 'll also find- a set of insert , send and master effects with a mixture of compression , wave shaping ( tape emulation , bitcrushing and filter drive ) - and EQ options . The send effects- features two syncable delays , while the two convolution reverbs offer 160 different impulse responses , taken with different mics and using different room sizes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the round robin playback through to the impulses and the various sonic options ; apparently two different 808s were sampled in order- to offer a wider range of tones , while 20,000 samples were taken of the 909 bass drum alone . For me , Wave Alchemy have really delivered with a virtual instrument that captures the inherent behaviour of analogue equipment . The drum modules really do sound superb , and all the subtle nuances of these influential machines are present , from the sound to the visual design . There 's deep control offered in a way that 's simple , intuitive and a pleasure to work with . Revolution is n't cheap , but this is a serious instrument. - If you 're a big fan of classic drum machines , but also enjoy adding your own flair when working with those sounds , then Revolution is a pretty much an essential purchase . 
@@34419654 @3419654/ <p> Whilst it 's the analogue world that gets much of the coverage from retro fetishists , digital vibe ' has its own place in the production environment . It may be a more recent phenomenon , but the way in which the limitations of early- digital sampling technology- manifest themselves in particular bits of kit has now become another one of the creative choices a producer can make . This extends from the perceived grit ' of specific digital drum machines to the full-on dirt associated with- low-resolution samplers . The fact that so many 80s and early 90s samplers played " and continue to play " a key role in the production of- dance music means that their sound- deserves consideration . <h> A Bit of Science <p> Before we dive in with some specific examples it 's worth running over some of the principles at play when dealing with digital audio . What 's happening inside- classic samplers- like the 8-bit Ensoniq Mirage- or- 12-bit Akai MPC60- to- give them their distinctive sound ? <p> To turn an analogue audio signal into its digital counterpart we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn the amplitude at each of these moments into a number . The speed with which we do this ( the sample rate ) determines the maximum frequency that can be captured and played back . Sampling theory states that in order to fully capture a continuously changing signal one must sample it at twice its maximum frequency the so-called Nyquist frequency . So , assuming that the range of human hearing can extend up to 20 kHz ( if you 're very lucky or very young ) , one must sample audio at 40 kHz in order to play this back fully . In reality , things can be somewhat complicated by the filtering that needs to be applied to keep aliasing artefacts ( unwanted signals caused by the digitisation process itself ) out of the final audio output . <p> The second important factor is the bit depth the range of numbers used to capture the amplitude at each sample point . The larger the size of number used , the greater the dynamic range . This difference between quietest and the loudest points ultimately determines how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later examples exhibit- outright distortion rather than more subtle favouring , but the overall effect is clear : as we reduce the sample rate and bit depth , we bring out more character and crunch in the sound . The choice of source material will also make some audio artefacts or quality limitations more noticeable than others . The impact on the signal is- not always desirable , but it can- work incredibly well in some cases . <p> Of course , these simple examples only marginally approximate what happens when you use hardware samplers- with low bit depths or sample rates , as circuits and implementations do vary considerably from one unit to the next ( depending on application , cost and available technology ) . - You can get a flavour of some of the approaches here . <h> Related <h> Technique is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507

Discussing the fact that two of his late 80s singles sold over two million copies each , he qualifies the incredible figure by pointing out that its only true if you count vinyl , cassettes- and CDs , as if that 's somehow less remarkable . <p> Having just flown in from Ibiza with his son Dantiez , Kevin- meets us in the bar of his London hotel , orders a pot of tea and sits down at a corner table . He s here to DJ , but as always he currently has a number of other projects on the go , including the- recent relaunch of his house project Inner City with the release of Bad Girl , a tribute to Donna Summer . With an album under way and plans to go out on tour in the near future , we took the opportunity to- have- a long conversation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we were chatting by email before the interview I asked about topics you might like to discuss and most of your answers related to travel in some way . So you 're still excited by travelling after all the years on the road ? <p> Kevin Saunderson : Yeah . When I grew up I never imagined that I was gon na be a traveller of the world . It just was n't on my radar . There 's the downside of it when you 're away from the family but it 's a world outside of my world and it 's uniquely different when you travel outside your own home . <p> For some DJs it quickly becomes a chore . There 's that saying that you do n't get paid to play , you get paid to travel . <p> Laughing I just said that for Naples . I had n't been for a couple of years and I really wanted the pizza . I was like , Do n't worry about the money , just gim me the pizza ' . <p> We all talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you see it from the opposite perspective . When you travel do you see places that you think really have a distinct character ? <p> Definitely . I think of Tokyo , right away . It 's definitely got its own character . It 's kind of like Blade Runner . Lots of people , very hi-tech , very polite , very hospitable and courteous . And then the parties , when you play they scream . They scream a lot . Not like every now and again hands up in the air , but almost every time you 're in the mix they 're screaming and jumping . <p> I think Holland , too . Amsterdam and everything that goes around it , the coffee shops . When I categorise or try to link something I link those type of things to places like that . <p> When I grew up I never imagined that I was gon na be a traveller of the world . It just was n't on my radar . <p> Do you find differences in the types of music people respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next ? <p> I think in the beginning it was more like that . It was like , Germany was into very industrial-sounding techno at one point , right ? If you wanted to play a house record or something that was not as hard or driving , you had to find pockets- " - it was n't popular . <p> It was a few countries that were like that in the beginning but I never liked that , to be truthful , just because I always thought you should tell a story with your music . You should n't have to go play just techno , just house , just deep house , you know ? I always thought it was good to play a variety of music , as long as you liked it and could tell a story with it and elevate the crowd . <p> But in general now I think it 's more diverse everywhere . I remember Belgium , at the beginning they was into something called What was it called ? New <p> New beat . <p> Right . So you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated towards that sound and it would become popular but a lot of that stuff eventually faded away because it did n't have the balls , you know ? <p> In the beginning if you wanted to play a house record in Germany you had to find pockets " it was n't popular . <p> Yeah . I can see why more open-minded crowds would definitely suit you . Why do you think things have become more open ? Do you think there 's a reason for it ? <p> I think it 's just social media . People connect a lot easier . Just think about back in the day when DJs had to use vinyl , nobody knew the names of vinyls . Now you got programs that can tell you what people are playing , you got SoundCloud , you got all these different social media avenues that help people be one . It helps the world dance as one , you know ? You might like this style or that style , but you can find a track that you might not have known , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think that 's helped . <p> Everyone around the world downloading the same mixes from the same websites . <p> Definitely . Hey , let 's be honest : people do n't really buy music any more . They go to parties , they go to events and DJs buy music but regular crowds I do n't think they buy music . But they still like it , they share it , they go to SoundCloud . <p> Your career 's coincided with the shift in those consumer patterns . What were your biggest selling records ? How many copies of something like Good Life ' did you sell ? <p> I know Good Life ' and Big Fun ' sold over two million copies each , but I 'm sure that 's a combination of 12-inch , cassette , CD <p> Sure , but come on " - it 's two million ! <p> Yeah , yeah . Each of those went over two million . Good Life ' more than Big Fun ' , too . Maybe 200,000 more sold . Those were my biggest sales from single records . 
@@34419657 @3419657/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Gear/Software <h> UVI Synth Anthology II <p> UVIs Synth Anthology reaches version 2 . Jonny Strinati finds out what the update has to offer . <p> The roots of Synth Anthology instrument can be traced back over a decade . That 's a lifetime in terms of music software , but things have n't changed much : - hardware synths are perhaps even more popular than they were back when UVI launched Synth Anthologys predecessor , UltraFocus . And of course , the demand for virtual versions of sought-after hardware units remains strong . <p> Synth Anthology II is an instrument based on samples of 77 vintage and modern hardware synths , multisampled and gently processed through some esteemed outboard . The release includes over 2,500 presets and an all-new interface , plus a series of effects built-in effects such as UVIs own Sparkverb and Thorus . The big news is the addition- of 25 new units , including- a mixture of modern favourites ( Moog Sub-37 , Korg Minilogue , DSI OB-6 ) and additional vintage classics ( Roland Juno-106 , Chroma Polaris ) . <p> Once- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument , the presets are divided into 10 categories , including Classic Analog , Modern Analog , FM and Formant , Additive , Samplers and more . The sub-categories are really well organised and varied , which makes life easy when navigating for a specific- sound . I experienced no wait time for presets to load , the engine is clearly very efficient , helping optimise workflow . <p> All the sounds are controlled by a unified GUI , a feature I found a big plus working with this instrument . There is no history lesson about vintage synthesisers ; instead we have a really intuitive and user friendly layout . Swapping out patches , you 're not then presented with a different set of front-panel controls , meaning once you 've mastered the interface , you 'll be able to edit and customise all the patches it has to offer . <p> It 's really interesting to see the range of different instruments sampled for this release . Many analogue classics are present , as you 'd expect " the ARP- Odyssey , Roland Juno-60 , TB-303 , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Modern Analog section including contemporary classics such as the Bass Station 2 and- Minilogue . Most notably , there are some real rarities here . We often see analogue synths being emulated or- multisampled , but in- Synth Anthology we also have an extended set of digital and wavetable classics from the likes of Casio , PPG , Yamaha , Korg and Ensoniq . UVI also sampled a series of vintage samplers for Synth Anthology II , a choice selection- of Fairlight CMI sounds being a particular highlight . <p> The oscillator- page hosts the filters and envelopes , with a dedicated sub-oscillator , including a choice of different waveforms . The blue and orange colour scheme distinguishes between your main ( sampled ) sound and your sub. - The only thing I missed were- master filter and envelope controls . Although having individual controls for both the main and sub sounds is great , it is slightly annoying having to apply separate filter sweeps to both . Falcon users can add a filter to the whole layer as a workaround . <p> The Edit page offers- voicing- controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and PWM via the mod wheel . The arp and step sequencer are intuitive and fun to use , combining with the mod wheel options to make this a great synth to play ' , enhanced further by the ease with which you can set up MIDI CC- controls . <p> There are some gripes , but they 're relatively minor . Synth Anthology requires iLok authentication , but seeing as it does n't  require the much-maligned- iLok USB dongle that should n't be too much of an issue. - Like most sample-based instruments , it also- leans heavily towards presets rather than sound design. - Although there is an abundance of sounds here that are production ready , there 's scope for some additional- tweaking of sounds , but the emphasis is more on the arp , step sequencer , LFO modulation and effects . <p> As an instrument , Synth Anthology- has a modern feel despite all the classic and vintage machines included . This is in part due to UVI 's slick GUI providing rapid workflow and ease of use , but more importantly its because these are timeless sounds. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafted an instrument which more than justifies the- G149 asking price. - A resounding win in my book . I 'll be reaching for Synth Anthology II again and again .

Weve decided to use a sample that has a noticeable sampled quality to it . The kick has a lot of mids and highs but also a substantial amount of low end . <p> As the kick sample has already been treated , there is not much to add to the processing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 Hz to clear up some of the muddy frequencies . <h> Step 2 <p> The next part of the sequence- is to add a snare drum . Weve taken a sound from an- Alesis DM5 and the pattern is a simple hit on the second and fourth beat of each bar . <p> Weve layered the snare with a clap , also from the Alesis DM5 . Layering drums in this way can- give the overall combined sound more character . When layering drum hits , pay special attention to the choice of sounds that you use . For example if you want to create an authentic- retro sound make sure to use the right sounds in the first place . <p> There is not too much processing required with the snare/clap combination as the sounds are already processed and sound good together. - Weve added some small room reverb for depth , making sure its not overdone " only 17% mix to the original signal with a short- decay of 0.46s . <h> Step 3 <p> Once you apply the hi-hats you begin to get that classic jackin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi-hat sample . Weve layered this with another hat that has very little attack and works in a similar way to a shaker or cabassa sound . Then on top of that we 've layered yet another hat sample for a third flavour . <p> We now have a composite hi-hat sound made up of three separate layers all blended- together . <p> In keeping with the first two steps , weve not added much processing to the overall sound. - Weve removed any unnecessary low end with a high-pass filter and reduced the brightness of the sound by cutting 2.5 dB at around 5.5 kHz . <h> Step 4 <p> The next step is to add in some percussion . Weve chosen a glitch-style snare hit. - In keeping with the rest of this track , the processing is minimal as it sounds good in its natural state . <p> The important thing here to is to ensure the pattern works closely- with the hi-hats . We- begin by following the hi-hat sequence , but weve also added in some extra ghost notes . These give the beat an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The final stage is to process the- drums in order- to glue them together. - We 've used Fabfilter Saturn with a clean tube setting , 10% drive and the band dynamics at .500 .

If you 've heard their mixtape for Attack , you 'll probably already know that the Farriers are scholars of electronic music , with a near-encyclopaedic knowledge of everything from early 80s electropop to UK garage . <p> In advance of our visit to Als Manchester home studio , Paul warned us that the pair werent trained producers or engineers . The humility may be sincere but do n't  let it fool you into thinking they do n't  know what they 're doing ; Paul , 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music together since childhood and their understanding of dance music production is practically innate . <p> We do n't  have enough space for Pauls thoughts on new genre names ( " Post-dubstep ? Fuck off ! " ) or some seriously geeky musings on the relative MIDI timing accuracy of Macs versus Ataris , but over the course of our interview Paul and Al offered insight into everything from what modern producers can learn from Detroit techno innovators through to the importance of having confidence in your own abilities . <p> Attack : Let 's start by talking about your association with the electro-house scene which was so huge a few years ago . A lot of people probably think of you as an electro act , but I do n't  think that 's a very accurate pigeonhole to put you in . <p> Paul : We never really intended to be associated with what became known as the electro scene , partly because electro to us meant- Street Sounds- compilations- When we first started releasing records we probably tried to pander to what we thought was expected of us , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The pair use AKG K271 mkII studio headphones rather than monitors in order to avoid disturbing the neighbours . <p> Al : Particularly when we knew the first EP was coming out on Boys Noize , the sets had a lot of Boys Noize and Ed Banger Records tracks . <p> Paul : I think we lost a bit of our personality there . We probably thought it would n't cut it to play a classic acid house track or classic techno . <p> So there was a bit of a misconception about who Shadow Dancer were from the very beginning . Did the association with Boys Noize Records make that perception slightly inevitable ? <p> Paul : I know Alex himself consciously wanted the label to lose that association and be more diverse two or three years ago . There are still certain areas of electronic music more serious parts where they do n't  really look at us twice . We tend to get ignored by Resident Advisor and people like that . I think they just expect us to make noisy electro shit <p> Al : Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds that have come back into our tracks from the hardware we 've been using . <p> Paul : Nowadays people think techno just means one thing , but the original ethos behind it was very open-minded . It was more about that freedom and it was quite a diverse genre . Carl Craig records do n't  sound like Strings of Life <p> And there are techno classics which could just as easily be called house . <p> Paul : I like the idea that techno was a manifesto for making music . It was n't a sound , but it was about the influences that went with it and basically trying to make funk music that was by machines . Music that had emotion to it like machines had emotions . <p> It does have a kind of political message because its from a part of America that capitalism basically destroyed , abandoned and left for dead , but the majority of Detroit techno is about futurism and space . Its odd that music which was predominantly about futurism is now retro . <p> People now seem to think that techno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be 128bpm , got to have big breakdowns and risers <p> Paul : I 'd prefer to be called techno , but only in the traditional sense , not the modern one . People should try to understand what techno means . I think its really strange when people do n't  know the history of the music they 're making . <p> So why did it take so long for you to start releasing music ? You were making music since you were teenagers but it was n't until you were in your late twenties that you began releasing records . <p> Al : We were making music but we never really sent demos off to people . I think we maybe sent two or three off and never heard back , so we just thought it was n't good enough . <p> Paul : We chose the wrong labels to send to , though . I do n't  remember this , but Al said the other day that we sent one to Rephlex . They would never have put out our stuff . <p> The studio setup changes on a regular basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juno 2 and Juno 106 and the Yamaha DX21 . <p> Were you just sending them to the labels you liked ? <p> Paul : Yeah , that was the problem . With the really small labels like Skam and Rephlex , all the stuff that they released was by their mates . <p> I suppose the internet made it a lot easier to make contact with labels . Is that what eventually happened with you ? How did you first hook up with Alex and Boys Noize Records ? <p> Paul : Yeah it was . He heard some tracks on MySpace . He used to look on MySpace for new music . I think he still looks on SoundCloud now . He got in touch and asked to do an EP , then eventually he asked if we wanted to do an album . We had n't  really made the music with the aim of getting it released , but MySpace made it possible to put it out there . People like Simian Mobile Disco and Zombie Nation used to give feedback on those early tracks . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were doing something right . I think we always lacked that confidence . <p> Paul : They were both done around the same time using the Amiga , the Akai S900 , Korg MS2000 vocoder and a shitty ART multi-effect box that we had . Its strange now that people can listen to them in a modern context . <p> It must show there was something good about the tracks all along . <p> Paul : Thats frustrating , though , because it means maybe we could have put them out years ago . We started doing those electro tracks around 99 or 2000 . There were all these techno tracks around which did n't  justify being seven minutes long , so we thought wed make something a bit more verse/chorus/verse and the length of a pop song . Then electroclash came along and we were like , We had that idea ! I do n't  know why we did n't  latch onto that at the time . <p> Al : I think we were a bit defeatist about the fact that we were outside the scene. - Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on an album for Bad Life in the autumn . Everything on the album was made between 1997 and 2002 . <p> Did you carry on making music between then and signing to Boys Noize ? <p> Paul : We stopped making music in 2003 and just had a period where we did n't  do it . In 2006 we started messing around again on a laptop . <p> What did you do during that period ? <p> Al : I did a PhD in Manchester , which was pretty much all-consuming . We still DJed but we drifted away from electronic music a bit . <p> Did you lose interest in techno at that time ? <p> Paul : When techno got a bit too serious and up its own arse in the late 90s I 'd already drifted towards vocal and deep house anyway , then I was a bit influenced by UK garage . I never really bought any but I worked in a warehouse and we 'd always have Radio One on so youd hear Artful Dodger , B15 Project , Architechs and people like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a track once which was inspired by Rewind and we 've got a track called Run From Deep which has got quite a skippy garagey hi-hat pattern inspired by Sincere by MJ Cole .

A nine-minute slice of loose , flowing freeform groove and classy-yet-understated musicianship , King Bromeliad first appeared alongside- Montparnasse- in 2014 as one half of a two-track single- on the Eglo Records label that Shepherd co-founded back in 2009 . As a highly-acclaimed example of Floating Points at his finest , we figured it deserved a bit of the Breakdown treatment . <h> Structure <p> Unashamedly unbound by the constraints of conventional eight-bar building blocks , King Bromeliad begins unconventionally , with a lo-fi recording of the track being played out at Plastic People , the London club at which Shepherd once had a residency as a DJ . This fades in gradually from nowhere , building slowly over the course of the first minute of the tune . Purely by means of audio , the listener is taken on a virtual journey from what appears to be pulling up outside at the club in a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being played . After the briefest of pauses at this point , the track kicks in properly after just over a minute . <p> The main groove then hovers between F and F# for a while , the two bass parts trading places whilst a variety of choice synth noises swoop in and out . After an extended central breakdown section , featuring a vibraphone solo and some crazy opened-out filter effects and modulation of the portamento depth on a couple of the synth riffs , the focus shifts to an alternative version of the bassline played out over the same , faded-in rolling drum groove . The filter on this new bass sound also gradually opens out towards the end of the song . <h> Drum track <p> The main backbone of the track is a swung , shuffling groove based around sampled live kit sounds , that rolls around funkily at 115 bpm . A rounded , weighty kick drum locks down four beats to the bar . Closed hi-hats punctuate the offbeats in between , with the fourth hat slightly more open each time round . Truncated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shuffle pattern , the ghost notes created by playing the same samples at lower velocity . An occasional tambourine chimes in playing sixteenths in the background , with a hint of conga percussion thrown in here and there . <p> Far from just a repeated loop , the drum track features frequent tiny variations in the pattern , enough that the whole thing feels like it could have been played in one take by a drummer . That said , here 's what the essence of the main drum groove would look like programmed in Ableton Live , with the ghost snare beats shown in pink , in contrast to the main hits shown in red . <p> Even though Shepherd is reputed to have a deep dislike of quantisation in its more rigid forms , there 's evidence of a swing quantisation in effect here " on closer investigation , the feel is roughly equivalent to Logic 's 1/16 Swing D preset . ( Read more about quantisation , swing and how they 're implemented in DAWs and drum machines here . ) <h> Bass parts <p> King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interweave throughout the duration of the track . The first , a brooding , deep organ bass sound , handles the alternating swing of the tune from F to F# and back again , as shown below . <p> The second bass part features a bouncier root , fifth and octave synth motif , matching the swung feel of the kit . It first appears as a low-pass filtered synth sound played simultaneously with the organ at about 1:36 , also alternating between F and F# but playing a completely different riff , shown below . It then becomes the predominant bass part at around 2:09 , the filter gradually opening out as it takes us through to the very end . <h> Synth parts <p> Most of the synth parts in King Bromeliad appear to have been improvised over the duration of the track , as there 's rarely a 100% exact repeated part . Instead , the parts are based around simple motifs that seem to vary continuously not too much cut and paste going on here ! <p> Notable examples include a- snarling , resonant sweepy sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic .

@@34419666 @3419666/ <p> Here 's the MIDI part we 've used for the bass hook , in the key of G# minor : <h> Step 1 <p> Repro-1 is a software emulation of Sequential Circuits ' classic Pro-One monophonic analogue synth . However , U-he have added a number of- great extra features , some of which we 'll take a look at in this walkthrough. - Like the original synth , which was a cross-genre classic from the time of its release in 1981 , Repro-1 is capable of a range of outstanding analogue sounds . <p> When you load a new instance of Repro-1 it should have the init- preset loaded by default ( the init- patch can also be loaded from the presets- section ) . <p> We begin by taking the patch down an octave using- the master tune- control ( found in the top right corner ) , which should be set to -12 . Then on oscillator- A , we have a choice of either a sawtooth or pulse wave ( the pulse having some pulse width options ) . We click the pulse wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then we turn- down the pulse width control slightly . The pulse width setting can be modulated to the left of the synth " either directly or via a mod wheel " if you want to add- pulse width modulation to- your sound . <h> Step 2 <p> On oscillator- B we have the option of a saw , triangle or pulse wave . We switch- the saw wave off and turn on the pulse wave . We also take the oscillator down an octave for a more bass-driven tone . Over in the mixer- section we turn up the volume for osc- A and osc- B. To the right of the oscillator volume controls we have a switchable feedback/noise- control . Set to noise and the control is a volume for the noise generator , set to feedback- and this knob controls the amount of signal fed from the amplifier section back into the mixer , perfect for adding some weight to bass sounds . We turn this up to a quarter of the way . <h> Step 3 <p> Now on the filter- section , we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn up the envelope amount , thus applying the filter envelope to the cutoff parameter . <p> We also turn up the keyboard amount control- a little , which- applies keytracking to the filter cutoff , meaning the filter- will automatically open a little more as we play notes higher up the keyboard. - This works- nicely with our bass hook " the low notes play a bit deeper , whilst the higher notes open up the filter slightly . <h> Step 4 <p> Now its time to set both the envelopes to shape our sound . We begin with the filter envelope . Keeping the attack- where it is , we bring down the decay- to a third of the way round , bring down the sustain- nearly all the way , and keep the release- where it is . <p> For the amp envelope- we push up the decay control- slightly and bring down the sustain- to just below a quarter . The sound is very deep and plucky now , and would be a useful sub sound in its own right , but we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . <h> Step 5 <p> Although not faithful to the original Pro-One , the stompbox effects are a welcome addition , each one having a character all of its own . At the bottom of Repro-1 we can switch between the keys- and effects- views . By default the keys view will be displayed . Click on the effects- button on the left to bring up the effects . <p> We begin by turning on Jaws , a waveshaping effect of epic proportions . We turn up the Folds setting- slightly to drive the input , then we turn the Teeth knob to the fully clockwise- position for a different type of distortion effect . We turn up the F-mod control to three quarters , - which applies an envelope to the Folds- control . Finally , we turn up the R control for added release to the F-mod envelope . <p> Next we turn on Lyrebird , a delay/chorus effect . We click where it says Sync- 16th and select Chorus/Short- from the drop-down menu . We change the mode- from PPong- to Echo , bring the Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the modulation- switch up to Med- for a subtle but warming chorus effect on the bass . <p> Next- we turn on the RESQ effect , boosting- the low shelf for some added bass . <p> Finally we turn on Sonic Conditioner- " its- capable of transient shaping and controlling width , but in this case were simply going to turn- up the gain- control in order to add- a nice touch of saturation . 
@@34419667 @3419667/ <h> An Introduction To Arpeggiators <p> Bruce Aisher runs us through the fundamentals of arpeggiators , from the most simple one-note patterns through to basic step sequencing , gated chords and MIDI effects . <p> Arpeggiators are perhaps one of the simplest and most audibly recognisable sequencing tools available . In essence an arpeggiator is a very basic real-time sequencer designed to take a chord as an input and turn it into an arpeggio . Originating in the early days of hardware synthesisers , the arpeggiators simplicity and immediacy has ensured that its found favour with musicians ever since . <h> The World According to Arp <p> Whilst arpeggiators originated in hardware synths particularly those developed in the microprocessor boom of the late 1970s we 're going to explore them in their more flexible software guise . If you 're lucky enough to own a hardware synth with a built-in arpeggiator , exactly the same principles apply . <p> Here we have Korg 's plugin reincarnation of the classic PolySix ( a relatively affordable polysynth back in 1981 which now commands a fairly high price on the second-hand market ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in any arpeggiator speed , ( note or octave ) range , mode ( up , down and up/down " some arps include others ) , and latch ( continues playing the arp once keys have been released ) : <p> If we set the range to one octave and play only one note , we get a simple pulsing pattern : <p> Play a few more notes ( or draw them into your DAW ) and you can create basic basslines very easily . The classic technique here is to follow the root note of the chord above . Here we 've programmed an eight-bar pattern : <p> The arpeggiators on most soft synths also feature a tempo sync button which allows the arp to stay in time with the host project ( if that 's what you want ) . In this case the speed control usually acts to divide the project tempo into 1/16th- notes , 1/8th- notes and other divisions . <p> here 's how our arp sounds set to- 1/8th- notes and played alongside a drum beat : 
@@34419668 @3419668/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Beat Dissected <h> Driven 909 <p> In the latest Beat Dissected , we create a beat- using- Roland TR-909 hits we 've processed through a Revox B77 tape machine for some true analogue warmth . <p> Beat Dissected is a regular series in which we deconstruct drum patterns , showing you how to program them in any DAW . Just copy our grid in your own software to recreate the loop . <p> Here 's the beat we're- building today : <h> Spec <h> Tempo <p> 120-125 BPM <h> Swing <p> 55-65% <h> Sounds <p> 909 Style Tape Hits <h> Step 1 <p> We begin by loading up Abletons Drum Rack and dragging our short kick sample into the rack . In- Sampler , we change- the sample mode to Classic , and tweak the envelope settings to- minimum attack and sustain with medium decay and release. - We then add an overdrive plugin , setting the controls as shown in the image below . <p> The envelope settings give- this sample a nice snappy transient , with the overdrive providing some extra attitude . Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes out all the thump from the kick , making space for the- long kick- we add in the next step . <p> We then insert a MIDI clip and programme a basic four-to-the-floor rhythm for two bars , placing the short kick- on every beat . <h> Step 2 <p> Next we add our long kick- sample and program the same pattern . We switch- the Sampler device to classic mode and take the number of voices down to 1 . Due to the length of the sample we need to make sure the hits do n't overlap ; limiting the voices means each new hit that plays will stop the playback of the previous one . <p> We tweak the envelope again , setting the attack and sustain to minimum , decay to 4 seconds and release 292 ms . The decay time you set here is subjective . If you plan to have a sub bass in your track then you 'll need to set a shorter decay time to create space , otherwise a longer decay time will provide the low end in your project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 <p> Now we add our ride sample , placing a ride on every 16th note . To add some dynamics to the rides , we turn- down the velocity of all the hits that fall on the up and down beats . Once again we switch- Sampler to classic mode and tweak the envelope settings , reducing the transient by backing off the attack to 9.49 ms , setting the decay to 300 ms , pushing the release right up to 60.0 s and taking the volume down to -21.9 dB . <p> We also set the number of voices to 1 as with the long kick , meaning each new ride hit will chop off the last , creating a cleaner rhythm . <p> We add an EQ to- sweep off any low frequency and also pan the sound- to the left slightly . <h> Step 4 <p> Now we add our rimshot , placing it in between the first beat and off beat . We also add one at very end of the two bars to lead us back into the loop . <p> In- Sampler we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ableton 's Saturator plugin , pushing the drive up to 14.9 dB . We change the saturation type to Medium Curve and pull down the output to -17.7 dB . After the Saturator we add EQ Eight , sweeping off any low frequency . We then pan the sound- to the right slightly , working with the ride to enhance the stereo image of the beat . <h> Step 5 <p> Next we add our clap sample , placing it- on top of the kick , which adds a nice energy to the beat . We also place an extra clap with a slightly lower velocity at the end of the loop to add some contrast between the two bars . <p> In Sampler , we adjust the envelope settings as shown below before adding an- EQ in order to- sweep off any low frequencies and boost some high end using a high shelf filter . <h> Step 6 <p> The final addition is- our snare , programming quite a busy rhythm " this could act as way to add intensity to sections of the drums . From- the Groove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agr groove preset , add a slightly looser feel to the snare . <p> EQ Eight is used once more , sweeping away any really low frequency and adding a slight boost in the higher mids , giving the snare a bit more presence . <h> Step 7 <p> Finally , we add some bus processing . FabFilter 's Saturn plugin is used for- some multi-band distortion . Splitting the drum track into three frequency bands , we go easy on the lows , adding a tiny amount of drive and taking the mix right down , but- for the mids and highs we set a moderate mix and drive . <p> After Saturn , we add the Glue Compressor , setting a slow attack and fast release before- tweaking the threshold control until we see- 2-3 dB of compression on the meter . We adjust the makeup gain to remedy for loss of level . <p> The Saturn plugin adds a nice amount of warmth here , while the Glue Compressor helps gel the drums together , adding some punch at the same time .

I 'm one of those guys who gets a little misty eyed when the subject of magnetic reels comes up . I think of my tape deck , I think of all the reels I 've slapped on it over the years , I think of all the calibration procedures I 've done on it and all of it makes me smile . <p> But I 've noticed that the dreamy-eyed nostalgia and romantic " almost gushing " reverence some of us have for magnetic tape can annoy people who , in their own minds , are firmly planted in the brighter , better future that all-digital recording holds . <p> Maybe they 've used tape more times than they care to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've never used tape but ca n't imagine what all the fuss is about . <p> This months column is n't for the post-tape crowd , nor is it for those who , like me , still prefer the transient and harmonic characteristics of a tape deck that 's breaking a generous sweat . Instead , its for those of you who 've never used a real deck , those whose closest brush with overbias and IPS is a tape emulation plugin or something like the UBK Fatso or Portico tape emulator . <p> If you 've not yet had the pleasure of tracking to tape , or mixing a song straight off tape , or ( as I do exclusively these days ) just running your sounds through tape as an effect , I 'd like to go on record that you 're missing something special. - It may not end up being your cup of tea ; you might prefer the faster , punchier bass and cleaner , crispier high frequencies of digital. - But you might instead prefer the slower , juicier bass and mellower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to know for sure . <h> The right kind of change <p> There 's no debating one of the strongest arguments against tape : when you run your sounds through a well-calibrated deck , what comes back is always different than what went in. - Its unavoidable : tape is not accurate , and it adds noise to boot . The inaccuracy and noise of tape are why many engineers were so happy to move on from it . They grew tired of dialling in their sounds to perfection , only to have the tone and the transients changed by the medium they were printing to . <p> But one person 's trash is another person 's treasure , and many of us possess a deep and abiding love for the way tape changes sound . More than that , some of us actually depend on the sonic shifts tape creates " we rely on it to pull together mixes with the unique and inimitable glue of those magnetic reels . <p> So what 's all the fuss ? In a word : distortion . And not just one distortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tape to pull together mixes with the unique and inimitable glue of those magnetic reels <p> First and foremost , there 's transient distortion. - Tape is incapable of accurately capturing any kind of strong , fast or high-frequency transient ; it rounds out the peaks and slows down the fast stuff . The harder you drive your inputs , the more noticeable this effect becomes . <p> The beauty of tape , though , is the instantaneous and musical way it does this . It 's like an infinitely fast limiter . But it 's not a smacky digital brickwall that eliminates punch by suddenly and quickly flattening all waveforms that cross a fixed threshold . Instead , it 's a progressive and oddly natural effect that starts off unobtrusive and grows more intense as it approaches its own ceiling . You control how much you want each track to bend into it . <p> To me , the resulting tape-ified waveform looks like it was redrawn by an artist who understood the language of the original sound and packed it into a more consolidated , texturally interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled , more naturally compressed version of the original , without any of the attack or release distortions you get with compression . It mixes easier and plays nicer with the other sounds in your mix . <p> Having a more levelled , rounded , well-behaved signal to mix is a big enough win to keep me coming back to tape , but there 's more to the story. - There 's the harmonic distortion as well. - Anyone who 's played with a saturation or distortion plugin the past five years knows what harmonic distortion is " even if the precise definition is not known or understood. - But plugins " and I include my own decidedly coloured UBK-1 and Pusher plugins in this broadly dismissive statement " simply can not touch the delicate beauty and organic warmth of the distortions that analogue tape imparts to sounds. - Tape brings forward a richness in the lows , a creaminess in the mids and a softness in the texture of the highs that , to me , sounds more organic , more expensive , a little more vintage and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compress without obtrusive artefacts " vocals , stabbing synths , electric and synth bass , whatever " can be creamed quite aggressively with tape , and the results are larger , richer with musical harmonics and more liquid in tone , density , and dynamic but they do n't sound compressed or limited in the same way that they would if you used a compressor/limiter to achieve the same degree of levelling. - They just sound like they were born that way . <p> The nature of tape 's compressive character " with an attack that is both infinitely fast and infinitely gradual " makes for one of the most natural , organic types of distortion I know of. - Nothing else sounds like it , and with due respect to those of us who make saturators and emulators of all kinds , my ears tell me that nothing sweetens a signal from top to bottom and front to back the way the real deal does . <h> Earning the magic <p> Like so many worthwhile things in life , the dark mistress of tape does not give away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must earn all of it. - For starters , there 's the fact that every tape deck " from the most basic cassette deck to the most sophisticated multi-track machine " is a serious electro-mechanical affair with tons of intricate moving parts , motors and electronic widgets that coexist in a very delicate balance . This means that if something breaks , it takes a serious and knowledgeable technician to get things running again . These techs are not commonplace , and outside metropolitan areas it can take some doing to find one . <p> And once you get your machine purring , you 'll need to calibrate and align its electronics for whatever formula of tape you 're using and there are many , many formulas to choose from . Aligning a tape deck is something any reasonably intelligent sound jockey is capable of , but the first few times can be daunting and confusing at best because absolutely nothing about it is intuitive , and most how-to guides are written by guys with more technical sense than literary chops . <p> But if you can get past those hurdles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it humming , and align it to the tape of your choice " you will be rewarded in ways you never imagined. - Everything about tape has the capacity to become a meditative ritual , from the mounting and winding of a new reel to the quiet pause in your process as you wait for it to rewind at the end ; from the journey of finding what formula of tape you prefer and massaging your deck 's response to it , to the deeply focussed process of driving a particular sound until you get an effect that makes you smile from ear to ear . <p> if you can find a solid machine , get it humming , and align it to the tape of your choice , you will be rewarded in ways you never imagined <p> If you 're a true tapehead , all of the above trials and trivia will bring you untold amounts of sonic joy . If you 're not a tapehead , it will all frustrate you to no end. - My advice : figure out which one you are , embrace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're anything like me , your music " not to mention your soul " will thank you every time you hit that big red record button . 
@@34419670 @3419670/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Interviews <h> King Britt <p> We chat to the electronic music auteur about how sci-fi movies inspired his recent EP on Hyperdub , why he deliberately limits his options in the studio and how avant-garde composers influence his work . <p> King Britt has been one of the most prolific artists in electronic music since his first release 1990s Tribal Confusion , released on Strictly Rhythm in collaboration with former business partner Josh Wink . Since then , he s produced music under numerous aliases , from his more traditional house output as Scuba through to his improvisational , hip hop-tinged , jazz-inspired , vocal-led output with Rucyl as Saturn Never Sleeps . <p> Britts recent Fhloston Paradigm EP on Hyperdub marked another high point in his career , combining a retro sci-fi inspired aesthetic with contemporary production values . From a technical standpoint , the EPs extensive use of vintage analogue gear and foreboding arrangements will draw- comparisons with Vangeliss classic- Bladerunner score- and John Carpenters soundtrack work , - but the release delivers a distinct take on the established tropes thanks to careful sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We spoke to King ( that 's his real name , by the way ) about his approach to making music and the ways in which the equipment itself informs the sound of his projects . <p> Attack : Let 's start by talking a little about the- Fhloston Paradigm EP , which is one of the most interesting pieces of music we 've heard this year . Can you tell us a little about the decision to limit yourself to a few pieces of analogue- gear for that record ? <p> King Britt : Well , its interesting how it all happened . I collect synths , so I switch them in and out of my setup every few months . On this occasion , around 2010 , I set up my Moog Sonic Six- and Boss DR-110 to make little rhythm tracks . I was learning to run the drum machine through the Moog processing ; there 's a little mixer on the Sonic Six and you can get some really raw-sounding things . <p> Kode9 put one of the tunes on his Essential Mix and I sent him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tunes that he may dig not really for Hyperdub , but just some he may like . He loved them but definitely wanted Chasing Rainbows for the EP , so it all worked out . I then fine-tuned the other songs using the Korg quad pad and Moogerfoogers . <p> The idea of restricting yourself to a limited set of tools is so interesting these days , seeing as most people are using software which offers almost limitless options <p> Nowadays there are so many options , especially with software , that you find yourself spending more time on finding the right plugin rather than doing the music . <p> So when I did the Adventures In Lo-Fi album , which is mainly hip hop , I only wanted to do it the way I did back in the day a stack of wax and an MPC . I 'd close my eyes and grab a few albums every day for a week , which gave a certain randomness to the creative sampling process , then see how many tracks I could do from those stacks . It created sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very clever sonic palette . <p> Using this approach of limitation , you tend to shape the sound of the project because you only can use the sounds of those things you 've chosen . For Fhloston , choosing three main synths actually branded the sound of the project and made all the songs cohesive . I do it with software too . Only- these- plugins , or what have you . I 'm now doing a series of sample packs which are textures used as foundations for the start of projects . <p> Are they just for your own use ? <p> No , I have a series that will be available exclusively through Sounds To Sample from November 16th . The series is called Fragments and they 're pieces of glitchy goodness that I created from scratch for producers and DJs . I used a different process to make each volume and they 're all Ableton-ready . <p> Moog Sonic Six <p> Sounds good . Going back to the restricted sonic palette , do you think that approach has a big impact on the way you compose the music ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something distinctive . Like the way the Mono/Poly has four oscillators and each note in a chord has one oscillator , so you get things that you may never get with another keyboard . <p> Or how using only CV and gate gives you a whole different swing than MIDI due to lag time and trigger sequences . <p> Have you taken a similar approach with other projects , sitting down and deciding on a set of tools before you actually make any- music ? <p> I always do now . Always . With my Soul Litchfield project for Saturn Never Sleeps , - its all Minimoog , JX-3P and MPC into Ableton using the APC40 . It totally changed how I composed . I was performing more in a live way of thinking because the APC is essentially an instrument if used right . <p> You 're a big Ableton fan ? <p> Its the best program to ever exist. - It really allowed me to break out the synths and incorporate them quickly and efficiently into a MIDI setup. - I also love the Moog MP-201 pedal , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have four MIDI to CV triggers to different synths is mind-blowing .

All the sounds on the album have been processed in my studio with my analogue equipment : ADT Audio- console , Looptrotter distortion , Distressor , SSL G-series bus compressor , Ableton Push 2 and a bunch of synthesisers and pedals . For this track , I got my Roland SH-101 synth on for the bassline and processed it the through my Looptrotter 8/24 for a fat saturation of the bass . Drums are 808 in full effect " I really like the contrast between some gospelly kind of vocals and a tough beat underneath .

He exchanged the favour , as we did Robots- together on his album a couple of years ago . The idea behind the track was to get a very hypnotic and repetitive voice on a chunky , funky groove and a rolling basslineagain , a very simple edit . I 'm not a big lover of crazy effects as I like to keep the flow and groove going " also because nowadays you can really re-edit the tracks according to your style with all the available equipment on the market like Rekordbox or Traktor so I keep things simple . <h> Without You ' <p> I really wanted to do something with a soulful vocal and a dubby beat using the same techniques as- hip-hop . So , again with my Push 2 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get that hip-hop feeling and I tried to keep the beat very tight , with a solid , subby bassline made this time with an 808 kick processed through my Distressor . I also played a bit with the edit here , leaving some beatless moments where the magic voice sample does the trick . Then when the beats drops in again people go mental all the time ! <h> Superfly <p> This is more of a simple tool , with a huge horn on the breakdown . I wanted to add some instrumental groovy flavour to the album flow and this was the right tune . The tracks rolling percussion and bassline were made with my Juno-106 . <h> Count On Me ' <p> I did this track a couple of years ago when I bought my Prophet-5 . I really wanted to do something special and more musical with it , so I played a bit with the chords and harmonies . I am very pleased with the result . I also liked to give the track a big contrast between the melody and the amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distorted 909 kick and some mad hats . This is my perfect end of the party tune ! <h> I Can See The Light ' <p> This is probably the first track that made it on to the tracklist , still pounding hard in the club ! I coupled old-school beats with a modern twist and a stop-and-go edit where an old-school siren just pops in here and there to keep things peaky ! I made the bassline with the Juno-106 and layered it on the mid frequencies with a bass sample then I threw everything into a distortion pedal to get the synth sound . <h> I Believe In You ' <p> I Believe In You was born because I wanted to recreate something with a classic synth sound from the 90s , so what 's better than the classic Rock Organ preset from the almost unknown Roland JX-1 ? I bought one in Rome " they go for very cheap , but there are a few classic sounds from the past that will always come in handy . So I started from the main synth hook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give that 90s feeling to it . Funny enough , the bassline came out from the synth hook off cut . I put it though the Distressor with a heavy sidechain and that was the result ! <h> The Loft ' ( featuring dajae ) <p> The Loft could well be the first official single that came out from this album , and its the first collaboration between me and Dajae . I remember that I made this tune with this early Chicago vibe and Green Velvet sent it to Dajae , who was very inspired to write about house parties . And she 's right : " There 's no party , like a house party ! " I made the bass again with some 808 kick drum samples and the groove was straight-up 909 kick drum and old-school loops to give that credible late-80s house feel to it . <h> Acid Train ' ( featuring DJ Pierre ) <p> It was such a pleasure to collaborate with the acid house legend DJ Pierre on this track .

The SH-101 bassline was distorted through the D16 Decimort- this time . Also , all the hats were put through Decimort and with a light chorus effect on top .

In essence , you 're creating space for processing in the master . Try a test by outputting three mixes with different levels of headroom and listen to how they sound with the engine . <h> Should I compress or limit my mixdown ? <p> No . Unless absolutely integral to the vibe of your recording , we recommend not using dynamic processors such as compressors or limiters on your master track . " Why ? " you may ask . <p> They interfere with LANDR 's EQ , compression and stereo enhancement . <p> They reduce headroom . <p> If you absolutely have to use them , make sure the output gain is low and the meter on your master bus peaks at 3-6 dB below zero . <p> Keep in mind that headroom is affected by every channel and plugin in your strip .

Standard bit depth is 24-bit , which is exceedingly good for any real-world application . <p> What you upload to LANDR will dictate what you get back , so make sure to bounce an uncompressed version in either a WAV or AIFF format . Avoid mastering MP3s . <p> The standard sampling rate for audio recordings is 44.1 kHz ( or 48 kHz if the song is going to be used with a video ) . Using higher sample rates " like 96 kHz " has its advantages , but there are a few practical considerations : <p> Higher sample rates require more storage space , which may be an issue if you 're trying to share files on a service like Dropbox . <p> Some recording interfaces restrict the number of tracks you can record at the same time if the sample rate is at a higher setting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DJ sets ?

You 'll hear if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full mix through . <p> LANDR needs a bit more time to process a DJ mix than it does for individual tracks . File sizes should be 1 GB max , but there 's no time limitation . <h> Do I need to do anything with the files after they 've been mastered by LANDR ? <p> To get the most out of your LANDR masters online , when uploading to sites like SoundCloud or Beatport , use an uncompressed WAV or AIFF file to avoid transcoding ( the undoing and redoing of MP3 encoding ) . <p> Most sites automatically make a 128 kpbs MP3 version of your track for streaming , and keep your uncompressed files for purchased downloads . Double encoding and transcoding can result in undesirable artifacts . <p> If you are uploading to YouTube , make sure to use a WAV for HD video ( 720p and higher will encode your audio at 384 kbps ) otherwise your audience will be stuck listening to low quality 128 kbps streaming . <p> Converting from WAV to MP3 online may boost the peak level of your track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Can I master- stems- with LANDR ? <p> Yes . Stem mastering is a great way to make loops and samples come alive. - Give yourself plenty of headroom ( render your stem a bit lower than the standard 3-6 dB true peak headroom ) . <p> Since the mastered audio is going back into the mix , make sure to output on the lowest setting in LANDR , otherwise you may run into problems when you do a final master . Stems that have monophonic content , or are completely dry of effects , do n't yield the most interesting result . <p> Try multitracks like drums , percussion , a vocal effect chain or synth group .

@@34419673 @3419673/ <h> Getting Dirty With Korg 's Volca Sample <p> Korg 's Volca Sample is one of the most affordable hardware samplers ever produced . Heres- how you can push it into dirtier , more retro territory . <p> Korgs- Volca Sample arrived on the market at a time when there was more interest than ever in the idea of vintage ' samplers " - that is , just about anything manufactured before the mid 1990s , when CD-quality sample playback and clean analogue-to-digital conversion became a standard for most professional samplers . <p> What exactly is it that people like so much about those vintage hardware samplers ? Up until the latter half of the 1990s , hardware was the only realistic choice for most producers who wanted to include sampled elements in their music . As we explained in our recent feature on replicating the sound of vintage samplers in software , the character of each of those classic hardware units is determined by a combination of factors : most notably , - the pre-amps or line stages on the way in , the analogue-to-digital converters ( ADCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resolution and bit-depth of the digital circuits , and then the sound of the digital-to-analogue converters ( DACs ) on the way out . <p> Caustic Editor allows custom samples to be loaded into the Volca <p> In the case of 80s and 90s samplers , the end result can be dramatically coloured in comparison to what we might now consider an acceptably neutral sound . Ultimately , most of this boils down to the fact that all those classic devices are using what would now be considered quite outdated technology . In the 80s , digital signal processing was in its relative infancy and therefore- expensive . As it- began to get more advanced and affordable in the mid 1990s , samplers got- cleaner and cheaper , right up to the point where software alternatives started to take over as the dominant form of sampling in the early 2000s . <p> The Volca Sample represents one of the new breeds of sampler ( not least because you ca n't actually- sample directly into the unit , as with- most software samplers ) . It 's not meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands-on , user-friendly hardware setup which can be used either on its own or as part of a bigger production setup . <p> As standard , the 31.25 kHz , 16-bit resolution Volca Sample does n't colour sounds as much as most- vintage 8-bit and 12-bit samplers , but as soon as we got our hands on one , an- obvious question sprung to mind : how far can we push it to draw out its character ? In other words , what if we actively try to make it- sound less clean ? <p> To get a sense of the Volca Sample 's inherent sound , let 's start with a simple loop including drums and synth elements . Here 's the original , unprocessed sample : <p> With the Volca we do n't  have a preamp or ADC samples can only be loaded via software , either via Korg 's AudioPocket app for iOS or a third-party editor . In this case we 're using Caustic Editor , which is available for Mac , Windows , Android and iOS . Here 's the same loop loaded into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing applied : <p> We can hear the high-frequency roll-off and the character start to come through , but- how do we draw a dirtier sound- out of it ? The most obvious answer is to pitch the sample down . This is when most samplers start to- reveal their true colours . <p> We can certainly hear some of the character start to come out , but there 's an obvious problem here . Unless we want to create tracks at extra-slow tempos , it 's going to be hard to work pitched-down samples into any kind of meaningful production context . <p> Vintage colour : the 12-bit E-mu SP-12 <p> The solution to this problem draws on a technique most famously employed back in the late 80s and early 90s by hip-hop producers sampling from vinyl . Working with samplers like the E-mu SP-12 ( which featured just 1.2 seconds of sampling time ) producers developed a clever trick : taking a 33rpm vinyl record and pitching it up to 45rpm ( or even higher using the turntables- pitch adjustment ) meant that sounds could be sampled while- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the fact that when the sound was tuned- back down to its original pitch in the sampler , it took on an even grittier , crunchier sound . <p> The Volca Sample has a maximum sample capacity of 65 seconds , which is way beyond what most samplers could achieve until the late 90s , so we do n't  need to pitch sounds up to save on sample memory , but what if we use the same technique- to exaggerate the effect ? - We can imitate the effect of a lower sampling rate by pitching our original sound up in an audio editor or a DAW before transferring it to the Volca . The sample can then be tuned- down in the Volca to get it back to the pitch it started at . <p> here 's how that same loop sounds pitched up to double speed in an audio editor before loading into the Volca , pitching back down using the Speed control and playing back at its original pitch and tempo : <p> In practice , the aliasing on the 8x pitched example might be a bit- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases. - If you 're using- single drum hits or one-shot samples , the next- step is a simple matter of picking the level of crushing that suits each of your sounds , loading up the Volca with retro , heavily crushed samples and then creating patterns- with the step sequencer or by triggering the unit over MIDI . <p> If- the sound you 're crushing is to be played back chromatically at different pitches , you can either motion sequence the Speed parameter , assign the same sound to multiple slots to be played polyphonically , or even just- resample the output into a software sampler to be played back in your DAW . The results are distinctive , full of character and incredibly effective for bringing that much-loved- vintage- sampler- sound into your productions . 
@@34419675 @3419675/ <h> Step 1 <p> Much of the sound design work in this patch revolves around tuning the oscillators and using Massives voicing section to generate- chords from single-note triggers . In house and garage- you can often get great results with minor 7th and minor 9th chords , but for this basic example well keep things simple with a minor triad , which consists of the root note , minor 3rd and 5th . <p> Create a new patch in Massive . Ensure all three oscillators are turned on and that the Amp setting for- each oscillator is turned fully up , then set the Pitch of Osc1 to 0.00 ( the root note ) , Osc2 to +3.00 semitones ( the minor 3rd ) and Osc3 to +7.00 semitones ( the 5th ) . Dial the Wt-position and Intensity to 100% for each oscillator . <p> The- MIDI pattern we 've used is show below , but you can program or play whatever pattern suits your track . <h> Step 2 <p> Move to the Voicing tab found in Massive 's centre panel . Click and drag up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2 . In the Unisono Spread panel to the right , turn Pitch Cutoff on , move the Pitch Cutoff slider all the way to the right and increase the number in the right-hand box to 5.00 by clicking and dragging upwards . This may push Massive 's output volume into the red ; if so , reduce the volume a touch . <h> Step 3 <p> With the raw patch established , its time to shape the sound for the purposes of the track . Let 's mellow it up to start with by clicking on the pull-down menu to the right of Filter 1 and choosing the Lowpass 4 filter setting . <p> At the same time , move the Filter Mix slider to the right of the Filter panel up to the top so only Filter 1 is affecting the patch . <p> Now set up a modulation envelope 1 ( 1Env ) to control Filter 1s cutoff frequency by clicking and dragging 1Envs blue crosshair in Massives central panel and dropping it into the first modulation slot below the Cutoff dial . <h> Step 4 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 , click and drag up on the blue-lit number 1 in the below modulation box to apply envelope modulation to the filter . We 've dialled it in at around the 2 oclock mark . <p> You can now play around with different filter and envelope settings to help the sound fit the vibe and groove of the wider track . In particular , play with the attack and decay envelope values , alongside the cutoff frequency and resonance values of Filter 1 . To get the sound in this example we 've chosen a farily swift attack and longer decay . <h> Step 5 <p> Adding some effects- really brings the sound to life . In this example we 've used a combination of Massive 's reverb and Dimension Expander . To set these up , go to the FX window and select Reverb from the FX1 pull-down menu and Dimension Expander from the FX2 pull-down . Tweak the values until you get a nice lush , harmonically interesting halo to the sound. - ( Anything from subtle distortion and chorus to snapback delay can also be introduced here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . ) <p> To thicken the tone further , try transposing the pitch of OSC1 down one octave ( -12 semitones ) . Now add some subtle detuning of OSC2 and OSC3 to give a nice warmth to the sound . Applying modulation to the- filter cutoff frequency , or automating the attack and decay of the amp envelope- adds tension ( note the way the sound- opens up in the third bar of the audio clip ) . <h> Step 6 <p> This is a great starting patch to experiment with . For a darker tone , try altering the Pitch values , Unisono voices and oscillator wavetables . In this example the pitch of OSC2 has been set to +5.00 semitones and the pitch of OSC3 to +8.00 semitones . The wavetables of both OSC2 and OSC3 ( selected from the drop-down menu to the right of OSC2 and OSC3 respectively ) have been changed to Strontium . <p> Now change the value of the Unisono Spread to 7.00 by clicking and dragging up in the box .

Even Roland , who entered the synth market a few years after the introduction of the Minimoog , produced the wonderful System 700 and System 100m modulars before switching their attention solely to fixed-architecture synths . <p> Moog and Rolands withdrawal from modular synth production " in 1981 and 1984 respectively " - was emblematic of a larger shift in electronic music trends which could be traced back to the introduction of the Minimoog in 1970 : musicians were increasingly turning to smaller , more compact and cheaper fixed-architecture synths . By the 90s , modular synths were widely considered an archaic relic of a bygone era , esoteric and interesting but barely relevant to modern musicians . <p> Amm explains that the modular synth resurgence began as a vintage revival targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems started becoming more scarce and sought-after , so companies like Modcan and Doepfer introduced new modular systems in the 90s to meet the demand .

" <p> Monster Modcan <p> Modcans Bruce Duncan began building modular synth equipment as a hobby in 1994 when he experienced a slow-down in his day job building prototype models for industrial designers . " I had always been fascinated with synthesisers and had owned many of the early polyphonic models from the late 70s onward , " he explains . " My first modular was a Serge , circa 1980 , which I bought locally second-hand . It had been assembled from a kit. - What got me started building was a need to expand the Serge . The filters and envelopes were lacking in my system and the cost for new Serge panels was beyond my financial capabilities at the time . I built a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could become a fun- secondary job for me when regular- day job- was slow . <p> " I met a guy who was a fellow synth nerd at a party and he knew a bit about HTML and helped me put together a very basic website which became modcan.com . I posted some of the early modules and started promoting- my work on the- Analogue Haven forum . Before long people were buying- modules to- augment their Serges and as free-standing- systems once I had enough modules to cover all the basics . I had a friend that had some under-employed buddies and they built the modules- for me in their bedrooms . I would drive over to their place and drop off the parts , boards and panels every time I received an order . <p> " It was very low production from about 1996 to 2004 . Maybe 100 modules a year , maximum .

" <h> Modulars go indie <p> While larger companies like Modcan and Doepfer led the way in revitalising the modular synth market during the late 1990s , they 've since been joined by a vast cottage industry of independent manufacturers. - Amm takes up the story : " The real resurgence started about six or seven years ago and has really ramped up in the last couple of years that 's basically when a lot of new , one-person start-up companies began popping up with their own modules , mainly in Doepfer-style Eurorack format . This Eurorack format is smaller and typically cheaper than modular systems of the past , so it really caught on . <p> " I think this is when it started to get really interesting , because its no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been thrown in too digital , analogue , valves , sampling , complex sequencing , interfacing between the modular and the computer DAW environment , just about anything you can think of . The increase in modular activity is really a result of the reciprocal relationship between the modular synthesiser manufacturers and their users ; the users crave more and more innovative sounds and approaches to synthesis , and there seems to be no shortage of new manufacturers who thrive on the challenge to contribute something unique to the pot . So I think a huge factor for the modular resurgence is fuelled by the fact that the internet allows this exchange of ideas and information . <p> " I think another significant reason has to do with the fact that electronic music is so common now , and people are burned out on hearing run-of-the-mill synth sounds , because they 're everywhere .

I wanted every nuance , noise and distortion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was used to it in my own studio environment. - Every hit of every drum machine and every key of every preset in every synth was recorded at 24-bit quality through various channel strips , such as the Focusrite ISA 430 and Neve 1073 , via the Prism Orpheus soundcard which in my opinion gives the clearest AD conversion Ive yet heard . The result was stunning " not just for the raw , warm , punchy sound but also in the subtle flaws and signal noise that just added to the character . <p> While I was in LA I sought to fill the gaps in the collection by hiring rarer synths not in my possession " such as the Roland Jupiter-8 and Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 " with the sole purpose of multi-sampling as many sounds as I possibly could . I 'd build my own patches " crazy wide pads and rumbling basses " making sure each hit was sampled at every possible velocity and filter setting , sometimes leading to 180 samples in just one patch . <p> After a few weeks of enjoying the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love . Many would feel perturbed at the idea of giving away sounds theyd spent years building from synths theyd spent even longer blagging , begging and borrowing to pay for . However Sample Magic had never done anything like this before . I was n't particularly impressed by many of the vintage synth virtual instruments on the market . The sounds were shoddy , tired and stereotyped with the GUIs messy and ill thought out . The prices were often outrageous with very poor value for money and an over reliance on features I could never see used . My collection needed a full release . <p> I connected with Matt Fudge , whod developed the amazing Transistor Revolution packs for Wave Alchemy . Over a six month period we sketched and mapped out a GUI that made full use of everything Kontakt had to offer . The patches really started to come to life " stereo enhancers , reverbs , step-time sequencers , unison , detune and tape warmth added hugely to what was already there . We built Ableton racks using macros , filters , reverbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We created a separate drum module , where I used combinations of drum machines and my own personal drum hits to make customised kits , programming over 100 original loops using the inbuilt sequencer Matt scripted. - Each drum machine hit was sampled at every possible pitch , tune , decay and snap setting with the ability to cycle through these sounds innovatively using just eight pads . The ability to have separate effects- and output assignments on each hit was paramount . Matts skill and Kontakts functionality made this a breeze . <p> Lastly we need to make sure Bloq looked slick . We could n't just take existing analogue synth design and re-hash it cheekily . I wanted original logos , looks and feels with every control , knob and button looking familiar enough to induce nostalgia but still be unique enough to feel like a new instrument . <h> Favourite Patches &amp; Features <p> Retro Polychord This came from the Clavia Nord Lead 3 , which is hands down one of my favourite synths of all time .

It reminds me of the old liquid drum and bass records of the late 90s , with a feel reminiscent of LTJ Bukem or a rave tune . <p> Warm Jupiter 6 Pad The workhorse pad of the collection . This is just a couple of saw oscillators stacked with a bit of low pass filter from inside the Jupiter . The stereo width and unison within Kontakt really bring it to life . I 've used this sound on so many tracks over the years . The filters on Kontakt make this sound even more lush . <p> JP8 Scream Lead Ive never heard a warmer and fatter sound than the Jupiter-8 . I made over 50 patches in a manic three-day sampling spree , but only a handful made the final cut . The raw sound was so loud and punchy we did virtually no post processing to the final sound . <p> Raw 303 Acid Seq I spent ages sampling the TB-303 and it was a real pain . Because I have a non-modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each note across each octave within a step time programming menu . Once we finally had it in Kontakt we made extensive use of the internal sequencer to create as dynamic a patch as possible . It sounds like its come straight out of the TB-303 , sequence and all . <p> EBM Bass Seq This one came from the Sequential Circuits Pro-One . I wanted this to be as close as possible to something Vince Clarke would do ! Again the Kontakt sequencer was indispensable here . <p> 808 Kit Enough said really . They do n't  come punchier and fatter than this . We spent a whole day sampling the machine and making sure everything was perfect from signal-to-noise ratio , right down to the quality of cables we used and the subtle attack we added to the snare hits using the Empirical Labs Distressor . <h> Essential Gear <p> Roland Jupiter 6 used on about six or seven of the patches .

Oh , and that iconic branding certainly has n't  done them any harm , either . <p> Signed to PMR , the Island Records-backed label which is also home to Julio Bashmore , Cyril Hahn , T Williams and Jessie Ware , the duo have enjoyed chart success with the likes of Latch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me features the vocal talents of London singer-songwriter Eliza Doolittle. - In this edition of The Breakdown , well look at some of the elements that make You And Me so effective . <h> " Pop-Structured Songs " <p> In a recent interview in The Guardian , Howard Lawrence refers to Disclosures tracks as " pop-structured songs in the style of house music and garage " , and its this simple formula that works to such great effect in You And Me . <p> The duos output incorporates both four-to-the-floor house rhythms ( Latch , White Noise ) and more broken rhythms which often draw from 2-step garage ( Tenderly , Flow ) . You And Me falls into the latter category , with a propulsive swung garage beat which changes subtly throughout the track . The beats almost constantly shifting , but to get an idea of the general pattern here 's a simplified transcription of a two-bar section in the second verse ( kick in blue , snare in red , hats in purple and yellow ) : <p> The track follows a simple verse , chorus , bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Disclosures music follows structures typically associated with pop music : clearly defined verse and chorus sections and relatively short tracks . Although the brothers often draw on the sonic palette of deep house , they do n't  tend to go for the drawn-out arrangements so often found in that genre . Instead , their tracks typically clock in somewhere around five minutes even before a radio edit ; this is dance music which makes no apologies for taking inspiration from the instant gratification of pop . <p> In You And Me , a number of techniques are used to build anticipation of the choruses . Let 's look at a few things about the tracks verses that build up so effectively to the catchy hook of the chorus. - Firstly , note that the verse features only one chord throughout ( a Bbm7 ) . - Half way through the first verse , at 0:28 , the rhythmic bassline is introduced , playing the Bb as the Bbm7 chord on top slowly develops a rhythm . <p> At the same point in the second- verse ( this time with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by changing from closed hi-hats in the first half of the verse to the open ones at 1:56 . <p> The rhythmic Bbm7 chord sustained throughout the verse is also filtered , with the filter cutoff frequency gradually rising throughout to create the anticipation .

The vocal mix of last years I Wan na Know , from the EP of the same name , is the perfect example . Let 's investigate- and see what makes this floor-filler tick . <h> Structure <p> The structure of I Wan na Know is based on eight-bar sections strung together , a traditional house-inspired approach . However , the sections are all relatively unique , resulting in a free-flowing structure that , from a melodic point of view at least , is unusually non-repetitive . An extended , 24-bar , DJ-friendly intro gradually introduces elements such as kick drum , percussion and synth before the vocal hook and bassline join in . From this point , there 's a varied arrangement of sections strung together with different combinations of drums , percussion , bass and synth parts . Combine this with the variety of vocal parts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which part is verse , chorus , tag , bridge or middle right in the conventional sense , meaning that there 's a lot here to keep the listener interested . <h> Sound Palette <p> It almost goes without saying that the sound palette of the- track is one of the key stylistic cues , evoking memories of classic Chicago- house and synth pop . Vintage drum machine percussion , bright and thin synth brass , rubbery synth bass and retro vocal effects are all in full effect here . <p> The notes on the record give some clues as to the sound sources : " Recorded with .. Alesis HR-16 , TSA-Tape Memo Recorder , &amp; Casio Rapmaster ! " The HR-16 and Casio Rapman ( also sold as the- Realistic Rap-Master ) are self-explanatory , even if the TSA-Tape Memo Recorder is a little more obscure . <h> Drum Track <p> The track runs at a solid 122 bpm . A four-to-the-floor kick drum part with alternating open hi-hats forms the framework to the rhythm track , with an embellishment of drum machine percussion including claps and tambourine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements shown below , in a section taken from the later part of the extended intro , around 23 seconds in : <p> In the intro , the handclap sample plays just on the fourth beat of every other bar , over the 4/4 kick drum and heavily-reverbed tambourine hits , building tension before main beat comes in . By the time the main chorus arrives at 1:18 , the clap is playing on the two and four of every bar . <p> Other percussion includes a timbale sample , that makes a sudden surprise appearance towards the end of the tune at around 4:35 , and a rapid castanet loop that also features prominently throughout , from about 1:00 until the very end of the track . <h> Chord Progression <p> The musical landscape of the track is dominated by a bright , brassy synth riff that 's actually the second thing you hear after the introductory drum and percussion sequence . The song is in the key of A minor , and the chords alternate between Am and F , but far from just plonking out the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note missing from the chord , which adds an element of harmonic variety to what is essentially a very basic pattern . <p> Here 's what the main riff is playing , taken from when it first comes in after 31 seconds : <p> A secondary part , featuring eighth-note stabs played by the same sound , also features prominently in sections of the tune , making a first appearance at around 1:55 and fading in again at 3:15 to herald the start of the second bass line , described below . Running alongside this part is what sounds like a faint analogue synth pad playing half-time chords on the offbeats , poking in a sneaky G major on the last chord in every fourth bar for a bit of tonal colour . <h> Bass line <p> The bass lines " for there are two of them in this track- " remain solid and unmoving , each stamping its authority on its own section of the track . The main bass synth , in the first half of the tune and again at the very end , plays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few notes of the reversed A minor scale : A , G , F , E and D. <p> Towards the end of the track , from 4:03 onwards , a second bassline takes over , played by a thicker , wider and more detuned analogue synth sound and an ascending , rather than descending , part . It goes a little something like this : <h> Vocals <p> Courtesy of vocalist James Garcia , the vocal is steeped in analogue-style delay . Much of it is double tracked in low and high octaves , with no pitch correction applied . This gives it a natural feel which is in keeping with the era it 's designed to emulate " there was no Autotune in 1988 ! <p> In terms of melody , you could n't accuse the vocal part of being repetitive , as there are more than six different vocal hooks on display here , which makes for an entertaining listening experience and a near-instant vocal house classic .

David Felton puts the latest incarnation of iZotopes one-stop vocal solution to the test . <p> The trend towards all-in-ones " plugins that do a bit of everything " has been gathering pace in recent years . Whether that 's part of an innate societal drive towards simplicity ( the Waves OneKnob series representing the logical end point ) or the twin trend to make usage-specific plugins , iZotopes- Nectar 2 does a bit of both . <p> Marketed as a vocal production all-in-one , Nectar offers all the tools that the vocal producer would typically call upon , from compressor and gate to EQ and de-esser . Reverb and delay take care of ambient processing . More esoteric tools for less regular treatment include a powerful harmoniser , saturation and a range of lo-fi and modulation effects . ( A Production Suite bundle is also available for an additional $70 , adding Pitch Editor and Breath Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Download and installation is swift and intuitive . The free trial edition is a simple download and launches with the options to purchase the full product or use the demo for ten days. - Looks are , in typical iZotope fashion , clean and classy " elegant greys and tan with key information in orange . The GUI does an excellent job of keeping key information , from EQ to compression levels , on the main panel . Toggling away from Overview to Advanced mode gives you an insight into the power beneath the bodywork , with each of the modules given its own page in which the apparently simple options on the Overview panel can be tweaked , sometimes to extraordinary detail . <p> Looks are , in typical iZotope fashion , clean and classy <p> Interaction with the GUI is nice ; real-time visual feedback on everything from frequency information in the EQ section to gain reduction in the compressor helps refine settings . The real-time gain reduction chart , overlaid on the treated audios waveform , is a very nice touch indeed . Elsewhere , the click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making frequency manipulation easy . <h> Classic inspiration <p> The analogue factor is a key part of the sales drive of Nectar 2 . The marketing material is laden with references to classic , analogue and retro . Motown is the inspiration behind the twin analogue-modelled compressors and the EMT 140 plate gets a namedrop as the model for the redesigned reverb unit . With producers across the board looking to the sounds of yesterday for inspiration , the move makes sense . But its not all retro . The option to create distinctly 21st-century auto-tuned effects demonstrates iZotopes decision to blend the best of the past with the vocal producers needs of today . <p> A case in point is the EQ . Here , the restrictive models of the past are eschewed in favour of a hugely versatile 5-band EQ . Each band can be set to a range of filters : low shelf , high shelf , low-pass , high-pass or Baxandall . These can then be further shaped with , yes , you guessed it , Analog or Vintage options . Its certainly a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible curves to shape any vocal . <p> The compressor offers four models : Digital , Vintage , Optical and Solid State . When launched in Advanced mode , you can shape the sound in the ways you would expect , with both peak and RMS settings on offer as well as a parallel mode that splits the signal and feeds each part to a different compressor . In both cases , the wet/dry balance can be set to allow for parallel processing anyway . iZotope offers excellent compression tools in Ozone and the same is true here , the plugin doing anything from gentle taming to ruthless dynamics-bashing with ease and , where you want , a sheen of old-school character . <p> Of particular note to electronic music producers is the Saturation unit which offers five flavours of analogue-style warmth , from Tape mode to Tube to just , um , Warmth . Sometimes just adding 20% or so saturation can be enough to give a vocal a little low and mid girth ; more can bring serious clout to an already ballsy vocal . Although the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each is worth an audition . <p> The Saturation unit offers five flavours of analogue-style warmth , from Tape mode to Tube to just , um , Warmth . <h> Space <p> Ambient effects are taken care of with a dedicated reverb and delay unit. - The reverb " a weak link in the original version of Nectar " has been given a radical overhaul , although its still not perfect . Where the plugin offers various flavours for other key functions , it seems a little strange to confine users to plate-style reverb " where are the room and halls ? And though no one would deny the evergreen utility of plate treatments on a range of vocals , it seems a slightly odd limitation . Furthermore , the decay times , true to the original EMT plate , only stretch as long as 5 seconds and as low as 1 . Still , its a solid recreation of the 140 , nearly standing up to the officially licensed UAD version , and the addition of saturation and width alongside low- and high-cut filters certainly give the producer enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice . <p> By contrast , the delay unit offers considerably more choice . Digital , Tape and Analogue settings bestow varying levels of warmth to the signal , with controls over everything from delay time and feedback to stereo width and the lo-fi Trash setting . A modulation panel offers enough control for tape-style wow and flutter . <p> A notable mention should go to the de-esser , which has just two settings " a central frequency and a slider that reduces sibilant frequencies . De-essers can be hugely hit and miss , but the algorithms employed here " apparently based on the DBX 902- " - do an amazingly intuitive job across a range of different sound sources . Nectar certainly holds its own against dedicated units like my usual go-to tool , the UAD Precision De-Esser.

@@34419685 @3419685/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Gear/Software <h> A Bit Deeper : Exploring the New Features in Bitwig Studio 2 <p> The much-hyped DAW was updated earlier this year . Jonny Strinati has been exploring- the new features in version 2 <p> Released in late February this year , Bitwig Studio 2 features many improvements dnd upgrades , new devices , a fresh take on modulation , better hardware integration , and much more . One of the unique qualities of the original release- was the quick and customisable workflow , and with version 2 Bitwig- look to expand on this concept , offering a hands-on semi-modular approach . Here we take closer a look at some of our favourite new features . <h> Modulators <p> Probably the most notable addition to Bitwig 2 comes in the form of- the brand new modulators , ranging from standard LFOs and envelopes to more unique controllers such as Math and Vector-8 . Modulators can be- directed to any parameter ( or modulator ) within a- device , offering near infinite sonic possibilities . <p> Of the new modulators , Steps offers step-sequence-based modulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you can change the speed , number of steps , direction and even randomise the whole modulator . <p> Vector-8 allows you to apply up to eight different vectors to parameters on your device , which are then controlled by movements to the XY axis contained within . I found the results more experimental than measured , but sometimes that 's what messing around in the studio is all about . <p> There are a few well-equipped LFOs , as well as a Random modulator , which behaves pretty much like an LFO , randomising values it 's directed to with tempo sync and tweakable wave shapes . The modulators seriously enhance the power and flexibility of whatever you direct them to ; there is no limit on how many you can add to a device , and some can be set to polyphonic , offering per-voice modulation . <p> Any VST plugin can be also be controlled via the modulators , allowing for advanced manipulation of your favourite synthesiser or effect . The modulators you set up will save with the preset , and if you find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily save this as a default , speeding up such workflow . <h> New Polysynth <p> Bitwig 's main synth , Polysynth , has received a bit of an overhaul for version 2 . Many of the modulators have been removed , bar the envelopes ( the revamped modulation system rendering them obsolete ) . There are now six oscillator blend modes , altering the behaviour when applying changes to the oscillator mix control , allowing for amplitude modulation , phase cancellation and more . <p> In addition to the main filter section , there is now a sweepable high-pass filter ( with- 12 or 24 dB slopes ) . The cutoff frequency only goes as high as- 500 Hz , so presumably this is intended more as a functional mix tool than anything creative . <p> There are also improvements to the unison capabilities of the synth , where you can control the width of each oscillator and also pan each one individually in the stereo field . A welcome addition , and great for taming overly wide basses or creating rich stereo leads . <p> Also added are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both great for applying some attitude or timbral shaping . <p> Of course , the modulators really open up the creative possibilities with Polysynth . Being able to modulate any parameter on the synth with any number of LFOs , envelopes , XY controls , or whatever else you fancy . On the face of it , this synth is relatively stripped back , but the sound design can go seriously deep . <h> Spectrum AnalySer <p> Arguably essential in any DAW , one of the new devices included in Bitwig 2 is a spectrum analyser offering adjustable left , right , mid or side analysis. - What I found to be extremely useful with this device was the secondary input , allowing you to compare the frequency graph of two different audio sources " handy when identifying frequency masking during the mix process . <p> All in all , this is a really nice analyser . The only thing I missed when using this on my master channel- was an option to enlarge the view , something Bitwig- may hopefully add in a future update . It 's fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when monitoring the frequency balance of a whole mix it 's always nice to maximise screen capacity . <p> You 'll also notice a spectrum analyser now features on many of the other devices , such as EQ , Filter , Phaser and Treemonster , offering an instant representation of the frequency shaping taking place . <h> Other New Devices <p> In addition to the spectrum analyser , we also have a number of other new devices . <p> Phaser is a stereo phaser effect , with familiar modulation controls . The default device loads with an LFO assigned to the phaser frequency , and is great for quickly adding pleasant movement and modulation to an audio source . Clicking and dragging on the analyser is a cool way to change various parameters with one mouse gesture . <p> Treemonster , described by Bitwig as " an amplitude controlled ring modulator with a life of its own " , has a very crunchy sound , almost bit-crushed to an extent . The filter , threshold and mix controls offer plenty of flexibility in terms of processing , allowing for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> New Note EFFECTS <p> A number of new note effects- have now been added , presenting quite an impressive array of tools at our disposal for MIDI sequencing . <p> Multi-Note is a chord device , capable of generating up to seven notes with adjustable pitch and velocity . Note Echo allows you to create quite unique echo effects and includes a repetition button for looping " awesome for creating synth trills and arpeggiated delays . Other new devices in this category include Note Length and Note Velocity , which can effectively reduce the need for fiddly piano-roll-based MIDI editing . <h> Remote Controls <p> Every device now comes with a Remote Controls panel , providing new- access to- your instrument and effect settings . I found this a useful way to pull out favourite parameters from a- chain and make them accessible from one page . It 's also great for optimising screen space when working with VSTs : mapping parameters to the Remote Controls panel reduces the need to open the plugin , handy when a synth GUI takes up the whole screen . Mappings can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware controller , allowing you to customise pages and add knobs , buttons and choosers . <h> Hardware Devices <p> Better integration with outboard equipment is another new feature in Bitwig 2 , provided by a series of hardware devices aimed to ease workflow when using external- synths- or outboard- effects . <p> You can , as with all devices , add in the modulators , so if you own some MIDI-controlled hardware this becomes seriously fun , allowing you to add any number of LFOs , envelopes , note effects , and more . <p> Although not MIDI CC compatible , running my SH-101 through some of the modulators seriously enhanced the sound design potential . Adding a couple of filters , modulated by a series of LFOs , a step sequencer and XY controls , and then assigning some of the modulation parameters to my Maschine controller allowed for some very creative playback . <h> In Summary <p> The modulators are the big winners for me in Bitwig Studio 2 , really enhancing the semi-modular feel of this DAW . Many of the these are n't  necessarily new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works a charm , being readily available in unlimited quantities with each and every device . This makes the music creation process very expressive , creating your own unique modulation chains , incorporating audio , synths , samplers , MIDI and hardware . The scope for creative potential is mind boggling . <p> There 's also lots going on under the hood with Bitwig 2 : a customisable toolbar , VST3 support ( but still no AU for Mac users ) , increased audio editing capability ( with the introduction of fades and crossfades ) and general workflow improvements . All in all , this makes Bitwig a serious contender in the DAW market . I believe they 're carving a niche here , offering a creatively different approach to music production . This release should put an end to at least- some of the Ableton comparisons , as this DAW really comes into its own with version 2.

The Minilogue is a game changer , and its success this year was thoroughly deserved. - Weve already- had time to get acquainted with its- little brother , the Monologue , which is due out imminently , and we have no doubt that itll be just as popular . <p> The modular synth sector feels more mature than ever , with many of the companies that sprang up over the last few years really finding their feet and establishing even stronger identities in 2016 .

At just G449/$499 for a 17-voice drum machine its an unprecedented bargain . We would n't be surprised to see other manufacturers follow suit in 2017 .

The return of the Technics SL-1200 feels superficially important , reflecting the much-hyped comeback of vinyl , but its not really as significant as it first appears . OK , we 've seen a lot of interest in reissued synths over recent years , but the reason a reissued Minimoog or ARP Odyssey matters is that the originals are rare , valuable and fragile . <p> By comparison , SL-1200s tick none of those boxes. - Glance at eBay , Craigslist or your local newspaper and you 'll find plenty for sale .

This is definitely a case where its- pointless trying to- pick the best out of the four , not least because they 're each- impressive in their own way , but also because they all do things so differently . Its truly a case of more choice being a good thing . <p> As to what 's coming for 2017 , time will tell .

The kick is quite boomy , which would be fine if it was the only low end element in our track , but in order to fit a bass or sub bass in between the kicks we 'll need to clean up the kick a bit . <h> Step 2 <p> To begin , load up an instance of Fabfilter Pro-C 2 , if you do n't have Pro-C , your host DAW 's native compressor should be able to achieve similar effects . The idea of this type of compression is to leave the attack portion of the sound unprocessed and flatten the sustain , so we start by backing the attack control off all the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Step 3 <p> Currently there is only around 1 dB of compression being applied . Pro-C 2 has various different compression styles available depending on the type of effect you 're going for . Well click the Style menu and select Pumping from the list . This instantly creates a much more aggressive type of compression , almost reducing the tail of the kick completely . <p> Next , we back off the threshold to around -16 dB to soften this effect slightly ( the exact threshold will depend on the level of the sound you 're feeding in to your own compressor go by sound rather than numbers here ) . Now you can hear a much more punchy kick , with space in between the drums for a bass sound . <h> Step 5 <p> Using compression , we can also increase the sustain portion of this kick drum . Well load up a compressor on another version of the same- kick channel , - but this- time well use a fast attack , fast release , a ratio of 7:1 , and bring the threshold to -12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compression being applied . These settings are squashing the transient of the kick a bit , but also bringing up the body and sustain .

Kristan Caryl talks to Optimos JD Twitch about a much-maligned aspect of electronic music . <p> Trance was n't always a dirty word in house and techno circles . As hard as it may be to believe it given the state of trance in 2014 , the genre did n't  start and end with German and Dutch titans like Paul van Dyk and Armin Van Buuren . From the famed hippie trail party scene in Goa to transcendental sounds like Asia 's Qawwali movement and even the KLF 's late eighties output , the concept of trance in music- has roots in many different cultures and countries . <p> Sadly , though , during the 90s , the term became appropriated by the aforementioned emotional overlords who were insistent on loading up tracks with the most overtly teary-eyed melodies and pseudo-celestial breakdowns . Yet attempts to reclaim the term have cropped up on a number of occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Omar-S with his ubiquitous hit Here 's Your Trance Now Dance , Brit Evian Christ with his Dipset-inspired Trance Party nights and of course the Border Community crew and their modern re-interpretations of a genre whose main aim is to lull you into a half-awake , half-asleep , partly-conscious state of uplifting emotional reflection and spiritual calm . <p> Someone who has never been afraid to dip his toe into trance when playing one of his notoriously widescreen sets is Optimo 's JD Twitch . As such , we tapped up the Scot to get his views on the issue . <p> Attack : When did you first become aware of trance in music ? <p> JD Twitch : I used to use the term long before it was used in reference to dance music . As a teenager I listened to lots of repetitive , hypnotic music " be that electronic or rock " and regarded that as trance . When acid house first came along a lot of people initially referred to it as trance dance . The first KLF records in the late 80s were branded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 90s until the precursor to what most people think of as trance started pouring out of mainly Germany around 1992/3 . <p> As far as what I thought of as trance , the initial things I loved were actually from New York ; records like the Lost Entity and Code 6 releases on Nu Groove , by Joey Beltram , Mundo Muziques Andromeda , Dreamworld by Ego Trip , the Atmosphere label , some Belgian records such as Phantasias Inner Light , No Promises by The Mackenzie and Age Of Love . A little later the Germans developed their take on it and I liked early Jam &amp; Spoon and Air Liquide , early MFS , Harthouse and Eye Q and records such as Mihon by Ongaku and lots of obscure one-off records I no longer recall . In the UK , some releases on Guerrilla and Sabres of Paradidse and also records from Holland on ESP , Djax and See Saw . Some of these are timeless , especially the New York ones , while many of them havent aged so well . <p> Why did it appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also a bit of a contrast to some of the harder post-rave sounds . Although I never really thought about it at the time , it probably complemented a lot of peoples drug experiences and feelings of euphoria . It was when all this got amped up to the nth degree and the music became cynically euphoric and generic that I lost interest . By the time progressive house " posh trance " and your ATBs had come along I 'd long since lost interest . <p> So what exactly is the characteristic that makes something trancey ' , do you think ? There seems to be a split between trance that induces an uplifting rush and trance that grips you in a kind of mindless , hypnagogic state <p> I generally avoid anything that has a y on the end . Trancey , jazzy , etc " all horrible and diluted . I remember frequently in the early 90s being asked if I could play something trancey and feeling a little queasy every time . To me trance comes from transcendental and is hypnotic , perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is almost as meaningless as trance now ) , - hypnagogic and even healing , especially with regard to something as transcendental as say Pandit Pran Naths music . <p> I remember frequently in the early 90s being asked if I could play something ' trancey ' and feeling a little queasy every time . <p> This probably makes me sound like some sort of pretentious old hippie but I do think there is a thread that goes back through the ages to the primal , hypnotic music of when we were living in a very primitive society that has some deep beneficial effect on us we perhaps do n't  fully understand , or have forgotten how to understand . I think a lot of psy-trance fans probably thought the same but added too many drugs , juggling and ridiculously fast tempos to the equation and thus lost the point a bit . <p> Where does the genre start for you ? Maybe the EBM groups of the 70s ? Have you ever traced it in that way ? <p> psy-trance added too many drugs , juggling and ridiculously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance goes , perhaps Terry Riley was the first ? Then on through Cluster , Harmonia , Conrad Schnitzler , Tangerine Dream , even Kraftwerk and a legion of other Germans ( not forgetting Giorgio Moroder I Feel Love surely being an all-time trance classic . Cerrones Supernature too ) through to some Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire on to Chris &amp; Cosey , lots of obscure cosmic disco and Euro disco , some German NDW " lots of that now gets called minimal synth " some EBM , some Belgian new beat , acid house , etc , etc . If one bypasses all the crap trance , that thread continues through to a lot of modern electronic disco , Border Community and acts such as Fuck Buttons , Factory Floor and Oneohtrix Point Never to name just a few . So , I think it is possible to trace it in myriad ways . 
@@34419693 @3419693/ <p> When it comes to mixing , the proclamation to use your ears is well worn " and largely accurate . However , that platitude- can easily obscure the fact that there are trends , conventions and aesthetic decisions involved in that process . <p> In this feature well analyse the mixes of five contrasting tracks , demonstrating how their approaches differ . Were focusing on two key aspects here : the use of the frequency range and the use of the dynamic range . Of course , there are countless other variables which determine the sound of a mix " use of the stereo field , ambience , noise and distortion , and so on " but , as well see , these two key factors can tell us a lot about any mix . <p> Our- tracks span 25 years and a range of genres , using a range of- different instrumentation . When compared , they should provide some interesting insights into the way mixdowns have evolved over the years . <h> Good Life <p> A good place to start with any audio analysis is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's go all the way back to 1988 and one of the defining tracks of modern electronic- dance music . <p> Here , the original version of Inner City 's timeless classic Good Life ' is compared to a version of the same track taken from a more recent compilation album . For reference , here 's the original : <p> The first thing to notice is that the version taken from the compilation album ( the lower of the two waveforms ) is shorter . The structure of the track is otherwise identical " either the need to squeeze more tracks on to the album meant adding an early fade , or the compilers assumed that modern listeners werent interested in the extended outro . <p> More importantly , the original is far more unruly in terms of signal level . Even at this resolution its clear that the edited version on the compilation has undergone some dynamic processing . In this case it looks like limiting during the mastering process is the culprit . This gives the waveform display of the compilation version a noticeable flatness across the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of bringing up the average level . This is ultimately perceived as greater loudness . The compilation version has probably been compressed or limited- in order to keep up- with- the loudness war of the last couple of decades . <p> Intriguingly , the peak level of the second version is lower than the first ( approximately -2 dB ) . We can see this more clearly by zooming in : <p> This difference was perhaps due to level adjustment between tracks at the compilation stage , though the ultimate cause is difficult to pinpoint without speaking to those in question . <p> This difference in perceived loudness is borne out by the stats . Here we 've run both tracks through an EBU R128 analysis ( the European Broadcasting Union 's recommended loudness and level standard see here ) : <p> The original ( on the left ) has a lower Integrated Loudness ( the average loudness over the whole track ) despite the larger peaks . <p> Notice also the different maximum True Peak levels . This is measured using an algorithm to calculate potential inter-sample peaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . This may appear counterintuitive , but this peak beyond 0 dBFS ' issue is something that may arise during mixing , mastering and format conversion ( WAV to MP3 etc ) . <p> Something that was noticeable when listening to both versions is the comparative brightness of the original . This is the frequency plot of the original : <p> And this is the compilation ' version after being adjusted to match the low-frequency level of the first : <p> Look closely and you 'll notice that there is level difference of over 5 dB at 5 kHz , and at 15 kHz it 's more than 10 dB. - Despite this , the overall shape of both is what we might expect , with a gentle rolling off in level moving from low to high frequencies . This will often dip more dramatically from 10-20 kHz . <p> What conclusions can we draw from this analysis ? First of all , its important to bear in mind that Kevin Saunderson was aiming for clean , clear production with his Inner City tracks of the late 80s. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateurish " terms like lo-fi , rough and dirty are thrown around " - but the truth is that the mix on Good Life has a lot in common with the pop production trends of the day. - There are plenty of late-80s mix characteristics here " the use of dynamic range , the relatively busy arrangement and the use of frequencies ( with , as well see , less of an emphasis on bass than most modern mixes ) .

Following the release of their debut album , They Are Among Us , last year , Mason are now touring with an elaborate stage show . <p> We caught up with the Iason and Coen to chat about their philosophy on artist albums , Dutch hip hop and Coens relentless quest to build the ultimate modular synth . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently ? <p> Coen : Working ridiculous hours in the studio and touring in between . Were playing mainly live at the minute , more than doing DJ sets . With the live show its the two of us on stage , playing our own tracks with a whole bunch of gear and instruments , as well as a synchronised light and video system we created . Its quite different from the DJing that Iason does by himself , as were touring with shitloads of equipment and programming all the venue lights to get it synced up. - With the live show we cant just walk in with a CD case ten minutes before the show . It takes hours of preparations , especially for our tech guys , but the show makes it worth the extra effort . <p> Apart from that were busy running our Animal Language label too , which is heading for its 25th release . <p> Do you still get to have a good time when you play live or is it a lot more stressful ? <p> Iason : Its always a kick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . Playing live is a lot more difficult than DJing , to be honest , so we make sure we start drinking and partying after the shows , not during . There 's just too much that can go wrong , so we need to stay sharp . But yeah work hard , play hard ! <p> What kind of setup are you working with in the studio ? <p> Iason : We like to combine the best of both worlds , so we mix in Logic and use shitloads of plugins like everybody else but we also work with lots of vintage synths and analogue effects . Our main interface is the Apogee Ensemble and our favourite compressor is the Manley VariMu. - Coens always busy with his never-ending wall of modular synths , which can just do about anything . These days working hybrid is much easier , so we can just route any audio through any of the analogue synths or effects and nothing needs to be replugged. - We also love the Expert Sleepers Silent Way software which let 's you send CV signals via your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control your ancient CV gear . That 's insane ! <p> Perfect ( Exceeder ) was such a huge success. - Did it open a lot of doors for you or was there a downside to having a big crossover hit like that ? <p> Iason : It opened up many doors , and from that moment on our life became a few hundred times more hectic with touring and remixing . It was mainly great to finally have a good window of people listening to your music , which is kinda what you want as a musician . Obviously we had labels breathing down our neck to make 3,412 new Exceeder-sounding ripoffs , but we did n't  really dig doing that , so we just went our own way , trying to keep stuff original . Luckily we still have a good fan base , who appreciate that choice , which were grateful for . <p> Coen : We could have collected ten dancefloor tracks and called it an album much earlier , but we wanted to do something different , and make a more pop-influenced album . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes and they all have crazy schedules so it took some time to nail these these tracks down . On the side we were still releasing all kinds of club tracks , but it was nice to balance that out with more pop stuff , as were both big collectors of present and past pop music . Its also a bit boring to only make club stuff 24/7 . <p> Do you think its important for dance musicians to make albums which can be listened to as a whole ? The kind of album you 'd put on at home , rather than just , as you say , a collection of tracks ? <p> Iason : A random collection of Beatport tracks does n't  feel like an album to us . An album is meant to be listened to from beginning to end , and should tell some kind of story . If you 're listening to an album like that you do n't  want to have boring one minute DJ intros and outros . <p> Its too bad the markets moving away from an album mentality . Without sounding like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all about albums but iTunes kind of changed that .

People like R+is+n Murphy , Aqualung and Sway were up for it , then we did the collaborations in every possible way : flying people to Amsterdam , flying ourselves to various places and renting local studios , working remotely , sending vocal takes over email <p> Creatively , the best thing is always to sit in the same room with a vocalist and throw ideas back and forth . This way you can work together on melody and lyrics , and pass ideas back and forth .

Anyone who 's had the opportunity to play a modern replica of an early fortepiano will know just how different they sound and feel in comparison to their modern equivalents .

Its not released until January , but Greg Scarth has spent the last- couple of weeks getting to know it <p> Over the last few years , it 's become standard practice for synth manufacturers to develop a single model into a full product range . Take , for example , Arturia , who gave us the MiniBrute , then the smaller MicroBrute , expanded the concept into the much bigger MatrixBrute and then took a sharp left turn with the announcement of the DrumBrute : the Brute name signifies not just a shared aesthetic , but also common synth circuitry and design philosophy . So here , less than a year after the Minilogue was introduced , the new- Korg Monologue arrives looking like a stripped-down version of Tatsuya Takahashi 's hugely popular analogue polysynth . In the case , appearances are deceptive : internally , the Monologue is n't just a cut-price Minilogue , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know what made the Minilogue such an instant hit , get familiar with our review from earlier this year and our interview with its designer , Tats , because the shared DNA sets the framework on which the Monologue will inevitably be judged. - Side by side with its bigger brother , the new synth is clearly from the same family . It 's smaller , of course , but there 's a similar front panel layout to the controls and an equally attractive wooden panel on the rear . The front panel itself is flat rather than curved like the Minilogue , but it still looks and feels like a quality piece of kit and as an added bonus it 's also available in a range of colours this time around . Overall , the Monologue possesses the same impressive build quality of the bigger synth , with solid , PCB-mounted potentiometers and the same OLED screen with built-in oscilloscope . The pitch bend slider even feels more solid and well-built- than the identical control on my first-production-run Minilogue . <p> Switch the two synths on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately clear that its not quite as simple as saying that the Monologue is a stripped-down version of the Minilogue with a few features missing . For a start , there are important differences in the synth circuits : the oscillators are largely similar to those of the Minilogue , but VCO 2 forgoes its pulse wave option in favour of a noise generator setting . Most notably , the filter is a new circuit . This time it 's a fixed 2-pole model as opposed to the two switchable units in the Minilogue , and its sonic character seems to fall somewhere in between the classic Roland TB-303 filter and Korg 's own MS-10/MS-20 low-pass filter depending on what you feed into it and how you modulate it . It 's best with the drive control pushed up slightly , giving it an aggressive , naughty tone . Turn up the resonance a little and it also moves into acid territory , squelching and burbling nicely in combination with the sequencer 's slide option . The drive control ( which operates an analogue overdrive circuit right at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself wanting slightly more gain on a few sounds . In some cases it breaks up the signal quite heavily , but the intensity of the effect seems to depend a lot on other parameters. - <p> The modulation section is quite substantially different to the Minilogue in practice , with a single ( and basic ) envelope generator to control amplitude , oscillator pitch or filter cutoff , plus an LFO to control pitch , wave shape or cutoff . Rather than the now-commonplace four-stage ADSR approach , the envelope can operate either as an AR type or ASR , with a third- setting that routes- the gate signal straight to the VCA , freeing up the AR envelope for modulation . The simplified envelope- does feel- like a cost cutting exercise ( or possibly just a matter of fitting the controls into limited front panel space ) , and it would definitely have been nice to have more flexibility . There 's no doubt that it 's nowhere near as flexible as the Minilogue 's dual ADSR envelopes , but it still just about gets the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LFO is actually more powerful than the Minilogue 's , with the ability to operate at extremely high frequencies for FM sounds , or to act as a one-shot modulation source . All in all , the modulation section is certainly unorthodox compared to most modern synths , but it gets the job done . It 's really more a question of accepting its idiosyncrasies and learning how to get the most out of it . <p> Elsewhere , the delay circuit from the Minilogue is gone , but to- make up for that omission you get an- improved- 16-step sequencer with a much better workflow- than the sequencer- found in- the Minilogue . Korg seem to have drawn heavily on their experience from other products here , combining step sequencing with real-time recording to great effect . In addition to the basic note on/off and slide functions youd find on most step sequencers , setting- the toggle switch to its lowest position , Motion , allows you to access the four independent layers of motion sequencing ( Korgs term for recording or programming automation of individual parameters ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by holding down a step on the row of 16 buttons and then adjusting a parameter on the front panel . Visual feedback is much more prominent this time around than it was on the Minilogue , and the motion sequencing feels much more a part of the overall package . <p> With the ability to record and play back smooth , continuous parameter automation or discrete , per-step values , the motion sequencing capabilities on offer here feel like a simplified- version of the parameter-lock approach found on Elektron sequencers , and the ability to create complex sequences with multiple layers of automation more than makes up for the lack of arpeggiator ( the sequencer can create- arpeggio-style effects using the " Key Trg/Hold " button , albeit only with a single finger input rather than by holding down chords ) . - With the combination of the filter and sequencer , there 's more than a hint of Monotribe to the feel of the Monologue , but it 's a much more advanced instrument overall . <p> One of the big surprises with the announcement of the Monologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , better known as Aphex Twin , to help out during the development process . James- has never been officially involved with the production of a synth before , so this is big news , even if its clear that his involvement has n't necessarily played the greatest role in defining the overall approach or- sound of the synth architecture- itself . There are two main areas in which he- was involved : microtuning and presets . The former is still rare in hardware synths " especially analogue ones " but its implemented nicely in this case , with a number of scales and tunings to choose from ( six by James ) and five slots for user scales . Meanwhile , the presets- are one of the most immediately appealing features of the synth . Of the 80 factory patches , the- 30 by Aphex- are undoubtedly the stars of the show , really demonstrating what the Monologue can do , with a particular focus on the microtuning capabilities and motion sequencing . As obvious starting points , AFX bAss ' is a classic Aphex sound in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drive control and filter settings , while afx beats ' goes wild with the motion sequencing to create a full-on bleep'n'bass loop . <p> The Monologue does n't feel like a poor man 's version of the Minilogue . OK , if you want polyphony then you 've got no choice but to go for the more expensive model , but the little monosynth feels perfectly complete , rather than ever coming across as a bigger synth with features removed . The synth- architecture- is remarkably versatile considering its simplicity . Beyond that , the motion sequencing plays to Korg 's strengths , making perfect use of- a workflow- which has been honed and refined for years across their product range . <p> When I first tried the Minilogue , it reminded me of the Roland Juno-106 in the sense of how easily it let you access its- sweet spot . The Monologue reminds me of another vintage Roland classic . Just like the classic SH-101 , its simple , user-friendly and surprisingly powerful despite what appear to be relatively limited synthesis options . It 's a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can turn its hand to the same kind of powerful acid sounds and deep , heavy basslines , but just like the SH-101 it 's also got a weird side which can be exploited for experimental sounds and FX . Oh , and both come in a choice of colours . <p> If there 's one final thought- to sum up the Monologue , it 's that it 's definitely not just a cut-down version of the Minilogue . It 'll be compared endlessly to the larger synth , but it deserves to be judged on its own merits first before you start comparing features . The price means it 's not quite such a must-buy as its bigger brother " - after all , there are plenty of alternative analogue monosynths around this price point " - but nevertheless it 's a great addition to Korg 's range and a synth with a lot of potential . I have no doubt well be hearing a lot of it over the coming years .

@@34419702 @3419702/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Gear/Software <h> Korg Volca Sample <p> Greg Scarth checks out- the latest addition to Korgs Volca range : a unique- sample sequencer with its own character . <p> When Korg released the first three models in the Volca series in late 2013 , they immediately generated a huge buzz . The reasons were obvious : they were affordable and they sounded great , but perhaps most importantly of all they were based around analogue technology . Until the announcement of the Volca Sample we 'd assumed that the Volca series was defined to a large- extent by its analogue circuits ; the signal paths of the Bass and Keys are almost entirely analogue , while the Beats is around 75% analogue . The introduction of the Volca Sample changes that , with the two-band isolator filter circuit across the master output being the only analogue element . If the architecture of the Volca Sample is a break from the first three units , the rest of the design- is much more familiar : it 's got exactly the same form factor and a very similar- 16-step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit itself , let 's put the Volca Sample into context : this is one of the cheapest hardware samplers ever made . That 's not to say we should give it an easy ride based on its price " - Korg have already proven they can deliver genuinely impressive instruments at this price point " - but its important to get our expectations in line . At this price you should n't expect a fully fledged sample sequencer like an MPC or an Octatrack . <p> Korg already makes a relatively affordable alternative in the shape of the recently announced- Electribe Sampler. - There are a number of similarities between the two units , but the Volca Sample is a much simpler affair . Just as the Volca Bass isnt- expected to compete with an MS-20 or- the Volca Keys ca n't match a MicroKorg , the Volca Sample is n't meant to be as versatile or comprehensive as the Electribe . <p> this is one of the cheapest hardware samplers ever made <p> So what do you get for your money ? Much of the formula is familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Volca Sample features- ten- sample slots , each of which- can hold one of the 100- samples stored in the units memory. - The step sequencing features are , - like the other Volcas , on the basic side but more than competent : in addition to the familiar options , the- range of programmable parameters is much larger than the other Volca units and there 's a song mode for stringing sequences of loops together into arrangements . <p> The elephant in the room is that the Volca- ca n't actually sample from external signals ( note that Korg describe it as a digital sample sequencer rather than a sampler ) . However , that does n't  mean you 're restricted to the built-in sounds . Custom samples can be uploaded to the unit via the Sync In socket using Korg 's own AudioPocket app- and- Korg have also released a software development kit for the Volca Sample , allowing third party developers to create software editors. - I liked- Single Cell Software 's Caustic Editor- ( available for Mac , Windows Android and iOS ) , which offers- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample- transfer options. - The inability to sample directly into the unit is by no means a deal-breaker for me ; it 's a small sacrifice at this price point . <p> Given the lack of sampling options , there- are obviously no A/D converters , preamps or analogue stages to colour the sound on the way in , but the relatively low sampling frequency ( 31.25 kHz , as opposed to the CD-standard 44.1 kHz ) does give the Volca Sample a distinctive character during sample playback , particularly when you start to- adjust the playback speed of samples . I found that a variation on the old **33;89;TOOLONG trick worked well , pitching samples up slightly before transferring them to the unit , then pitching down to bring out the gritty character of the unit . <p> Given that the Volca responds so well to pitching sounds up and down , it 's disappointing that there 's no way to play samples chromatically along the keys ( or via MIDI ) . Instead , you can only adjust- the pitch using the Speed control . All 11- sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic pitch and amp options , plus a non-resonant low-pass filter ) can be sequenced- on a per-step basis , but trying to sequence melodies is- a fiddly process compared to playing them- chromatically. - It probably puts the focus more on drums and individual hits rather than melodic elements , which feels a little bit like a- missed opportunity . <p> The elephant in the room is that the Volca ca n't actually sample <p> On the other hand , its certainly not a problem- that advanced sample editing options such as auto chopping and granular looping are absent on a simple unit like this . A basic form of chopping can be achieved by assigning the same sample to multiple slots and adjusting the start point and length parameters accordingly , but it 's a slow and inaccurate process ; if you want to chop samples you 're much better off doing it in software before uploading the individual slices to the Volca . The absence of a- waveform display would make more advanced editing on the unit itself fiddly and frustrating , so its not missed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sample sets itself apart from the other models in the range . It 's great to see the addition of a global swing control on the front panel , since the other Volca units can only swing when synced to an external clock signal such as Korg 's SyncKontrol app for iOS . The analogue isolator section is simple but effective , working across the entire stereo output and offering a useful real-time performance option ( it ca n't be sequenced or automated ) . The reverb option- is an all-or-nothing effect that can be set on a part-by-part basis , with the only adjustable parameter being a single wet/dry mix control that affects all parts simultaneously . <p> The Volca Sample is a small departure from existing products in the Volca range , but it 's a hugely welcome addition to the line-up . There are very few hardware samplers left on the market , with just a handful of notable exceptions such as Akai 's MPC range , Elektron 's Octatrack and Korgs own Electribe Sampler . Given that software such as Maschine- or Ableton offers a more user-friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense for manufacturers to focus on creating hardware samplers with character rather than seeking hi-fi clarity and sonic perfection . The Volca Sample hits the mark at a very affordable price . Like the other products in the Volca range , it offers an excellent first step into the world of hardware or a useful addition to an existing production setup .

@@34419708 @3419708/ <h> Garage Bass <p> Synth Secrets is a series of programming tutorials in which we show how- to make a- range of classic and new synth sounds using- plugins such as Massive , Sylenth and Predator . <p> In our latest Synth Secrets- were making use of Massives Modulation Oscillator to create the kind of FM-style bass sound that became synonymous with UK garage and crossed over into its bass-heavy house offshoots . <h> Step 1 : <p> Create a new sound in Massive and assign the Sin-Squ wavetable to Osc1 . Tune it- down to -24.00 semitones ( two octaves ) for a subby sound , then turn Wt-position all the way to the left so only the sine wave sounds . <p> Next , in the large middle panel , click on the Voicing tab then check the box alongside Monophon to make the sound monophonic . We 'll only be able to play one note at a time , which suits our needs perfectly for a bass sound . <h> Step 2 : <p> Garage bass sounds often make heavy use of oscillator modulation . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oscillators , and turn it on by clicking the circle next to the text ( the circle- will turn blue ) . <p> Modulation Osc allows you to apply a range of modulation types to the oscillator , including ring mod , phase modulation and wavetable modulation . Click on Phase mode then right-click on the 1 ' box . Phase Modulation is now being applied to Oscillator 1 . You do n't  hear the effect until you turn up the Phase Mode control " for now , position it just short of the midway point . <p> The audio example below shows the kinds of effects you can get when tweaking the Phase button in real time " you can automate this parameter for a similar effect . <h> Step 3 : <p> With the general FM bass sound set up , its time to strengthen its low-end credentials . First up , shift the Modulation Osc down an octave by reducing its Pitch to- -12.00 . ( Note the same Phase automation from Step 2 is still in place for the below audio clip . ) <h> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a percussive quality to them , which leaves lots of space in the mix for drums , synths and vocals . <p> To get the sound were looking for here , set up an envelope generator to control the Phase parameter by clicking the blue crosshair of 1Env and dragging it into the first modulation box below the Phase control ( a blue- 1 will appear in the box ) . Now click and drag up on the 1 in the modulation box to apply envelope modulation to the Phase control ( we 've added around 60% ) . <p> Tweak the 1Env envelope settings to give it a fast attack , medium to fast decay , no sustain , and a short release ( if you 're working against a beat , edit the timings with the beat playing to ensure a fitting rhythmic interplay between kick and bass ) . <p> If there 's a click on the tail of the sound , increase the release of the amplitude envelope ( 4Env ) to around 33% , as shown in the image- below . <h> Step 5 : <p> To further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu next to Filter 1. - Set the cutoff frequency to around 25% with no resonance then click and drag the blue 1Env crosshair onto the first slot beneath Cutoff so that 1Env is not only modulating the Modulation Osc but also Filter 1s cutoff frequency . Again , click and drag on the modulation box " this time all the way to the top " to apply maximum envelope modulation to the cutoff frequency . <p> Now push the filter mix slider , labelled Mix1-Mix2 , all the way to the top so you only hear the output of Filter 1 , and make sure the volume of the filter ( the slider to the right of the knobs ) is turned all the way up . <h> Step 6 : <p> You can fatten up the patch further by adding a second oscillator and some effects . Switch on Osc2 , select the Sin-Squ wavetable and shift Wt-position all the way to the left like with Osc1 . Now set Pitch to -12.00 and the Amp to around 2 oclock . <p> Its worth noting that this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in this walkthrough we 're using two sine waves " but experiment with triangle , square and even saw waves to put your own stamp on the sound . <p> Move to the Osc panel- and ensure that the Rate setting in- the Glide panel- is checked and that the Time dial is set at around 10-15% . This ensures a swift transition between notes of different pitches . Next , check the box to the right of Restart via Gate to ensure the phase re-triggers with each new key press . While you 're making these settings , experiment with longer Time settings : higher values deliver a lazier , woozy kind of bass sound . A nice production tip is to automate the Time parameter during fills or breakdowns . <h> Step 7 : <p> To bulk up the sound , apply some Classic Tube distortion in the FX1 slot , with the Dry/Wet and Drive controls set to around 10 oclock . Next , add Dimension Expander to the FX2 slot , keeping Size at 0 and increasing Dry/Wet to 10 oclock . The combined effects- add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition of the effects- has pushed Massive 's output into the red , reduce the master volume a little . <p> To further customise the sound , experiment with the attack and decay values of 1Env as well as the level and pitch of the Modulation Osc . <p> To get a more wonkily detuned classic garage sound , lower the pitch of the Modulation Oscillator to -12.30 and increase the Phase control level .

That is , one melody rises in pitch while , at the same time , another falls . <p> Its a common technique employed by composers of classical music and it can be applied successfully to absolutely any style of dance music . <p> The most common use of contrary motion in electronic music is to create a contrast between a bassline and lead melody , but the same principle can be applied to any two melodic elements . <p> For a bit of historical context , let 's listen to one of the finest examples of contrary motion , taken from the third- movement of Rachmaninov 's second- symphony : <p> The progressions from 5:28 " 6:00 , and 6:18 " 6:52 in particular contain two distinct melodic trajectories : the ascending violins and descending basses and low brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything we could slot into a typical dance track , its useful to see the potential this technique has in imparting emotion and direction in music . <p> Now , let 's look at a more contemporary example of the same technique in action : the string sample and bassline used by Burial in the track Archangel ' from his 2007 album Untrue . ( The sample is taken from Harry Gregson-Williams score for a cut scene in the video game Metal Gear Solid 2 . ) <p> Here 's how the string sample sounds in the track , with a transcribed piano roll below . <p> It 's the ascending pattern of the top melody line we 're most interested in here . The notes are highlighted in red : C , D , Eb , and Ab . These are notes 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 of an ascending C minor scale , and because of this it would often seem natural for the bass to follow an ascending pattern starting on the tonic ' or root note of the scale , in this case C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similarly ascending bassline of C , D , Eb , F. <p> The result introduces an element of tension as the two melodies work against each other , creating a much more interesting result than the obvious ascending bassline . The- use of contrary motion in Archangel ' contributes hugely to its emotion and movement . <p> Contrary motion is a simple musical technique that 's frequently overlooked in dance music . However , as seen in Archangel ' , it is one that can be hugely effective . <h> Related <p> Author Oliver Curry 8th August , 2012 <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507

As David Felton explains , we can learn a lot from other genres <p> Fleetwood Mac pictured during the chemical-fuelled sessions for Rumours <p> The second half of last year I spent editing- Classic Tracks " The real stories behind 68 seminal recordings . It was the third book I 've edited , but it was the first one that veers dramatically away from dance music to embrace the wider music world . So while there are dance artists featured in there " like Justice and Tricky " the vast majority of artists profiled are from other worlds : rock , pop , indie , hip hop , jazz , soul and metal . <p> One of the main themes that comes up time and again is how few differences there are between the worlds of these big producers and our own , often isolated , world of production . And because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept relating the struggles and lessons of the legends of the past to those faced by those of us who work in the world of dance music production . <p> Here are the five that struck me most <h> 1 " The best tracks take time <p> How many times do you hear producers talk about their best tracks being made in a couple of hours ? Too often . And there 's a grain of truth in there " labouring over every decision is hardly conducive to surfing the creative fast-lane . Often the best ideas are the ones which come together very quickly . But for every speedily penned and engineered masterpiece there are dozens of songs that have spent weeks , months " even years " to work into their finished shape . <p> Take Michael Jacksons number one smash Black Or White . What started as a simple country-style riff and vocal refrain ( recorded in the space of the first few days of the- Dangerous- sessions ) , evolved over the course of eighteen months into a musically and stylistically complex opus . <p> Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the making ( four weeks recording the basic tracks , another four weeks for the mixdown , with an exhausting seven month period between filled by overdubs ) . In the end , the only thing that stopped the project from going on longer was a non-negotiable deadline from record label A&amp;M to get the album mastered for imminent release . " When you 're doing something by instinct you can do it really quickly , " noted engineer Peter Henderson . " As time ran out and we got down to the wire , the instinct came back in a hurry and we just got on with it . Thank God it all worked out . " <p> In the case of Don McLeans American Pie , the main mans backing band " at the behest of hands-on producer Ed Freeman " spent two whole weeks in the studio before Freeman even considered pressing the record button . Thats- two whole weeks- spent routining a song that had already been written and arranged . Only- then- was it time to start comping , editing and mixing . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Shane MacGowan and Jem Finer spent crafting The Pogues Fairytale of New York ? Or the six years it took to write , refine and then record and master The Rolling Stones Start Me Up ? ( The song was first recorded in 1975 with a reggae feel , then again in 1978 with a rocky vibe before being completed for- Tattoo You- in 1981 . ) <p> Which is all to say that great music rarely makes it onto tape ( or hard drive ) in the space of a few inspired hours . <p> So whenever you next feel that your latest masterpiece is stuck in the doldrums , do n't  get too disheartened ; even the finest talents struggle . There 's nothing wrong with putting a song on the back-burner and returning to it days , weeks or even years later . In many ways its the persistence that matters . And the overriding faith that the song you 're working on is worth seeing through to the end . However far away that is . <p> Great music rarely makes it onto tape in the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the performance <p> Although performance in its strictest sense " playing instruments live and recording the result " is something that few dance producers get involved with , I did end up thinking that we have lost something musically important by moving almost completely inside the box and focusing on programming rather than playing . <p> That 's not to undermine the myriad benefits offered by the range of accessible technology available to us today , or the ability we have to work on the road , or " perhaps most of all " that fact that we can own a whole studios worth of virtual kit for the price of just one vintage mic or pre-amp . <p> But I think it is legitimate to lament the passing of so much knowledge relating to the actual- recording of sound . I wonder how many music producers or mix engineers in our brave new world , for example , have ever actually set up mics above a piano , or around a drum kit ?

As supply finally catches up with demand , we report the results of our long-term Push test . <p> In software development , it 's almost inevitable that there comes a point where adding more features leads to rapidly diminishing marginal returns . In the case of DAWs , how many of us can truly say we use all of the functionality of our software ? We demand programs which can do absolutely everything and then quibble about missing features , but chances are very few of us are really pushing our music software anywhere near the limits of its potential . <p> Since the great DAW revolution which occurred some time around the turn of the millennium , most music software has been far more powerful than many big budget hardware studios . The challenge now lies not in pushing the limitations of the software itself , but in finding more efficient ways to get the most out of ourselves . <p> Few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of its potential . <p> The most obvious solution is to use a hardware controller to provide easier access to options which may be hidden , complex or otherwise unintuitive in the software itself .

The unit itself is remarkably heavy at just under 3kg , which is n't necessarily a good thing if you want to take it out for live performances but does make it feel reassuringly sturdy alongside similar controllers . ( Ableton offers a padded messenger bag designed to fit the Push and a 15-inch laptop . We also like the look of Magma 's neat CTRL Case Push for a more slimline protective option . ) <p> The rest of the hardware specification is fairly self-explanatory : the unit connects via USB and there 's an optional external DC power supply ( the Push can run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be slightly dimmed to reduce power usage ) . Along the top of the front panel you 'll find a large LCD screen with eight rotaries which automatically map to the parameters displayed on the screen . Dotted around the edges of the unit you 'll find dedicated transport , tempo , swing and master volume controls plus a selection of dedicated buttons for the most commonly used controls . Over on the left there 's a long vertical ribbon controller , but the front of the unit is dominated by that giant 8+8 grid of touch-sensitive pads , augmented by an additional 2+8 row of slightly smaller buttons along the top . Time to plug it in and see what it can do . <p> The front of the unit is dominated by that giant 8x8 grid of touch-sensitive pads . <h> In use <p> The first and most obvious way to use the Push is as a simple pad controller , so I launch Live 9 and load up a drum rack .

The 4+8 strip of pads at the top functions as a step sequencer , while the bottom right 4+4 section allows you to move between patterns . <p> It 's at this point I realise Push can do a lot more than most controllers and that I probably did n't need to use the mouse to load the drum rack in the first place .

A heavily reverberated , booming kick fills out the low end . A warbling- dub siren sound- effect- preempts each turnaround ( trem bird in the graphic ) . <p> 2 . Enter the sampled- ragga vocals , taken from an open vocal line- on a remix of- Top Cats- Request The Style . Note the muting of the second ( of four ) sirens to clear space for detail in the- new vocal element . While the track is generally governed by eight-bar or 16-bar turnarounds , this opening section lasts for 24 bars- to make it more DJ-friendly . <p> 3 . A simple fill , consisting of a clap pattern- underpinned by a short vinyl slowdown , marks the end of the intro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its all change as the track suddenly gets much busier . The Think break is chopped more- liberally in order to rearrange the groove . Its joined by a machine-sourced clap , ping-pong delayed , and a second alternative break ( most likely a different edit of the Think break ) , triggered in the latter part of each measure and EQd differently to provide a counterpoint to the main Think part . Only the boom kick is left untweaked to deliver a single long hit at the start of each bar . Elsewhere , a sparse sub bass part fills out- the low end while a synth siren , heavily delayed , offers mid-range detail at different times- to the FX . <p> 5 . A big woozy bass , drifting lazily between notes now fills out the bass frequencies . Its brutal simplicity allows- space for- the drum groove to retain the central focus , with- a lively stick/rimshot fill at the end of each turnaround .

Four bars later the woozy bass re-enters , this time playing a slightly more complex melody . The beat returns- to play the opening Think break sequence , shifting- all attention to the floor-shaking bassline . The upper registers are dominated by two newcomers : firstly the re-worked female vox sample ( the legendary Kathy Brown , sampled from an acapella of- Turn Me Out ) and a simple old-school rave fall that triggers when the vocal is absent .

The reintroduction of the FX bird and siren add to the mayhem . <p> 9 . The male vox- returns , joining- the same bass sequence that it last played with at bar 49 ( this coupling of parts is common throughout the arrangement ) .

The- rhythmic break is made up of a heavily edited version of the Think break , this time not just sample start and end points being messed with but pitch envelope too .

Second guessing what 's going to happen next in this mix is absolutely not on the cards . A stick fill carries the track to bar 188 , with the bass muted to let it shine . <p> 16 . The mix fills out even more as the female vocals are tweaked yet- further , reverb and delay levels morphing- between in-your-face dry to swamped wet . The rave stab adds interest- in the upper mids , with the siren joining the action at bar 188 . The clap fills out the rhythm section for what is the last big blast of the song . <p> 17 .

Its one of the greatest synths in my studio . You have four oscillators , which gives you a very large range of possibilities in terms of sound design . The sync and cross modulation are two- of the most important features . Also the short times of the ADSR curves allow you to create very short , hard and percussive sounds .

The Eventide Space is a reverb for electric guitars , but its also perfect for any other kinds of instruments or sounds . I use it both in the studio and- when playing live .

My brother , Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from looking at the kind of deals he was being offered from other labels , then thinking , We can do this . We can do it just as well , if not better , and we can take a bigger cut from it. <p> It started from very humble beginnings . The name Toolroom comes from my parents tool shed , which is where we built our studio . The first office was my parents study , which was three sweaty guys working back-to-back from eight in the morning until eight at night for no money at least for the first year but it was a passion , it was something we really wanted to do . <p> The label itself has taken a long time to grow and were always looking at investing in people , getting people involved in the label . Were now 19 people strong and its been a long hard slog but its been really enjoyable . <p> You have to base everything around the music , define your sound and have a clear message that you 're trying to get across . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can branch off later on , but when you 're starting it has to be a very , very clear message . <p> Weve developed over eight years based on hustling hard and being approachable . When we were trying to approach other labels there was this kind of standoffishness . Unless you were of a particular standing you did n't  get the person answering the phone or did n't  get the reply to the email . We wanted to be approachable , from the kid in his bedroom giving us a demo to signing records now from people like Coldplay . We wanted to be accessible . <p> Do you think that gets harder as time goes on ? <p> Yeah , I 'm doing less and less music and more and more running a business . We have a saying at Toolroom : We could be selling washing machines . " Were not , were selling music , so its very easy to get up in the morning and do something youre passionate about , but we still have the same work ethic and business model as if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . If you do n't  , its a hobby . If you want to give up your day job and make a career from it that work ethic has to be there from the word go . <p> I 'm always in the office . I love picking up the phone . So does Mark when he s in the office . Were not going to find the next young talent by being standoffish or unapproachable . I 've got a lot of time and respect for the young kid who comes up and pushes the CD in my hand . The wrong way to do it is a blank email to me and 16 other labels going , Check this out I have n't got time to do that , I 'm checking out a hundred other things . The personal touch is still key . <p> What 's also important is doing that bit of homework about me , about the label , about our sound , about where you think were going . If you can give us a little bit of that at the same as you hand us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you understand where were coming from , it means that have an understanding of where your record sits on the label and it gives us that affirmation that you 're really serious about being part of our label . <p> How do you cross over from underground to the mainstream ? Is it possible to achieve long-term success in both arenas ? <p> We sit down at the beginning of every year and write a budget and at some point it always comes up , How do we put a hit record in that budget ? There 's no magic formula to writing a hit in dance music . You can go down that road of thinking , I 'm going to be David Guetta . I 'm going to write a pop song. I do n't  think that 's the way to tackle it . I think you should get comfortable with what you produce and comfortable with what you like . If that has crossover potential you 'll see it very early on . Trying to write a crossover record never works . Ive been trying to do it with my brother for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a track for the Black Eyed Peas and it was never meant to be a Black Eyed Peas track . It started out as an underground house record and it developed into something else . That 's where the whole business side of it comes in . If you do develop an idea like that and youre not too comfortable it may be a bit too poppy , a bit too crossover for the label you 've got an avenue to give it to someone else . In that particular case we gave it to David Guetta who gave it to will.i.am and then it appeared on the Black Eyed Peas album . Theres ways of achieving crossover success but also staying true to what you want to be as long as you have that network of people . <p> How do you stay at the forefront of a particular scene and sound ? <p> Immerse yourself in the scene . You cant dip into it , you have to live and breathe it . Its a 24 hour job . If you love it thatll come across in what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing younger and younger people , I 've got to be honest . <p> We started the record label when vinyl and physical sales were in decline and everyone said we must be mad . We saw that thered be a new way people would want to buy music and we thought , If we can make it in a time when its tough , when it does start to pick up a bit we should be fairly high on the crest of that wave.

@@34419722 @3419722/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Gear/Software <h> UVI Relayer <p> UVIs Relayer is a fully-featured delay plugin with a few unique tricks up its sleeve . Greg Scarth puts it to the test . <p> If you 're going to release a delay effect , you need a unique selling point . Aside from the fact that a number of third-party developers already offer delay plugins , the majority of DAWs now include pretty decent multi-tap delays as standard . With Relayer , UVI have taken the obvious approach : go for broke by throwing as many features as possible into the mix , aiming to create an ultra-versatile take on the familiar digital delay effect , with a huge sprinkling of original twists . It 's a risky strategy , which could result in a messy , overcomplicated affair , but thankfully that 's not the case here . <p> If you 're going to release a delay effect , you need a unique selling point . With Relayer , UVI have taken the obvious approach : go for broke by throwing as many features as possible into the mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . The timing of the repeats can be free-running or tempo synced to the host DAW ( with versatile swing options to be found within the plugin itself ) . From there , the plugin uses a step-sequencer-like approach , allowing the user to control the parameters of each of the delay lines . The interface is based around six individual panes , with separate step-based modulation editors for time , gain , pan and the two effect slots . There 's also a dedicated pane for advanced feedback settings ( filtering , a drive setting with three distortion modes , and feedback tap point ) . <p> All the standard features you 'd expect from any delay plugin are present " modulation options , master filters and so on " but where Relayer really sets itself apart is with the implementation of effects on each of the delay lines . The FX1 and FX2 sections offer a range of options including comb and vowel filtering , sample rate reduction and wave shaping . As a result , you can program a wide variety of effects , from fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percussive sound into the Harp Arp Warped ' preset , for instance , and the combination of comb filtering and wave shaping produces an arpeggiated melodic output . <p> The colour setting introduces a final twist , processing the delay 's output through a convolution processor , with a choice of impulse responses . There 's no option to load custom IRs at this point , which seems like a bit of a missed opportunity , but the range of IRs on offer is more than enough for shaping the character of the delay , from the deliberately lo-fi ( Old Phone ' ) to the subtly coloured ( Device Analog ' ) to classic reverbs ( a number of settings based on EMT and Lexicon models ) . <p> A plugin with so many options could easily spiral out of control , but the usual UVI attention to detail means that Relayer is incredibly user friendly . Each of the modulation editors can be activated or deactivated independently at the push of a button ( you can even deactivate the time modulation , setting the timing of each delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top left-hand corner of the plugin window ) . A solo button alongside the wet and dry controls allows you to audition the wet signal on its own at the touch of a button . There are two memory slots , A and B , which allow you to edit a patch , step back to your starting point and compare the two . Adjusting settings in each of the modulation editor panes results in visual feedback via the lower gain , pan , FX1 and FX2 panels ( time and feedback affect all four simultaneously ) . <p> With Relayer , UVI have achieved that rare feat : a hugely versatile plugin that 's also intuitive and easy to use . At $129 it 's not the cheapest delay plugin on the market , but the price seems fair given how much can be achieved with this highly creative , neatly designed effect .

These things generally do n't happen overnight " I would rather let a solid idea develop- and sit on the boil maturing for a while , or at least until motivation collides with enthusiasm . <h> What does a typical day involve ? <p> My days start at 6.30 am ( I blame my energetic two-year-old- daughter for that ) , my head is normally brimming with ideas so I have to be disciplined and prioritise . Generally speaking there is always too much to be done than there are physical hours in the day so prioritisation , commitment and delegation are key . More often than not my days are derailed with emergent work or opportunities that present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little slack here and there . I 've got scary levels of OCD and I 'm also a firm believer of not putting things off , so I try to smash everything that day so I can clear my head and compartmentalise , if you get my drift . But yeah , its always a composite mixture of pitching for opportunities , developing relationships , managing content , liaising with clients , labels and artists . No two days are the same , which is why I probably love the job the most . <h> Highs of the job ? <p> Securing a sync has to be the highlight , and not for the monetary aspects either . This job is so relationship-driven , and people are very dependent on us bringing home the goods . This side of the industry is the last bastian of cashflow , so there are countless hours of effort that you do n't see , dedicated to building relationships , lamenting over online content or packaging together samplers or pitches . It takes real commitment on an enduring basis " I 'm normally knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with A&amp;R commitments , so when something does land its a real Everest moment . <h> Lows of the job ? <p> Emails , bloody emails .

I- joined the military when I was like 16 so my influencers are totally not related to my current line of business " my influences have always been great leaders , inspirational pillars of society , which has inevitably rubbed off on me .

The choice of sound is important . Weve gone for a 909-style sample with plenty of thump , punchy in the lows but not over the top . To create mix space for the bassline , the kick passes through a high-pass filter set at around 85Hz . Some of the mids and highs have been increased to help it cut through a busy mix ( and the break that will be overlaid in step 5 ) . <h> Step 2 <p> With the snare in , the classic breaks-derived drum &amp; bass rhythm is already evident . The snare is made up of three elements a low punch , the fundamental pitch of which is boosted to make it hit harder , a rough live hit for fullness in the mids , and a characterful top snare with an uber-fast attack transient that 's high passed then fed through subtle hall reverb to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The groove is filled out now with the hi-hats . You do n't  need anything too characterful here : just a nice clacky sound , machine or live-kit sourced , that brings definition to the high-end ( and to the kick and snare ) . Where the kick and snare sounds are often picked to be larger that life , the hi-hat should take a clear ( and clean ) back-seat : hold off on any distortion , overdrive or saturation . Some judicious EQ and reverb help it slot neatly back in the mix . The 16th-measure ghost notes at the end of the beat are swung back slightly and play at a lower volume to give the beat a little swing . <h> Step 4 <p> The live-style on-the-eighth ride is tuned to sit with the rest of the beat , and then a bitcrusher effect is used to change its harmonics . You may also want to EQ out lower frequencies and add a feed to the same reverb on the snare . Last in line comes a compressor , side-chain driven from the kick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mix when either a kick or snare hits . This adds a breathy feel to the beat , and ensures the two key elements always knock through clearly . <h> Step 5 <p> Now for the break ! The drums programmed in steps 1-4 are grouped and run through a saturator effect to blend them and dirty them up a little . A range of raw breakbeat loops are then auditioned until one that works with the sounds and groove established so far is found ( these breaks are from Sample Magics Vintage Breaks ) . At this stage its character that matters . When a break with the same sonic feel is found then cutting can begin : slicing and re-programming in any number of ways to create a new original drum &amp; bass groove . The coup de grace is a slinky downward roll at the end of the 8-bar measure .

I do n't ever stop talking shop so it 's just part of my DNA and my teams to be where we 're at .

@@34419733 @3419733/ <h> Acid Synth with U-He Diva <p> Synth Secrets is a series of programming tutorials in which we show how to make a range of classic and new synth sounds using plugins such as Massive , Sylenth and Diva . <p> In this instalment of Synth Secrets we 'll look at creating a relatively simple acid sound- using U-He 's Diva plugin . Taking inspiration from the classic Roland TB-303 , we 'll also look at a couple of different ways to set the synth up for variations on the sound . <p> And here 's a screenshot of the MIDI pattern we 've used for the melody : <h> Step 1 <p> We begin by loading a new instance of Diva . We head straight to the Patches tab and initialise the patch by selecting the INIT Minimono ' preset- from the Templates section . <p> Heading back to the main synth section , we turn up the feedback control in the mixer section to a third in order to add bite , then in the VCF ( voltage-controlled filter ) section we push up the emphasis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resonance this high creates those distinctive resonant sweeps when moving the cutoff frequency up and down , synonymous with the acid sound . <h> Step 2 <p> In the tuning section we turn up the first glide control to a third of the way , then in the section underneath we change the mode from legato to mono . Increasing the glide time creates the pitch transition between notes , so- the synth bends from one note to the next for that classic 303-style effect " how high you go with the glide control is of course up to taste , - and dependent on the source material . <p> Changing the mode to mono means the synth will only play one note at a time , however we still have glide between all notes . If you keep the synth in legato mode then there will only be glide between notes that overlap . Here are examples of how both sound with our MIDI clip : <h> Step 3 <p> Now time to add some distortion . As we 're using Ableton we load up the Overdrive device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native distortion plugins will do the trick nicely here ) . <p> The effect instantly sounds pleasing , so all we do is increase the drive setting slightly to 63% and push up the tone control to 60% , adding extra distortion- and increased high end respectively . <p> Distortion and overdrive plugins will usually react very differently depending on what frequencies are being fed into them " the high resonance values we set on the synth create a spike in the frequency response of the synth , especially when we sweep the cutoff , creating that classic driven acid tone . <h> Step 4 <p> Now its time to experiment with what we 've created so far to explore more creative potential . From the MIDI Effects section in Ableton , we load an Arpeggiator device onto our MIDI channel . <p> We set the Rate to 1/16 , bring the Gate control down to 47% and push up the Steps setting to 4 . This arpeggiates the notes coming into the synth at a rate of 16th notes . Bringing down the gate shortens the envelope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes are triggering over 4 octaves . <p> We also add the Ping Pong Delay device for some stereo movement on the sound , filling the gaps in between the notes . We tweak the EQ so the delay is only present in the high frequencies , bring down the Feedback to 37% and pull down the Dry/Wet control to 21% . <p> Back in- Diva , we take the oscillator down an octave by changing the Range setting from 8 ' to 16 ' ' in the oscillator ( VCO ) section . We also push up the emphasis control slightly for an increased resonant sweep as we automate the cutoff frequency . <h> Step 5 <p> For this final example we turn off the arpeggiator , and focus on Diva . In the VCO section , we change the waveform from a sawtooth to a square wave ( the original TB-303 featured both a square and sawtooth wave , so both will sound authentic ) . We push up the Env 2 control in the filter section so that the second envelope is now controlling the cutoff frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving us a nice variation on the previous sound .

We caught up with him for a chat about production and his love of record hunting . <p> When Motor City Drum Ensemble emerged on the house scene over the course of 2007 and 2008 , you would have been forgiven for assuming the name on the record sleeve was a reference to Detroit . Many of Danilo Plessows releases could easily be filed alongside Michigan natives such as Moodymann , - Theo Parrish and Omar-S , but the Motor City in question here is n't in the US Midwest but south western Germany ; 27 year-old Danilo hails from the German motor city of Stuttgart , - home to Porsche and Mercedes-Benz . <p> With the sample-based Raw Cuts- series on his own MCDE label , Plessow showed an exceptional ear for sample chopping and a maturity of sound which belied his age ( the earlier Raw Cuts releases were made when he was barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20:20 Vision and Studio !

What kind of gear are you using most at the moment and how does that help determine the outcome of the project ? <p> Danilo Plessow : I 'm looking to achieve a certain sound and attitude with my records and I just find certain hardware makes it much easier for me to get that . Lately Ive been trying to get away from the computer as much as possible and work a lot with the E-mu SP-12 , for example . <p> Your Raw Cuts series was almost entirely sample-based , which obviously played a major role in shaping the sound . Has that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start with a few pieces of equipment and then see where they lead you , or do you start with a musical idea and choose equipment to fit it ? <p> You can have all the gear in the world and still make mediocre music , so its not about that you have to know where you want to go . With Raw Cuts , I had a very clear vision and could just lose myself completely in the music. - So I 'd say that the idea or the mood you are in comes first , and then you choose whatever instrument you want to express yourself with . <p> Music for me has always been a very important way to channel my feelings , and I 've learnt that this is by far the most important thing regarding the results. - I 've gained more knowledge from sampling and therefore discovering new music than from playing any synth and I guess its this knowledge of music that determines my sound most . <p> Youve mentioned that you were a big fan of sample-based hip hop as a teenager and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of samples . Was that a large part of the inspiration for Raw Cuts ? <p> I grew up on hip hop and black music from the 60s and 70s . Jazz , soul , funk This for me is the basis and still the most resourceful and rewarding music there is . Moodymann , Pal Joey , MAW and DJ Sneak were the first artists I discovered fusing house with these elements and they have definitely- been a major influence . <p> But I take as much inspiration from a Pete Rock record as I did from them . Raw Cuts was about doing house in a 90s hip hop way and that 's still my forte I guess , sampling and that rough edge to it . <p> There also seems like there might be a bit of a Theo Parrish influence in your work ? <p> I discovered him a couple of years later . What 's most inspiring about Theo for me is his DJing , the deep knowledge of music and his ability to mix records decades apart from each other and still keep the groove . 
@@34419735 @3419735/ <p> Well , it 's been nearly two years in the making " and with little information as to what features and improvements it might contain " but Cubase 7 has now officially landed . <p> In fact , since its announcement a few weeks ago , the official Cubase forum has been buzzing with excitement , speculation , criticism and recrimination all before any of its contributors had even got hold of the software in question , such is the fully wired world in which we live . Luckily a mood of ( near ) sanity has arrived since the actual release on 5th- December . <p> The new Tube Compressor <p> Despite a few unexpected surprises , what 's on offer sticks closely to the earlier press releases . Top of the bill is the new MixConsole that replaces the mixer windows in Cubase 6 . Although in certain respects MixConsole does n't profoundly change the basic mixer building blocks ( or internal signal flow ) , it does introduce some interesting new features and enhancements , and is visually quite different to previous versions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Track and Chord Assistant features link into both MIDI and audio tracks ( via the updated VariAudio engine ) to help your track writing . <p> For those new to Cubase , or not too keen on navigating the 900-page PDF manual , Cubase 7 also introduces an array of instructional videos accessible via the new Steinberg Hub shown on startup . <h> MixConsole <p> Like the rest of Cubase 7 , an overall darker hue is apparent in the MixConsole. - It certainly has a very different look and feel to the previous mixer . The window itself is fully scalable and is capable of being displayed in full screen mode . The aim here appears to be to place more emphasis on a single-window concept that ultimately moves focus away from a single main arrangement window and attempts to minimise the overuse of menus though one could argue that this has now been replaced with icon-based menus instead . <p> The scalability itself is generally welcome , and allows you to focus on specific areas of the mixer more easily , though it does take some getting used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some text visibility has also suffered in this customisation bonanza , but hopefully this can be addressed in a further update . <p> The new MixConsole marks a dramatic improvement to the previous mixer <p> The MixConsole window is split into a number of functional areas . The top of the window features icons for universal functions and controls . The Rack in the centre , which alludes to the outboard- rack in a traditional studio , can be configured in a number of ways for viewing effect sends , insert effects and the new Channel Strip ( a pre-configured set of processing blocks available on every track ) . <p> Along the left of the window a track list allows channel visibility and location ( Zone ) options to be adjusted , whilst on the right you find the Control Room ( still also available as a separate window ) for configuring mix and monitor outputs , and a new and comprehensive metering section .

How did you come to do those , how long did it take to be skilled enough and what do you think the third deck allows you to do you could n't with two ? <p> My setup consists of three decks and two CDJs at the moment , so yes , I 'm still using multiple decks and the technical side of things is very important in my sets . When I DJ I 'm trying to use two or three tracks at the same time in order to come up with a new version of the music " a bit like remixing , in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play a lot of edits , acapellas and unreleased music , which I believe- greatly enhances the possibilities . <p> How much do your DJ sets feed back into the studio when you 're writing music ? Are you thinking about what will work on the dancefloor ? <p> The dancefloor definitely has an influence on my music to a certain extent but I would n't rely on the dancefloor feedback only . The setting needs to be right for certain tracks in order for them to work best so I do n't  consider it to be an overly important reference . <p> Generally do you think the art of the DJ is getting lost as a result of shorter DJ sets , sub-standard residents , the glut of technology and beatmatching tools ? <p> For my understanding of DJing , which I originally got to know as one of the three main elements in hip-hop culture , that certainly is the case . I believe there is a movement towards the original values of DJing again these days though . There 's a younger generation which does n't  simply try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows the history of the music really well and also values the technical side of things . <p> You 're known for sleek sounds , but the album seems a little more rough and raw than usual . - Were you aiming for that ? <p> It was my intention to work out a bit of a rougher sound aesthetic throughout the album and it was also due to the use of many old analogue synths on the album . As the album is very vocal-heavy , I wanted to create a counterpart with the music in order to avoid a too polished sound . <p> I believe there is a movement towards the original values of DJing again . <p> You were much more techno in your early days you seem to have mellowed over time . Has it happened naturally with age ? Were you tired of techno ? <p> It has definitely happened naturally over the years and as a result of being influenced by a huge variety of music across many genres . I 'm not at all tired of techno " there 's actually a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music is either house or techno but it sits somewhere in between " probably leaning towards the tougher side of the spectrum though . <p> Back in the day I understand you were a hip-hop DJ and specifically into what was called hip-house . What were your essential tracks back then ? <p> My essential hip-hop tracks at the time were Gang Starrs Take It Personal , De La Souls Me , Myself And I and A Tribe Called Quests Rhythm . The first four-to-the floor tracks I heard were Ill House You by the Jungle Brothers and the Royal House singles but the one track which really won me over for house and techno was E-Dancers Pump The Move . <p> Loco Dice has said he thinks hip-house is on the verge of coming back . What are your thoughts ? <p> It very much belongs to that period of time in my point of view so I 'm not exactly longing for it to come back . <p> How do you think your sound has evolved and improved since your debut album in 2006 ? Can you feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your message out in a clearer fashion ? <p> I 've rearranged my studio setup over the past two or three years . I took many old synths out of the basement , bought some new ones as well and as a result of this my way of working has moved away from using plugins compared to my first album . The process has become a lot more fun as I often record session takes with these synths and record them as separate tracks into Ableton . I then tweak and arrange them during the final arrangement and mixdown only in order to retain the lively feel of those recordings . <p> Going back even further , how long did it take you to find your own voice now you look back ? Was it a challenge ? And is it a challenge now to find the right headspace to make music ? <p> Obviously , it was very challenging in the beginning and still is at times of course but I found a strategy which works really well for me . If I get stuck with a track or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else and go back to the original idea maybe the next day , a week or even months later .

@@34419738 @3419738/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Gear/Software <h> Fabfilter Pro-R <p> Fabfilter have a reputation for delivering innovative and intuitive takes on many essential everyday plugins . Pro-R is an algorithmic reverb plugin capable of anything from short ambient spaces to huge hall effects , but the real selling point is the- stripped-down GUI , aimed at offering a user-friendly workflow . <p> The Space knob is the largest control on Pro-R and essentially shapes the room size of the reverb , allowing you to seamlessly sweep from one algorithm to another rather than selecting different room sizes . Blending between spaces causes no audible artefacts , which allows for a very flexible audition process and fine-tuning of the sound ( the control- can- also be automated for some quite unique results ) . <p> Although the decay time will intelligently adjust according to the room model set by the Space control , the Decay Rate knob will allow you to tweak the decay time of the set algorithm . This ranges from 50-200% , allowing for subtle alterations to reverb tails or extreme adjustments for less natural sounding effects . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Character and Distance controls . Brightness is for subtle frequency balancing " turned down , it will produce a more natural-sounding reverb , dipping higher frequencies slightly . The Character knob controls the modulation of the reverb , which can be used for effectively adding a richer tone , applying a subtle chorus at extreme settings . The Distance knob will produce more prominent early reflections when turned anti-clockwise ( making the sound appear closer to the listener ) , while moving the knob in the other direction pushes the sound further away . <p> So far , its all pretty standard stuff , albeit presented in a very user-friendly way . The point at which Pro-R really sets itself apart is with the addition of a few unique options . The most significant are the versatile EQ features , with- Decay Rate EQ and Post EQ occupying a large proportion of the user interface . Pro-Q 2 users will be familiar with the operation of these EQ curves : in combination with the analyser they are very intuitive and musical to work with . The unique Decay Rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q , and an option of four different filter shapes for each band bell , low shelf , high shelf and notch . With this control you can shape the decay time over the frequency spectrum . Boosting frequencies with the Decay Rate EQ will lengthen the decay time for those frequencies ; any cuts you apply here will shorten the decay time for that frequency range . <p> The emphasis here is to help achieve more natural sounding spaces , which- works beautifully on its own as well in conjunction with the Post EQ . I got some extremely pleasing results boosting the Decay Rate EQ around the main body of the audio source signal , and then dialling down the same frequency band in the Post EQ , achieving a warmer and deeper reverb . <p> The Post EQ is fairly straightforward in its operation , controlling the frequency balance post-reverb . The notch filter featured on the Decay Rate EQ is replaced by low- and high-cut filters , both with- the option of 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 or 96 dB/oct slopes . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EQs to apply global editing , which is useful for bypassing , Q shaping or shifting the frequency of a number of different bands in one go . <p> The Decay Rate EQ will win most of the plaudits due to its innovation , but having the fully featured Post EQ built into your reverb plugin is also a huge bonus , and reduces the need for post reverb processing on auxiliary sends . <p> Useful pre-delay options- can be found at the bottom of the plugin , which- also has a nifty trick up its sleeve in the form of Pre Delay Sync , synchronising the pre-delay to the project- tempo . I ca n't honestly say I 've seen this on any reverb plugin before ; its great as a functional mix tool , but- also allows for more creative and rhythmic effects . With the sync turned off , this control functions as a standard pre-delay , allowing you to dial according to taste in order to provide some separation between the audio source and reverb tail . <p> All the innovative features included in Pro-R would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound quality , and thankfully it does , and then some . The plugin- produced very natural sounding results on everything I applied it to , equally adept on individual drum tracks , vocal arrangements and helping to settle- busy synth arpeggios in the mix . The Shape and Decay Rate controls are simple and intuitive in their operation , while providing incredibly powerful fine tuning of the reverb algorithm . Along with the Pre Delay Sync , these are the game changers , but there are plenty of other features included that extend the audio quality and simplified workflow of this plugin . Personally I 'm a big fan of the stripped-down user interface ; it feels more organic and musical to work with , although some users may want more flexibility or detailed control in certain areas . It 's also quite expensive , given the competition , but I ca n't say I 've ever used a reverb plugin that sounds so good with so little effort .

But for the most part of the album writing process , we worked individually in our own rooms and then swapped sessions back and forwards .

I was always a DJ and I never lost the passion for that but Frank comes from a band background so he had something missing in his life for a long time .

The best of both worlds ! <p> We 'll be using a combination of Tundra and Ableton Live 's native plugins for this walkthrough , but these kind of techniques are n't limited to these tools . If you have some nice orchestral samples you can try- resampling them , and if you do n't use Ableton be sure to explore your DAW 's built-in- sampler and the resampling options you have . <h> Step 1 <p> We begin by loading up an instance of Kontakt 5 and Spitfire Audio 's Tundra instrument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for resampling purposes . We settle with Strings Low Short Frozen ' . Programming a two-beat-long chord with a C2 , G2 and C3 note . <p> In- Tundra itself we turn down the reverb . Although this sounds nice at this stage , it might not play so well when we 're resampling and re-pitching . We also click on the wrench icon to reveal some extra parameters in- Tundra and change the balance of the four mic groups used in the recording process . Increasing- the C ( close ) mics level all the way adds a nice definition to the sound , while- turning the A ( ambient ) mics and O ( outrigger ) mics adds a nice stereo balance . <h> Step 2 <p> Next , we load our audio into an instance of Simpler . By default , Simpler loads in the Classic mode . Our sample is automatically mapped chromatically , so we play around with some new chords and program a chord sequence in C minor ( we know our sample is in the pitch of C , so we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sampler ) . <p> The sound is a little glitchy when we trigger notes . This is due to the Warp mode in Simpler being set to Beats by default , meaning the sample is being sliced . If you want a smoother playback , you can switch the warp mode to Complex Pro . However , we 're going to keep the Beats warp mode for this tutorial and use it to our advantage for some resampling techniques . <h> Step 3 <p> The loop function is turned on by default in Simpler , meaning if we play- a note and hold down the key , the sample will loop over and over . To the left of the loop button we have some options for sample start position , loop length and sample length . We can click and drag up and down on these settings to alter them , however if we double-click on the box we can also type in numerical values . This enables us to set tempo-synced sample loops ( just ensure you always use samples that conform to a musical grid length for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ) . <p> Note that if we change the sample length to 25% we are now looping over exactly a quarter of the sample ( one beat in our case ) . Provided we either half or double the loop length , we 'll maintain a sample loop length that is synced to our project tempo . <h> Step 4 <p> Next we change the Preservation setting from transients to 1/16 . This changes how the sample is divided when warped . For more accurate results you can stick to Transients , but- some interesting rhythmic effects can be achieved using one of the fixed note values . <p> To the right of Preserve we have the Mode setting , which determines what happens in between the sample chops " the settings are Off , Loop Forward , Loop Forward or- Backward . We select Off ( the first option ) . This creates a gated effect , which is enhanced when we bring down the envelope value to the right , as this shortens each one of the chops . <h> Step 5 <p> On the right side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it takes to play back the sample from start to finish using the : 2 and x2 buttons . We click the : 2 button to double the tempo of the sample playback . This creates a nice tension with the string . <p> We then load a Beat Repeat device- after Simpler , setting Grid to 1/8 , Gate to 8/16 and pushing up the Pitch Decay to 100% . Automating the On/Off for the Beat Repeat creates a pitch fill for the sound , a nice way to introduce new elements into the arrangement . <p> We also add a touch of reverb to the sound via a bus send , applying Valhalla 's VintageVerb . In the following audio example , we 've duplicated our Simpler instance and changed the Preserve to 1/32 for the drop section , and also automated the Beat Repeat on and off for a nice transition effect . 
@@34419747 @3419747/ <h> Introduction to Loudness <p> How do you make your tracks sound loud without harming your mix ? Its one of the most common questions asked by producers . Bruce Aisher has the answers . <p> We all know how important it is to make our tracks sound loud . Even if you 're not having your records professionally mastered for broadcast or club play , a loud mix will usually make tracks sound their best and help them make the biggest possible impact. - Before we explain- how to make mixes sound loud , its important to understand exactly what that means . <p> As we mentioned in our feature on mix bus processing , its important not to confuse the loudness of musical material with its peak level. - This screenshot shows the waveform of a drum loop in Cubase . As you can see , the peaks are nearly at the maximum possible level of 0 dBFS : <p> But even with peaks near 0 dB , is this clip- loud ? Probably not . If we played it alongside a mixed and mastered track , matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly quieter . The loudness of a piece of audio depends on much more than just its peak level . A signal with a higher average level , less dynamic range and more content spread across the full frequency range will almost always seem louder . <p> ( In fact because of the way our ears work , perceived loudness also depends on the listening environment and duration , frequency content and density of the signal , as well as many other factors . ) <p> Usefully , there are many ways of getting visual feedback on audio loudness . In Cubase , for example , the Statistics window can be used to find the peak amplitude ( i.e. the level of the loudest peak ) and the averaged RMS ( root mean square ) power : <p> A DAW 's peak level meters are only really designed for monitoring general signal level and clipping issues , so some form of loudness meter is also useful for trying to check the perceived loudness of a signal . The TT Dynamic Range Meter , shown on the right , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of averaged level , with the RMS method perhaps the most common . <p> Of course , if you run a complete track through a meter such as this it will only give part of the picture , as it does n't indicate how the power is distributed throughout the audio spectrum or between the various contributory musical parts . A spectrum analyser or similar multi-frequency level meter can be useful in addition to these broadband tools which measure the entire frequency range . <h> Using compression <p> If you 're generally happy with a track 's overall mix , but feel that it lacks a little punch or sounds quiet in relation to other peoples tracks , then some form of dynamics processing might be the solution . <p> The most common standard tools in the armoury are compression and limiting , with limiting- essentially being a form of extreme compression above the threshold level ( check out the- mix bus compression feature- for more on this ) . <p> This unprocessed audio is peaking near to 0dB , so there may appear to be little we can do increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower the threshold setting until we achieve 3dB of gain reduction . The loudest peaks are being squashed ' by 3dB allowing us to move everything up in level by the same amount : <h> Take it to the limit <p> For more dramatic limiting , we need to apply more extreme compression settings . Limiting by definition requires a fast attack time , so if you want to turn your gentle compression into limiting you should look at making the attack as fast as possible without inducing distortion . Release should be moderate to fast for most rhythmic material , and ratio greater than 10:1. - Many compressors and limiters offer an automatic release setting which will allow the effect to adjust the release time based on the audio material being processed although you can switch to manual control if required . <p> The screengrab on the right shows how to configure the classic SSL master compressor plugin for limiting .

However , if we start and end our progression at different intervals of the same scale , we get the following modes , now in their respective keys : <p> So , for example , E , F , G , A , B , C , D , E is a Phrygian mode in E , whereas F , G , A , B , C , D , E , F will give you a Lydian mode in F. As well see shortly , these modes can then be transposed up and down to play them in different keys . So , if we transposed every note in the E Phrygian mode down four semitones , we 'd have C Phrygian . <p> The four modes we 'll be looking at here are the most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its happy ' sound is largely characterised by its major 3rd , but the major 7th ( both highlighted in red ) is also important , especially in a lot of dance music where major 7 chords are frequently used . <p> Dance music is very rarely written in a major key . However , every major key has a relative minor ( Aeolian mode ) using all the same notes . This means that chord progressions in a minor key could easily have a melody in a major key over the top . <p> We can hear an example of this below . We 've played a very recognisable melody in a C major key , then repeated it over a simple chord progression in C majors relative minor key , A minor . This completely changes the context and feel of the original melody : <p> Aside from the flattened 2nd , it is identical to the Aeolian mode / natural minor scale . It is this flattened 2nd , highlighted in red , which gives the Phrygian scale its distinctive Eastern ' sound . <h> Phrygian Mode Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Phrygian mode in practice , let 's listen to the opening of Organic ' by Kryptic Minds , taken from the album One Of Us . The eastern flute solo that opens the track is in a G Phrygian mode . <p> Along with the instrumentation and the use of reverb , the Phrygian mode helps give the intro its Eastern sound , setting the tone for the track 's dark , minor and almost sinister quality . Listen out for the Ab in particular at 0:47 , which defines it as being in a Phrygian mode rather than the Aeolian mode . <h> Related <h> Passing Notes is sponsored by 200505 @qwx400505 200506 @qwx400506 200507 @qwx400507 <p> those this modes had thier own harmony progressions , or i can use them over any minor or major " functional " harmony ? ? thanks for this column , its great to discuss on this matter and the magazine is great . thanks ! ! <p> Yes , the modes will have slightly different chord progressions depending on any flattened / sharpened notes in the mode . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 2nd interval of the scale will be Bb , rather than the B we have as the 2nd interval of the natural minor scale . <p> This means that the 2nd triad chord we can make from an A Phrygian mode will be a Bb major triad ( Bb , D , F ) rather than the B diminished triad ( B , D , F ) that wed get from the natural minor scale . Hope this helps ! Cheers , <p> All your music theory explanations ( not just this one ) are so helpful and well done ! It confirms a lot of stuff I have been doing intuitively by trial and error , but it also gives me inspiration for composing new and better music ! So thanks ! <p> I really like your explanations on theory but just wished they go a bit further . Its just a bit brief and at a basic level generally availableI do n't  mean to be strongly critical but just that it seems like you guys have the understanding to discuss a lot more and I 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's obviously a fine line between something which is too basic to be useful and something which is too advanced for some people to understand . We know that a lot of dance producers do n't  have any background in theory so we want to make sure we do n't  turn anybody off by jumping straight in at the deep end . As we continue with this series well certainly be looking at some more advanced theory and getting deeper into some of the ideas weve already discussed . We hope you 'll stick with us . <p> I have been trawling the web for some good dance music production help for a while now but yours is by far the best . Clear and concise , gets the point across exactly how it should be done . Thank you very much . <p> I would like to echo that i want to see more advanced stuff having a strong background in music theory being classically trained . I have just found it very hard making the jump into making dance music . Whilst i have been an avid listener for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But so many of your tutorials are so helpful and i cant wait to see more . Keep it up ! <p> I experimented myself one month ago improvising with modes over a constant drone bass note , and found that in that context , mixolydian sounded very much like celtic music , phrygian was more like arab / sinister thing , dorian sounded like in your face rock solos i think it was a very nice exercise to do , i recommend everybody to do it ! <p> Your article is very good and gave me another great take on the subject , thank you very much ! <p> I know this is an old article and all , but is n't the last picture Mixolydian rather than Ionian ( because of the Bb ) ? im new to music theory so maybe i 'm missing something : &gt; this is a great website btw &lt;3 <p> But in the context of a track that is composed solely in the minor key , by default that 's in Aeolian , right ? Unless you employ one of the more complex minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale to make melody and chords from , that 's by default Aeolian am i right in thinking that ? <p> Just trying to string together the important for minor scales for dance music and the Aeolian mode mentioned in this article . <p> Ionian mode mode cheesy ? , this is the problem with all of you guys who study music theory to the nth degree , and believe the text books , this is a classic quote from them , do you think the audience is going to hear that as " cheesy " ? , of course not ! 
@@34419753 @3419753/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Books/DVDs <h> I Dream Of Wires <p> The extended cut of this engrossing modular synth documentary demands serious time investment but offers a thorough history of a technology intertwined with personal relationships and creative processes . <p> " I do n't want to make music as anyone knows it , " Morton Subotnick recalls telling analogue synth pioneer Don Buchla in the mid 1960s . For the last half a century , that 's exactly what modular synthesis has represented : an alternative to conventional approaches . The mainstream appeal of modular synths was small even when they were the only option in the brave new world of electronic music , but they became even more specialist when cheaper , more compact synths hit the market in the early 1970s , and their popularity continued to fluctuate over the following decades as fashions changed and new technologies altered the musical landscape further . <p> Fifty years on from the release of Bob Moog and Don Buchlas first modular synths , the technology has never been more widely available , more affordable and " - dare we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market in recent years- driven largely by the emergence of the compact Eurorack format . <p> Histories of synthesis all too often rush through the modular 's pivotal late 1960s role in- an effort to leap ahead to the glamour of Minimoogs , OB-8s and Prophet-5s , the affordability of DX7s and the dominance of Japanese manufacturers . As soon as more affordable compact synths become commonplace in the early 70s , modulars are relegated to footnotes and afterthoughts . It 's understandable . Even the most ardent proponent of the benefits of modular would surely concede that modular formats remained the preserve of a small but passionate group of niche enthusiasts for much of the 1970s , 80s and well into the 90s . <p> But with interest in modular synthesis now greater than ever , the time is right to recap the story of its development , the modulars turbulent time in the wilderness and , arguably the most interesting factor of all : its rebirth as a genuine alternative to mass-market synths . <p> This , the so-called Hardcore Edition extended cut of the I Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited release only . Overwhelming demand has driven the filmmakers to make it available as a general release on DVD and Blu-ray. - Over the course of its four-hour length , I Dream Of Wires explores every aspect of modular synthesis . Starting with Columbia University 's RCA Mark II valve synth and Bob Moog 's early experiments with theremins and oscillators , the documentary charts the course of the modular synth 's early dominance of the electronic music world , its slow and gradual decline over the next few decades and finally its recent renaissance . <p> It 's the personal stories which resonate the strongest ; the links between musicians , their instruments , and the pioneers who designed them. - The film tells a story in which technology and art are inextricably intertwined . Drawing on Morton Subotnicks outline of a new electronic instrument , Buchla returned with a device Subotnick dubbed an " electronic music easel " ; a new approach to synthesis and electronic music composition was born . <p> It 's the personal stories which resonate the strongest ; the links between musicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Modular synths somehow go hand in hand with personal stories . The manufacture of synth modules themselves has , after all , always been associated much more closely with individuals , small companies and enthusiastic amateurs than it has with the corporate giants who eventually came to dominate the keyboard market . But it 's not just about manufacturers. - Once the mass appeal of synthesisers exploded in the early 80s , personal relationships with electronic instruments changed again . <p> Take that DX7 for example : with over 160,000 units sold , all of which could draw on banks of presets without any hard work on the part of the performer , could you really say that the average owner was as personally invested in the instrument as the typical modular synth owner of the 1960s or 70s ? - That 's not a criticism of mass-produced synths , per se " - without them the field of electronic would be radically different today- " - but it goes a small way to explaining what makes modular synths inspire the passion on display in I Dream Of Wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal tales continue . We move away from the impact of the original innovators and into a uniquely democratic , connected world of synth technology . Prices drop , modular synths eventually come back into vogue , but the community aspect of their design , manufacture and use becomes even more prominent . Where the earliest modular synth owners and users tended to be clustered around university music departments and big budget studios , the modular synth owner of today is more likely to be found on internet forums discussing new modules with manufacturers based in garages or basements half way around the world . <p> But the focus on technology shouldnt distract from the practical application of synthesisers . I Dream Of Wires also engages with the art of music making and the question of integrating these sometimes challenging instruments into a creative process . Fittingly , the films producer Jason Amm 's all-modular soundtrack is suitably wonky in places while also demonstrating the fact that modulars can be tamed and used to make more than just the stereotypical bleeps and bloops . <p> Is it a documentary strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , maybe . But even the filmmakers admit that this sprawling work is best viewed in more easily managed chunks. - You could accuse the Hardcore Edition of I Dream Of Wires of being bloated and even self-indulgent , but you could say the same thing about many of the synths which it contains . To many , that 's part of the attraction . Either way , this is as thorough a study of the unique appeal of modular synths as you 'll find . 
@@34419754 @3419754/ 200504 @qwx400504 <h> Long Reads <h> What Makes A Great Label ? <p> With more new record labels being launched than ever before , standing out from the crowd is crucial to success . But if great music does n't  necessarily make a great label , what other factors determine the success or failure of an imprint ? We spoke to some of the most successful dance labels " and some of the young pretenders trying to knock them off their thrones . <p> Midland , pictured thinking about his new Graded imprint ( probably ) <p> Running a label is easy . The day-to-day process , at least . Anyone can do that bit . Running a good label ? That 's a whole different ball game . Think for a moment about your own favourite imprints and what characterises them . Whether they 're genre-defining legends like Trax , Warp , Strictly Rhythm , Transmat and Metalheadz or more recent names like Hyperdub , Ostgut Ton , Ed Banger and LIES , chances are it will be far more than just the music , because there are many labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them great labels . The true standouts are those that make your heart flutter when you see their logo popping out at you from a record rack " those buy-on-sight- guarantees of quality and a clearly defined aesthetic ; those whose way of doing things you admire ; - labels whose entire ethos you subscribe to . <p> The best record labels are cultural icons that can reflect the era we live in as well as any social study . They are historical journals , forever setting in stone musical trends , format fetishes and other signs of the times . They are n't  just about delivering music to people " if all you care about is letting people hear your music , get a SoundCloud account . They 're about identities and stories , communities and , in some cases , whole lifestyles . The labels to which we submit and subscribe are those we consciously or sub-consciously allow to define our own identities ; they 're extensions of our personalities , signifiers of our self . <p> The best record labels are cultural icons that can reflect the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a label in 2013 is easier than its ever been . Digital music can be released in your sleep and even pressing a small vinyl run is a fairly straightforward process . That said , 2013 is also the toughest time to start a label thanks to the ever-rising tide of homogenised averageness which gets released each and every day . No longer are 300 hand stamped , limited white labels enough to get you noticed ( except , most likely , for the wrong reason ) . - Barely a day goes by without a new label being announced , and when pressed about their motivation for adding to a saturated market , all too many label owners resort to that trite platitude : " We just want to release good music that we like . " So where do you start ? Is a desire to take control of the release process sufficient justification for launching a label ? <p> For Midland , currently enjoying the success of release 001 on his newly minted Graded , it was " just a desire to present my music in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artwork and a collectable vinyl product . I want the label to feel hand made , " he continues , " from the artwork to the music ; something that has the digital edges rounded off . " And with that he has an MO , the basis of a clearly defined aesthetic , a loose template on which to build in the future . <p> Detroit sex-punk Jimmy Edgar had grander designs from the off . His new Ultramajic label " run with Machinedrum " has been birthed to " develop artists , develop a new sound for myself and take this visual journey more seriously . I 've always been a student of occult , quantum physics , new age philosophies and the esoteric , so were playing with these ideas very subtly through the label . " Of course , it will take the passage of time and arrival of a few releases for these concepts to be implanted on the brains of those who buy Ultramajic releases , but if you do n't  start right , you ai n't  gon na end right . <p> I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new age philosophies and the esoteric , so we 're playing with these ideas very subtly through the label . <h> Format fetishism <p> And then there 's the format itself . Midland admits to having had sleepless nights deciding on whether to be vinyl-only before coming to the conclusion that " its not my place to dictate what format someone buys and plays my music on " . Jimmy Edgar also stresses its importance : " It can make or break a label , " he explains . " For us its an advantage to have a really slick physical product because we want to create monumental statements . " <p> Dixon Avenue Basement Jams concur on the importance of image : " Originally we had planned to just do white labels with no stamp and no info at all , but we thought after a while that would get boring for us and also , from my own personal experience working in Rubadub , white label records with no art tend to end up stuffed behind other releases on the wall , so we wanted something that would stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognisable . " <p> Not every label is conceived with such forethought , though . Since 2005 , Yossi Amoyal has run the Sushitech label , home to luminaries such as Delano Smith and Steve OSullivan . " I always wanted to let the music be the driving force behind the label , " he explains , " rather than a release schedule or brand . The music dictates our schedule rather than the other way round , so we might have two releases a year or 10 , it all depends on the music and if the artists and I feel right releasing it . " <p> At this point its important to consider the bravery " and by the same token , restraint " required to run a decent label . It would be easy to get sucked into a regular release schedule for a number of reasons " it keeps you in the public eye , you increase your chances of having a big hit , of becoming flavour of the month and so on , but once you set out your stall , youd better hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to lower your quality levels just to keep up with your own self-imposed schedule . <p> While avoiding the temptation to release more frequently and run the risk of reducing quality control , many of the label bosses we spoke to stressed the importance of sticking to a cohesive musical style rather than getting tempted to branch out into too many sounds at once . " You can find almost anything in my collection , but that does n't  mean that I 'll release all these sounds and genres on Sushitech , " reckons Yossi . " If I did , it would be difficult to present the concise vision and message of our art as well as I hope to . " Critical boss Kasra puts it a different way : " Its not a lack of ambition ; you have to stick to what you know . Every scene needs labels that do their own , different stuff .
