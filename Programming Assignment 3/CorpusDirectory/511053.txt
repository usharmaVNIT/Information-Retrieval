Shares of General Motors rose slightly Tuesday , May 30 , 2017 , as a proxy fight escalated between the company and a hedge fund that wants to split its shares into two classes . David Einhorn 's Greenlight Capital said Tuesday it 's sending a letter to shareholders emphasizing that the stock price has barely grown since GM 's initial public offering at $33 seven years ago . GM says two independent evaluation firms are against the proposal that it calls too risky .

@@88503212 @4003212/ <h> Running : It 's all about the socks <p> Other than your own two feet , what is the most important thing you put into your running shoes ? Socks ! And if you think " socks are socks " , well , we got a little lesson from the folks at Complete Runner in Flint .

Brad says you have to choose very wisely , " One of the biggest injuries in running is blisters , and a lot of that stems from the socks that you put on your feet . " <p> So , you can invest in the best running shoes and still wind up with pretty painful blisters , " What 's the first thing that you do ? Between that shoe and your skin , you put a rotton sock- a cotton sock . <p> In the running world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What we like is you know , like a poly blend or a merino wool , to put in between there . That 's going to wick away moisture , keep the skin nice and dry . and that eliminates blisters , hot spots and odor . " <p> There is another disadvantage to cotton socks , that can really make for an uncomfortable run , Brad adds , " When cotton gets wet , it starts to bunch up a little bit and that 's when it starts creeping down the back of your heel . " <p> Another way to help avoid your socks coming off inside your shoe is to look for the ones with a little lip right at the heel , to help hold them up while you run . <p> Just remember , a good sock still needs the right shoe for complete comfort . Make sure you get fitted for the right size and type of shoe for your foot . Running specialty stores typically have staff trained to help you make the right choice .

Rick Snyder to investigate how the crisis happened . <p> The Flint water crisis began in April 2014 when the city switched over to the Flint River as a water source . Previously , the city received water from what is now known as the Great Lakes Water Authority , which operates out of Detroit . <p> Nearly two years later , it was determined that the water system was contaminated with lead . Flint has since switched back the Detroit water system .

Police said that 's exactly why they wanted to release it . <p> In his first remarks on the assault , Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said that the attacker was simply " crazy . " He questioned what the gunman was going to do with the $2 million horde of poker chips he had tried to haul away . He also discounted any links to the Islamic State group , saying this " is not the work of ISIS .

He then begins dousing gambling tables and slot machines , igniting each with a lighter . <p> Luchie Arguelles , 61 , was playing slots just after midnight when she saw the man enter .

The Polynesian voyaging canoe is returning to Hawaii after a three-year journey around the world guided only by nature with navigators using no modern navigation to guide Hokulea across 40,000 nautical miles to 19 countries . Thousands are expected to welcome the double-hulled canoe to Oahu , Hawaii , on Saturday , June 17 , 2017 . ( AP Photo/Sam Eifling , File ) <p> No modern navigation instrumentation guided a Polynesian voyaging canoe as it followed the horizon during a three-year journey around the globe . <p> About a dozen crewmembers for each leg of the voyage relied only on their understanding of nature 's cues " ocean swells , stars , wind , birds " and their own naau , or gut , to sail across about 40,000 nautical miles ( 74,000 kilometers ) to 19 countries , spreading a message of malama honua : Caring for the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hokulea home to Hawaii when it entered a channel off the island Oahu and tied up to a floating dock with iconic Diamond Head in the distance . <p> Ka'iulani Murphy , an apprentice navigator on the double-hulled canoe , told The Associated Press that the successful journey taught her the value of ancient Polynesian maritime techniques . <p> " We really are sailing in their ( the ancestors ' ) wake , " said Murphy , 38 . " We had to re-learn what our ancestors had mastered . " <p> The toughest part of the journey was dealing with cloud cover and trying to maintain the proper speed so the boat escorting the canoe could keep pace , she said , adding that she enjoyed eating the fish the crew caught during the journey . <p> " Just being here and feeling the mana ( power ) that 's here , it 's something to enjoy which brings tears to my eyes , " Wong said . " This is so powerful . " <p> The crew held a formal homecoming ceremony on Magic Island , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Ige and Mayor Kirk Caldwell and a speech by Nainoa Thompson , a well-known master navigator , the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported . <p> Thompson , president of the Polynesian Voyaging Society , was visibly moved as he addressed the crowd , saying that he was " standing here on behalf of the many , " Hawaii News Now reported . <p> " Thank you , Hawaii . Thank you for the moment , " he said . " I am very humbled to tell you right now that Hokulea is home . " <p> The voyage perpetuated the traditional wayfinding that brought the first Polynesians several thousand miles to Hawaii hundreds of years ago . The trip also helped train a new generation of young navigators . <p> Hokulea means star of gladness . The canoe was built and launched in the 1970s , when there were no Polynesian navigators left . So the Voyaging Society looked beyond Polynesia to find one . <p> Mau Piailug , from a small island called Satawal in Micronesia , was among the last half-dozen people in the world to practice the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1976 . <p> " Without him , our voyaging would never have taken place , " the Polynesian Voyaging Society said on the website for Hokulea .

" <p> The epic round-the-world voyage that started in 2014 shows how far Hokulea has gone since its first voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti in 1976 . <p> Disaster befell another voyage in 1978 when the canoe capsized off the Hawaiian island of Molokai in a blinding storm . Eddie Aikau , a revered Hawaiian surfer and lifeguard on the crew , grabbed his surfboard and paddled for help , but was never seen again . The rest of the crewmembers were rescued . <p> Crewmembers hope the success of the latest journey will inspire other indigenous cultures to rediscover and revive traditions .

" And I think that is the challenge of the time for planet earth and all of humanity . " <p> Crewmembers of the worldwide voyage were mindful to incorporate that into daily life . <p> Fish they caught for meals never went to waste , even when the crew once landed a 49-pound ahi , crewmember Naalehu Anthony , who participated in about half-a-dozen legs of the voyage , recalled in a blog post . <p> " The fish was plenty for us for the day , " he wrote . <p> Crewmembers slept in plywood bunks covered with waterproof canvas and bathing was simple , recalled Russell Amimoto , a Hokulea crewmember for two legs . <p> " We have unlimited supply of nice , ocean-temperature saltwater available , " he said , explaining that crewmembers threw a bucket attached to a rope overboard to scoop up water for bathing . <p> The voyage has had challenges and reaching South Africa in 2015 " the journey 's halfway point " was the most dangerous leg because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 10,023-foot ( 3,055-meter ) high Maui mountain Haleakala looming in the distance , signifying Hokulea 's official return to Hawaii waters . <p> After returning , Hokulea will embark on an eight-month trip sailing throughout the Hawaiian islands . <p> " We will go to as many as 70 communities and 100 schools to thank Hawaii 's people and share what we have learned with their children , " Thompson said .

She called the argument " outrageous " and rejected the idea that political violence afflicts the left and right equally . <p> " For them to all of a sudden be sanctimonious as if they had never seen such a thing before--and I do n't even want to go into the President of the United States in terms of some of the language he 's used , " she said before taking a step back and insisting the conversation was best left for another day . <p> Like many other members of Congress , Pelosi has received numerous death threats .
