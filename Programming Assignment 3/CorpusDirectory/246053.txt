@@37016274 @6016274/ <h> I. Introduction <p> Harford Community College is an academic community and all members and visitors share the duty and responsibility of securing and maintaining the freedom to learn within that academic community . Freedom carries responsibilities ; chief among these is respect for rights and values of others . In order to provide and preserve this freedom and promote safety , security and overall well-being on the HCC campus and at College-sponsored and College-supervised functions , this Student Code was developed by a committee of students , faculty , staff , and administrators and is reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with best practices and strategic priorities of the College . <p> Within the College community , individuals are accorded respect in an academic environment that is conducive to learning , fosters student development and is free from discrimination on the basis of race , color , religion , sex , national origin , age , status as an individual with a disability , veteran , sexual orientation , gender identity , marital status , or any other characteristic protected by law or by the policies and practices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit and to practice professional behavior and model good citizenship when participating in all instructional settings , including during classroom instruction , field experiences , internships , athletic and cultural events , co-op assignments , and other related College endeavors .

@@37016346 @6016346/ <h> Question : <p> Should I use Owlnet or SOLAR ? <h> Answer : <p> If you are a non-credit student you must use SOLAR . If you are a credit student that has attended in 2007 or later , you should use OwlNet . SOLAR is used for credit students who last attended prior to 2007 and all non-credit students . <h> Question : <p> Does my OwlNet username and password work for my email account ? <h> Answer : <p> After you set-up your account , your OwlNet username and password is the same for your Owlmail , and network accounts . If you need to access your SOLAR account , which uses a different security system with a different user name and password , please contact Registration and Records . <h> Question : <p> What is my email and network username ? <h> Answer : <p> Your username depends on when you were first registered for classes . If you registered for your first class in the Summer 2008 semester , then your username is made up of the first character of your first name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . The number is different for each student with similar first and last names ( Example : Joe Smith could be jsmith5 ) . Unfortunately the number is impossible to predict , so you will need to refer to your admissions letter to get your exact account name . If you registered for your first class at HCC before the Summer 2008 semester , then your username is made up of the first character of your first name followed by the first two characters of your last name , then by your birth month and day with two digits each , followed by the letter " a " . For example , if your name was Joe Smith and your birthday was 01/03/1980 , then your username would be JSm0103a . Please note : in the event that multiple students have the same usernames the additional accounts will have letters other than a on the end to distinguish the accounts ( ex . JSm0103b ) . <h> Question : <p> What is my email address ? <h> Answer : <p> Your email address starts with your username , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is jsmith5 then your email address will be **27;62;TOOLONG <h> Question : <p> The very first time I log in , what is my email and network password ? <h> Answer : <p> This depends on your account username . If your username uses the format : jsmith5 , your password is your 6-digit birthdate : mmddyy If your username uses the format : jsm0103a , your password will be the last six digits of your social security number . <h> Question : <p> How do I set up my email and network account ? <h> Answer : <p> Use the Account Setup Wizard to guide you through the steps of account creation . Once you have gone through this process you will be able to use your account to log into OwlNet and the HCC network . <h> Question : <p> I have forgotten my email and network password .

In addition , because he had attended a private institution for most of middle school and all of high school , he was accustomed to a more personalized classroom experience and faculty/teacher to student ratio . He found that same type of close personal relationship and much more at HCC . <p> " I never realized how much opportunity there was to get involved here . I used to only go to class , the library for homework , and then I would go home . " He found that being involved made his college experience even more enjoyable . He joined the Student Government Association , and has participated in several HCC programs including L.E.A.D. , iCan Succeed , and Soar2Success . In addition , Daylin serves as an orientation leader and a peer mentor . <p> " I have loved my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment , the people , and most teachers have shown concern for my performance in the classroom . I have built some great relationships with certain individuals throughout my involvement in the different extracurricular activities on and off campus .

A psychology major who will graduate from Harford in spring 2016 , Daylin plans to transfer to a four-year institution . He loves learning about human behavior and hopes to pursue a career in Student Affairs/Student Activities . <p> He feels that Harford is great for those who want to save money , prefer a personalized experience , are unsure of what they want to major in , and/or if they just want a comfortable environment in which to grow before they transfer to a four-year institution .

@@37016379 @6016379/ <h> News <p> The Hays-Heighe House has been a part of the campus of Harford Community College ( HCC ) in Bel Air for sixty years , yet it was only in June 2010 , that the historic building was partially restored and fully renovated to realize its full potential to serve the campus and the public . The House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 , the first building in Harford County to be awarded this distinction . Since June 2010 the House has been used as a public history space , with a mission to showcase the social and cultural history of Harford County through exhibits and inclusive programming . <p> Although other structures on the property ( such as barns ) that were built prior to the construction of the College are no longer in place , the historic springhouse remains . The springhouse was built in the early 1800s but by 2004 was much in need of repair . During 2004-2005 , then HCC faculty member Rhonda Deeg and students in the Building Preservation and Restoration academic program shored up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof along with the roof structure . <p> During 2016 , additional work was performed on the structure to stabilize it and to allow it to be viewed safely by the campus community and the general public . In April 2016 , a permanent drainage system was installed to drain the flooded springhouse , which allowed contractors to clean and repair/preserve the existing stone walls . The spring was sunk into drain tile through the springhouse and diverted to flow directly into the nearby spring . The surrounding landscape was altered to reduce the incursion of surface water into the springhouse . <p> In May 2016 , the oak roofing system was preserved and missing roof slate was replaced . Extensive masonry repairs were made when it was discovered that a large tree root had pushed a wall . Workers unearthed and reset granite steps leading down to the springhouse , which completed prior work done to clear the overgrown area for better visibility and easier access . Much needed improvements were made to allow better access to and around the springhouse , including a placing a layer of washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installing an asphalt walkway to the site . <p> In August 2016 , a shelf to store crockery was reinstalled , spanning the side wall . Crockery was added for historical verisimilitude . While visitors are not able to enter the springhouse ( other than through special arrangements for specific purposes ) , a grillwork gate allows ample visibility of the interior from the doorway . In November 2016 , the College installed two exterior signs , providing viewers with information about springhouses generally and about this springhouse specifically . <p> The purpose for the stabilization work was to provide opportunities for Harford Community College students and the general public to have a glimpse of what life was like during the 1800s and early 1900s . The stabilized springhouse complements and extends the learning made possible by the renovation/restoration of the Hays-Heighe House itself . Already , two students in the Engineering Technology program at Harford Community College have taken on a project to create a three-dimensional , working model of the springhouse , using 3-D printing technology . Also , a student in HCCs Mass Communication program used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horror movie . We anticipate many more creative projects that involve the springhouse in the future . <p> Contractors on the project included Modern Construction from Street , MD to do the work on the building and CD Lawncare from Whiteford , MD to do the cleanup of the trees and brush . Lou Claypoole , Manager for Special Projects at Harford Community College , and Steve Garey , Associate Vice President for Campus Operations at the College , oversaw the project . <p> To celebrate the completion of the springhouse stabilization project , the Hays-Heighe House reinstalled its June 2016 exhibit titled Made By Hand and scheduled a series of lectures and other programs related to the restoration of historic properties . The programs included a lecture by Meg Algren , Ph.D. , on " Common Plants Around Springhouses ; " a slide show and talk by local historians Henry C. Peden , Jr . and Jack L.

@@37016385 @6016385/ <h> MARYLAND HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION STUDENT TRANSFER POLICIES <h> Authorization <p> These Student Transfer Policies , as adopted by the Maryland Higher Education Commission on December 4 , 1995 , shall be effective and applicable to students first enrolling in Maryland public post-secondary educational institutions in Fall 1996 , and thereafter . <h> Applicability of Policies <p> These transfer policies and procedures apply to admission , credit transfer , program articulation , and related matters for undergraduate students who wish to transfer between Maryland public colleges and universities . The Maryland Higher Education Commission also recommends them to Maryland independent institutions . <h> Rationale <p> A major premise of the Maryland public higher education system is that a student should be able to progress from segment of higher education to another without loss of time or unnecessary duplication of effort . The Maryland Higher Education Commission 's objective is to ensure that a student who intends to complete a baccalaureate degree and who begins his or her work at a community college , is able to move toward the completion of that degree by transferring to a baccalaureate degree-granting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . At the same time , the Commission recognizes that some students change their educational objectives as they progress in their studies , indeed , sometimes because their students expose them to new ideas and possibilities . These students should also be able to complete their general education courses and have them transfer without loss of credit . <p> One means of accomplishing this objective is through the development of recommended transfer programs between two- and four-year institutions . A recommended transfer program , developed by careful planning and agreement between specific two- and four-year institutions , is that recommended sequences of courses which a student takes at a community college will constitute the first two years of a baccalaureate degree program at a Maryland public institution of higher education . <p> The Maryland Higher Education Commission recognizes that students select institutions of higher education for a variety of reasons . These policies also recognize that each Maryland public college or university has a separate and distinct mission , and that each has the responsibility to establish and maintain standards of expectations for courses , programs , certificates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient transfer of credits between and among these institutions must occur within the larger context of the statewide structure of baccalaureate and community college education . <p> Successful and harmonious articulation depends upon : <p> Firm agreement that the needs of the student should be a primary concern in developing articulation procedures , while maintaining the integrity of educational programs ; <p> Establishment of clear and equitable policies to assure optimum accessibility for transfer students with minimal loss of credits and minimal duplication of course content ; <p> Mechanisms for evaluation and resolving difficulties students may encounter in moving from one school to another ; <p> Free and continuous communications among institutions ; <p> Mutual respect for institutions and their missions ; <p> Adaptability , within a context of understanding that changes affect not only the institution making changes but also the students and institutions impacted by the changes ; <p> Free exchange of data among institutions ; <p> Timely exchange of information relative to students ' progress . <p> The intended principal benefactor is the student , whose uninterrupted progress toward a degree - based on successful academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current information about programs , and is best protected by a clear transfer policy pertaining to the public segments of higher education in Maryland . <p> The State 's interests are similarly served through such a policy , which results in the optimal use of its higher education resources by reducing the costly duplication that results in the needless waste of the valuable time and effort of Maryland students , faculty , and administration . <p> Institutional interests and missions are also protected by this systematic approach , which permits them to incorporate into their academic planning more accurate projections about the programmatic backgrounds of transferring students . <p> In more specific ways this document 's purpose is to : <p> Define broad areas of agreement among the public two-year and four-year institutions of higher education pertaining to facilitating the transfer of students within these segments ; <p> Provide a mechanism for continuous evaluation of programs , policies , procedures , and relationships affecting transfer of students ; <p> Provide such revisions as are needed to promote the academic success and general well-being of the transfer student ; <p> Provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve difficulties that students experience in transfer . <p> While policies and procedures can be established which facilitate the transfer of students , it is the responsibility of the student , as the principal in the process , to know and follow the procedures defined . <h> .01 Scope and Applicability . <h> .02 Definitions . <p> In this chapter , the following terms have the meanings indicated . <p> Terms defined . <p> " A.A. degree " means the Associate of Arts degree . <p> " A.A.S. degree " means the Associate of Applied Sciences degree . <p> " Arts " means courses that examine aesthetics and the development of the aesthetic form and explore the relationship between theory and practice .

Transitional Studies courses are offered for students who demonstrate on the Academic Skills Assessment the need to improve one or more of the basic skills . Transitional courses provide a supportive instructional environment that allows students to attain the basic skills and attitudes to perform effectively in college-level study . <p> Transitional Studies courses are listed under the English , mathematics , human development and chemistry sections in the Schedule of Classes and begin with the number 0 or 00 . These courses are used to determine full-time or part-time status ; however , credits earned are shown as " 0 " on the student 's academic transcripts and can not be applied toward fulfillment of a degree or certificate . Grades earned in transitional studies courses are not computed into the student 's GPA . <p> Students enrolling in transitional courses should allow one hour per week on campus in addition to class time . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center and to take advantage of other support services . <p> If Academic Skills Assessment results indicate that a student needs to enroll in transitional courses , such courses must be completed prior to or concurrently with other college courses . If enrolled in a degree or certificate program with an English Composition ( ENG 101 ) requirement or college level math requirement ( 100 level or above ) , the student must complete these courses before they attain 24 college-level credits . Furthermore , transitional courses required as prerequisites to college level English and math must be continued in sequence once begun until college level courses in English and math are complete . It is strongly recommended that students consult with an advisor before withdrawing from any Transitional Studies course . <h> POLICIES ON TRANSFER COURSES <h> Transfer Students <p> Credit may be granted for coursework completed at regionally accredited institutions and from institutions that are candidates for regional accreditation . Course work completed at degree-granting and non-degree-granting higher education institutions that are not regionally accredited but hold national or specialized accreditation recognized by the U.S. Department of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered for transfer credit on a case by case basis . <p> Students pursuing a degree or certificate at HCC should provide an official transcript to the Registration and Records Office prior to the completion of their first semester at HCC . Transcripts are considered official only if received by HCC in the issuing institution 's sealed envelope within one year of the print date . Transfer courses are accepted based upon the student 's declared program of study at HCC . Students who have previously earned an associate 's or bachelor 's degree will not be evaluated for General Studies . <p> A student is required to complete fifteen credit hours in residency at HCC in order to graduate with an associate degree and/or must complete 25 percent of the required credit hours for a certificate . <p> See Assessment for Prior Learning for policies regarding the awarding of credit through non-traditional learning . <p> All transcripts received by the Registration and Records Office are the property of the College and can not be released to the student ; they will not be duplicated , returned to the applicant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual , or agency . <p> Since it may be difficult to assess transfer credit from another institution unless adequate information is available , it is the student 's responsibility to supply the Registration and Records Office with a catalog and/or course syllabi from each institution previously attended , if requested . <p> Transfer students pursuing an associate degree or certificate are strongly encouraged to meet with an academic advisor in the Student Center prior to registering for credit courses . A review of assessment results , previous college credits and grades , and the length of time away from college should be taken into consideration when planning an appropriate course load . <p> Students seeking information about receiving credit through non-traditional learning should see the policy for Assessment for Prior Learning in the catalog . <h> Transfer of General Education Courses <p> HCC adheres to the general education and transfer policies of the Maryland Higher Education Commission ( MHEC ) and complies with Maryland COMAR 13B.02.02.16 .

Documents must be evaluated and translated by a credential evaluation service . HCC requires a course-by-course evaluation and recommends the use of AACRAO or WES ( World Education Service ) but does accept official evaluations from members of the National Association of Credentialing Evaluation Services . Evaluations must be received by HCC directly from the issuing agency . Courses may be considered on a case-by-case basis . <h> Repeating of Transfer Courses <p> Transfer students with multiple repeats of the same course at previous institutions will have the most recent attempt , regardless of the grade or previous institution 's repeat policy , reviewed for transfer credit . If you received transfer credit for a HCC equivalent course and then repeated the same course at HCC for credit , the transfer course credit will be excluded from your transfer record and the HCC grade becomes permanent . The HCC course will be included in the student 's grade point average regardless if higher transfer grade was higher . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course at HCC and then earned credit at another institution for the same course may use the transferred credit to satisfy the credit requirement for that particular course .

Students must submit an official transcript to the Registration and Records Office . <p> A student who received a passing grade ( D or better ) for an HCC course can not transfer the equivalent course to HCC . The credit will not be accepted . <h> Current Students Attending Other Institutions <p> Students who plan to take course work at other institutions after enrolling at HCC should have the courses approved in advance by an academic advisor . This process will assure that courses taken to meet program or General Education requirements will transfer to HCC . <h> ACADEMIC STANDARDS FOR CREDIT STUDENTS <p> At the end of each semester , each student 's academic standing is reviewed .

HCC Associate Professor and Owl Magazine advisor Claudia Brown helped Faras to achieve his goals . He stated , " Claudia Brown deserves a lot of credit for allowing me to explore my creativity . College was a surprise to me because I was never good in grade school like my well-achieved siblings . I felt like there was always a box that I was being forced to think inside of . Claudia pushed me to make my own decisions and never settle for good enough . She trusted me as a leader and example for the other students and always treated me like a true professional at my craft .

I love art and I love culture so by combining my experiences with my poetry , music , and cinematography , I am able to give people insight into my world and my visions .

These guidelines state that a student 's residency , also referred to as " domicile , " is the permanent place of abode , where physical presence and possessions are maintained with the intention of remaining indefinitely . <p> The main factor in determining residency is a student 's independent/dependent financial status . If a student is a financially dependent ( received more than one-half of his/her financial support from another in the most recently completed year ) , the student 's domicile is the domicile of the person contributing the greatest proportion of support , without regard to whether the parties are related by blood or marriage . <p> Students will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than one-half of the student 's financial support maintain legal domicile in Harford County for a period of not less than three months prior to the start of the semester/term . Students will be considered in-state residents if they or the person who contributes more than one-half of the student 's financial support maintain legal domicile in Maryland , but outside Harford County , for a period of not less than three months prior to the start of the semester/term . Otherwise , a student shall be considered an out-of-state resident . Local addresses that pertain only for the purposes of attending college will NOT be considered for determination of tuition charges , except to the extent necessary to determine if an individual qualifies as a covered individual under 38 U.S.C. 3679(c) . <p> If information is received which would contradict or call into question the validity of the residency status that was determined at the time of admission , a student may be asked to provide proof of residency and his/her tuition rate may be affected . <p> To request a change in residency , students must submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Registration and Records Office . Forms are available in the Registration and Records Office . A request for a change in residency must be received prior to the start of the semester/term .

@@37016487 @6016487/ <h> A Brief History of HCC <p> Harford Community College - originally called Harford Junior College ( HJC ) - began by offering afternoon and evening classes to a little more than 100 students at Bel Air High School in September 1957 . From the beginning , it was a serious academic institution , with its own library , and with many faculty members holding graduate degrees . Along with hiring high quality faculty , the first president , Dr John Musselman , focused on the transferability of courses and credit hours . He also boosted the schools reputation by achieving official accreditation for the College in 1958 . <p> The Harford County Board of Education , which governed the College for its first 15 years , bought Prospect Hill Farm in 1962 to construct the current campus . Harford Junior College opened the campus in 1964 to 705 students ( and more than 1000 the next year ) . There were three new buildings - those now called Aberdeen Hall ( science ) , Bel Air Hall ( arts ) , and Maryland Hall ( library ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old stone house became administration offices , a smaller house became a faculty lounge , and an old barn became the theater while the newer barn held physical education classes . <p> Dr. Alfred OConnell , the second president of Harford Junior College , emphasized and expanded programs that were terminal rather than for transfer . These were for para-professional careers in science , paramedical , and technical fields , along with the nursing program . Dr. OConnell also added new buildings to the campus . By 1968 , HJC had Havre de Grace Hall , Joppa Hall ( originally shared with the Board of Education as a Vocational Technical School ) . Also finished were the Chesapeake Center ( administration and a theater ) , and the Susquehanna Center ( pool and gymnasium ) . <p> The institution 's name was officially changed in the early 1970s from Harford Junior College to Harford Community College , and it became more independent of the Board of Education . Rather than having a Board of Trustees that completely overlapped with the school board , the College had its own , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 1970s were a difficult time for Harford Community College - just like the nation as a whole - as it struggled with funding cutbacks and budget shortfalls . Dr. OConnell , who had resigned in the late 1960s , was brought back on as president to get the College back on track . <p> In the early 1980s , Dr. OConnell tightened Harford Community Colleges academic standards . He instituted placement tests , changed policy to begin recording Fs and tracking GPAs , and authorized suspensions and other " restrictions .

Danielle took a year off from school and spent most of it completing all the required paperwork , but later learned that she would not be accepted for medical reasons . Since it was too late to apply to four-year institutions , she registered for classes at HCC in fall 2015 . That decision proved to be the right one for her .
