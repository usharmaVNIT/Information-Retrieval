So here goes - do try and stay with me , it will be informative ! <p> Roof Prism : Generally more compact , generally more robust and yes , ' generally ' slightly easier to hold , because they are more compact <p> Porro Prism : Slightly Larger , produce brighter images and on the whole , are less expensive . <p> Binocular companies manufacture the glass with and without coatings , so if it says coated or multi-coated on the box , it means that additional coatings have been added in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durability of the glass and stray light reflection . Some binoculars have coated surfaces on the air to glass surfaces only and then others go the whole hog and are coated front , back and inside out , which makes them fantastic for looking through but also very expensive ; but as they say , " You get what you pay for " <p> Binocular models explained . <p> The first number on the binocular is the magnification , so 8x , 10x 12x etc and then the second number is the objective lens size , that 's the bit at the opposite end to the eyepiece , so that can be anything from 21mm to 50mm etc . Now light is really important when seeing . How many of us have fallen into the wardrobe when grappling in the dark late at night ? The more light you can get to the back of your eye the better , so in a perfect world we would want all binoculars to have an objective size of at least 50mm , but of course , this makes them large and heavy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand for high quality binoculars in a compact style . Swarovski and Leica , do an amazing range in 8x20mm and Hawke and Viking have similar styled binos , which are possibly a bit more affordable , although remember , you will end up keeping them for life , so its always good to spend as much as you can in the initial purchase . <p> More Magnification is n't Necessarily Good <p> It is always tempting to get the highest magnification in binoculars , because logically , you would think that the more magnification you have the better the image . Well according to science and possibly a very , very long formula , the more magnification you have , the less light reaches the eye . So in the day to day world of binoculars , 20x binoculars , may sound fantastic , but unless the objective lens is really big , the image will be less clear than if you have a 10x42mm pair . If you want to magnify that sort of distance , then go for a spotting scope , as these are designed for long distance work .
