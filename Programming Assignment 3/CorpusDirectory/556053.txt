You can put an overgrip on top of that , to help with sweat absorption , or to increase the size of the grip and make the racket feel more comfortable in your freakishly large hands . <p> You can also buy a replacement grip . In this case you remove the factory grip and put on the replacement grip instead . <p> I generally only use overgrips . My favorite has always been Tourna Grip . here 's a video review I did of Tourna Grip , along with a brief tutorial on how to grip a squash racket . <p> I do n't  use replacement grips too often but I 'd have to guess the #1 brand of replacement squash grips is Karakal PU Super Grip .

Here it is : <h> Comments <p> Here are some thoughts on grips . I have gone from replacement grips to overgrips . Overgrips are faster to change , cheaper , just as good tack and usually you can use both sides . These points mean that you can change it more often than replacement grips for the same money . I only buy thin overgrips so they will not effect the grip size much . <p> Karakal PU Supergrip . I used to grip my rackets with this , but honestly I do n't  get the huge love people have for it . In my experience it initially has great tack , but it loses this great tackiness after the first matches and becomes just average quite fast . <p> Technifibre Absolut Squash replacement grip . Good initial tackiness and feel but looses its best feel and tackiness quite fast . Okay for sweaty hands , but not great . I would call it overall an " okay " product but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Shorbagy . <p> Tourna Grip overgrip . The initial tackiness is good , not great .

As a bonus you can use both sides of the grip like Wilson and Yonex . One of the best overgrips on the market . <p> Rab Reflex Dry Overgrip . Tries to emulate the Tourna grip but succeeds poorly . Low initial tackiness which gets just a little better with sweat/moisture . I can not recommend this product . <p> Wilson Pro overgrip . One of the best overgrips . Has a silky smooth feel , which is difficult to explain , with good tack . The smooth feel of this grip is probably its best trait . Okay for sweaty hands but not as good as Tourna . Average durability but you can use both sides , so a 3-pack actually becomes a 6-pack . Highly recommended <p> Yonex Super Grap overgrip . Quite similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as good for sweaty hands . Maybe looses its tackiness slightly faster than wilson , but overall a good overgrip . Average durability but you can use both sides . <p> Head Xtreme soft . Great initial tackiness . Has a nice rubbery feel and the neon yellow looks cool . Tackiness outlasts the Yonex and Wilson and has good durability . Slightly thicker than Yonex and Wilson . If you have sweaty hands it initially feels like it has good adsorbtion , but depending how much you sweat it will suddenly become very slippery . Only one-sided so you cant use it twice , but overall a good tacky grip but not for those who sweat alot from their hands . <p> Salming Extreme Sticky replacement grip and overgrip . Both the replacement- and overgrip feel quite similar except for the thickness . Very good tackiness and has a rubbery feel like the Head . Nice feel and looks cool and with average durability .

I have been an adidas stabil fan for years and have probably owned atleast one of every generation of stabil with the exception of the generation one boost . My first impression of the newer stabil boost 2 or stabil boost ii is a solid 8/10. i have only had the shoes for a 2 weeks now and only played 6 times in them however a few noteable differences in construction are quite pronounced . <p> First off the touge gap is quite large much larger then older stabil models i assume this is because adidas shoes tend to be tight fitting and not great for the wide footed players . Perhaps adidas thought that shortening the shoe sidewalls and increasing the size of the tounge gap would accomidate a larger foot ? What it has done is increase the span of the lace across the top of the shoe resulting in more lace and less shoe coming across the tounge . This is the biggest problem with the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding laceeyeletts rippling out . You really have to pull on the laces to get the shoe snug and there is allot of pressure on the lace during play that is not absorbed well by the shoe which was likely the cause of the eyelett damage cited above . <p> On top of that vs the prior generation stabil the shoe wall construction looks and feels a bit thin specifically around the lace eyelets which the have attempted to reinforce with a think rubber peice which looks more to me like fashion vs function . <p> Adidas has to done a great job reinforcing the shoe from the outside . Heel support is amazing and side wall is very good .. Toe box is quite snug yet still comfortable . The redesigned toe box vs old stabils and gen 1 boosts is much better and seems to eliminate the wrinkles that occurred across the top of the toe box in other models . <p> The new sole grips well and the shoe weight seems inline ( or a bit lighter ) then other stabil models . While I 'm not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shoe feels comfortable and supportive and responds well on court . <p> For me they felt a little bit to spongy . Furthermore the grip of the asics is better . The worst part is , that the holes for the laces tore off after just 3 weeks ( http : **27;36;TOOLONG I hope this is working ) . I returned them and try now salming . <p> Couple of guys on the club own these shoes . They seem to enjoy them and told me the fit was a little tighter around the foot .

Generally , I like traditional head shapes with a medium weight . <p> The Head is a really good choice Pierre , I had one the last year and I miss the feeling of this racket when I try to find the nick . A problem with grommets made me change to Eye and its 120 Control . Both are so similar rackets , despite the difference of weight , a little bit more powerful the Eye , more control in the Head .

Thanks to Tecnifibre for providing these rackets to review . <p> You 're welcome , Usman . I may not be able to give you the right answer but I 'll try . I 'm sure Pierre will have something to say on this . The numbers 16 , 17 , and 18 refer to the gauge of the squash string ; lower number implies thicker gauge and the higher number thinner gauge . Squash strings come in only two gauges , I think 17 and 18. 17 is thicker and 18 is thinner . 17 gauge strings diameter ranges from 1.16 mm to 1.25 mm , whereas 18 gauge strings diameter range is 1.06 mm 1.15 mm .

There are other options available but someone else , who has used other strings , can give you a better opinion . Hope this help . <p> Hi everyone , I recently broke my Tecnifibre Carboflex 125S and now searching for a new racket . The problem is that there is no way I can try a whole lot of rackets before I buy a new one . I tried Head Graphene Xenon 135 and Head Graphene XT Cyano 110 . I felt that the 135 version provided more control while the 110 one was more powerful . But I also felt that the Head rackets in general are flexible and vibrate on contact with the ball ( it could be due to my ( faulty ? ) technique but I rarely felt the Carboflex 125S vibrating ) . I 'm thinking of getting Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 but before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other visitors could provide their feedback . Looking at the pictures of Dynergy AP 125 , I 've a feeling that due to its squarer shaft it would tend to vibrate more as compared to Carboflex 125S , which has a rounder shaft . But of course its just my feeling . One of the contributor on this site felt that this racket is chunky , which makes it difficult to dig the ball out of the corners . Anyhow , any guidance in terms of Dynergy 125s comparison with Carboflex 125S would be welcome . Other options I have are Dynergy 117 , Prince Pro Sovereign 650 , and Prince Team Airstick 500 ( but I have n't tried these ) . Any **31;65;TOOLONG would indeed be greatly appreciated . By the way , I 'm an average club-level player , thin frame , and I play 3-4 times a week . I 'm not a power hitter . Thanks . <p> Hi Omer , this is a tricky one as I did n't  think the Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 had much vibration , but then again I 've used the Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I 'm not sure if I can answer this too well . <p> Hi Pierre , thanks for your reply . Like I said , it might be because of my inadequate technique that I felt vibrations when playing with Head rackets . Or it could be due to stock strings . But at the same I havent felt much vibration playing with Tecnifibre , Wilson , or Dunlop rackets . By the way , I have played with Wilson Fierce BLX , which I liked very much , Dunlop Aerogel 4D Elite , which did n't  suit my style of play at all as I got tennis elbow playing with it , and Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 S , which is a very nice racket . Anyhow , I decided to go with Tecnifibre Dynergy AP 125 . Why Im ( have ) switched away from Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 S ? Well , I thought a slightly head heavy racket would suit my style of play ( unfortunately , where I play , there are n't  many people who can give me solid advice , so its more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to get this one .

In my opinion , its quite a forgiving racket and sweet spot appears to be larger too . But for anyone who is switching from a lighter , even-balanced racket , it would take some time to get used to this racket . And to be honest , I liked the cosmetics and design of this racket , so I really wanted to get this one : ) . Once again , thanks for your reply . <p> Do n't  bother with the any prince racket under 750 power level .

The previous 2016 TexTreme racquets only had a small patch at 10 oclock and 2 oclock points . 4 . The new Pro Beast is the only racquet in the range to use the Powerbite string pattern and is slightly heavier than its predecessor at 135g unstrung ; the previous ones were 128g ( I should know , I 've had four of them ! ) . 5 . Spec-wise , I do n't  think the other " new " racquets have changed a great deal from their earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire range by about 20% . This might just be for me being in the UK and the - being weaker in comparison to the G/$ last year but could also be due to the extra TexTreme used in their construction . <p> So , Looks like the Pro rackets feature Textreme , and the team rackets do not . <p> Other than that , the four in each range are the same spec in terms of weight and power and string pattern ?

Anyone done a comparison on the Rockets vs. other Asics , or maybe vs . Salmings , the new darling of the PSA tour guys ? <p> Good comment from Stefan . I lean towards less cushioning personally , to get more floor feel , especially in the forefoot .

I have been playing it for a few weeks and the cushioning is fine although I never had an issue with my knees so I am not sure how others would take it . <p> It definitely feels light and is a bit more flexible than the Domain .

Anyone done a comparison on the Rockets vs. other Asics , or maybe vs . Salmings , the new darling of the PSA tour guys ? <p> Good comment from Stefan . I lean towards less cushioning personally , to get more floor feel , especially in the forefoot . That said , my knees are holding up so far ( knock wood ! ) and I get the lateral support I want from the Rockets , although I have n't tried other Asics models . Sometimes you stick with the devil you know .

Any suggestions <p> If you can find a Gel Blast 4 or 5 in your size go for it but if you have wider feet and can afford them I would definitely recommend that you try out the Salmings . The Adipower does fit a little on the narrow size so they might not be ideal .

To start things off the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch that Adidas supplies a spare pair of laces too .

Fit is normal for length and slightly narrow for width which results in a nice snug fit .

As a result , the underside of my ankle bone has essentially had the skin sanded off ! Very unpleasant . High tabs couples with firm build and rough material has been damn painful . <p> Unfortunately they are still pretty much as problematic 2 months on !

I have tried Asics Rocket , Wilson , Prince and right now using Dunlope.I planing either to go for Adipower 11 or Gel Blast . I have fairly broad feet and based on what I have read Adidas is narrow from the toe . Any suggestions <p> If you can find a Gel Blast 4 or 5 in your size go for it but if you have wider feet and can afford them I would definitely recommend that you try out the Salmings . The Adipower does fit a little on the narrow size so they might not be ideal . I have slightly narrow feet and these are a snug fit for me . <p> I bought the navy/orange version a couple of weeks ago and having played in them a few times my feedback is mostly positive . To start things off the shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch that Adidas supplies a spare pair of laces too . The shoe was a little stiff to start with but has softened nicely and offers good grip , breathability , stability and cushioning . Fit is normal for length and slightly narrow for width which results in a nice snug fit . As noted before I have suffered a little bit with rubbing underneath the ankle due to the high tabs on these shoes but just made a small adjustment by wearing slightly higher socks and that has helped . <p> Bought those 2 weeks ago in white/blue/silverish , sent them back the day after , I thought I had reasonably wide feet but these shoes clearly made me feel like a hobbit in a pair of Louboutin , God that was painful .

No wiggle per se and the construction of these shoes is top notch . A little on the heavy side , but i feel that will help in their durability .

I-m so happy with the racket . <p> Bought one 4 months ago , couple of issues , it vibrates when you hit the ball on the sweet spot , which is n't exactly rewarding , but at least I understand why it came with an anti vibration mini ball that comes off all the time but its ok since it makes you look like a gigantic dork when its on . Also the factory string ( Dunlop Silk black for mine ) is quite stiff and could use a bit less tension , I 'm not a fan to say the least , but I guess its a trend now , new players like rackets so stiff it feels like you 're hitting the ball with Moses stone tablets . <p> Despite those 2 flaws the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations were just too much for me , so I bought a set of 305 1,20 hoping it will get better . But as a back up I also bought the carboflex 125S and I think I wo n't bother with the Dunlop when I receive it . <p> I 've recently played with this racquet for a few weeks and I was quite disappointed in its maneuverability and power compared to my head graphene/anion2 racquet . Its supposed to be head light but it feels head heavy after putting the strings on . The frame vibrates uncomfortably with every hit . <p> However , I have n't been able to readjust from playing a tear shaped racquet to the traditional shaped . Both shapes have different sweet spots . I guess that affects my shots . <p> My squash season ends on 4 December , so I 'm gon na try persist and keep going with this racquet and see how I go . Otherwise , I might have to return to my head anion2 ! <p> After playing this racquet for 3 months now , I feel this racquet provides me great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks on the power side but surely with different strings or lower tension it may get there . I bought 2 more for back ups ! <p> My friend used the last 3 models of the elite and he mentioned the weight has damaged the tissue in the muscles in his forearm and he s recently switched to the carboflex 125 which he complements as a much better racquet for power and control <p> I was play with the Head Graphene 135 . Quite a powerful racquet . Unfortunately I had a small crack and it got bigger as I was hitting more power shots . Its quite expensive and I was n't willing to buy another one , hence my search for an economically cheaper but high end model . <p> Thanks for your feedback on the power ! Its a good rating system . I suppose for future models you could implement a review rating system in different categories then have an overall score . 
@@90398290 @5898290/ <p> This is similar in head shape to the Dunlop Force Evolution 120 , which is also new for 2015 and of course is supposed to be 10 grams lighter . I weighed both rackets ( strung ) , and the 130 was only two grams heavier than the 120 , though this is within the normal tolerance of +/- 5 grams . <p> This Force 130 is supposed to be an even balance , and the Force 120 is supposed to be head-light . That matched up with how the rackets felt in my hand . <p> Dunlop is promoting the Force 130 as Alison Waterss racket , and the Force 120 as Nick Matthews . Which is interesting , because last year it was reversed Nick was using the Biomimetic 130 , and Alison was using the Biomimetic 120 .

I first saw these when PDH Sports posted some photos of the Salming Viper range on their Instagram account a while back , and they 're now available for purchase . <p> I 've found these to be amazing shoes after two weeks of play three times a week . Not much to break in-slightly stiff , high comfort level and premium control on court surfaces ( good looking too ) . I do n't  think anyone has mentioned the bonus of the suction-cup action at the rear part of the sole on the court its a unique sensation hopefully with functional benefits . If I were to change anything to the design , it would be to add more padding at the ankle area ( do n't  get me wrong , its better than most ) . Truth be told , I became so accustom to the Prince NFS IIs that I miss it . Regarding the fit , it is true to size if you are using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.5 US / 29.5 cm and they are spot on . All manufactures use their own templates ( or " last " ) to pattern the shoes shape , so its no surprise when it comes to differences between them . Performance and comfort wise , I think you would be hard pressed to find a better shoe . Durability ? I 'll let you know in few months . Brilliant shoe otherwise . <p> I have this shoes for 2 months now . First of all I have to say that they fit bigger than Asics . My previous pair of Asics Domain 2 were a size 12.5 and these Salming are 12s and I probably could wear a pair of 11.5s They as comfortable as the Asics , usually Asics are more comfortable than other brands like Hi Tec but Salming can match up with Asics . About durability , I had some concerns about their durability since I heard some players complaining about this . So far they are holding up . Just a little wear and tear in the insoles and the outer right side its getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glue will fix it . Overall they are great shoes the only CON I can find is their price $190CAD per a pair of shoes seems excessive . If money is not a concern for you then I would recommend these shoes if you are looking for something cheaper go for the Asics Domain 2 ( DO NT BUY THE DOMAIN 3 , THEY ARE TERRIBLE ! ! ! ) . Cheers , <p> Picked a pair of these up as replacements for my asics jel blast 4s . While the shoes perform fantastically they are NOT DURABLE . I drag the upper inner portion of the shoes on deep lunges , and after TWO WEEKS of having these shoes I wore a hole almost completely through the shoe . As a comparison , my pair of jel blast 4s lasted a year and a half . <p> I 've had the vipers since they came out . I was looking for a lightweight shoe so tried these . The fit is really secure with tons of good old fashioned grip . The forefoot does have a minimal padding but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Whilst a few people have voiced concerns about durability mine are lasting extremely well and I play around three times a week so they 've had a decent amount of play and still going strong . The best court shoes Ive tried by far . <p> I bought the Salming Viper now , and i really like how light they are . The mesh also provides good ventilation and keeps your feet cool . But they already show a lot of wear . I don-t think they-ll hold as long as my Hi-Tec shoes did . They are also quite stiff , and give my Achilles tendon some stress I have not experienced from other shoes before . Will get used to hopefully.n++ <p> Thank you : d . Had Mizuno wave stealth IIs before , and while they are really good , it turned out its not for me . They are to " high off " from the ground and I just do n't  find the feeling good for my personal style . What i have found about the Viper that it has no special cushioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just wondered how they feel ( for example is the front cushioning at least on the level of a low level asics shoe like the Rocket 6/7 ? ) Sorry for pestering with questions , but I do n't  want to buy another shoe that will turn out to be not right for me , especially considering the price of the Viper . I 'm looking for a shoe that has good grip , that locks down your foot inside and a low feeling with some cushioning . Up until now i have considered the Asics Gel blade 4 , Nike kobe 9 and this . If anyone has played in one of these please give me some feedback . Would appreciate it . Thanks ! <p> Drop 7mm The heel to toe drop of 7- sets up a natural posture , allowing a correct lean throughout the stride . <p> LMS+ Fast lateral stops expose the foot to the risk to roll over outwards , causing injuries .

Sadly , I bought my size in the new Viper they do run a little large . This may be due to the style/design they used in the forefoot area . IMHO that space is too big , and it does not lock down on your foot with the resulting effect of sliding around a bit in the shoe . Or they just run large . I may have to try a 1/2 size smaller .

Thanks 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I 'm currently using the DNAMX string in the 18 gauge 1.15mm . I previously used the 305 1.20mm , then switched to the 305 1.10mm , and liked the extra feel and cut in the thinner gauge , however had some premature string breakage , likely due to mishits . This happened on 3 string jobs , so I 'm now trying the DNAMX at 1.15mm , which I hope is a good compromise between the 305s 17 and 18 gauges , in terms of durability and feel . The feel is pretty good , and very comparable to the 305 . Power feels a tad more than the 305 . As for durability , its only been a few weeks , but so far so good ! <p> I 've also tried the 305+ , which felt more stiffer than the 305 , and I can say the DNAMX is a different string , closer to the 305 in terms of feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison to the 305+ which i have on my 125s , i really do n't  like the stiff feeling of them , power WAS there but has now faded thinking of cutting them out and replacing them but i do n't  know what with ? <p> but i also like these dnamx the best of all of the tec strings . good control and havent had any issues like breakage as some others on here have mentioned . getting a lot good lob and deep shots on these with better efficiency <p> definitely will buy again and keep on the Eye racket. keeping the ZX on my princes <p> I am surprised there are no reviews yet of this string . Once I learned about this string from the Pro Warrior review made by PDH , I started looking for places to buy one , but there werent any . <p> After a few weeks I found it available on PDH sports and I bought two sets of 1.20mm thickness . <p> I installed one on my ProWarrior 600 racket @ 11.3 kgs tension , and I have another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give more power ) . Playing with both rackets back to back , the DNAMX has way more power , and very good control , at least as good as the 305 green . Its power really shows when returning slow balls , even at the back of the court . A simple wrist flick returns the ball to the front wall with ease . This also makes me return boast shots with confidence . <p> For full power shots , I think I am limited by the racket . I have a 2012 EXO3 Rebel with 305+ strings , and it can produce higher power shots . But its heavy , and I like the ProWarrior more . <p> All in all , this is the best string I have ever used ( compared to 305 and 305+ ) . Once I break the 305 green , I will try the X-one @ 11.3 kgs . I am anxious to compare its power &amp; control to the DNAMX on the same racket . <p> I 've had 2 sets of dnamx snap on me now , within a month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying anymore . Seems its quite weak when the ball is hit hard to the side of the sweet spot . Some red ashaway string I have on another racket ( not sure type ) seems to put up with the same torment so might keep to that . <p> Do you string on an electronic machine ? My best advise ( from experience ) on using PU based string , is to set your machine to lock-out tension , and NOT apply constant tension . <p> If you do not have a pre-stretch function , just up your machine by 1lb , and keep it on lock-out . If you set it to 27 , and lock out , you will not pull out the elasticity of the string and it resist of-centre string breakages a lot more . <p> Correction , now its 3 sets that have snapped within a couple of months , while the ashaway powenick 18 on my carboflex is fine . Def not buying again . Will try the biphase next as the guys at my local club all seem to use it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club I play at started offering the Eye strings like 6 months ago and I have to say I really like them . They give very nice cut on the ball , good power and durability is also good . I tried the 305+ , but they kept breaking near the beam if I miss hit a shot . This has not happened with the Eye string so far . I only break them when they wear out in the middle . I will try their green Eye version as well and see if I can feel any difference . <p> Heard through the grape vine there were a lot of complaints that the 305+ was breaking prematurely so they had to do something . It broke prematurely on me and several players at my club . Heard Dnamx has been used by several of the pros with great success so here it comes . My take on the string , 305+ was touted as 305 with more power with everything you like about 305 and no it never was , it was much harder stiffer and not the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like 305 for rails , control , touch and feel but need just a little more power Dnamx could be your string . If you are using a teardrop headed racquet with 305 but want to go back to a closed throat for its control , feel and touch the Dnamx should allow you the opportunity . If you find that in a closed throat racquet 305 just does n't  allow you to keep your strokes effortless and you have to truly make perfect strong full strokes to get the ball to the back of the court the Dnamx should help . With the Dnamx in teardrops you up the power even more in closed throat in my case it gives the racquet new life and allows you to drive easier to the back of the court . Great touch , great rails with control and feel . If you like 305 you will like Dnamx better . It allows you to be in more control . Enjoy the game ! <p> people skip 305+ and opt for 305 green which has the highest share in strings market followed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flourish 305+ sales they need to give it another name ( few tweaks too ) and associate it with world #1 Mohammed alshorbagy . <p> Just bought some of the new Tecnifibre Dnamx 18g and 17g and strung the 18g up in a Harrow Vibe . Really nice if you like soft strings . The closest to gut yet with better consistency . About to string up an Eye control 120 with it strings nicely also not much coil memory . I have tried a lot of different strings and I seem to always go back to 305 , so far the Dnamx has the nice consistency of the 305 for great rails , softer feel , more power and about the same bite and spin availability . At low tensions , like the 305 it springs back to it 's starting position each time , you can hear the strings moving around when you cut the ball but they spring right back in place . Nice string . Enjoy the game ! <p> I would love to hear what you thought about the Dnamx in the V Lite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 305 18 in my CF125s and V Lite 120 Controls . I am considering adding Ultranick 18 into the mix . Have you hit with the UN18 ? How would that compare to the Dnamx and the 305 ? I have been playing with the 305 18 for quite a while and was surprised how much I liked the Dnamx that came strung in the CF125Surprisingly soft . <p> My AP 125 came with this , and after only a few weeks has snapped unfortunately ( about 9 or so games ) . Seemed to snap in one of the top corners , but not sure if it was a genuine string issue or i clipped the ball wrong on power shot . I 've bought another set of the same as i did like the way the whole racket played . Just hope it is n't a recurring issue .

@@90398299 @5898299/ <h> A Short History of Squash <p> The history of squash is filled with many interesting nuggets of information like that one . Often , and especially in the early days of the game , squash was played in " upper-crust " locations from renowned private schools and colleges to exclusive private mens clubs . So in some ways , its no surprise that the game was played on that world-famous ship . <p> Squash was first played in the 1860s by boys at the Harrow School in England . The boys took a small rubber ball something that we take for granted today but was then only just becoming available and , using racquets , hit the ball off the walls of their school courtyards and alleys . Squash was typically played by underclassmen who did n't  yet have the seniority or skills to play Racquets , the preferred game at the time . <p> Squash spread to the US in 1884 , when St. Pauls , a private boarding school in New Hampshire , built four open-air squash courts . The game also took hold at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it spread to private mens clubs in Boston , Philadelphia and New York . Gradually , the game spread southward and westward in the US , and began to catch on with a wider audience . <p> By the 1950s , squash had spread throughout the world . The most dramatic example of this worldwide growth was the arrival of Hashim Khan on the international squash scene . Born in a small village in Pakistan , Hashim had an informal job as a ballboy at the courts of a local British Officers Club . He honed his game , eventually landing a job as the local squash pro . In 1951 , Pakistan sent Hashim to play in the British Open , the most prestigious tournament in the world at that time . He crushed the competition , winning the tournament with ease . <p> The game has had many twists and turns , not to mention colorful characters , over the years . If you 're interested in reading more about the history of squash , I recommend James Zugs- Squash : A History of the Game ( affiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to extinction a few times before eventually thriving . <p> The book focuses on the early history of the game in England , and then moves onto the development of the game in North America . If you 're looking for more in-depth coverage of squash in other countries , this might not be the best book for you . Of course there 's much discussion of squash players from outside the U.S. , since squash is a global game and many of the great players to play in North America were born overseas . And any squash player will appreciate the stories about the origins of the game .

We named this sportsquash . And its what a lot of us old guys used to play exclusively .

So if its winter and your court token allows you to play for 40 min only in London municipality squash courts for example , then go for dyd Wilson or tecnifibre balls .

So put the ball in hot water or bring a small flask full of hot water and dip the ball in for few seconds . <p> Imo since aproxx. 1-1,5 years the dunlop yellow double does not bounce as they used to do in earlier years . In addition the durability is very poor currently . 2 hours playing hard and the ball is dead . Way better are Prince , Karakal , Oliver and Victor .

So while the Victors are slightly more expensive than the Dunlops I feel they offer a better value in the long run . <p> Totally agree with Jan here .

Its a tough sell , though . <p> I bought three packs of Dunlop double spot and single spot last autumn . Two of the single spots were less bouncy than a double spot normally is so no use at all on cold courts . One of the double spots would n't bounce either .

@@90398314 @5898314/ <h> A Short History of Squash <p> The history of squash is filled with many interesting nuggets of information like that one . Often , and especially in the early days of the game , squash was played in " upper-crust " locations from renowned private schools and colleges to exclusive private mens clubs . So in some ways , its no surprise that the game was played on that world-famous ship . <p> Squash was first played in the 1860s by boys at the Harrow School in England . The boys took a small rubber ball something that we take for granted today but was then only just becoming available and , using racquets , hit the ball off the walls of their school courtyards and alleys . Squash was typically played by underclassmen who did n't  yet have the seniority or skills to play Racquets , the preferred game at the time . <p> Squash spread to the US in 1884 , when St. Pauls , a private boarding school in New Hampshire , built four open-air squash courts . The game also took hold at Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it spread to private mens clubs in Boston , Philadelphia and New York . Gradually , the game spread southward and westward in the US , and began to catch on with a wider audience . <p> By the 1950s , squash had spread throughout the world . The most dramatic example of this worldwide growth was the arrival of Hashim Khan on the international squash scene . Born in a small village in Pakistan , Hashim had an informal job as a ballboy at the courts of a local British Officers Club . He honed his game , eventually landing a job as the local squash pro . In 1951 , Pakistan sent Hashim to play in the British Open , the most prestigious tournament in the world at that time . He crushed the competition , winning the tournament with ease . <p> The game has had many twists and turns , not to mention colorful characters , over the years . If you 're interested in reading more about the history of squash , I recommend James Zugs- Squash : A History of the Game ( affiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to extinction a few times before eventually thriving . <p> The book focuses on the early history of the game in England , and then moves onto the development of the game in North America . If you 're looking for more in-depth coverage of squash in other countries , this might not be the best book for you . Of course there 's much discussion of squash players from outside the U.S. , since squash is a global game and many of the great players to play in North America were born overseas . And any squash player will appreciate the stories about the origins of the game .

OK , so what I generally do is warm up and start playing with the older Dynergy Tour 125 and if I 'm " in the zone " I 'll switch to the Flexarm to wreak maximum havoc on my opponent . The Flexarm really does have amazing power and control but I 've got to be playing really well to tap into it . I therefore suspect the Flexarm would be best left in the hands of high level experts/pros . If I have n't brought my " A game " to court then I 'll just stick with the Dynergy Tour 125 but the Carboflex 125 would also be a really good racket under these conditions . I have n't used the carboflex 125 as much but it is really nice and balanced and I find it definitely does offer excellent control and forgiveness on those " off days " . It just does n't  have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert more effort to get the same level of power . Comparatively the Dynergy generates power with less effort which is probably why I like the racket because I have relatively thin wrists so do not have to exert quite so much effort in driving the ball with explosive power to the back of court . <p> By the way : The Tecnifbre website says that the balance point of the new Flexarm is 350mm but , from memory , I think it is printed with 355mm on my racket . So I suspect the website details are wrong because the Flexarm is slightly ( but noticeably ) more head heavy compared to the older Dynergy Tour 125 . Its perhaps a subtle difference to many but I personally prefer the 350mm balance point ; the racket seems to have better poise in my hand ( but , again , I have quite thin wrists so my arm does n't  seem to tire so quick with the 350mm balance point ) . <p> This is what I am playing with .

@@90398335 @5898335/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> First of all I want to thank you for what you do , I appreciate you take the times to film the videos . I 've watched many of them and they have been a great source of information when I 'm looking to buy new rackets or shoes . I am an advanced squash player but not pro or competition level . I competed in the varsity team for a major university in Canada and still train alongside the current team . This means that I 'm playing 90 " 120 minutes 5 " 6 days a week . I am 190lb and my style is fast and aggressive . I have a strong volley game which relies on quick turns and sprints . That being said , my shoes usually show greater wear than normal . I had always worn Asics and I was really happy with them . Regardless , I decided to try Salming given all hype behind them . I ordered a pair of Adder to give them a try . <p> My first impressions where positive overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't look bad . The fit was good , a bit on the wide side which fits me better . As I took them on court , I realized they are really fast shoes , as advertised . They stayed in place all the time and worked perfectly during training and games . <p> The problems started after the first week of use . Some cosmetic damage appeared on the side and front of the shoe after hard lunges which I did n't mind as long as the shoe performed . Towards the end of the second week , the clear plastic on the side showed cracks and eventually came off in certain parts . As I continued to use it I became worried about the durability of the shoes . At the one month mark the area of the ball of the foot was completely worn off and the midsole started detaching from the rest of the shoe . At nearing the two month mark , holes showed in the side of the left shoe and I could see my socks . Aside from the damage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take my shoe off and readjust between games . Also , the minimal cushioning made my heel hurt badly ( probably my fault for not doing the research ) which I was able to help with better insoles . <p> After this I contacted Salming North America and they told me to return them for a new pair . I have to congratulate Salming on the excellent service . I talked to Jeff from Control the T ( Canada ) who gave me an excellent and personalized treatment throughout this exchange . If someone is looking for shoes in Canada , I highly recommend Control the T. They have good prices , fast shipping , and excellent service if you need to return an item or even recommendations before making a purchase . <p> In conclusion , if you are a heavy and fast player , stay away from the Adder . Get a pair of shoes with more cushioning to take care of your heels and knees . Overall I would n't recommend this shoe to anyone . The durability of the shoe is not worth the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a fellow player experiencing the same problems I have with the Adder , thanks for sharing . Also great to hear Salming NA has been more customer-oriented than Salming Germany . Do you mind sharing which shoe you have found to be more fitting for your feet and style of play ? <p> first of all , thanks a lot for your dedication , your site is a great source of information to me and I appreciate a lot that you spent so much time helping us fellow squash players . <p> Secondly , I have spent a good year of playing squash and badminton in two pairs of Adders and while they have some strengths , I came to the conclusion not to recommend them , or any other products of Salming , to others . <p> I have a small frame and am a player that profits a lot from being very quick on my feet and persistent in not giving up on any ball . Naturally this playstyle of quick acceleration , stops , turns , sliding and occasional even hitting walls is very tough on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damping , I do not experience the same bruises in my soles and in particular heels that I did from stomping my feet into the floor while lunging that I did with other shoes . Also I feel the traction and stability is decent . Two aspects that failed on me on both shoes constructionwise and that are a deal breaker for me are the adhesion of the outsoles and the form stability of the insoles . While I made it 100% certain I wore the correct size by ordering three different sizes to try them on , I still I had to find out that the outsoles split from the mesh at the midfoot area of the shoe only a few hours after I first wore them on court . Additionally in long , sweaty sessions the thin cardboard insoles deform/crumble and ride up the heel , essentially leaving you with a shoe without footbed . Past weekend I played a six match tournament over the course of 8 hours and after a single close set no less than 1/3 to 1/2 of the insole had slid backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lastly , obviously only important to fellow Germans , the German customer service of Salming is very impolite and not accommodating at all . I had both a racket and the two pairs of Adders damaged relatively shortly after purchase and instead of finding an amicable solution they accused me of misuse of their products and picking the wrong size in shoes when the two facilities I play at house first and second national league teams and several highly ranked players told me I am doing totally fine . To me the price-performance ( and service ) ratio of Salming is just not right . <p> Did you experience any similiar problems with the construction of your Salming shoes ? <p> Thanks for the comment , sorry to hear that Jan . I did n't  have those types of problems with either the Race or Kobra . I had some normal wear-and-tear around my left toe where I drag my foot ( shown in this video ) . I had no problems with the insole , though I have been testing a 3rd party insole for much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks old for me so I will have to do a follow-up review after I have used it more . Your comment is good feedback for other players whove got a similar style of movement ( or live in Germany ! ) . <p> They say the Adder is an entry level handball/indoor shoe which offers a very good price-performance ratio and performs very similiar to the Viper 4.0 . Due to the sole being identical/very similiar to the Viper it should offer levels of damping , stability and traction rarely found in the 100 G price range . With the worksmanship being good as well they essentially only criticize the design as being a light version of the Viper . In terms of fit they recommend to go up half a size from your outdoor shoes since the shoe runs small . It is suitable for those who have a wider fore- and midfoot.

( Update : maybe not . See this comment from Topias. ) 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I think Mazen Hesham has been custom painting older Prince rackets for some reason .

Maybe because the previous models clearly had problems with too early breakages . I think Hesham and some other players havent been happy with the heavier feel so they use the older models . I think the Team Black 800 is the most horrible example of this : in reality its almost 10g heavier than the O3 Black and the balance point is even more towards the head so the O3 Black is so much more maneuverable . The SP Black 850 is somewhat better but theyve moved the balance point too much towards the head in my opinion . You do n't  see any pros using these two rackets the Pro Beast 750 and the Team Red 700 are the new good Prince rackets . The Pro Rebel 950 has somewhat the same problem , but if you like a radically head heavy racket , you 'll choose this one .

I 've seen him mainly use sky blue and yellow ones with his airstick ( though sometimes white too ! ) . But now , he s been switching over to black ones , white ones and even a purple one back in 2016 . To me , the holes on the newer grips indicate maybe he s using a Prince grip ? Definitely not a Karakal grip anymore though <p> kindly i have to tell yout that you need to correct this article , because prior to using the prince airstick 130 ramy was using dunlop vision 110 marketed before as dunlop venom 110 which is a raquect that weights 110 grams and that 's why psasquashtv said he was playing with a 110 grams raquet at that time , and prior to using vision raquet he used the black max titanium he never used biomimetic max <p> Hi David thanks ! here 's where I thought I saw Ramy actually using the Biomimetic Max . Its a bit difficult to tell from the picture but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're right , Joey Barrington often mentions the 110 gram weight , so Ramy may have been playing with the Vision / Venom , though I was never able to find a good picture of him doing so . <p> Hello fellow Ramy-racket aficionados , I am a huge Ramy fan and a few months ago I won PSAsquashtvs " Win Ramys Racket " nickname competition . The racket I received was the Biomimetic Max , but it had a slightly customized paint job , which included his initials on the shaft as well as his signature painted onto the side of the frame . Although I ca n't be 100% sure that this is the actual racket he played with at the time , I am pretty certain it is , based on picture comparisons . Another interesting point is that the racket did not have the grooves ( aeroskin technology ) that most Biomimetic Max rackets have . The reason I say most , is because I also use the Biomimetic Max and have come across versions at the store that do n't  have the grooves either . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I weighed the racket , and it weighed about 135 grams , the same weight as the one available in stores . Thus , I have no idea why Joey Barrington at SquashTV keeps insisting that Ramy plays with a 110 gram racket . Even now that Ramy is using the BlackMax Titanium , Joey still says the racket is 110 grams , even though it is listed at 130 grams . By the way , I love SquashTV , and also love Joey Barringtons commentary , but just find it funny that no matter how many times Ramy changes rackets , Joey will always stick to the 110 gram story . Ramy could be playing with a baseball bat , and Joey would still say its 110 grams . Finally , here is an amusing description of the BlackMax I found at an online retailer : " Dunlop Black Max Titanium Squash Racket : A great super head light racquet for those beginners looking to improve their game.WEIGHT : 130 grams ( Unstrung ) HEADSIZE : 500 sq.cm .

Its similar to the GTS 130 but a little head heavier , which should encourage you to set up earlier and take a full swing through the shot , and get more power in the process . At the expense , maybe , of some ability to hit quick wristy shots . <p> Another one you might want to try out is the Dunlop Elite GTS . I just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro GTS but I felt the Elite has a bit more power . <p> Henry try the new Tecnifibre Dnamx and try dropping it down to 20 or like Gautier 16 . I Have gone from racquet to racquet trying to find the right balance between power and control . Prince , Harrow , Head , Dunlopeven tried a bunch of different strings .

The factory string is decent enough , but I will no doubt thread in either Ashaway Ultranick 18 ( Blue ) or Tecnifibre 305 17 when its done its dash . All in all this is a great racket which offers all the power and control my old Xenon 135s , but with significantly more maneuverability and is much kinder on the wrist , especially when flicking out backhand shots from the back corner .

Definitely worth a try ! <p> Completely agree with Saurabh . I changed from this model for the same reason . I felt I really had to hit the volleys rather than place them with soft touch . But I have now gone back to it as I still love the ultimate series . <p> I had the Prince sovereign TT before this .

@@90398381 @5898381/ 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> @Pierre , any idea what grip Ramy is sporting ? I 've seen him mainly use sky blue and yellow ones with his airstick ( though sometimes white too ! ) . But now , he s been switching over to black ones , white ones and even a purple one back in 2016 . To me , the holes on the newer grips indicate maybe he s using a Prince grip ? Definitely not a Karakal grip anymore though <p> kindly i have to tell yout that you need to correct this article , because prior to using the prince airstick 130 ramy was using dunlop vision 110 marketed before as dunlop venom 110 which is a raquect that weights 110 grams and that 's why psasquashtv said he was playing with a 110 grams raquet at that time , and prior to using vision raquet he used the black max titanium he never used biomimetic max <p> Hi David thanks ! here 's where I thought I saw Ramy actually using the Biomimetic Max . Its a bit difficult to tell from the picture but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're right , Joey Barrington often mentions the 110 gram weight , so Ramy may have been playing with the Vision / Venom , though I was never able to find a good picture of him doing so . <p> Hello fellow Ramy-racket aficionados , I am a huge Ramy fan and a few months ago I won PSAsquashtvs " Win Ramys Racket " nickname competition . The racket I received was the Biomimetic Max , but it had a slightly customized paint job , which included his initials on the shaft as well as his signature painted onto the side of the frame . Although I ca n't be 100% sure that this is the actual racket he played with at the time , I am pretty certain it is , based on picture comparisons . Another interesting point is that the racket did not have the grooves ( aeroskin technology ) that most Biomimetic Max rackets have . The reason I say most , is because I also use the Biomimetic Max and have come across versions at the store that do n't  have the grooves either . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I weighed the racket , and it weighed about 135 grams , the same weight as the one available in stores . Thus , I have no idea why Joey Barrington at SquashTV keeps insisting that Ramy plays with a 110 gram racket . Even now that Ramy is using the BlackMax Titanium , Joey still says the racket is 110 grams , even though it is listed at 130 grams . By the way , I love SquashTV , and also love Joey Barringtons commentary , but just find it funny that no matter how many times Ramy changes rackets , Joey will always stick to the 110 gram story . Ramy could be playing with a baseball bat , and Joey would still say its 110 grams . Finally , here is an amusing description of the BlackMax I found at an online retailer : " Dunlop Black Max Titanium Squash Racket : A great super head light racquet for those beginners looking to improve their game.WEIGHT : 130 grams ( Unstrung ) HEADSIZE : 500 sq.cm . " Watch out everyone , Ramy is a beginner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have to tell you that you need to correct this article , because prior to using the prince airstick 130 ramy was using dunlop vision 110 marketed before as dunlop venom 110 which is a raquect that weights 110 grams and that 's why psasquashtv said he was playing with a 110 grams raquet at that time , and prior to using vision raquet he used the black max titanium he never used biomimetic max

Its light ( 130 grams ) and , according to the specs , just a teeeeeeensy bit head light ( 34.5 cm ) , but it felt like an even balance . <p> I got a very nice feel on the ball with this racket . It felt very solid and stable , without being heavy . <p> I compared it to my Dunlop Pro GTS , which has a similar head shape and weight . The Tecnifibre was a touch heavier in the head , and just felt more " dense " . In other words the Dunlop felt like it had more flexibility in the shaft and was maybe more appropriate for quick , wristy shots , while the Tecnifibre Suprem 130 encouraged a smooth swing with solid contact . <p> All things considered I really like this racket . <p> Image via tecnifibre.com <p> Heres what Paul " Suprem " Hargrave had to say about this racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rackets ) .

I went to demo the Tecnifibre Suprem 130 hoping I would get the same experience , but was disappointed . I just felt the feel and power was n't the same . Anyone else experience this ? <p> Agree with you on this . After having gone through so many NG130s I thought I 'd try the suprem 130 and was quite disappointed . The power was lacking and the feel just seemed to spongy , only real way I can describe it ! The racket too did n't  feel anywhere near as stiff as the old NG130 which is something I really like . If you are looking for something as a replacement , I changed to the Eye X Lite Pro 110 Control , and havent looked back ! <p> Hey Pierre , I note from your previous posts that you use the Dunlop Pro GTS " I do as well . <p> I really like the racket . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more power on the ball " I 'm already running quite a low tension : 25lbs on the GTS but would n't mind putting in maybe a little less effort , its marginal but something I 'm considering . <p> ( Since I 'm not set on strings or tension just yet Imc considering dropping tension further by a few lbs ) . <p> I like the more classic shape of the GTS and the Suprems and the feel that shape gives , my question is : <p> Do you feel any of the Technifibre Suprem range might tick the power box for me ? <p> Hi Henry , I do think the Suprem 125 would be interesting for you to try . Its similar to the GTS 130 but a little head heavier , which should encourage you to set up earlier and take a full swing through the shot , and get more power in the process . At the expense , maybe , of some ability to hit quick wristy shots . <p> Another one you might want to try out is the Dunlop Elite GTS . I just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro GTS but I felt the Elite has a bit more power . <p> Henry try the new Tecnifibre Dnamx and try dropping it down to 20 or like Gautier 16 . I Have gone from racquet to racquet trying to find the right balance between power and control . Prince , Harrow , Head , Dunlopeven tried a bunch of different strings . Then started playing around with tensions and an old favorite Tecnifibre NG130 strung with Dnamx at 16 and well seems to be a great combination breathing new life in an old favorite .

I 've had both from the 2014 series . I would say Airstick is the better and more complete racket out of these . Its lighter and not as head heavy so its got better control and its more maneuvrable . The Sovereign is surprisingly heavy , rather 140g and more head-heavy than it says in the specs . This makes it a bit clumsy . It does generate power easier than the Airstick . Lack of power is a minus for Airstick . But if you want a power racket , I would n't choose the Sovereign 650 , its simply not the best product Prince have to offer . <p> Hi all , I have been using prince racquets for 4 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air stick lite 550 . I find the durability better as compared to the old rebels . Green , yellow and black and the yellow one . I tried the new neon one as well but I think its too stiff .

Highly recommend for wristy players . <p> Hi everyone , I have just come accross a very similar ( seems identical ) racket named : Prince Pro Airstick 550 Team Can anybody tell me if its the same racket ( maybe named differently in different countries ) or a completely different one that happens to share the exact same colouring scheme ? <p> Hi Pierre , I have actually seen this racket with my own eyes in a shop earlier this week . The racket does exist online tough it is rather hard to find . The only place I did find it in is this polish website where you can see some photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm on my third racquet and found that the slightest touch on a wall breaks at about the 13:30 mark on the clock . Not happy at all . Great feel , durability is crap and that 's with head tape .. Why Prince , why ? <p> If u want raw power and durability go for 125 , that 's what technifibre are famous for . But its heavy so its hard on your wrist . Prince , on the other hand , its so fun to play with , its light , hit the ball glued to the wall , cut the ball in short easily , do all deceptions with your wrist . However one big problem is that the frame might break before factory string break . I have broke 2 myself , i 'm not a wall hitter . That 's when i switched to 125s because no money . If u have your trust fund go for prince . If not technifibre last forever . <p> I have changed to this racket recently , having changed from the Head Xenon 135 which I started to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviness . I have found that the Prince Pro Airstick Lite has a very light pick up weight , with a hint of weight balanced towards the head . While the racket is great for drives and offers excellent power and control , it is also light and maneuverable enough for deceptive front court play and accurate drop shots . The factory string is decent enough , but I will no doubt thread in either Ashaway Ultranick 18 ( Blue ) or Tecnifibre 305 17 when its done its dash . All in all this is a great racket which offers all the power and control my old Xenon 135s , but with significantly more maneuverability and is much kinder on the wrist , especially when flicking out backhand shots from the back corner . Highly recommended ! !

I 've used several other ASICS models with lesser features and lighter in weight , but they do not compare to the Sensei shoe . In my experience , the stability and cushioning of this shoe contributes much more positively to on-court agility when compared to a less supportive and potentially lighter weight version . <p> Once you get the break-in period over ( approximately four good matches ) these shoes really grip the floor while providing superior cushioning and ankle support . <p> Hi I have these shoes and I would recommend them to players with specific need for protection . The balance between weight and dampening in good shoes , equals relation racket power vs control .

Apparently this racket was originally produced as a lighter version of the Harrow Mojo , which I 've never posted . Anyway Jonathan Power ended up making a custom signature version of this racket , and they have continued it with new versions over the years . <p> I think its probably because the version he uses does n't  have his name on it .

I guess its down to preference- tbh if I had n't  been given the orange one for free I would have picked the black one . <p> actually Karim is still using a dark navy harrow vibe .. you can pause this video LONG ... at 0:36/10.39 .. you will see : USED IN TOURNAMENT PLAY BY KARIM ABDEL GAWAD probably a very specific custom racket for Karim .. maybe only 2 rackets world wide .. both with Karim = <p> i contacted harrow team and i received confirmation from John Burke and Kelly Williams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also new one came in black color , seems for marketing reasons ( probably Harrow ca n't re-publish old vibe with same color ) so they made a new color ( same weight same balance like old one ) and seems that new one has only 2 letters KG ( not handwritten signature ) <p> I believe they are identical , just different color schemes . Actually I 'm told that different paint colors have different weights , so this could have a slight impact on the balance but safe to say I probably could n't detect a difference = <p> Gawad has got his own custom design now as well only know because the awesome people at Harrow ran a competition and I won one . Ill post how I get on with it , usually play with a different balance but fully agree with the comments about Karims style ! <p> I have to agree with the above comments about the durability of Harrow rackets . I have personally played with many of them before and I absolutely love the playability of Harrow rackets , especially the Fury . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a junior who managed to break 2 Jewels in around three months and she 's far from what youd classify as an aggressive player or a hard hitter who smashes the back corners . <p> I got my hands on a demo , because I wanted to give it a try .

While it seems like the rackets have not changed much over the years aside from a new paintjob , they play very nicely , and I can understand their popularity .

The other brands offer them at a bit less , $150-$160 . <p> While the the Harrows are great rackets and are gaining in popularity , I have experienced myself , heard from others , and read on the internet comments about their durability .

@@90398406 @5898406/ <h> Racket Info <p> The Carboflex 130 is made of Graphite ( boring ) and BasaltexG ( exciting ) - technology . What 's BasaltexG , you ask ? Well , according to the Basaltex website , this seems to mean products made of basalt. - In case you did n't  know , that 's cooled-off lava . <p> That 's right : if you play with this racket , you can say your racket is made from lava . Why is that good ? Well for starters , you can say your racket is made from lava . But in addition , if you are ever playing squash and the court becomes covered with red-hot molten lava , your racket will be more likely to survive than your opponents racket . <p> If you are really keen on lava-based rackets , you may also want to check out- the- Wilson Tour BLX . <p> Here is Mohamed El Shorbagy using his Carboflex 130 in an insanely long rally against Peter Barker , who happens to use the Wilson Tour BLX . In case you are n't  paying attention , this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court did not flood with lava during this point , so we are not able to witness the high melting point of these rackets , but we are nevertheless treated to an exceptional squash point : <h> Racket specs <h> Tecnifibre Carboflex 130 Blue / White <p> Just spotted this white and blue model at Squash Gear in April 2017 . They may have had these custom made for their shop , because I have n't seen then anywhere else . According to the product description they are strung with Tecnifibre SynGut ( so , not one of the " premium " Tecnifibre squash strings ) . All in all you get a classic racket , plus decent strings , for $108 . Not too shabby . <p> Hi I have been using the Technifibre Carboflex140 for the last 3 years . My wife just bought me the new 130S . The head feels too heavy now for me . Will I adapt or is there a benefit to this ? When I compared the 130S to the 130 it also felt very head heavier . Will it maybe neutralise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I just try and persevere ? Thanking you in advance Alfred <p> I had commented on this racket three months ago when it was when i first bought it . I am currently experimenting with the sting tension for the 305+ started at 22 lbs but no feeling to it and did not generate that huge difference in power to make it worthwhile . Now was 24,5 lbs but for some reason the sting broke after playing three time . At this tension the racket felt much better but now since it broke restringing at 26 lbs . <p> As for the racket , i cant say i am 100% there yet . It feels a bit difficult to maneuver . You have to follow the whole swing and be prepared . I realized i tend to hold the grip higher to make the racket more quick . I do n't  know whether what i am writing does make sense but it feels that the racket is heavier than what it actually is . So I guess next one will either be the 125 Carbonflex or the the 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dunergy 117 as i play hard thus I do n't  need a racket that primarily generates power . <p> How about you Pierre any second thoughts after playing this long with the technifibre . Have you changed yet . How about stings ? still using the 305+ <p> I have been using the 130 for a few weeks now . Before I was using the suplex 140 grams a bit head heavy powerful but not good in control . The Carbonflex 130 has an excellent control and if you get the right swing the power is unbelievable but after playing half an hour or so , it feels that i have to concentrate a lot in order to hold the racket properly and not to wobble . As for the string 305 + i think its wonderful but you need to be a good player . My previous racket was strung with the 305 green which felt sweeter . Let 's not forget I am a novice player with a total playing experience of 1 year . I might try different tensions when i restring with the 305+ to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour game and them i might try the Green 305 although I am not certain whether this is the right move , since this racket was recommended and strung with the 305+ . All in all I do like the racket a lot but I think it needs for my experience a bit more time to get used to this racket . <p> Probably a bit late but still , I would recommend the tecnifibre carboflex 130 if you have a budget of -90 or $150 , because it comes with some of my favorite strings ( 305+ ) and provides power , control and maneuverability , as a good junior player , this world be good because it is a high to mid price racket but is good value for money as no need for string upgrade also this is a very durable racket so i would only buy one because they last years also you can get the 2011 version for a really good price , meaning it is even better value for money but it would need a string upgrade . Despite the fact it comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the strings making the useless . Also the Prince Rebel one of my favorite rackets is a better choice if you want a more developed racket/higher tec . This also provides better control but not as great power , I believe this is because of the strings , as the 305+ is a power string , and the most developed string in the world ; also it has a larger sweet spot due to the EXO3 technology , plus the bonus of more racket head speed . However the Prince Rebel is not as durable , also it is more expensive but in my opinion it is a better overall racket . To conclude they are both pretty similar however the prince is more expensive than the tecnifibre , so it depends what your budget is . Ben

Founded by two squash players based in Canada , their their stated aims are to offer advanced products at intermediate prices , and to support grassroots squash movements . <p> The rackets are currently for sale in the US and Canada for $100 . They plan to offer their rackets around the world eventually . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> Just got the PXT-110 . It really surprised me with the combination of power and very " maneuverable " head . I actually had to adjust my swing throughout the session because I was getting it around that much faster than with the CNT-135 . I still do n't  like the factory grips at all , but I 'm trying out the new Xamsa replacement grip , and so far it stands up to the Karakal grips . <p> Hey Ted I just got them with the factory strings . I find the Xamsa black to be pretty decent , but they feel tighter than 30 lbs . I will get the string upgraded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25-28 lbs . <p> The racquet balance and weight plays way lighter than the racquet stated weight and I find the handle far more comfortable to hold then my Harrow VIBE-JP edition racquet . <p> Value for cost , this receives a 10 out of 10 in my books . What I would ( will ) change through is the strings , I just got the factory strings , but I think I will eventually change them to the same strings as on my Harrow Vibe . I did feel I lacked a bit of power with the PXT-110 vs the Vibe , but felt the touch was good overall and service swing power felt the same . The sweet spot of the PXT-110 felt nicer than the Vibe . <p> Overall though , I am very impressed with the XAMSA products .

I highly recommend considering this racket if you are looking for a closed throat racket . Some people Ive talked to about these rackets think that because they 're inexpensive that they 're not good but that is simply not true . <p> Ive been using the VBO for about 2 seasons now . I have yet to break a frame . It has a lot of power , and I 'm very satisfied with the control I 've developed with it .

I cant tell what she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a technifibre that she 's using ? ( It certainly is n't the pro beast anymore ) <p> I have used this ( the Textreme version ) , technifibre 125S and the dunlop biomimetic ultimate GTS . The technifibre is amazingly easy to pick up with lots of power and is a very consistent racket . The dunlop is a special one ; it seemed slightly head heavy at first compared to the other two and lacks a bit of power but the control is superb after getting used to the racket . <p> The pro beast , on the other hand , generates a lot of slice and " cut " which is how ive always liked to play . It generates more power than the other 2 mentioned above , and feels extremely light . One problem , however , is how brittle the string is . Due to the 15+14 string pattern the string breaks almost too easily , especially if you love to cut the ball like i do . There was once it broke after less than 4hours of play ( technifibre 305 1.2mm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this problem . <p> good review .. can you tell me how the new string is working is it perfect or same issue is coming again as i am fed up changing the string after every 2-3 days . which string you are playing with now and its details thankyou . <p> Hi Zari i 'm currently using ashaway supernick XL 1.25mm at 27lbs . Have only used them a couple of times so i cant really tell the durability . The strings are slightly heavier than the technifibre so flicks and short swings are not that easy now though it should get better if you get used it them . I do feel that the technifibre 305 is more " crisp " and have a better feel about it though . <p> I have in fact started using the Dunlop Biomimetic Ultimate GTS now as my main racket as the control it gives me is quite a lot better than the pro beast . The pro beast sure is nice when you do cuts , drops or deception but the accuracy and tightness of my drives are compromised . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My racket has broke ( refer to post below ) but i managed to get a couple of good weeks out of the racket and new string and I must say the string felt really good with the racket . There is more power than the technifibre though i felt the slicing is not as smooth as before ( it also feels a lot more durable ) . I highly recommend it ! <p> Unfortunately my pro beast 750 textreme has broke after just 6 months of play ( i did n't  hit the wall ) . Prince racquets seem a little more fragile and they cost quite a lot from where i come from , so i guess ill be sticking to my dunlop for now : / <p> I just saw James Willstrop practicing for the Netsuite Open in San Francisco looks like he s back to an older Prince model it may have even been the Speedport Black ( strung with green strings , so assuming the 305 , as he s used in the past ) . <p> I bought this racket and have played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific racket . Easy to get used to and move anywhere . I do not feel it head heavy at all , but I did use some lead tape to give stability to the racket head , makes it steady and give a more controlled plough through when you hit the ball at any speed or from any distance . <p> has anybody used power bite 750 , air stick 550 and technifiber carboflex 125 ? . i m confused between these 3 rackets , which 1 to buy ? which racket offers the most power , durability and cutting the ball short ? ? <p> I have tried all three .. although I did not try the air stick 550 for long as it belongs to my friend who no longer plays at my area . <p> I think the factory strings of both air stick 550 and power bite 750 are great . I feel a bit more control with the air stick but a more natural feel with the power bite ( easy to do cuts with power bite too ) .. they are both awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel as solid like the technifibre carbolex 125 <p> however , i still prefer carboflex 125 over those two as it just " feels rights " . Carboflex 125 really feels like an extension of my hand cant wait for the new carbolex 125 S. <p> my few cents some people may have different preferences and opinions = but i do feel that the shape of prince rackets are about the same .. and if you like the feel that comes with that shape .. prince might be a better option for you <p> There is a bit of vibration in the 750 , but to be honest , its not really bothersome to me . I used a Black Knight ION ( red ) the other day and was shocked at the solid feel , and by that I mean the sweep through a backhand , connecting with the ball , and follow through all felt like one powerful and cohesive action . This is probably in part due to the style of racquet as compared to the beast , and the heavy weight , also maybe the 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little head heavy , I have to agree , but not in a bad way . As Pierre pointed out , it let 's one mark the position of the racquet in space , and I have found it exceptionally at quick volleys to return hyper-powered cross courts by my opponent . <p> I have used the 750 and the 125 . The 125 has more power , the 750 better cut and spin . The 750 is great for rails the 125 is a blast to play with . Both held up great . I still use the 750I need more control then I do power.a plus for the 125 is it comes with great string in it.if it is the correct tension .. both great racquets the 125 makes it easy to get carried away with a power game the 750 a more all around game because it does n't  have one thing that stands out above the others if that makes sense . If you need more power in your game the 125 if you need to balance your game because you have enough power then the 750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul at PDH Sports notes the 750 does n't  have a lot of control . I wonder if he refers to the need for more accuracy or a higher caliber of player given the small head size ? IIRC he noted he could cut the ball nicely etc . There are times I am fatigued or generally playing out of focus where I hit the rim of this racquet and it could be due to the light balance of this racquet that results in it not balancing itself . Hard to explain unless you have used the 750 , its so evenly balanced and light you might not know its orientation in space . <p> I hv played squash for 27years . Yes , prince rackets are indeed brittle . I played with the extender sc , extender , the extender cts followed by ctsII. all were simply wonderful rackets but every piece was so fragile . I recall a friend breaking five extender comp in a month . I subsequently switched allegiance to dunlop but recently went back to prince air stick 130 which I personally think is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it generates really serious power owing to the enlarged string bed .

The study looked at each sports impact on your endurance , strength and flexibility .

This means you can get a great workout in a short period of time . <h> Easy to Organize <p> To play squash , you only need two players and a few pieces of equipment . This makes it easy to organize a game , especially compared with team sports that require a large number of players or tons of equipment . And when its easier to organize a game , its easier to stay in shape . <p> A typical squash match lasts around 45 minutes .

There are a few different camera angles , so you can see the play in a variety of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hear noises from the court , like sneakers squeaking and the ball smashing into the wall . You can also pick up ambient noises , such as the crowd reactions . <p> I really enjoy the match commentary . For each of the mens matches they have two commentators in the booth calling the action . The banter in the commentary booth is great . The guys covering the PSA are quite funny and all-around entertaining . Their insights into the match and player tactics are quite interesting and help me become a better squash player . <p> They also cover womens matches . For some events , such as the US Open starting in 2013 , there are female commentators and full coverage like the men . For other tournaments , there are no commentators , and only one camera angle . It seems like Squash TV does its best to broadcast some of the womens matches for major events that have both mens and womens draws , but this is not their main focus . Even with no commentary , I often watch many of the womens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womens matches than I can watching the men . <p> While the live tournament coverage is a big part of the Squash TV service , it is n't the only thing . They also have an archive of matches , including recent tournaments of course , but also classic matches going back as far as 1997 . And they are continuously adding new matches to the archives . There 's a wealth of amazing squash play available to you on demand as soon as you sign up . <p> The service is n't perfect . A couple times , the service has been interrupted due to an Internet outage at the venue . In one case , service was out for 2 hours . This was annoying , especially since I was hooked on watching the matches ! In the end they got things back up and running relatively soon . Still , its a reminder that this is n't like watching the World Cup problems can still crop up . <p> Another problem with the coverage is that its bad for my productivity at work ! I 'm based in the US , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I often leave the coverage open in my browser and check it once in a while . OK , maybe I 'm glued to it . Oh well . <p> I encourage you to check out Squash TV . Even if you do n't  subscribe , they have some good highlight videos that are free to view . Might as well check it out and see some great squash ! <p> I definitely recommend Squash TV for all squash enthusiasts . I like it so much that I signed up for their affiliate program , which means if you sign up for the service- through any of the links on this page , I 'll get a small commission , which I 'll put towards the upkeep of this site .

Most people spend tons of time thinking about which squash racket they like , forgetting that its the squash strings that actually make contact with the ball . And I must admit , I 've been that guy on occasion . <p> While some squash rackets come pre-strung with a premium squash string for example , Black Knight squash rackets are pre-strung with Ashaway , and of course Tecnifibre squash rackets are pre-strung with Tecnifibre most squash racket manufacturers string their rackets with an in-house brand of string . <p> Personally , I have a slight preference for the premium brands , but I find the factory strings to be acceptable . <p> So what 's the best string for you ? There 's no simple answer . The best thing to do is try out different strings at different tensions and see what works best for you . <h> About Squash Strings <p> Here are some basics about strings . <h> Tension <p> To get more power , string at a lower tension . A string under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launching off your strings . Conversely , higher tension gives you a more controlled hit . <p> The reason is , well , think about it like a trampoline if it bends easily , it will launch you higher ( more power ) , but the bounce will be more difficult for you to control . Conversely , a stiff trampoline wont bounce you as high , but itll be easier to control your bounces . <p> I would say a high squash racket string tension ( more control ) is 29 pounds , average is 27 pounds , and low tension ( more power ) is 25 pounds . <h> Thickness <p> Thinner string bends more easily , and that gives you a bit of a power boost . In addition , the thinner the string , the more it will- " bite " into the ball on contact , allowing you to put more spin on your shots . So if thinner strings provide more power and better spin- control , why not always use the thinnest string available ? The reason is that thinner strings are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace . <p> For squash strings , 1.1mm is thin ( more bite / less durability ) , 1.2mm is medium , and 1.3mm is thick ( less bite / more durability ) . Thickness can also be measured in " gauge " , except with gauge , higher numbers indicate thinner- string so 18 gauge is thin , 17 gauge is medium , and 16 gauge is thick . <h> Comments <p> I 'm moving to Colorado this summer and wondered if anybody out there had any advice for how you adjust your string tension for playing at altitude with the altitude ball . Currently I string my rackets at 26lbs with the Ashaway Ultranick 18s . <p> Has anyone else noticed that straight after restringing , the ball seems to get coated with some kind of silicon material causing the ball to skid off the floor at a low angle . <p> Strings : Tecnifibre 305 / DNAMX / X-One BiPhase 1.18 . <p> I 'm new to restringing and wondering if the strings are supplied with this silicon-like coating to aid stringing but then require a thorough clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the stenciling but very much doubt paint will stick onto a silicon coated string ! <p> I tried the ashaway zx and for me it was horrible . I strung it at 28lbs but there was no ping , and just a complete dull feel when I hit the ball . I found that it did n't  even give me any extra control . The restringer has recommend I try prokennex iq core 1.15m . I 've had it put in the racket but was wondering if anyone had tried it and what there thoughts were on it ? <p> I am using the Ashaway ZX supernick 1.25 mm string , one of the best strings i ever tried , its been a month am using it and am really satisfiedMaximum power &amp; control , impressive spin potential and precision . <p> Nylon strings ( eg. Tecnifibre 305 ) will produce a different tone compared by Zyex strings ( eg. Ashaway PN ) with the same diameter when pulled at equal tensions . Things become even more complex , because most strings are made from a variety of materials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be matched when comparing string tensions by acoustics . = <p> My Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 Basaltex Squash Racket ( 2014/5 lime green ) comes with a great string tension when new but having difficulty getting a restringer to replicate the ex-factory tension . <p> The tension range states 20-30 lbs and to start with my stringer strung a Tecnifibre X-One ( red string ) at 26lbs which clearly made a much higher tone than my spare ( brand new ) . When string broke , we went for 23lbs which surprised us both as it is still 2 tones higher than ex-factory . <p> You might all be saying just play with it at 23 then and get on with your life ! But the ex-factory strings seem to have more power , a bigger sweet spot while somehow maintaining touch seems impossible but that 's why I love them . <p> Personally I wish they put the factory tension on them , so we have a guideline . I know people will say they have lost some of their tension while sitting in the factory/shop but I think Tecnifibre have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on this racket . <p> Couple of questions : 1 . Has anyone else out there embarked on the same quest ( matching ex-factory string tension particularly for my racket ) ? 2 . I notice that people lower the cross string tension by a coupe of lbs . Do you think that would be done to an ex-factory racket , or this just a personal thing ? <p> I 'm a musician and engineer ( ! ) and I note that pinging an ex-factory string is a A and my stringer produced a 23lb C. I wonder if there is a rough guide that could estimate x semi-tones = y lbs.now I 'm sure someone will tell me to get a life ! <p> I was hoping someone might just know what it was . I can tell you its lower than 23lbs which was a surprise to me . I 'm stringing at 21 next time ( see Tjeerds answer ) . I 'm also pinging an email off to technifibre to see what they say . <p> Just forget the tensions printed on the frame : they are mainly there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of factory string jobs is usually not very well . Time is money and it is not uncommon that during factory stringing , strings are double or even tripple pulled ( 2 or 3 strings are pulled at once ) . In my experience , factory string jobs are far from consistant and that they indeed vary between the ranges printed on the frame . = <p> You may want to try the " RacquetTune " app ( available for Andriod and IPhone ) : this app uses sound to " guess " the string tension , depending on some more variables like string type ( ! ! ) and gauge . <p> But what you are actually are looking for , is a way to meassure the stringbed stiffness . There are special devices for this on the market ( Stringlab ) . You could use such a device to meassure the stringbed that you like , and work your way towards this stringbed stiffness when you have to restring your racket . <p> Concrete answers to your questions : <p> 1 ) Yes , I have ; see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of reasons . The main reason is that the cross strings are shorter than the main strings , but you want to give the cross strings about the same amount of " flexibility " as the main strings . In other words : to let a short string produce the same tone as a long string , you have to give the shorter string less tension . ( or vice-versa ) <p> Do n't  be affraid to lower the tensions even further to get the stringbed stiffness you like the most . Bear in mind that stringtype and gauge are essential variables for this , and that a fresh stringjob will have to settle and will loosen up after it is used a few times . ( or example : depending on the racket , for cross-strings I will go as low as 9.5 kg ( +/- 21 lbs ) with multifilament strings en even drop to 9 kg ( +/- 20 lbs ) when using polys ) <p> This is a comprehensive and valuable reply . I 'm very keen to get the tension right and your explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23lbs but when I swap to an ex-factory strung tension and it is just that bit more powerful with less vibration my length shots get more reliable and punches to the back of the court benefit from a slightly bigger sweet spot so it means a lot to me to get it right . <p> The answer is 25 lbs with a lockout machine . I 've recently bought a machine , calibrated it and it fires the brake at 25lbs so I guess you want to subtract 2-3 lbs for constant tension machine . I 'm doing the crosses 2lbs down too and it plays identically to an ex-factory racquet . Got there in the end . <p> Scrap the above comment wrong again ! Tension was lost as it settled in . I 'm now pre-tensioning the string and doing it at 26lbs lockout which seems to hit the spot for me . After a week playing , it now has exactly the same tone as the ex-factory . Here ends the quest for me . <p> Dnamx it is better then the + and does n't  break as often.great string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in my emailanyway tried the 17 for a bit good but something was missing so I bumped one racquet back up to 27 and left the other at 17 and well after a bit gravitated back to the 27 just better touch feel and control for me in the SB 125 xenonEnjoy the Game ! <p> Hi all ! i have a question regarding the new string to buy i am using prince pro beast 750(2014) and recently my company fitted string broke i changed that to technifiber 305+ guage 17/1.20mm ( black ) but it lasted only a single day however i really loved that.I have heard that wide pattern in this model causes easy string brake is that correct ? I prefer power alot with above average control so kindly suggest me best durable string that have best power rating and good life . Thankyou <p> Lawrence went through a few more racquets really intrigued with the new thin body racquets so tried a few Eye racquets found their weights were just all over the place for the same racquet one of the 115 was 142 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reference each weighs in at 154 . So to answer your question on tension I am still trying to figure that out . One is factory strung just received , the new adaptive string option one , figured I would try it or have the option to try it when I need to restring it and the other is the green one strung at 17 . I checked the tension bed of the factory one and the string bed tension is , mains 27 crosses 25 . The other racquet I strung at 17 string bed tension is mains 24 crosses 21 . The factory one has more control then the 17 lb one which has more power . The factory one a little more consistency , repeatability . So which one won more games.with players I can over power the 17 lb strung one worked well good enough for touch and plenty of power to keep the pace high to keep them off their game but playing the top club player I found the higher tension racquet gave me just better control to place the ball more accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance and win more rallies . So as I said earlier still trying to figure it out . I am going to step the green up from 17 to 20 and see if it gives me the control AND power for both or might just up it to the factory numbers and play there . Any suggestion or thoughts are welcome . Enjoy the game ! <p> Thanks for the update JB ! Hope the 17 to 20 works out , let us know ! Ive been experimenting with the Dnamx 1.15 and TF 305 1.1 , and I find that the Dnamx have more power , yet have a lot of control too . <p> Do you have the same experience ? And how do you think the new Ashaway ZX would compare to the Dnamx ? I put the ZX on my Ramy Pro Warrior and found that the strings were lively and have the pop , yet strangely felt it was dull/soft . I always thought Ashaway strings have the crispy feel whilst TF strings have the soft feel . Or is the other way around ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am on a never ending quest to find the perfect set-up , and for the perfect racket ! <p> Lawrence I found the same for ZX very soft and powerful not the control I was looking for and at that time I was dropping tensions from 25 lbs down and the string strung at 25 or less never settled in always out of line especially after you put spin on the ball . Some say just leave it it does n't  mater I look at it if it is n't straight then the tension is higher then what it started . How can it be consistent , though the ball temp chances also so probably the same thingprobably just a in the head thing ? I would straighten them after a rally and it just took me out of the zone to much . It just does n't  snap back in place . The 305 , 305+ and Dnamx all the way down to 16 snaps back in place ready for the next hit . So I went back up to 27 and well with Dnamx plenty of power and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do the second or first racquet at 25 to compare them . Kind of starting the process over again . Or should I try 29. whichever way the Dnamx really is nice . Enjoy the game . <p> As i was in a rush to have my rackets restring i choose to use the string they have available at the squash club i was playing during vacationsSo i had the Tecnifibre 305 ( green ) at 9.5 Kg / 10,5 Kg . So pretty low tension and i found it very good but took me time to adjust until the string " break in " and quite easy on my shoulder . About the type of the machine , pretty sure it was not an electronic one . <p> Dear friends of Squash Source , I need some advices about what kind of strings I could put in my Eye X.Lite 120 Control . The original strings are so good when you hit the ball with power to the back of the court , but a think that the feeling when I try to make control shots could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eye 1.20 ( I don-t know if it-s the strings which Eye uses to prestrung their rackets ) , the Ashaway SuperNick 1.25 or the Tecnifibre 305 1.20 . I don-t want to loose this power , but a little bit of more control could be awesome . Thank you all ! ! <p> Hi , I am a squash racket re-stringer who within my team does about 50 rackets per week . <p> Seriously , do not take any manufacturers or one lone players opinion on control . Control is a very subjective issue and what deems to be the qualities of control for one player is completely contradicted by another , because of what it feels like for THEM . <p> In general though through 3 years of trying to get an explanation to my customers ; ASHAWAY feel/control is based on pure hitting comfort and a sense of firm and immediate elasticity when you strike the ball . <p> Technifibres sense of feel/control comes from the ball feeling like it stays on the racket longer and the feedback is cushioned ( some call this dwell time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as metioned before , it is subjective but if you understand what I am trying to convey , you should have a sense of the qualities on control between the two manufacturers and which one clicks with you . <p> Personally , for your racket , if you liked the factory string , I would do tecnifibre 305 1.2 in a ONE-PIECE setup ( eye rackets only really allow this due to the large grommet holes being limited ) <p> try the mains at 26.5 and the crosses at 24.5 . You will have a similar power feel on the string bed as the factory strings but with the dwell-based control that 305 offers . <p> Had the opportunity to try out some gut string on the prince powerbite 750 PB <p> i liked the grip of the ball but manit was really tough to control the ball <p> added a lot of power it was strung @26 lbs about right where i like itright in the 26-28 range <p> some drops were pretty effective due to the good grip from the stringsbut it would also send balls back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing w/ it after 4 games and found i had a much better time w/ the ashaway ultranick 17 xl ( my string of choice ) <p> It was to powerful for me I used the 305 strung one the most . Sold two one to yourself the 305+ and supposedly the 305 is sold awaiting payment and went to the Head 120 slimbody ! Incredible control racquet ! Enjoy the game ! <p> Tension is a trial and error effort . I would start with 25 if you find you need more power 24 more control 26 and continue down that road.Ashor strings at 25 or so Mathew up at 28-29 and Gualtier 14-16 so it just comes down to your type of game and timing on the ballthe lower the tension the easier it is on the body.Enjoy the game ! <p> here 's my 2 cents about squash strings . = Just about a year ago , I started to string my own rackets . Since then , I 've tried some not very obvious string setups . If you take some time to look around and you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings without paying top prices . Some of my favorites : <p> Dunlop Silk 1.18mm ( black ) Dunlop does not have a great name for the quality of their squash strings , but this is a string I would highly recommend . Its a multifilament string , with the filaments twisted and bonded with PU . It will give you fantastic power , with great comfort and touch . The ball really " pops " of the strings and meanwhile is easy on the arm . Allthough the coating is quite smooth and Dunlop rates the " ball grip " for this string 7/10 , you 'll be able to really cut the ball and go fo those flaming nickshots . Very lively string with little string movement . The durability for a string of this gauge , is just fine . Have strung several rackets at the club with this string and got only positive feedback . I 've seen 200m reels for just about 100 EURO , so if you are searching for a somewhat affordable top quality string , this one is definitely worth trying . <p> Kirschbaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics , this is an absolute top string . Like the Dunlop Silk , this is a multifilament string with the filaments twisted and bonded with a PU resign . During stringing , this string felt more stiff and the outer coating is just a little rough . This gives you great ball-bite . Great power and is very , very easy on the arm . The big downside of this string is the price ( just under 100 EURO for a 110m reel ) and the durability ; I 've got an avarage of 6-7 matches before it broke , mostly in the top of the racket . But if you can afford it , go for it <p> Polyfibre Ply Hightec 1.10mm ( yellow ) If you have arm or wrist problems , please skip this string . Because yes , this is a tennis string , and yes , its a polyester monofilament . But due to the thin gauge and when strung at a 5% 7% lower tension , it actually feels quite elastic and comfortable . Great power , great touch and a very unique " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nevertheless gives good grip on the ball . Unbeatable in durability , but with one ( big ) downside : because its a poly , it will become " dead " after about 2-3 months of of play ( 4 hours a week ) and needs to be replaced . But if you string your own rackets ( just under 60 EURO for a 200m reel ) and want to try something completely different , its worth a try . <p> Pros Pro Dura Ace 1.20mm ( natural / yellow ) If you are on a budget , this string is for you . IMHO , for the price of under 25 EURO for a 110m reel , this string can not be beaten . Its a prestretched multifilament string with 2 outer layers of braided fibers . These braided fibers give the string its rough surface , resulting in great grip on the ball . This string is very elastic and is very comfortable and easy on the arm . Good touch , good power , great durability . One to have always in stock . <p> Thered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have tried the Dura Ace and agree its a great bang for the buck string . It is to bad it s not made in an 18g 1.10 . I will heed your advice and give a few of your others a try also . Thank you <p> Very interested with the Kirschbaum strings since i have lot of shoulder pain . I currently use a harrow vapor and i wondering if it can be a good mix with the Kirschbaum . What tension will you recommend for good control / power balance ? I was using 305+ with a tecnifibre 125S before and it was less painful for my shoulder , but i really love the Vapor much more so i need to find a string that will temperate this little fury ! ! ! <p> Hard to tell , Michel , string tensions on themselves wo n't help you that much . What you actually should do , is to measure the stringbed stiffness ( DT-value ) of your beloved Tecnifibre 125S / 305+ combination and try to reproduce this on your Harrow Vapor . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combination of string area , number of mains / crosses , string type , string gauge and string tension(s) . Actually , its quite difficult to produce constant stringbed stiffness on identical rackets , with identical strings , even if the stringjob is done by the same person on the same stringing machine every time again . For example : a Karakal BX-130 racket strung with Dunlop Silk with 11 kg. for the mains / 10 kg. for the crosses gave me a nice , comfortable and " springy " stringbed . To reproduce somewhat the same feeling on a Oliver Blizz Z5 with the same string , I ended up with 10 kg. for the mains and 9.5 kg. for the crosses . Attempts to reproduce this on a Oliver EP13 , did n't  succeed for so far = <p> If you know the string tension of your TF125S combination , maybe you can use that as a starting point and work your way up ( or down ) the way JB suggests . You could also try to use a vibration dampner , which is probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Ashaway ZX I have it in a Harrow Vibe not as stiff a racquet as your Vapor but a great string so far . Still fall back to my Vibe with 305 strung at 23.5 great feel and power . The ZX is heavier 17g than the 305 18g . I find the 305 strung over 27 is dead to me like a board so dropping down feels good . The ZX at 25 works well . Depending on what you normally string at and string might help understand what is going on . Try either the 305 low tension or the ZX around 25 I think you will like it . Enjoy the game ! <p> Harrow vapor has a TIGHT string pattern that demands a low tension to be comfortable . <p> They used to come strung in supernick and from factory were very sweet to hit with . <p> My advice is to use supernick again ( maybe zx ) , go for 23lbs , and insist that your stringer uses lock-out setting on their machine ( if it is an electronic one ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Past month I have tried two other strings . Here are my thoughts about them : <p> MSV Squash Soft Touch 1.20 ( natural ) The construction of this string looks a lot like the Kirschbaum Touch Multifibre . The string is made of 1400+ nylon fibers that are twisted and bonded with PU . It feels equally stiff like the Kirschbaum Touch Multifibre , but the outer layer is less rough and feels a bit " wobbly " . After 2 / 3 times of playing , the string will " settle " and soften up a bit more . After some more play , the strings will start to notch and fray , just a bit like the Tecnifibre 305 . Its easy to string , but you 'll have to carefully adjust your clamps ; if they are too tight , it will again like the TF 305 " crack " inner PU resign . This string will give you fantastic power and good control . Its very resilent and comfortable , a good option if you suffer from arm / wrist / shoulder problems . Durability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of my favorites . <p> Toalson Asterisk 1.20 ( orange / blue / green / white ) This is a nylon monofilament string , with a thin layer of outer filaments . I think this string can be categorized as a " synthetic gut " . Its " sellingpoint " is elasticity . And indeed , the string is elastic . But in my experience , I had to string at a 5 7% lower tension to get that elasticity working and get some " pop " off the strings . Once you got that " pop " , its actually very nice and comfortable to play with . The power of this string is just okay . If you are searching for a lively and " crisp " feel , youd probably better skip this one . I can imagine that people who have tried this string , think its " boring " or " dull " . But this string is probably everything about comfort and control . Off the reel , it felt like the string was coated with some sort of teflon spray ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  like it and before stringing , I cleaned the piece of string with a wet microfibre cloth . And even when cleaned , it is very easy to string with due to its smooth surface . Conclusion : good and affordable string with good durability and a very comfortable soft feel . <p> Tjeerd , just bought some of the new Tecnifibre Dnamx 18g and 17g and strung the 18g up in a Harrow Vibe . Really nice if you like soft strings . The closest to gut yet with better consistency . About to string up an Eye control 120 with it strings nicely also not much coil memory . I have tried a lot of different strings and I seem to always go back to 305 , so far the Dnamx has the nice consistency of the 305 for great rails , softer feel , more power and about the same bite and spin availability . At low tensions , like the 305 it springs back to its starting position each time , you can hear the strings moving around when you cut the ball but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game ! <p> String is the second most important piece of equipment right behind shoes ! Well I am fortunate to have a stringer so have tried a bunch . I have 3 of the same racquets and rotate strings keeping the one racquet with the best playing string in it cut out the other two and restring . What I have found is not only string is important but the tension , and certain strings play better at certain tensionsany way just my findings and thoughts take with a grain of salt I am not a pro far from itstrings to try Tecnifibre 305 for a good all-a round , does all things good , seems to have the right amount of stick or slick to run the rails nicely , natural gut there is good stuff and some garbage one from the west coast poor quality , I bought 5 packs it is stiff as a board and fragile was told it is not for squashafter I bought it he told me.well good natural gut is great all a rounder great spin , touch and power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch but not as much spin as can be produced from the n gut and 305 . Gamma Tour Elite really nice great smooth power and touch okay spin but can move around until broken it and seatedTecnifibre x-one close to gut without as much spin producing . Ashaway makes some good string they just seem to loose there pop to soon ? Great spin and control not as powerful as the Tecnifibre or Gamma . RAB Sensorfibre great string if you like the thick stuff 17L is the thinnest they make but like the 305 with a bit more pop gauge to gauge but drop to the 305 18 and you get more pop less longevity but nice all a rounder . Tried many other brands but none are jumping out to me right now as bettering the above mentioned . I have found that the frames as long as it is what you like balance wise and weight if you put your preferred string tensioned to your liking a racquet is a racquetmy above thoughts are just that and please do n't  take my word seriously experiment it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your tension and string , enjoy the game ! ! ! <p> Hi Brent , I 've played with the X.Tech 1.20 ( green ) and liked it . Eye says its a similar multifilament construction to the Tecnifibre 305 . I admittedly do n't  have the most sophisticated palette when it comes to strings , but I thought the Eye strings did feel similar to Tecnifibre 305 , which I have tried previously ( 1.1 gauge though ) . <p> The owner of the squash store where I buy my rackets is a former spanish champion of racketball and top 10 of squash in Spain , and he told me that he uses the eyes strings . He , as Pierre , said that is quite similar to 305 . <p> Pierre is exactly correct experiment . There are a lot of good ones out there . Depending on what you are looking for from a string power , cotrol , a combination of bothwill help you narrow your choice , then once you settle on one experiment on tension . You will not believe what it can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tension . There is the popular string by Tecnifibre and Ashaway but do n't  hesitate to try some not so popular brands Gamma Tour Elite and RAB Sensor Fibre are two that play great . Another to try is natural gut but be careful which you get there are some poor stiff stuff out there and ask before you buy if it is approved for squash naturalgutwholesale.com for example says ( after you buy it ) not approved for squash . Enjoy the game ! ! <p> I have a Head Graphene Cyano 115 squash racquet . It is nearly 3 months old . I play 4-5 times a week for an hour . Over the last two weeks , I have noticed that I need to readjust my strings quite often during gameplay " something I rarely had to do earlier . I have been considering restringing my racquet but Im concerned it will affect the balance and performance . What strings are best for this racquet and are there any instructions I should give to the person restringing them so I have the same quality as earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension over time , which could explain the need for readjustment . Strings are a very subjective matter so its hard to recommend one " best " string . I would go into it with the mindset of experimenting to see what you prefer in terms of string and tension . <p> Cyano Rackets can Be Very Temperamental to string setup changes . Basically , it can be hard to get the factory feel in a restring as the string they use in them at factory changes frequently . <p> However , what I can tell you is that they should be strung in a TWO PIECE setup , with the mains running about 3 lbs higher than the crosses . <p> For instance , if you were guiding for a 27lb job ; consider the mains to be done at 28.5lb and the crosses back down at 25lbs . If you ar using powernick or ultranick , remember to lower the target tension by about 2.5lbs also . <p> do not use a thin guage string or supernick xl , as the open strign pattern of the cyano will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want comfort and durabity , consider new luxilon pro shot rough at 25/22 If you want control of pace and spin/cut try 305 classic at 28.5/25 or you could try the new Supernick ZX at 27/24 , I have some recently happy customers with this new orange string with a small reduction in tension . <p> Great advice Thomas throwing out an observation on the new Ashaway ZX or for that matter any of the Ashaway Powernicks or other Ashaways they tend to also move around which all string does but it does not go or pop back in place . So if it bothers you that it does n't  go back in place on its own then be aware the Ashaway seems to move then stay there instead of popping back in place like a Tecnifibre and others . Now heard many say if it is out of place or not makes no difference in how the ball reacts off it . Me bothers me how I see it if it is out of position then that string is at a higher tension then when it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same two attach points so has to be a higher tension it is being stretched . So what I have found in a Harrow Vibe is the ZX moves around as all string does but does not pop back to its original position on its own strung at 26 lbs or below . At 27 and higher seems to pop back in place on its own . On a Head XT Slimbody same thing .

Also very good touch and ball control . You have to know its a head light racket but it does not affect the power , and that give more manoeuvrability . This racket change my game , and i have more and more pleasure to play with . <p> Just bought one of these and had my first hit with it tonight . To be honest Im slightly perplexed by it I had a knock with someone elses first about a week ago and was amazed by how the ball just popped off it , it generated fantastic power . The one I bought feels totally different though very stiff and wooden almost with a lot of vibration through it , but ( in complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drop shots . I 'm not entirely unhappy with it I 'll get used to it I 'm sure but its so not what I expected from that previous hit and from what Ive read on places like here that , if I could , I would probably send it back for a replacement to see if its different ( I do n't  think " it does n't  feel right " is a valid excuse to send it back though ) ! Maybe the one I played with last week had been restrung or something and I did n't  notice but definitely not getting the ease of power out of it that I was hoping for . On another note , definitely going to throw a new grip on it , would like something a bit softer in the hand . Thanks for the reviews ! <p> I have the Carbonflex 130 and my first feeling when i first bought the racket was exactly what you said . Disappointing . The racket you first tried was either restrung or was played a few times . In general the 305+ string is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . So i would propose that you play it for a few months , then you will see the power dropping suddenly and it would mean its time to restring . Either use the Green ( 305 ) string for a better feel or give the 305+ another chance at 26 lbs . I think this could work for you . <p> I have played a few games with this racquet so far and I am thoroughly impressed . The best phrase to describe this racquet is ; As light as a feather but can sting like a bee . This is not only because of its yellow and black colour scheme but because of the lightness of the frame combined with those fabulous tecnifibre 305+ strings . <p> The frame is stiff with a nice thin shaft that feels very comfortable in the hand . What I would say is that I echo what others have said about the sweet spot . When you hit that sweet spot you know about it , the same is said about if you do n't . Although there is little vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely not go where you wanted it to go . Hit that sweet spot on the volleys and the drives and you will feel the power of this racquet . I found that I was hitting the nick more consistently as soon I had figured out where that sweet spot was . For the up court shots you can just let the ball come off those strings as long as you have it aligned on the sweet spot , if you want to be sure then a soft tap will help the ball on its way . Saying this I have discovered that using your wrist more in taking shots really helps produce a lot of power whilst using this racquet . If I did this with my previous racquet it would not have the same effect as it is slightly head heavier and harder to power through only using minimal arm movement . Perhaps this is just me but it definitely has made a difference . <p> The ball pings of those Tecnifibre 305+ strings like nothing else . The ball does n't come off like the racquet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The strings are tight and the ball just comes off them with the minimum of flex . This is why it is a racquet suited so well to the fast paced game style , once that ball has come off the racquet you are almost instantly ready to get back into position to take the next shot . <p> If there was one down side it would be the grip . It came with the Absolute Squash Grip and was very sticky for the first few minutes of play but when I got into playing and my hands became a little sweaty the grip lost this stickiness and actually became very shiny . As we all know shiny things are never that easy to hold so this disappointed me slightly . I will try the Tecnifibre Dry Grip and I hope this is a better product .

Asics , for me anyway have better than most companies in terms of durability on the sole , meaning you do n't  have to replace the shoe every few months .

It definitely feels great . I feel I am able to hit quite deep without too much effort though with higher tension ( I read some where its 27lb but cant find it now ) than what I currently used ( 25lb on old Head Cyano Power 135 as primary racket , same Supernick ZX string ) . It definitely feels lighter than Carboflex 125S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little with the 125S being less agile and a tad head-heavy but it might just be I need more time getting used to it . <p> I felt that I have better control with GWS 125 but it could also be the higher tension . I could also drive tighter to the sidewall but occasionally hitting slightly towards the right with backhand . Could it be its stiffer than the much older Head racket or its just me ? <p> I will be having more hit with this GWS 125 as well as 125S for comparison . <p> The RAD grip does n't  have the same sticky feel to the Karakal . That 's probably the only negative . Having said that , its better than Carboflex 125Ss original grip . <p> Also aesthetically , there are some minor paint leakages near the throat . <p> Others : The grip on mine is black instead of white as shown on this site Stencil on mine is " bk " instead of the knight logo

How do you rate this racket against HEAD i 110 ? <p> Sorry I have n't tried either but I will say its sometimes helpful to have a little more head-heavy racket because it helps guide your swing path a little bit . This is probably especially true for a beginner . I like the feel of a head-heavy racket too ! <p> Its great racket overall my favourite so far ( and I 've tried a few ) . Its great for beginners and club league players alike . This racket feels lighter than some my other ( theoretically ) lighter ones . Good balance of power and accuracy .

I felt the GTX was a little heavier ( despite the 130 name ) , a little head-heavier , a little stiffer , and had a smaller sweet spot . The GTX would be better if you have a slower swing and want the racket to help carve out your shot . The Slimbody I think would be better if you can generate good racket head speed and middle the ball . Even though the Slimbody has a larger sweet spot , its not very forgiving if you hit outside that sweet spot . <p> I purchased this racquet and it is probably the most unique racquet Ive ever owned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the racquet . I re-strung it with Power Nick at 26 lbs , and wow , what a difference . This racquet now has so much power , I have never felt a sweet spot with a racquet before like this . It is so nice . If you do n't  middle the ball , there can be a little vibration on off centre hits . I am very interested in trying the 135 slim body and see if its more forgiving on miss hits . I 've never played with a racquet that can dig balls out of the corner so effortlessly and also picking up tight balls off the wall , so great . Definitely recommend this racquet once you switch over the strings . <p> Constantinos have you tried the 135 yet really interested to see how it compares to the 120 . If so one with the optional fan stringing pattern ? Waiting to see how others like it . I have weighed the 120 and on my scale comes in at 150g string with 18g and a PU grip . Curious what the 135 comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enjoy the game ! <p> Hey JB , I have n't tried the 135 yet , but I saw a good deal online for the 135 , it was $129CAD , so I might pick it up . As far as the 120 is concerned , it has become my main racquet . The effortless power , great accuracy , and ability to flick a wrist in the front of the corner provides great deception has made this racquet my goto for matches . I absolutely love the balance , just feels so nice in the hands and during your swing . If there is one knock on the racquet , since it is so light , you can tend to get a little " wristy " and " whippy " , making it a little harder to hit straight lines , but I blame that more on my abilities than the racquet . In those cases , I just tend to slow it down and really concentrate on putting a good swing on the ball and minimize my wrist whip . But great racquet , with the new one coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these . Also the durability is amazing . This racquet has taken a few good whacks on the wall and is still in top shape <p> Constantino thank you for getting back . Let me know if you get the 135 . I have asked Pierre for feedback on the two since he has used both but heard nothing back . I am really enjoying the 120 and recently restrung it with Tecnifibre Dnamx great improvement . I unlike you have been using very light racquets and finding it an adjustment digging out balls in the back corners and the flicks . Use to Eye 115 and a Harrow Vibe much lighter racquets . But finding my swing is more grooved as I tend to swing through more . Great control great for tight rails like the Eye but for nice controlled serve returns the Head is just comfortable , swings through to return the ball either cross court or nicely down the rail less swing effort I assume because the racquet is heavier . Cutting off balls is great with the heavier racquet I find it takes less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . So it comes down to another 120 or try the 135 . The heavier 120 has slowed me down and improved my game so the weight seems to be good for me . Enjoy the game ! <p> As some other players ( it seems ) , I first had a mixed feeling The first time I hit the ball I felt a lack of power ( and not a little ) but after playing this racket few weeks it give me very good sensation and but sure the power can be there when its necessary . It become an evidence after an accommodation period . I played an eye 110 control which is more easy to play immediately I think but I really think this head racket help to improve the game ( technically , tactically , ) . And the Slimbody is for sure a very pleasant characteristic . Try it but not for only one game if you can ! <p> Marlier I am interested in the Eye x lite 110 pro control and have tried the XT 120 SB so was wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the two ? Which one are you using most and why ? Which one is heavier and is it an advantage or disadvantage ? Thank you Enjoy the game ! <p> I 'm an intermediate player here in Pakistan . I bought this racquet after reading a few reviews and after swishing it about in the shop . It has a nice even balance to it so I got it . Big mistake ! <p> There is significant vibration if you stray off the sweet spot even by a little bit . My game has gone down a notch with this and the vibration did n't  help a nascent tennis-elbow . I 'm now going for the Head Graphene XT 110 after trying out a friends 115 ( which is not available , so the 110 ) . <p> Bottom line : Unless you 're an ace player who always middles the ball , I would stay away from this racquet . <p> Sohail , if you have an issue with tennis elbow , you should definitely consider a heavier racquet , do n't  go lighter to a 110 racquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel up your arm . The lightest you should think about going is 130g . <p> Restring it I have used Tecnifibre 305 18g and Ashaway Powernick 19 both great the 305 incredible control the Powernick you got it more power . It is definately a racquet for someone that strikes the ball consistently on the sweet spot .. Also a great racquet for doubles with the 305 in it . Just for reference strung with 18g 305 it weighs in at 150g figure 5-7g for the string . Even balance . Enjoy the game ! <p> I just received a 120 and the first few strokes I thought it might not be the right racquet for me . It felt great as far as balance but the ball just did not pop off the racquet . The more I played with it though the more I appreciated the total control wether you were trying to pass a player down the rail or dropping it in the front court . Lobs did n't  flying off the racquet you have to stoke the ball back there . Once I completed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is making me a better player . No longer am I using my power to try and win a rally I am placing the ball and playing a thinkers game slowing it down and putting it where I want it . It seems to be a very consistent racquet . First time using the Head Evolution string , good feel , stays in place , nice , smooth . The ball does n't  explode off the string it acts more of guiding the ball to where you stroke the ball . When I need power it seems to be enough and going were I want it . A bonus the racquet looks great also ! Enjoy the game ! <p> I 'm looking forward too for some review about this racket . I already have the xenon 140 wich has the same string pattern ( 14+17 ) and same balance point , so I 'm very intersting to know if the xenon 120 slimbody has a big difference comparing to my racket. 
@@90398627 @5898627/ <h> Head Graphene Cyano 115 <p> here 's the Head Graphene Cyano 115 , which came out in 2013 . Technically this is marketed as the Head Graphene Cyano2 115 , but nobody seems to use the 2 which kind of makes sense , because its not2 convenient . <h> Racket Info <p> Graphene is a flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional ( 2D ) honeycomb lattice , and is a basic building block for graphitic materials of all other dimensionalities . It can be wrapped up into 0D fullerenes , rolled into 1D nanotubes or stacked into 3D graphite . <p> NICE . But what does that do for you ? According to Head , <p> GrapheneG technology allows for the first time an optimal redistribution of weight in HEAD racquets . Through the use of GrapheneG in the shaft , the weight in the middle part of the tennis racquet can be reduced . Instead , weight can be shifted from the racquet shaft to more functionally relevant areas in the tip and grip . This unique construction provides players with an unmatched maneuverability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racquet with GrapheneG is easier to swing and enables even more powerful shots . And it will give opponents a really hard time . <p> Functionally relevant areas in the tip and grip ? Sold . <h> Reviews <p> I had a hit with the Head Graphene 115 a while back and really enjoyed it . I was expecting it to feel too light , but actually it was quite fun to play with . It was certainly light and maneuverable , but I also felt my shots to length felt very solid . This was an all-around great racket and I would love to play with it again . <h> Spotted <p> This is a great picture from the British Nationals of Sarah Kippax ( pink ) getting caught on Jenny Duncalfs skirt as she tries to go around her . You can see the Head 115 in action : <h> Head YouTek Cyano 115 Original <p> I first saw this in Darren McCanns squash bag . This seems to be a predecessor of the Head Graphene Cyano 2 115- and the Head YouTek Cyano 2 115 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 115 grams , with a 36.5 cm balance point . So this guy might be a less-expensive option ( while its still available ) . I recently had a hit with the newest Graphene version of this racket and loved it . <p> That is always tough . The factory strings the racquets at the upper end of the range since racquets lose tension over time as you know . So racquet is strung at the upper end , then it gets packed and ships over on a boat , received in our warehouse , then shipped to the dealer and then to the customer . The time that takes varies so the tension of the racquet when the customer receives is hard to gauge . It is really difficult if not impossible to match factory tension and feel unfortunately . That is not just for HEAD but all racquets . <p> I have tried the Head Graphene Cyano 115 today and it was great , solid racket , light and powerful . Also tried the tecnifibre carbloflex 130 but did n't  like it comparing to the cyano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to buy a new racket but not sure between the two although the cyano is cheaper I do n't  care though . Want the better one . Any comments will help . <p> Hi Geoff , its a bit down to personal preference really , but I prefer a head-light racket for volleying because I feel I can get the racket prepared more quickly , in time to get a ball that 's moving fast . Some people prefer head heavy because it helps you follow through the shot better rather than just stabbing at it . <p> To me a stiff racket means there 's not much give in the shaft , which means you 'll get a SOLID feeling when you hit the ball . A looser frame with more give in it I feel accentuates control and touch . I 'd say the Tec 125 is on the looser end . <p> Geoff I have played with both and agree with Pierres comment . The 125 Carboflex trumps the Airstick on the power side and control but if you put some Tecnifibre 305+ or 305 1.10 gauge in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airstick and it balances it out more . The + gives more power than the straight 305 but either will really improve the racquet but in my experience not quite to the 125 Carboflex with 1.10 plus in it . The Ashaway Powernick 1.10 is great stuff and light but just cant get it to settle in and stay put after every rally I have to straighten it get it back in place . The new Prince Beast 750 looks promising Ramys new racquet of choice lighter and more balanced than the Airstick 130 . I am trying to get more consistency in my game so falling back to a slightly head heavy racquet with the Harrow Vapor . <p> The Head ( Graphene ) Cyano 115 is also on he loose end . Strung and gripped it weighs exactly 150 gram . I use a karakal pu supergrip overgrip making it 10 grams heavier , but more important , the balance shifts toward the grip , making it more manoeuvrable allowing me to harnass and aim the power it packs . Truely , for me it was never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compared to its predecessor I feel the added graphene makes it a bit more stiff making it easer to play an " absolute " dropshot into the nick . I compared it to the Tecnifibre Carboflex 125 and I experienced much more pop with the Cyano <p> Hi all , Really impressed about this racket a friend of mine just bought recently . What is according to your view the appropriate string and tension for this magnific product ? Thanks in advance for your reply . <p> A great racket . I use this as my back-up racket . Very light and very powerful . You can pick this racket up for about 60 pounds and is a real bargain . Probably would benefit from a string up grade . There is a product review video from Paul at pdhsports . <p> Hi Seb , Personally I do n't  see any reason why you should be dissuaded from trying a lighter racket , especially if you already feel uncomfortable with the heavier models . I think people tend to recommend heavier rackets to beginners ( not that you are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weight helps you shape your swing better . Whereas with a lighter racket , people might tend to be too wristy with their swing . I actually asked my local pro about this a while back and his answer was that he does n't  agree with the general approach of having new players play with heavy rackets he thought a lighter racket was a perfectly good , perhaps ever preferred , starting point . <p> Hi Seb , Recently I had the pleasure to try a few shots with the Karakal TEC Gel 120 . I 've always been skeptical about these kind of light sticks , but since I was familiar with the TEC Tour 140 , I took my chance for a good comparisment. = I was quite suprised dispite the low weight I had no problems at all hitting good , powerfull drives . Probably because of the balance-point ( I believe it was 37-38 cm ) that felt slightly head-heavy , helping you hitting " through " the ball . It comes ( like all Karakals ? ) with the Karakal Nano 125 string , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you plenty of power . So , my TEC Gel 120 aftermath : good , stable racket with loads of control and enough power on board . I can think of no reason why you should *not* give it a try <p> Hi Seb , I would recommend using a racket that feels good and has an easy swing , it does not matter what people say . I believe you should feel and try to test the racket first ; by hitting some length , volleys , drop shots , etc . I know that can be very difficult nowadays . Go what feels right that 's what I did . I went for Ramy Ashour , racket the prince airstick 130 , that was my first racket I brought off my coach two years ago , for -20 it was a great deal , because it used to cost -120 and upwards and my coach restrung it with tecnifbre 305 ! That was just over 2 years ago , by the way this is coming form a junior player . I now use the racket after my first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good junior player .

@@90398634 @5898634/ <h> Dunlop Squash Rackets 2014 <p> Recently , I asked my email list if they had any questions about the Dunlop Squash Rackets 2014 2015 models that just came out . Originally my plan was to video review all the new rackets , but I was n't able to do that in the end . Thankfully , Tom from Dunlop was kind enough to answer all the questions that were sent in . <p> here 's a short intro video , which is mostly me testing out my new tripod setup . It looks like the ceiling is resting on top of my head , but I assure you its not . <p> Anyway , the video below is where I go through all the questions and answers in more detail . You can switch it to HD playback by clicking the gear icon , or view it on YouTube to see things more clearly . <p> If you have any further feedback or a different opinion on anything , please leave a comment ! <p> A : Try the Dunlop Revelation 135 . Note : I said in the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range but that 's not true the Biomimetic Max , to name one , was teardrop . <p> Q : Just how good are the factory strings on Dunlop racquets or would you recommend restringing . Have just bought a Biomimetic Elite with Dunlop Silk string . <p> A : The Dunlop Silk strings are geared for feel , touch and control , which should be a good fit for most club players . Personally , I used the factory strings on my Dunlop for a year and now am using Tecnifibre 305 1.1 ( green ) . <p> Q : Do Dunlop rackets still vibrate when striking the ball ? <p> A : Havent had that problem ( leave a comment if you have ) but you can use the dampener that comes with the racket . <p> Q : I use Tecnifibre rackets ( Carboflex 125 ) and have always thought of using Dunlop or at least trying them , what are the differences ? I am looking for touch rather than power . <p> A : Tecnifibre rackets have greater power and are generally stiffer . Dunlop does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to the Elite or any of the other top 2014 model year racquets ? <p> A : The Ultimate and Elite are now " GTS " rackets . Theyve been made a touch stiffer , but maintained control/feel . Update since making the video : Note , the new Elite actually has 18 cross strings , as compared to last years Elite , which had 19 cross strings . This should give the new model a bit more power . <p> Q : I use the Dunlop Blackstorm and I-d like to read reviews about New Dunlop rackets compared to the old ones . <p> Q : Why is the Dunlop Biomimetic Evolution 120 , which is head-light , specifically aimed at women when Nicol David uses a 135g head-heavy Prince and there are men on the PSA tour who use very light racquets ? <p> A : Boys can play with a pink racket too = <p> Thanks again to Tom for helping get these questions answered for everyone . <p> Remember to leave a comment if you have any further thoughts to add ! <p> Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular basis , with other brands as well , so make sure you are subscribed to my email list if you want the latest updates ! <p> Unfortunately I do n't  think Dunlop makes that type frame anymore . I believe you are the second person to ask so it seems to be missed by others too . My idle speculation is that Wilson is using that mold for the Whip rackets ( I have never used it , just a guess based on the pictures ) <p> Thanks for the reply Q Is the Dunlop Precision Ultimate Squash Racket a better racket than the Dunlop Biomimetic MAX i 'm thinking of buying one.I have giving up on the Biomimetic Max looking for a replacement now any ideas ? ? <p> I have discovered what the S and L mean on Dunlop rackets ! For stringing purposes , these denote the SHORT and LONG side for one piece stringing ( which as far as I know , is the way all modern Dunlops come from the factory and is the method Dunlop recommends for restringing their rackets ) . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one side of the racket and the long string side only on the other is because the grommets and bumper strip are not symmetrical . There are channels in the grommets and bumper strip that put the strings below the level of the grommets and bumper strip if you orient them the correct way . if you do it reversed , the string will stick up and make contact with the floor or wall when scraping shots off the floor or wall . This will start wearing away at the strings and eventually cause them to break on the outside of the frame there . Done in the correct orientation , the string will be below the grommets and bumper strip and will be protected . <p> Honestly its kind of a personal preference thing , higher tension will give you a bit more control . They may find their clients generally prefer that . A tension of 28 is within the band of normal tension . Do n't  be afraid to ask them about it ! <p> Pierre , nice job ! It is very interesting to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket you want to have a consistency as much as possible So : 1 . Does Dunlop use different tension for different strings / different models or it is 25 pounds everywhere ? 2 . Does Dunlop put different tension to vertical / horizontal strings ? Thanks !

Finally found one online for 60 bucks . Before I pick them up though , would you have an idea of what theyve improved in the 5 over the 4 ? <p> I currently play with the Black &amp; Silver Asics Gel Rocket . Really light ( mediocre balance ) and decent cushioning . The Blasts are much heavier , do you think that would make a big difference on court ? <p> Mulch mowers cut grass clippings twice into fine particles that fall through the turf and decompose quickly . Get some tips on calculating the value of your time and learn how to prioritize your tasks more effectively . <p> I see how that can relate to squash . " Marketing " must relate to how one moves on court . Mulching is like staying low on the T and it helps " decompose " your opponents loose shots . Genius aerator , pure genius .

Both strung with Dnamx 18g and Black Knight Supergrips the control is slightly head light , the power , head heavy to even . The control weighs in at 142 grams the power 160 grams yes 160 grams . Maybe they mistakenly painted a 125 power the 115 paint scheme ? Got me but they are totally different rackets . Eye is thinking about my question to them so see what they say . The power control thing using different string spacing is n't new I recently had a Prince Pro Beast 750 with the same concept and it works as advertised great spin and power . The two Eyes I have play incredibly different the control that and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power well at 160 grams it should have more power then the 142 gram control and it does . The powers spin and touch are great but rails are tighter with the control.So do I have an anomaly a one of with the115 160 gram power ? Something does n't  seem correct .. So which one do I prefer.the control feels better great for attacking and cutting off to dominate the t but the power slows the game down more full sweeping swings more of a length game just very different rackets . Enjoy the game !

@@90398763 @5898763/ <h> Asics Gel Fastball Men <p> here 's a shoe called the Asics Gel Fastball . Its a handball shoe , so it would be appropriate for any indoor court . This year a number of players have migrated to the Asics Gel Fastball , especially those who were fans of the Asics Gel Blast 5 but have been disappointed with the Asics Gel Blast 6 . <p> I have not worn a better pair of squash shoes for squash than the Gel Fastball ( I bought the blue and yellow pair and found them only on the Amazon Germany store ) . The ability to turn laterally with a solid grip and support while stopping fast and moving back from the front wall is very impressive . I like the rhino skin which is super hardy and avoids the damage ( to an extent ) done by constant friction to the wooden floor . Depending on your feet shape , these can be really snug . Big up from me lads . <p> Based on your comment ( and some other suggestions ) I went into the deep water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , needed to buy it from Amazon Germany ( which I speak ) , and luckily they ship to Australia . <p> Awaiting delivery on Friday , looking quite forward to giving them a go . <p> Good Choice = It been 4 months since I have been wearing them now . Having broken into them well and love it still . They have also significantly dropped prices so you would have got a sweet deal . Cheers <p> I 've had my pair for over a month now and am still trying to break them in . Since new , they 've been a bit too narrow , and the toe beside my pinky toe gets squished . I ordered the same size as my Blast 4/5 shoes ( 9.5 ) but these definitely seem slightly more narrow and less forgiving than the Blasts which also were a bit tight at first but quickly adapted to my feet . Length of the 9.5s is perfect . Am also having a bit more blistering on the right ball of foot than with the Blasts ( despite using ENGO pads ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to sit a bit higher at the heel . <p> Will try to break them in a bit more and report back . Am limited to using them in solo sessions and for matches , have been rotating through my old pairs of Blast 4s , choosing the pair that looks the least abused . With four pairs of Blast 4s to rotate through , I think I can make it to July 2017 when the Blast 7 comes out but am still hoping the Fastball proves to be a shoe that I can make work for me . <p> These shoes are definitely more narrow at the toes than some of the other Asics shoes Ive used in the past ones like the Blast and Domain . And they definitely do n't  " give " as much so if they are a bit tight , its difficult to make them fit just by wearing them . I eventually took a hair-dryer to my pair and pushed from the inside outward at the place where my toe ( 4th toe beside pinky ) was getting squished . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be better maybe even gone . I then took the shoes to some friendly matches this morning and low and behold , the pinching was no longer an issue . I was finally able to fully utilize and enjoy these shoes the way they were meant to be . And boy are they good . Light , stable , and amazing grip . I could go on but I think this thread is already full of accolades . <p> So to conclude a bit more narrow than some other Asics models ; take some break-in time if you have medium to wider feet , with break-in potentially accelerated by using a hair-dryer and some pushing from the inside outward . But once broken in , a very capable shoe possibly the best I 've worn similar stability and grip to the old Blast models but noticeably lighter . <p> Hope this helps somebody . Particularly somebody who wants to give up on the shoe due to its slightly narrow toe-box . <p> These shoes are fantastic for squash . The only problem Ive encountered is that , being a left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the left foot takes a beating and is separating from the white foam piece . Maybe its just my pair that is defective . I do n't  know . To try to reduce the damage , I 've covered that area with duct tape and it will last a couple games before wearing through . I 've also tried shoe-goo . Also lasts a couple games before wearing through . Its too bad because these shoes are awesome otherwise . Is there anything out there more resilient than shoe-goo that would last longer ? I would n't be surprised to see a slight design update for the Fastball-2 where this part of the sole is better protected , like you see with the Domain line . <p> Jeff introduces the Asics Gel Fastball to me because the Gel Blast 5 was discontinued . It was almost a blessing in disguise as I absolutely love these shoes ! They are lower to ground which is great for balance and the wider outsole at the ball of the foot really increases stability which especially good for me and my weaker ankles . Even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there and they do n't neglect the comfort of the Blasts . There was next to zero break in time , which was an added bonus as I was in dire need of a new pair of court shoes ! <p> These are gaining in popularity here in Toronto . As a long time Asics Blast user , the new 6 has changed for the worse in my opinion . It seems many people who dislike the 6 but prefer Asics are gravitating toward the Fastball as a great alternative , and $40 more in my pocket , no less ! <p> For myself , I find the Fastballs just as comfy and grippy out of the box as any pair of Salmings , but more durable . My Salming R1s hardly lasted a couple of months . If the Fastballs hold up as well as all my old Blast 4s and 5s , I 'll be an extremely happy camper . <p> Just a little nick-pick in the description : they are made by asics , not adidas . They are a cheaper version of the fireblast . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireblast has : CGS , heel lock material at the top . I tried them on , and they are really good , would need some weeks to break in as it has a rhino skin ( leather-ish ) upper . In the same category as the Salming viper

Its strung weight is 165gpretty much same like other " 135g " rackets . " even " balance is very nice , very comfortable . I have it strung with 305+@23lbs and the ball really pops off with good control . i would say its a very relaxing racket to use . <p> I had this racquet for about a couple of months .

I broke mine with very little force on about its 10th game , some one else I know had one and it lasted just 3 hit-outs . Could have been dumb luck , but I would proceed with caution . <p> All in all , I was n't very happy with it , even before it broke .

Tecnifibre supposedly took the power of their 305 strings and merged it with the control of their X-One Biphase , creating one superstring , a creature of power and grace , like the mighty Pegasus . <p> But instead , the terrifying reality is more complicated . One reader said the 305+ 1.1 string " felt tight and hard " ( that 's what she said ) , and another said " it was too stiff for my liking " ( that 's what she said ) .

I almost sent it for a restring as my elbow was starting to complain . Laziness got in the way and 2 weeks after my first impression that string had finally settled : jackpot . Its silky smooth . In the long run the 305 Original may very well be a bit sharper , but its harder to tame and quite unforgiving . The 305+ is delicate in comparison , and feels a bit more powerful , but that might be the Carboflex doing its thing . I tried both the 305 and the 305+ on the same day and I had a hard time telling one from the other , no joke , its really close , especially when the 305+ is brand new . But give it some time and the 305+ becomes its own string , not some 305 heir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular players looking for a bit of comfort . <p> I 'd definitely concur with the comfort statement in this comment . I usually use Powernick 18 red , but have been trying a few things since developing a bit of tennis elbow . Combination of 125S and 305+ was definitely a lot more forgiving on my elbow .

Very powerful but havent been able to get the control right . You need to be persistent with this string until it works . I know it works for many people but unfortunately it does n't  for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose power in my shots . <p> I 'm currently using the Biphase and it has a softer feeling with great control and power ( less powerful than 305+ ) . It basically can do everything . I find that my performance increases once the strings start to fray ( crosses has some fuzz which gives more grip to the ball I guess ) . Biphase is more expensive though and durability is much lower than 305+ . <p> Hi , a lot of guys are playing with Carboflex 125S and in 99% of all cases they cut the original strings out and have it restrung with 305+ with lower tension . They met with Tecnifibre team and told them that they should be sold without strings as nobody is using factory strung Carbolex 125S . From CZ <p> i 'm using the 305+ 1.2 since it comes out with the carboflex 125 . The string is very durable and generates lot of power .

I have seen this only on prince rackets that have a small throat ( hybrid in between tear drop shale and throat ) . <p> Another question have you experimented your self in lower tensions on the 305+ with the technifibre racket ? I have tried ( probably silly of me ) 22.2 lbs ( 10 kgm ) on my 130 carbonflex racket and 24.3lbs ( 11 kgm ) on my other carbonflex 130 racket . <p> The feeling on the 22.2 lbs is that it is rather num and cant control the ball very much and was n't impressed witht he power . on the 24.3 lbs the same power with a bit more control . have you had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think ? This is the first time since i bought them that i re-string them . <p> I played with the 1.2mm strings for a few months and I have to say , they are really difficult to play with . I strung it with 27lbs and there was little feel on the ball . There is amazing power but it makes it harder to control and the power slowly goes dies after a while . <p> I played with biphase 1.18 and I found that so much better . Its too bad the durability is so low and so expensive . I 'm going to try the Powernick 18 and hopefully that will be my string of choice = ) <p> I play this string with my Technifibre 130 and i have to say i tend to agree to the feeling you just mentioned . Because I have only been using this racket for a weeks , at the beginning i thought it might have been the racket but I am afraid that it is the string . The weird part is that this racket comes already with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so I am considering to restring the same one at less lbs and if this does n't  work then probably try the 305+ 1,1 . <p> Of course my last option would be to work to use green 305 , which i liked with my previous racket . <p> Thank you David . I have two identical rackets with the same string . My plan is to use one of them a lot and when time comes to change the string then i experiment o and i see which one i like best . But I do agree i feel the string is one which needs time to get used to before deciding . Quick question as I am from Greece and not familiar with the expression . When you say it dies , what do we mean ? <p> One quick question as I am experimenting on the 305+ 1.2 sting tensions . You said you tried at 27lbs and you were not happy . Did you have chance to try on this string another tension ? I tried 22.2 lbs and 24,3 lbs . For the 22,3lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a difference in power . As for the 24,3 lbs i felt it being better more control and the power was there .

According to RacquetGuys , the strung ( all-in ) weight of the Classic is about 10 grams more than the original , even though they 're both advertised by Dunlop as 130 grams unstrung.

I am a intermediate player ( in the US ) , and is currently using the Dunlop Biomimetric Tour CX with the Tecnifibre 1.2 Green strings . The previous racket I had was a prince beginners racket , so I do n't  really know much about rackets . <p> I am starting to see some wear and tear on my racket , and I am thinking of buying a second one to rotate . I am also thinking of the Evolution 130 ( Matthews racket ) . What do you think ? And if I buy it , should I also remove the factory strings and string it with something else ? If so , what other strings would you recommend ? I am more like a control-type player , not a super power player , and I am also very quick on the court . <p> here 's my take on this . Readers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> So , I actually have n't played with either the Tour CX or the Evolution 130 , but I am going to take a stab at this anyway ! <p> Sounds like you are progressing from being a newcomer at squash to now intermediate and probably still on the rise as you work out all the angles of squash . <p> This may be kind of a boring answer but I think you should consider getting a second Tour CX rather than the Evolution 130 . I think at this point you want your racket to be a constant rather than a variable . So as long as you are relatively happy with the Tour CX , I 'd double down on it . <p> From what Ive read , the Evolution 130 is probably going to be lighter , and more head-light . That 's great for a very attacking ( volleying ) player . Personally , I think for a control player , you 're going to want a bit more weight in the head . At least , that 's what I prefer . It helps me " carve " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more pace on the ball when needed . So , my guess is the Tour CX will suit you a bit better . <p> As for the strings , I really like the Tecnifibre 1.2 Green . But honestly , I 'm not too fussy about strings . I 'm usually happy enough with the factory strings . Maybe keep the factory strings in for a bit and compare the two to see if you notice the differences . You may end up wanting both rackets strung about the same , for consistency . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I agree that its better to have two of the same racquets rather than two different racquets . Buy them at the same time and string them at the same tension and try to rotate them in play .

I often use one racquet for two games in a match and then switch if the grip is getting too sweaty , which is why its good to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suggest finding a racquet that seems to work well and then trying to stick with it for a few years , and if you want to experiment , do it in the off-season from league play . Change the racquet or string tension or string brand / make if you want the racquet to feel different . It makes a pretty big difference actually , so you want to settle on a setup for your racquet / string / tension / grip and go with it for a season before changing . <p> I 've used the Prince Airstick 130 for about 5 years now . Looks like it may be coming off the manufacturing roster for Prince , so I 'll have stock up or find something similar . Not to recommend the racquet specifically , but to show consistency with the same gear .

Differences : almost same weight , same string pattern and more durable apparently the BK . Dunlop seems a little fragile and needs a restring to be in the same league . Difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of BK . Could you she 'd some light on this t+pic ? BK just started to distribute in my Region . Not too many players have tried the brand . THANKS in advance <p> Hi Chano , I decided to reply to your question even though I have NOT used the BK Ion Storm . I was using the Dunlop Pro GTS 130 at the beginning of this year but recently switched to another Dunlop racket : the Biomimetic Ultimate . The main reason why I changed rackets was because of the weight balance of the Pro GTS was n't doing it for mealthough Dunlop describes this model as head light that is simply NOT true , holding the racket is just like holding a hammer . I find that on the current Dunlop range the Ultimate and the Elite have a much more even distribution of the weight . Hope this helps . -Juan <p> That 's true with the dunlop my gtx-130 with ashaway red strings and that basically turned into a hyper hammer . My dunlop was fragile though the paint below the bumper at the top fades away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bumps . I 've played briefly with the black knight racquet however the balance to me did n't  work out and it felt quite " dead " so not too responsive

@@90398921 @5898921/ <p> Got a good look at his racket in person as well and noticed he shaves off the bumper guard so its just the top part of it that holds all the grommets in place . Also he strings his racket at a very loose 22 lbs . <p> Simon , Will , Pierre Thank you for good observations and interesting info on Gregoire 's Carboflex 125 . <p> Liam ( the stringer and racket customizer ) states that most pros add weight to the handle of the sales rackets . So shaving/sanding the tip ( like Gregory Gaultier racket ) is not so much to have a lighter racket , but to change the balance point having the possibility to move/add weight towards or into the handle . GG racket is said to be 157 grams and 33 cm balance . <p> Let 's kill the powerhype of the lighter rackets , even premium commentators at SquashTV states repeatedly that both Greg and Ramys rackets are incredibly light . Not so , the magical LightSabre , the YodaStick as racket does not exist , and is only a wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords as important tools regarding usefullness maneuverability and power . We all ( should/will ) know that the lightest racket is as **28;380;TOOLONG as the racket with the fewest strings . Imagine playing squash with a badminton racket or one that teoretically weights zero grams or one that only have two main strings ! Thats powerfull beond real , and not a very good squash racket , will probably be called the **26;410;TOOLONG . <p> I can understand that the heaviest squash racket in the world is not selling a lot , and that often lightweight is an important buying consideration for tents or laptops when backpacking without Sherpa , but when getting married we do not normally choose the lightest wife or husband <p> Most of the rackets from the shop are luckily much heavier than announced anyway . Marketing info is totally unreliable . Weight is announsed sometimes totally stripped , without strings , grip , bumper , paint , . Other times , like the Harrow Spark I recently bought supposed to be 135 grams finished weight , weighing in at my place at 146grams . Likevise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams . GoGreen ! Strings are 10-15 grams and grip is about the same . So the Carboflex 125 will probably be 155grams total . <p> It would also be interesting to know how much weight Gregoire 's rackets are added ( in the handle ? ) , and what total weight and balance point that would give , optimized for him , and probably for most others also a good racket to get used to , or start of with . <p> In choosing rackets , personal preference is overrated , a good/best racket is more objective ( like a premium chefs kitchen knife or Makita drill ) , and you should get used to it , not the other way around ! ? <p> ( Sorry for length and grammar , but so little info on this important subject for the quality of our game found on the internett ) Hurray ! Ole <p> Sometimes pros can get custom rackets catered to them personally . And taking off cosmetics ( paint ) could shave off a few grams/OZs and its cheaper than making the actual racket lighter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably just that he likes his racket lighter .

I put in my prescription , ordered them and they arrived after a couple of weeks ( shipped to me in South Africa I was impressed ) . I 'm a big guy with a big head and these fit comfortably . Peripheral vision is decent with I 'd say slightly more than 90 degrees to each side ( with 0 degree being straight towards the front ) .

@@90399013 @5899013/ <h> Sponsored Links product i 'd : 26347 222379 @qwx842379 <p> As best I understand it , Ashaway took their popular SuperNick string design and introduced a relatively new material named Zyex into the outer jacket of the string . Its supposed to mean that SuperNick ZX has improved durability and holds tension better than the classic SuperNick strings , but still retains their playability . <p> This string is 17 gauge ( 1.25 mm ) , which is on the thicker side for squash strings . 222378 @qwx842378 <h> Comments <p> I tried the SuperNick ZX Micro gauge on my Eye X.Lite 120 Control and the string did n't  survived 10 hours of play . If somebody around germany is interested in trying the micro gauge , I bought a secound set ( 9 meters ) and will sell it for 10 Euros plus postal rate . Drop me a line here and we can get into contact . <p> I just cut out my 305+ and strung my Dunlop Elite with ZX strings at 26 lbs ( 11,8 kg ) with my drop weight machine with flying clamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My comments : Feels soft and surprisingly powerful , with good feel of control . I definitely feel it has better control than the 305+ and just as powerful but much softer than the 305+ . My 305+ was strung at 24m/23c and it felt good for that string with good power and no vibration even though it is a very hard string . <p> I still think 26 lbs ( on my machine ) is too low for the ZX string , because the string moves around very much and will not keep aligned . It also feels maybe too soft for my liking at 26 . I would next time go for 28 lbs to get a crisper response and direct feel , and better string alignment . <p> I think that for recreational/club players it is better to go with thicker strings like the ZX if you have a racket with a big head and an open string pattern , like the Dunlop Elite . Thinner strings in a big head ( 500cm2 ) with an open string pattern ( 14+18 or less ) leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also have a Dunlop Ultimate strung with 305 18G/1.1mm and in that racket the thinner strings work much better for me , because of a denser string pattern . Just my thoughts . <p> I totally agree with you about the ZX supernick 1.25mm , ideal tension is 12.5-13 kg and you will feel the difference . explosive ! ! ! after a week it will reach 12-12.50 kg fair enough , strings still aligned most of time ! <p> its been 8 months am using the Ashaway ZX , as for durability it lasted more than a month . i play 4 times a week <p> Ive been using the ZX Micro in my Force Elite . Its the first time Ive changed strings , so I 'm still working out what works best . I tend to prefer thinner strings , as I do n't  go through them often , so was looking forward to trying these , and they have n't disappointed . <p> Initially I wanted to try a lower tension , around 25lbs but the stringer thought they were too soft when he did them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ill probably go for around 27-28lbs next time . <p> Ive play tested the micro version of this string and it feels really good . Unfortunately it was strung at a tension way lower than I 'm used to so it was harder to make a really good comparison to the Ultranick 18s that I usually play with . However , my notes would be that it seemed to play like a 19 gauge string with excellent power , feel and cut . It seemed to play a lot like the Powernick 19 , but should have better durability . I 've also got the 17 gauge version in my BK Ion Cannon Castagnet but the factory tension seems very tight which has reduced the playability of the string . I 'll provide more feedback when I get it strung at my regular tension . <p> Over the past 18 months or so Ive experimented with Tecnifibre 305 , X-One Biphase , Supernick XL , Ultranick 18 , Ultranick 19 , and the Supernick ZX . I play a pretty light tension 24lb . The 305s and the X-One gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 2-4 weeks or so ( I play nearly every day ) , and replacing them gets expensive for a student . I liked the durability of the Supernick XL , but I missed the sense of control from the 305s and the X-One , the ability to cut into the ball . <p> Played with the Supernick ZX today in two Prince 03 Speedport Blacks . Power felt good , the ball really popped . Despite the thick gauge , I felt like I had the same ability to cut into the ball , and in fact the sweet spot was heavily speckled with rubber at the end of the match . But the best thing was the touch . With the ZX I felt like I was hitting the ball with my bare hand , especially on drop shots and lobs . Never felt that way with other strings , even the 305s . <p> I have used this string about 4 months now on my Oliver Pure 3 . I 'm fully impressed for this string ! The power and touch is perfect for me ! Durability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set of strings at this period of time . On behalf of the price this is much cheaper option than ultranick or powernick . Here in Finland reel of powernick 18 cost 138G and reel of supernick zx 75G ! I think this string is really good value for money ! <p> The now unavailable version of Powernick 17 had Zyex as part of the name IIRC . It was a pale metallic blue colour and 1.25 or 1.22 gauge and lasted forever even compared to the PN18 which is one of the most robust strings available in my opinion . <p> i put these beauty strings on my prince airstick 130 . the buddy doing the tension said 28 lbs and 32 for the cross due to the nature of the power ring type racket . <p> i played w/ it yesterday all day and really liked it . for a sluggish performance ( my head and feet just werent in the game ) i felt like the strings were : <p> 1 . a bit on the heavy sidemade for a more powerful ball and better length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to put decent cuts on the ball for drops 3. they 're sexyflashy and fun and lots of compliments 4. durableso far so good.they withstood some good power shots <p> Rod just a thought might want to go the other way if you are going to vary tensions to allow the racquet to work with te string for even more power and better control . The mains actually when striking the ball pull the head rounder allowing the sides and crosses to control how much giving the racquet its sweet spot . If you increase the cross tension the racquets sweet spot becomes smaller so less control or less predictable . For more consistency try your 28 for the mains and 27 for the crosses if you want to change it up . Once a racquet is strung the mains become almost 25% greater tension than the crosses if tensioned at the same tension so your 28 will become 33-34 mains 28-29 crosses . Since the mains are so long the tension they put on the frame hitting a ball is about the same as the crosses even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even longer just wrapped around their bridge . Enjoy the game ! <p> I have not heard this theory of mains increasing 25% . By that calculation , racket strung at 28lbs ( typical ) the mains would increase to 35lbs . And that tension can only come from the cross strings so those have to decrease to 21lbs . That does not seem plausible nor is that my experience . <p> Try it string a racquet at whatever you string at and you will find the mains will be considerably higher than what you started with and the crosses about a lb higher than you set to tension at . So 28 will be around 35 for the mains the crosses about 1 lb higher 29 . Its not a theory it is actually what happens . <p> JB , I guess you use something like the Tourna Stringmeter to measure the tension of the mains and crosses in a full stringbed ? <p> When you 've put in all the mains , the head of the racket will be measurably deformed : the tension on the mains will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of this , the middle 2-4 mains will feel noticeably more loose compared to the moment you pulled tension on them . The deformation of the racket head will be equalized when all crosses are put in , so that will not be the reason for this increased tension . It actually is the weaving of the crosses that will " pull " the mains to a higher tension . The result is a stringbed with a certain stiffness . In the end it all comes down to personal preference of feel and comfort = <p> While typing this comment , I bumped into this article . Interesting view on tension of mains and crossing , specially for poly strings . Guess its time for some more testing = <p> Tjeerd you are exactly correct . It has been very interesting to try different tensions but learning also that the different frames make as much a difference as the the string and tension . Since finding this out I have stayed with 3 of the same frame to try to prove out different combinations to see if one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far 305 at 21-23 has been very interesting in a Harrow Vibe , very different and right now I enjoy it better at those tensions than the usual 28 everyone seems to recommend . Great feel and seems to give me much more control to place the ball seems the ball seems to stay on the racquet to place it if that makes sense . Higher tensions it seems to just jump off the strings . Let me know what you find out . The article you ran across did n't  come up if you have the link that would be great , interested to see what it says . Enjoy the game ! <p> I agree , and since trying a lower tension on my Beast 750 I enjoy the feel of the ball on the strings . I feel more control given the ball is in contact with the strings longer , and I am getting more power . <p> Next I will try stringing at 24 mains and 26-27 crosses with various string . <p> Interesting to note a player with great feel , Shabanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather low at 23/24 IIRC . <p> One might be able to to quick cuts at the ball with higher tension , but I feel strongly about the lower tensions right now . <p> I cant believe Selby is using Ashaway 18 Ultranick at 29 ! To each his own <p> Hey Rod , I use my harrow for practice , I play my matches with Prince Pro Beast 750 , my Prince just got strung in ZX , I 've had Tecnifibre 305 green 1.2 , Power nick 18 , in my opinion I think Ashaway has brought in a great string into the mix , I had it strung at 28lbs , its bang on for me , I think I 've found my favorite string !

Another benefit in my opinion , dealing with eyelets is that you can replace only one of them without changing a great amount of pieces , and obviously it is so cheap . In the store that I use to buy the Eye products , they have eyelets which you can buy in order to replace them if you have any problem . And finally , if you want an opinion about the racket , is the best racket I-ve ever had and I ever tested , I-m really happy with my choice . <p> Thank You for fast replay . You reassured me that it is a good choice and I ordered it . I also found that eyelets are available in shops in my country ( Poland ) as well . I will post on my experience with the racket in some = <p> Hi Bartek : ) That 's a very good decision ! Eyelets are offered by erakiety.com but to be honest.when your x120ctrl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't  had such experience but there is no squash player without that = <p> Is the same racket with a different colorway . When Borja signed his contract with Eye , he started to play with the x.lite 120 PRO control . This racket has a quite small head size and is a direct response racket , whereas the x.lite 120 control is a touch racket . But right now he has a signature model of the x.lite 120 in red , the Shabanas one , but with a different color . <p> The factory tension for all rackets is around 26-28 lbs and the string is nylon . We contemplated supplying our rackets with X.Tech ( our premium multi-filament string ) but there are several reasons against doing that . The rackets , after production , are often transported through several climates ( humid , dry , hot , cold ) before arriving in the country of sale . It can also be anywhere from 3-12 months ( possibly longer ) before a racket ends up in the hand of a player . For these reasons , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and benefit from a re-string on delivery . The tension will be reduced and become un-even . Several brands use a premium string in the supply of their rackets , however pros/top amateurs will cut the factory ' string out straight away and replace . <p> The factory string in our rackets is not available to purchase and instead we recommend X.Tech . <p> I tend to use the factory string until it goes ( largely because I 'm lazy ) and find , although X.Tech makes a noticeable difference , I still get good response out of the original strings . <p> I just wanted to follow up on my experience with Eye Rackets . After ordering the X.Lite 110 Control and not liking it , I contacted Eye and was given discount for an X.Lite 120 Control . <p> I received the racket last week and weighted it right away with a PU Karakal grip that I put on and factory strings , it comes up to exactly 140 grams ( 20 less than the X.Lite 110 control with the same setup ) . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams , so 120 gram naked frame sounds exactly right . <p> Moving on the playing with it , I have to say , this is BY FAR the best racket that I 've ever played with . My confidence has just skyrocketed . Deception has improved by far because the racket is so light that you can hold the ball until the last second and send it anywhere on the court . My short game always much improved as I feel that the racket has a lot of feel , despite being so light . I feel 100% confident to drop from anywhere . I really like the factory Eye string . Normally , I restring all of my rackets immediately with 18 gauge TF 305 , but I think that I 'll leave this one on for a while . Lastly , due to the thin head profile and lack of bumper guard , I find it much easier to scrape balls that are just glued to the wall . <p> I 'm very happy with the purchase and will be ordering another one to have as backup when the strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the durability . I will post an update here if anything catastrophic happens in the near future . <p> I 'm playing since march so its still to short to judge but for this moment everything is ok . I have hit the walls many times and nothing happens . I 'm still using original strings but they might need changing soon . As far for the grip it needs to be replaced ASAP = <p> Hi Pierre , Theres a lot of really good stuff on your website . I need to point out a couple of things about your review of the eye lite 120 control and power rackets . You called the frame a classic closed throat design , its not closed , its open . Joey describes it correctly in his video , I 'm sure that was a slip of the tongue . More importantly , the power version in your video review has been strung incorrectly with the bottom 2 cross strings missing altogether . This would greatly effect the performance of the racket and probably shift the position of the sweet spot noticeably . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as designed ) around the entire hoop , this would be likely to upset the characteristics of the frame to some extent . I think this really invalidates this particular review . It would be interesting to see the outcome of your review with the power version set up correctly , to see if you like it any better , it did n't  really have a chance this time round ! <p> Hi Pierre , the open or closed throat debate is a common one . Having been a player for over 40 years , I started on wooden rackets like the maxply and grays light blue etc. they all had a long shaft and small round head ! The first big change came when some rackets were made where the shaft split a few inches before the head " opening " up the throat , creating the now familiar open throat triangle formed by the shaft splitting at the yoke and the bridge which holds the centre mains at the throat . These rackets were called open throat rackets . I think its simple , as there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more formally the USRSA/ ERSA Stringers Digest has a diagram of a racket in the first few pages that clearly states this type of racket is open throat . All certified stringers and Master Racquet Technicians have been examined on the contents of the digest for about the last 25 or more years . That s enough for me to be convinced ! You can get teardrop shape rackets with both open and closed throats eg , TF carboflex is closed , Prince powering rackets are open what do you reckon ? Cheers Nick . <p> Thanks for weighing those Pierre . I was also expecting around 135 myself . <p> I contacted Eye and while they do n't  admit to any issues with the racket , they are willing to send me a 120 X.Lite Control at a big discount , claiming that I should be happier with it and that the 110 version is not as popular . I will report back when I get it . <p> Regardless , I would love to hear from someone else that is using the 110 to find out if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple factors you need to consider . Not all companys state the weight of the racket strung , most give the unstrung weight , so right there the 110 jumps to 125 atleast . Plus you need to factor in the weight of the grip which is probably another 15 grams . That makes 140 .. Now the last 7 grams I could n't tell you : &gt; The only company I know that shows the actual weight strung of the racket is Harrow . <p> I just weighed the X lite 110 Pro Power ( I string rackets for my clubmates , and so have a mix of rackets in house from time to time ) It weighs 140grams on my digital kitchen weight . Both my X lite 120 control weighs 148grams , but that includes a thin overgrip . <p> Jostein any chance you or anyone else weighted any more 110s . I am very interested in trying a xlite pro control 110 but need to know it is indeed lighter then the 120s as I have used my son in laws 120 and it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighter racket . I weighted his at 142 g with a PU grip and Dnamx 1.15 18 g string . My Harrow is 132 g with the same set up . 132 is more my liking even balance . Enjoy the game ! <p> I can agree with you Jason . i bought the X Lite 110 Power about 2 months ago , factory strings broke within a month ( playing 3-4 times a week ) , which I replaced with my usual Ashaway Supernick XL Ti string ( thinking ) " its ok , its a 17 guage string so should be fine " even if its a more coarse string 4 weeks later and the centre main string was ripped to shreads and all others intact with little wear . I have now replaced with a more durable monofilament so I will have to see how long it lasts ( 2 weeks in and I can see a tiny bit of notching ! ) . I suspect less tension might be the answer if these break in the next few weeks ( but worried how it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great racket to play with ( very light , and manouvreable ) and I 'm really pleased with it . I too was concerned about the durability of the frame , but having scuffed it a few times against the side walls , its holding up very well indeed , I am pleasently surprised ! Well done Eye ! <p> Hi guys . With a more open string pattern like the power version , there will be more movement in the string compared to the tighter control pattern . More movement means more friction and friction is the main reason that strings break . If you try a lower tension , that will increase the string movement further . You could try a higher tension to reduce movement , or consider a thicker guage string at the same tension . The thicker guage ( in the same string ) will be a little less elastic than the thinner guage , move less and reduce the friction slightly . It should last longer . Its sod s law , of course , that what you gain in durability , will be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has stood the test of time , but it has a braided coat that would exagerate the friction when the strings move . The newer ultranick and powernick from ashaway have zyex in them which beefs up there durability considerably . I would try the powernick 18 . Eye s own xtech string is good too , a pu multifilament , completely different , but comes in three guages , worth a bit of experimenting to find a good combination . Maybe ? <p> The problem with these rackets is that the grommets break off really easily because there 's no bumper guard that 's holding them in place , but instead they are all individually inserted . And their " power " model is awful in my opinion , you need atleast 14 main strings , any less and the feel is really bad on the racket in my opinion . Otherwise the 120 control is a pretty good racket . <p> I have to agree with Jason on the durability of the eyelets . I had a few breaking after two weeks of use . Apart from that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame is my only concern leftonly time will tell . <p> On both my Eye x lite 120 pro power some eyelets broke off easily . I have seen this more often on the " power " series of rackets , I guess the open string pattern increases strain on each " grommet " I have seen the same thing happen to some Prince airsticks , even with a more dense string pattern . <p> The good news is that the newer rackets from Eye is said to come with eyelets in a softer less breakable material . Those Eyelets can also be bought separately from Eye/UK according to their website . In my experience Eye rackets holds great customer service . <p> Nice ! Very thorough review Pierre . I am using the new Dunlop Elite GTX this season strung with 18g 305 green . I like the extra power i get from the patter as apposed to the ultimate still get tons of feel and control . How would you compare the new Elite to either of these two racquets since i 'm a fan of this shape of racquet with a head light balance .

I feel as if my lunges both forwards and backwards are quicker and more on balance . Lateral movement is a joy , as they seem to have cut down completely on the twisted ankles of before .
