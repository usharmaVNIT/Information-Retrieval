You had cool images , snazzy animations , and the data speaks for itself , right ? Apparently not , since minutes later most of the attendees were reaching for their mobile devices and checking email . <p> It 's them , not you right ? Well , sort of . <p> We often forget that we all learn and process data differently . <p> If you want your employees to benefit from your meetings , you need to ensure your content and delivery appeals to each different learning style . A graphical presentation may work for one employee , but it might not work for the rest . <p> Here are some ways to tailor content for your next meetings to appeal to different learning styles : <p> Visual : Because this person learns best by seeing things , you need to include sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider including flowcharts , videos , and infographics . <p> Aural : Do n't overload the slides with text . Instead have separate notes that speak on what is on the slide . Allow attendees to record the presentation as well . Also , aural learners may be sensitive to outside noise , so be respectful as to where the meeting takes place . <p> Read/Write : These learners prefer to take in information displayed as words , so include text-based materials . Encourage this group to take notes and also allow them to describe things in their own words . This will help them solidify the information presented . <p> Kinesthetic : This group despises traditional meetings where they have to sit around and listen . Engage this group with active participation . This could be a role playing scenario or a group exercise . Also , consider bringing in a prop for them to hold onto : Silly Putty , Slinkies , or even a stress-ball . <p> Being aware of other 's learning styles can also help avoid misunderstandings , such as an uninformed visual learner complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't making eye contact . <p> It took me a long while to understand that I was a kinesthetic learner . I knew I was a poor listener , but I did n't really know why . Meetings are always a struggle , as are long emails and links to lengthy articles . It 's not that I do n't care , but focusing on four pages of content feels like I 'm reading Tolstoy . <p> Determining employee learning styles does n't have to be a complicated . Look closely , and you will see clues as to which tactics engage which colleagues . Then strive to present new ideas in those ways . Because in a time where more decisions are made with less context and information , we can not afford to waste any more employee time .

I spoke with Dustin Joost , Head of Sales and Marketing at YourCause " an employee engagement platform . Noticing the similarities in our mission , we spent some time talking about what employee engagement is , and why its challenging and the kind of great things that result when it works . <p> Lavoy : What does YourCause do ? <p> Joost : YourCause is a technology company that helps other companies do good . <p> We do that by providing a platform where our clients can engage their employees in giving , volunteering and sustainability initiatives . It 's a community where employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give to charities via credit card , payroll deductions . <p> Lavoy : Why did you need an intranet ? <p> Joost : Growth and communication . Even when we were a company of 25 , every team had a different way to communicate , and that meant there was no global communication . For a company to succeed , there needs to be a marriage between that task-focused , detailed team collaboration and the more global and inclusive communication that makes an organization work effectively as a whole and feel like a place you belong . <p> Really to be honest , we 're growing so fast , that it got hard to keep track of everybody . <p> Every week we have 3 to 4 new people coming to the office , and so Jostle allows us to just look at the profile pictures of those people , and see their contact information , understand what role they play in the company . But also understand what knowledge they bring to the company through the skills Cloud and their ability for them to link that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Joost : The search process for an intranet was pretty painful . There 's got to be 1200+ intranet tools out there . We had our list of hard requirements and we had our list of soft requirements . The hard list was pretty basic : document sharing , some type of news posting service , and collaboration . Then we had our soft requirements . <p> We wanted the software to somehow reflect our personality and core values as a company : partnership , customer service , flexibility and fun . Fun was a really important one for the intranet . A lot of the intranet tools that I looked at were similar to Wiki 's . There was a lot of architecting that you would have to do during implementation . You had to construct all of your Wikis , you had to define permissions and the UI just was n't fun . It was n't pretty , it was n't something that I saw our team members coming on to every day and getting excited about using . <p> The truth is we did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Jostle , I knew that 's exactly what wanted . It had all the hard requirements , the documents , the libraries , the discussions , but then it also had the soft requirements including the ability to get the champions we already had on the team engaged as contributors . That gave them ownership and responsibility . And they spread their excitement to the team . <p> Lavoy : How 'd it work out from a tech perspective ? <p> Joost : From a technology perspective , Jostle made it really easy . Being a Software as a Service based company , which we are ourselves , we understand that SaaS software is inherently easy to implement - but Jostle takes a really interesting approach with it . You 're assigned an implementation manager who can walk you through all the technical specifics , which are very minimal . <p> It 's an online tool so there 's no need to download any type of software . It was really no system requirements that you need to run through . They make you feel good about security as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , our tech team was pretty excited about how easy it was going to be to get Jostle set up . <p> Lavoy : Have you seen any impact from a business perspective ? <p> Joost : We 're a technology company - we 're always developing new software and it 's very hard to keep everybody on the loop on what new features or bug fixes are coming out . <p> We do biweekly code pushes , which means every two weeks , there 's something new in the platform . <p> Prior to Jostle , our way to communicate out those production code pushes was primarily through email . <p> The challenge with that is it gets lost in your inbox , and if anybody actually has a conversation about those code pushes , they either do n't hit reply all or it 's just a very siloed conversation . <p> With Jostle , we do a new NEWS story every time we have a code push , and then the comment section allows people to talk about what 's going on in that code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happening , but our account managers , client services and our sales and marketing team are all on the same page when it comes to what we 're actually pushing out as a company . <p> Every time we have a little win or we do something that we want to celebrate , we would run out of our room , celebrate with the whole company . <p> But , if somebody was n't there that day , they do n't really get the news of what we actually accomplish . We have a lot of small wins that we like to celebrate like submitting an art piece or getting shortlisted with a prospect and a lot of that is n't something we want to go run around the whole company and celebrate , but Jostle gave us a place to share it and feel good . <p> Lavoy : What 's your personal perspective on your new intranet ? <p> Joost : On a personal note , I think Jostle is just fun . If you look at our Jostle community home page , I 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what we 're doing from a client services or account management or even sales and marketing perspective , but then , the other 50% is celebrating what we 're doing on a personal level . The other day , we did a big company-wide poll on what color Kirsten , who 's one of our account manager , should dye her hair . <p> We did a big Jostle news story for everybody to share all their Halloween pictures , so it 's really helped engage our remote employees that we ca n't just talk to every Monday morning in the office and talk about what they did , but it gives them a place to collaborate and feel like they 're part of the culture as well . <p> Lavoy : I understand you approached your Jostle Intranet rollout as a way for you to understand your own customers better . <p> Joost : We wanted to see what our clients go through when they roll out a new tool , because we want to develop best practices for them . I mean we have a great piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers be even more successful with it . So we rolled it out thinking about it from a client point of view . What does it really take to roll out new software , and get people engaged with it ? <p> Jostle gives us a place for us to keep the entire company in the loop on what we do here in sales and marketing . It really let 's us celebrate the small wins . Every time we respond to an RFP , yeah we did n't win the business yet , but it gives us a chancec to say , " We worked pretty hard on this RFP .

@@58956320 @7956320/ <p> But what makes a culture ? Each culture is unique and myriad factors go into creating one , but I 've observed at least six common components of great cultures . Isolating those elements can be the first step to building a differentiated culture and a lasting organization . <p> 1 . Vision : A great culture starts with a vision or mission statement . These simple turns of phrase guide a company 's values and provide it with purpose . That purpose , in turn , orients every decision employees make . When they are deeply authentic and prominently displayed , good vision statements can even help orient customers , suppliers , and other stakeholders . Nonprofits often excel at having compelling , simple vision statements . The Alzheimer 's Association , for example , is dedicated to " a world without Alzheimer 's . " And Oxfam envisions " a just world without poverty . " A vision statement is a simple but foundational element of culture . <p> 2 . Values : A company 's values are the core of its culture . While a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of guidelines on the behaviors and mindsets needed to achieve that vision . McKinsey &amp; Company , for example , has a clearly articulated set of values that are prominently communicated to all employees and involve the way that firm vows to serve clients , treat colleagues , and uphold professional standards . Google 's values might be best articulated by their famous phrase , " Do n't be evil . " But they are also enshrined in their " ten things we know to be true . " And while many companies find their values revolve around a few simple topics ( employees , clients , professionalism , etc. ) , the originality of those values is less important than their authenticity . <p> 3 . Practices : Of course , values are of little importance unless they are enshrined in a company 's practices . If an organization professes , " people are our greatest asset , " it should also be ready to invest in people in visible ways . Wegman 's , for example , heralds values like " caring " and " respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And it follows through in its company practices , ranked by Fortune as the fifth best company to work for . Similarly , if an organization values " flat " hierarchy , it must encourage more junior team members to dissent in discussions without fear or negative repercussions . And whatever an organization 's values , they must be reinforced in review criteria and promotion policies , and baked into the operating principles of daily life in the firm . <p> 4 . People : No company can build a coherent culture without people who either share its core values or possess the willingness and ability to embrace those values . That 's why the greatest firms in the world also have some of the most stringent recruiting policies . According to Charles Ellis , as noted in a recent review of his book What it Takes : Seven Secrets of Success from the World 's Greatest Professional Firms , the best firms are " fanatical about recruiting new employees who are not just the most talented but also the best suited to a particular corporate culture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each candidate . And as an added benefit , Steven Hunt notes at Monster.com that one study found applicants who were a cultural fit would accept a 7% lower salary , and departments with cultural alignment had 30% less turnover . People stick with cultures they like , and bringing on the right " culture carriers " reinforces the culture an organization already has . <p> 5 . Narrative:Marshall Ganz was once a key part of Caesar Chavez 's United Farm Workers movement and helped structure the organizing platform for Barack Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign . Now a professor at Harvard , one of Ganz 's core areas of research and teaching is the powerof narrative . Any organization has a unique history " a unique story . And the ability to unearth that history and craft it into a narrative is a core element of culture creation . The elements of that narrative can be formal " like Coca-Cola , which dedicated an enormous resource to celebrating its heritage and even has a World of Coke museum in Atlanta " or informal , like those stories about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriented culture at Apple . But they are more powerful when identified , shaped , and retold as a part of a firm 's ongoing culture . <p> 6 . Place : Why does Pixar have a huge open atrium engineering an environment where firm members run into each other throughout the day and interact in informal , unplanned ways ? Why does Mayor Michael Bloomberg prefer his staff sit in a " bullpen " environment , rather than one of separate offices with soundproof doors ? And why do tech firms cluster in Silicon Valley and financial firms cluster in London and New York ? There are obviously numerous answers to each of these questions , but one clear answer is that place shapes culture . Open architecture is more conducive to certain office behaviors , like collaboration . Certain cities and countries have local cultures that may reinforce or contradict the culture a firm is trying to create . Place " whether geography , architecture , or aesthetic design " impacts the values and behaviors of people in a workplace . <p> There are other factors that influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation for shaping a new organization 's culture . And identifying and understanding them more fully in an existing organization can be the first step to revitalizing or reshaping culture in a company looking for change .

So this article by John Jantsch on the foundations of corporate culture resonated with us . John is a marketing consultant , speaker and the founder of the Duct Tape Marketing Consultant Network . You can find his full blog here . <p> <p> The idea of culture is a hot topic in business these days , but the actual concept of culture can be tough to pinpoint or define . However , like so many things that are hard to describe , you know it when you see it . <p> Many small businesses do n't give the idea of culture much thought , particularly early on , but every business has a culture . It may be strong or weak , positive or negative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a form of internal brand in a way . It 's the collective impression , habits , language , style , communication and practices of the organization . <p> A healthy and vibrant culture is what attracts and keeps people that are committed to what a business stands for and it 's what ultimately attracts and keeps customers and fosters a strong external community . <p> My belief is that a healthy culture is a shared culture , one created through shared stories , beliefs , purpose , plans , language , outcomes and ownership . These are n't little things ; these are n't things that you get right during an annual retreat . These are things molded over time with trust and passion and caring . These are things that evolve because you work very hard at finding them , holding them and making them important . <p> The following seven elements make up the foundation of a healthy business culture . <p> 1 . Archived stories <p> The first step is to begin to develop , archive , curate and tell stories that illustrate what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you do , who you it for , why you 're passionate about it , and where the business is headed . <p> Throughout time , great leaders have used stories to inspire commitment and attract community . The central elements of a strong culture are the stories that employees tell themselves and each other . The ' why you would want to work here ' story , the orientation story , the ' here 's how we deal with challenges ' story , the ' here 's where we are headed ' story . <p> These illustrations are like oral traditions that allow culture to sustain , thrive and grow , and it 's the job of the leader of the business to make story-building an intentional act . <p> 2 . Active beliefs <p> People want to work for more than a paycheck . Sure , they want to be paid fairly and in some cases the element of salary will be an important aspect of their decision to come to work for an organization , but perhaps more importantly , people want to work on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people who share their passion and beliefs . <p> This is n't the same thing as saying that everyone in your organization has to maintain the same beliefs . However , by creating a set of core beliefs that everyone in the organization lives by and supports , you create a set of filters for how decisions are made , how people treat each other , how they treat customers , what 's expected , how to manage and even how to write a sales letter . <p> 3 . Demonstrated purpose <p> In order to bring purpose into the organization you must determine a way to bring it to life and reinforce in every decision the organization makes . <p> This may take the form of an employee development program , foundation support , benefit package or community program . The key is to bring purpose to life by example . Your actions , or how you treat your staff , will speak far louder about purpose than any page in an employee manual . In order to create a shared purpose the staff must be your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most productive cultures come to life when people know what to do and how to do it " in places where they are trusted to do good work and use their creativity to solve problems . <p> If you want to grow your organization to the point where it can serve a higher purpose , you 'll need to develop a system that enables people to manage themselves . The key lies in systematic planning , thinking , clear accountability and consistent communication . <p> 5 . Mentored leadership <p> While stories are an important way to attract and inspire people to join you on your journey , they can only take you as far as the leaders you develop . <p> After payroll is made and your business is generating sufficient cash flow , I believe that the leader 's primary role should shift to developing leaders internally . In fact , as the owner of a business you 'll never succeed in reaching beyond where you are today until you are no longer the person that brings in the most work . <p> Teaching others to land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared beliefs , to inspire and attract commitment means you have to invest time and resources in this very thing in a very intentional way . <p> 6 . Measured accountability <p> One of the strongest ways to foster commitment is to get people to commit to a stake in the outcome of their work . The only way I know to do this is to establish benchmarks , goals and indicators and then report and communicate progress religiously . You must create reporting mechanisms that truly measure the most important components of your business . This will include key financial elements , but must strive to go far into measuring success around shared beliefs and culture . <p> 7 . Real ownership <p> The ultimate measure of commitment is achieved when people that work for your organization come to understand that they play a crucial role in creating the kind of company they want to work for " that the company is actually their most important product . <p> This wo n't happen until you help employees free themselves from the typical job descriptions and organizational charts so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they are excited about the journey they are on . It wo n't happen until they fully understand how a dollar spent on a new desk equates to profit margin . It wo n't happen until they start thinking like an owner when it comes to meeting a customer 's needs . It wo n't happen until everyone realizes they can help develop new business , build the community , create innovation , fix problems , right wrongs and make decisions that impact the organization on their own .

@@58956360 @7956360/ <h> About Dave Aron <p> An effective team is a powerful thing . Many of us have participated on teams where the members complement each other , trust each other and find ways of working that are not only effective , but also enjoyable . For teams like this , performance is typically much higher than might be expected of the sum of individuals . <p> And yet while teams often are where the real work gets done , most businesses do n't value or manage them well . Many businesses are n't skilled in talent management or team nurturing . Team management , in particular , is often a scarcely recognized activity . <p> What 's more , most employees do n't work in high-performing teams for long periods " team members move on , projects finish , and other pressing needs come to the fore . While it 's part of the normal course for organizations , disbanding well-functioning teams is actually a value-destroying activity , eradicating the " team capital " built and stored in the team . Because businesses do n't fundamentally recognize such teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value destruction seems inevitable . <p> But what if there was another way ? One in which organizations capitalize on the inherent value of a well-functioning team ? One where the organization evolves its management style to let teams self-manage to preserve their culture and value ? <p> A New Kind of Team : Clusters <p> Clusters are a radical alternative to our traditional notion of teams . They are formed outside a company context , but are hired and paid by companies as a unit , as a permanent part of the company . They manage , govern and develop themselves ; define their own working practices and tools ; and share out remuneration . Technology trends and tools like the cloud , and collaboration suites , are evolving to make this more and more workable . <p> The business or agency treats the cluster as an atomic unit of resource and it hires , fires and positions the cluster as a unit . Likewise , each cluster appears as such a unit in the business 's organization chart . Clusters plug together like Lego bricks to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as a consulting model . The main difference is that clusters will typically be hired permanently by a business with a mutual intention to commit for the long term . As such , a cluster can be considered a real asset of the business , just as high-performing staff members are today . Also , the cluster model puts extreme emphasis on teams that learn how to work well together and determine their own tools and work practices . This is not always true of consultancies . An individual can be in different clusters over time , and possibly in multiple clusters at once , similar to a conventional part-time work model . Similar approaches can and should be applied to consultancy models . <p> Clusters Manage Themselves <p> A cluster typically consists of five to eight people , is hired by a business with a clear scope of work , and remunerated based on outcomes . Clusters have already established shared values , work practices , tools , and roles , such as who is good at what . Balancing team roles can be particularly important to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her idea to dominate and the team is unable to come to a consensus . Clusters actively seek the variety of skills , talents , and personalities necessary to create a high performing team ( see the Belbin model for a good example of nine discrete team roles . ) <p> While there are close equivalents of clusters in a few corners of the working world ( elite military teams , medical units , and TV and film crews ) , this model could and should pervade much further into the working world , possibly and ultimately for all operational and project work , and sometimes even for leadership teams . I would project that by 2020 , 30% of work will be performed by permanently employed , self-managed clusters . <p> The cluster manages itself by finding , hiring and firing members ; governing itself and resolving conflicts ; creating and sustaining work practices and tools ; and managing its engagement with other clusters , teams , people and organizations in order to fulfill its direct business goals and to nurture itself . <p> In short , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is extreme because the enterprise only has a formal legal and financial relationship with the cluster , not its members . Note that while a cluster is self-managed , it is not typically a self-directed team . Self-directed teams define their own goals , whereas clusters agree on outcomes with the businesses for which they work . <p> Clusters Create More Value <p> Clusters offer four main benefits : <p> Higher levels of business performance through higher motivation . The cluster model , when executed well , addresses known performance drivers such as purpose , autonomy , and mastery ( see Daniel Pink 's book Drive for more on these ) . <p> Higher levels of business performance through a custom work environment . Clusters can create and sustain leading-edge electronic work environments since they are less burdened by bureaucratic decision-making and the need to serve the diverse needs of many types of teams and individuals . <p> Talent management in the right place . The cluster model removes the burden of team and individual performance management from the business " where it typically sits uncomfortably and ineffectually today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , contributions and development needs much better . <p> Higher levels of personal happiness . Clusters are sufficiently small for members to genuinely know and care about each other , and they are stable and autonomous enough for members to support each other 's long-term personal development . <p> Clusters Have Risks , But They Are Manageable <p> For the cluster model to work well , with businesses hiring , firing , positioning and remunerating clusters as atomic units , considerable changes are needed in the macro work environment , to HR and payroll , recruitment agencies , legal , financial , and real estate . Even if these macro changes are made , there are two main real and perceived risks with the cluster model : the formation of mini silos , and the inability to retain clusters or their loyalty . The key to success is to ensure that the cluster 's agreed-on scope of work includes appropriate levels of commitment to , and multiple interfaces with , broader corporate goals and initiatives . <p> Eventually , wherever the cluster model is adopted , businesses will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as they have always done for their emerging talent assets " ensuring that the best are motivated to stay , the worst are inclined to go , and those in the middle are motivated to improve . <p> About the Author <p> Dave Aron is a vice president and Gartner Fellow in the Gartner CIO Research group , focusing on IT leadership issues .

@@58956370 @7956370/ <h> About Julian Hall <p> Let 's be clear about something . The boss is the boss . It is a position of power . Whether they are the manager of a department , head of a unit or the owner of the business they have positional power . That is a view most people subscribe to . To put it more simply they have influence . In reality , however , in this ever changing and volatile world the true power to deliver productivity , sales , growth and efficiency is not with them . It is with the followers of the leader . The workers . The leader however , has huge influence over one key area of the business , its culture . <p> The culture of the business will be determined more by the actions of the leader than by the smart words and mission statements they may have on their walls . I was always interested in the incongruence of a business I worked with that had a mission statement that included the sentence Our people are the greatest asset we have ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energy and capital in improving their factory than they ever did on improving their workforce . This was just one symptom of a wider issue the leader had with communicating and engaging with the workforce i.e. the followers who can do more to influence efficiency than the leader . <p> This is the same effect as saying my door is always open ' and then retreating into my office closing the door and remaining unapproachable for ever more . <p> A lot is written about company cultures . They are named , modelled , plotted and changed ( sometimes they change ) . My area of expertise how communication affects culture and honesty in the workplace and how this affects a business ' ability to solve problems . What interests me especially is the effect these have on business efficiency and why leaders put up with them . <p> In communication terms there are simply four cultures that grow in organisations and they are all the product of the boss . <p> Passive : Shrinking violets This is the culture where the employees behave passively towards everything that management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings or their opinions and actually appear not to have an opinion . It is most likely to be found in smaller , owner managed businesses where the boss has a clear almost fanatical vision of what he wants to achieve and how . The staff they employ are simply the tools to achieve the results and the boss requires no input from them . In fact input is actively discouraged and not offered . The staff do n't appear to mind . <p> Passive Aggressive : Sulking This is often mistaken for a passive culture . In reality there is a seething mass of aggression that the individuals and the collective are afraid to express . This leads to classic passive aggressive behaviours such as use of sarcasm to make points , scoring points against each other and bitchiness ' . It becomes highly politicised because there is an unwritten code of behaviour to work out and the rules of the jungle communication exists ( the rules are , there are no rules ) . Sulking or withholding communication or support for projects is rife and efficiency is dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever petty conflict is at the forefront of the person or the workplace . <p> Aggressive : Shouting Some prefer this because they see it as at least it 's honest and out in the open ' . The reality of it is , unless it is considered acceptable and everyone ( absolutely everyone ) signs up to it , aggressive behaviour has an impact upon others , and has consequences . An aggressive culture where it 's perfectly acceptable to blow up , shout at each other and act out anger in the workplace is quite rare . It 's rare because those that are aggressive rarely want others to be aggressive back to them . They want their aggression to influence people . Examples of these cultures may be found in the male dominated teams on the trading floors of the investment banks and we all know what those cultures have cost us . <p> Assertive Culture : Sharing I summarise this as anyone in the company can communicate their feelings honestly , openly and respectfully to anyone else . Importantly whilst this level of honesty is wholesomely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is simply to be heard . Communication where there is an expectancy that others will change and do as you wish is not assertive . It 's aggressive . This is the culture that we should , in my opinion , aspire to . It is the most challenging to cultivate and maintain . It requires bravery , honesty and integrity . The rewards , however , are great . Imagine an organisation where conflicts were resolved honestly and openly with respect . Where problems were dealt with and everyone moved on . No more seething and plotting . No more fear of aggressive responses . No more not contributing because no one will listen anyway ' . This is real employee engagement . So why is it that the least common culture I come across is the assertive ? There is a whole host of reasons . One is that from an employee point of view it is often easier to avoid responsibility and instead take the victim or martyr position and moan . We ca n't expect assertive communication and respect without role modelling it ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may perceive comes from genuine discourse , debate and allowing others their say . Stress is a huge factor in poor communications and people under stress drop the respectful part of communication thinking it wo n't matter this one time . The problem is one time becomes two , becomes a habit and before you know it we are taking offence and in conflict . There will be many more reasons why these cultures grow . I will leave you with one more . Passion . Too many people mistake passion for an excuse to railroad people . True passion inspires . It does not leave you feeling like you have been trampled upon by a screaming , unruly , rioting mob . <p> Am I advocating no conflict in the workplace ? Absolutely not ! In fact I feel that challenge to ideas , to the way we do things and behaviours and attitudes should be encouraged to the point of provocation . In other words the boss should be encouraging conflict . Conflict , that is , in a healthy assertive way . An assertive culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact it is open about conflict . It encourages it and does not sweep it under the carpet and pretend it 's not there . An assertive culture takes all the benefits of disagreement and conflict and makes the best of them . <p> If the strategic direction of the business is a big arrow travelling in a given direction then each team member , department or division is a smaller arrow inside the bigger one . If all the smaller arrows are pulling in different directions the larger arrow slows down and stalls . If they are all moving in the same in the same direction I think you know the rest . <p> The point is , healthy , assertive conflict and the culture that promotes speeds up problem solving , decision making and is an essential part of a flexible progressive business .

That 's especially evident inside the workplace , particularly when it comes to technology . While some people see the immediate value of adopting new technology , many do n't . Perhaps it 's the perceived difficulty of implementing a new way of working , or maybe the benefits have n't been clearly articulated . Regardless , it 's important to carefully plan how a new technology is implemented . <p> Here are six tips to help you build more bridges than barriers when you introduce a new technology : <p> Make sure it 's something everyone , not just you , will benefit from . Be diligent and remain objective . Is this something that 'll really benefit your staff , teams , and organization ? Or does it just seem like the right idea to meet your immediate needs ? <p> Give everyone a heads up . Communicate as soon as possible that you 're investigating a new technology and outline the benefits and impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligns with business objectives . Involve key stakeholders early to get buy in and identify problems . <h> Looking to introduce a new intranet ? <p> Engage a champion ( or a few ) . Negativity can spread easily in the workplace . Enlist a few people at all levels to help others understand the benefits of the new technology . Show your champions the clear advantages and intended outcomes of the new solution so that they can easily vocalize and demonstrate their support . Make sure your full senior leadership team is behind the change and will function as champions themselves . <p> Provide engaging launch and training events . No one wants to sit through a boring training session . If it 's done effectively , your participants wo n't even realize they 're learning ( or being asked to change ) . Try a lunch and learn or throw some humor into your presentation , and make your launch a celebration . Do what works best for your people and workplace culture . <p> Consider different learning styles and needs . Whether we 're an auditory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information differently . Tailor your training sessions to all types of learners by providing a range of learning materials and options such as documents , live training , and videos . Be available for one-on-one training for those that require that extra bit of personal help . <p> Make it personal . Nothing builds apathy more than employees not recognizing the personal value of a new tool . Let people know why this matters to them , and how it will impact their day-to-day work . Ensure staff understand how it will help them , not just the company . Make sure your new technology is ready to use and seeded with relevant data for all users . Help them quickly get more value out of the new system than the effort they are investing in it . <p> We 've all experienced challenges while trying to introduce or learn a new technology . Incorporating the tips above , while trying to sympathize with those who struggle with change , will go a long way to successfully implementing your new technology .

How just at a store level how do you coach leadership in terms of recognizing and reinforcing those values and those aspects of your culture on a day-by-day , hour-by-hour basis ? <p> Len : Well to me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Whether it 's at the restaurant level , or corporately within the leadership team here , or with our owner/operators , it really does come down to day-to-day behaviours . Are your behaviours reflecting our values ? <p> A critical piece , too , is when you see behaviour that is not in line with the values , it needs to be addressed ; you talk to the individual about it . There 's a climate where within my leadership peer group , if someone 's having a bad day and does something out of whack , it 's perfectly normal for us to call each other on it - 99.9 per cent of the time they 'll go back and apologize , because sometimes they did n't even realize their action had been interpreted in that way . <p> So , day-to-day behavior is one piece . Focus groups and surveys are another piece , because it 's important to continuously work at your culture . We encourage ongoing training and development , and leadership development , as part of this . <p> Key to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give leadership messages for the extended team , be it at meetings , or conventions , or whatever , often we will refer directly to a particular value . Certainly the inference is always there in terms of what it is that we talked about . <p> Today was a good example , since we had our summer staff barbecue here . There , we rewarded and recognized and celebrated those right behaviours ; we tied these awards in with the results that we were looking for . So at the staff meeting today we gave out awards . I must have been up there for 20 minutes reading the bios of the people who were recognized . We do that at every staff meeting . We do it for all owner/operators at conventions and at business meetings at the end of the year . We do it with our suppliers when we have our Suppliers Summit . <p> Again , you create that environment really consciously , but we also do it because it 's natural for us to celebrate and recognize those people that are really delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the behaviours . <p> The last piece that I would share with you is , and this is important if you 're trying to change our culture , is how you go about driving your culture . You need to start by reflecting back on your organization and you say okay , right from the top , how do I want to define what the culture is ? What does our culture look like today ? What should it look like in the future ? Then map this to the values that define this desired culture and the desired behaviours that will reflect them . Finally , tie it into your performance system . <p> At McDonald 's , people are evaluated on a combination of both their results achieved , because you still have to deliver results , and their behaviours , which we measure . One of the things that we found effective , to help that assessment of the behaviours , was to provide leaders with behaviours that are acceptable . Here are examples of behaviours that we 're looking for , but here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That helped people really start to assess employees a lot more accurately , because you can get so easily influenced by just the results being achieved that you 're not paying attention to , as I said before , the possible collateral damage that may be out there . I think you 've got to tie it back into the performance , because that ties back into their reward , and obviously the financial benefit , as well as the career growth that will follow . <p> Leadership Conversations publishes each Monday and Wednesday in the Jostle Blog .

This is part 2 of a 9 part series . <p> Brad : In Part 1 of this interview , you set down a really good foundation on how McDonald 's uses seven clear values to align employees , owner/operators and suppliers . I guess that really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your culture ? What is culture ? <p> Len : I think culture is simply a reflection of leadership beliefs -- their value system and then the behaviours that reflect that . You 're going to always behave the way you believe . Sooner or later You might be able to mask it for little while , but sooner or later your behaviours are going to reflect what you truly believe . <p> That 's why I think for a healthy culture you need to be so transparent and clear as to what the values are and what the expected behaviors are . Otherwise you run that risk of getting results with some pretty significant collateral damage potentially , or you 've created an environment where it 's results at any cost . <p> As a leader , you 've got to really start at the top and say okay , what do I envision my company looking like and how do I want my employees to interact ? When you 're small it 's easy because you have the direct contact and your own behaviours will reflect the culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at that point -- your behaviors are going to reflect what it is that you believe and what the values are . <p> As you grow and expand , how do you now translate that ? In Canada , for example , across to 80,000 employees , I ca n't be in every store . Our president , John Betts , ca n't be in every restaurant to talk to the staff . So that 's where you need to deploy your values down into the organization . To say here are the values , here are the expectations in terms of the behaviors . If an individual 's behaviours do n't reflect those values , it does n't matter what your results are , you 're not going to grow to the degree that you want to within the company . <p> Brad : That makes sense .

This is part 1 of a 9 part series . <p> Brad : A big part about what Jostle does is driving culture and enabling employees . It sounds like we 've got a lot of common ground here . McDonald 's is amazing I 'm totally impressed with your National Hiring Day . Wow ! In a single day you really hired 6000 new employees in Canada ? <p> Len : Yes we did . <p> Brad : Deploying , I 'm not sure that 's the correct term , the McDonald 's culture across this never-ending wave of new employees must be a huge challenge . You have to nurture a consistent culture across 1400 different locations , correct ? <p> Len : Yes . <p> Brad : How do you make the cultural part of that happen ? The part around task-based training seems pretty straight forward , but how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees happen ? <p> Len : We use a very consistent approach , and not just for employees . Whether it 's the crew person at the front counter , in our boardroom , or in terms of how we interact with our store operators or with our suppliers . We look at our company as a three-legged stool : our owner/operators are one leg of the stool , our suppliers another and the corporation itself is the third . When you have three-legged stool you ca n't have one leg shorter than the other , or one leg not as important as the other , because it 's going to fall over . <p> This is kind of unique . We hear consistently from our suppliers that they feel very engaged with the business . They feel almost a part of who we are as a culture . Our relationship with store operators is very collaborative and a key part of our extended culture . <p> There are a number of things that we do to really make sure , from a cultural point of view , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alignment there . There 's a lot of communication , a lot of teamwork , and a lot of involvement . <p> I think if you were to ask our suppliers , and certainly our operators even more so , that it really does come across more as a partnership . It 's working together and collaborating together to come up with what the best solution is because we all come at it from very different ways . As a result of that , there is a real energy that gets created around it . Certainly , from a three-legged stool perspective , that happens . <p> If you take the next step , and ask what drives that kind of philosophy , what you 're looking at is really a reflection of what our values are as a company . It is the value piece that drives the behaviors and drives the whole underlying culture that exists at McDonald 's . <p> We educate ourselves . We educate the operators . We educate our suppliers and we certainly educate all new staff coming in that there are seven values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . It impresses me how big we are , yet we 've got that real consistent message that 's simple and everybody can understand . To me , this all about our focus on the seven values that underlie our culture , and the behaviours that reflect these values . <p> To keep it really simple , in terms of a crew person coming in , the number one value , or the first value , is to put the customer at the core of all we do . That makes it really simple to explain to a crew person at the front counter , or in drive through , what the job is . The customer comes first . Make sure that whatever you 're doing with that guest coming in is that you 're taking care of them . If there is something wrong , cold fries or a wrong soft drink , or whatever , just go ahead and replace it , because the customer is the most important priority . <p> The second piece tied in with that , and to me that 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a value . When you look at our two primary vision statements ; the first one being everyone 's favorite way and place to eat and drink . That 's our guest-facing or customer-facing vision . Then for our employees , it 's our employee 's favorite way and place to work . These two vision statements tie back into the values . I mentioned the first two values . There are another five which are : believe in the McDonald 's system , operating the business ethically , giving back to communities , grow the business profitably , and strive to continuously improve . <p> With respect to the employee piece , we spend a lot of time developing this as a global initiative . It 's very interesting because it really ties into what we sort of already knew intuitively here in Canada , but we were able to validate it . We went across the globe and interviewed over 5000 of our crew and asked them why do you work at McDonald 's ? What makes McDonald 's special ? What makes it a great place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had all these 5000 slips of paper and we had to prioritize them into the different themes . It basically came down to three things and that was family/friends , flexibility , and then the third was future . What we recognized from talking to our employees is that they come to us with different expectations . For the first time ever we 're dealing with four different generations in the workforce . So , how do you make sure your employee value proposition really ties in with the four different groups ? What we found was family/friends , that 's pretty consistent , it 's social . <p> People like it and it 's fun . Whether you 're 15 or 70 years old and retiring , it was all about family/friends and just a really great feeling . <p> Flexibility was the second theme . For me , when I started as a McDonald 's crew member , it was about being able to play hockey . The way I wanted to play hockey , I needed a flexible schedule . That 's the only reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a mom let 's say , she wants to see the kids off to school each day and she wants to get back in the workforce . McDonald 's makes it possible for her to do that . For someone coming out of university ; it could be the start of their career . McDonald 's offers them a flexible career path . <p> That ties in obviously with the future theme . I 'm not the only one that started serving customers in a restaurant and progressed to a senior position in the company . I always find it fascinating that here in Canada 50 per cent of our owner/operators started as crew , and have been able to go through and build a corporate career and to do extremely well , and then have moved into the franchisee community and to become very successful entrepreneurs . <p> I think that really speaks to the strength of our culture , the strength of that three-legged stool , the employee value proposition of family/friends , future , and flexibility ; and then certainly those seven core values that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes us a cohesive team . <p> Leadership Conversations publishes each Monday and Wednesday in the Jostle Blog .

Tell us a bit about your organization and what it is trying to accomplish . <p> Kansas City Kansas Community College ( KCKCC ) is a public , urban , and comprehensive community college committed to excellence in higher education . The college was founded in 1923 as part of the Public School System of Kansas City , Kansas . Our mission is to advance the lifelong educational needs of students by providing high-quality , post-secondary , and career-focused educational programs that are academically and financially accessible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our students . <h> 2 . Tell us a bit about you and how you view your role as CIO . <p> I was born in Egypt and ever since I was a teenager , I tinkered with computers . You could say it was my passion and purpose . When my dad gave me a computer for graduating with honors from high school , I felt like I was in heaven . I mastered DOS , Windows and few programming languages such as Pascal , C , C++ , and Assembly to name a few . I used to spend 16 to 18 hours on the computer every day . From that point on , everything fell into place and my world revolved around computing . I was lucky to find what I loved to do early in life . <p> When I became the CIO , I realized that I interact with people more than hardware and software . <p> It was uncharted territory for me and I had to work hard to learn the art of winning friends and influencing people . As a CIO , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative technology units that assist organizations , such as KCKCC , in providing quality services to stakeholders . My greatest satisfaction comes from knowing that I have made a real difference in my organization by helping set a high standard of excellence in achieving organizational objectives through leveraging appropriate systems and technology . <h> 3 . What were the key reasons you started to drive social into your organization ? <p> I think one of the most profound factors that prompted me to explore social media is the social stigma that almost all IT professionals , including CIOs , are introverts and prefer to interact with computers rather than people . I wanted to change that ! I thought that social media would help me hang with the best technology influencers in the world and form new connections with users both inside and outside KCKCC . Like many first-timers , I was unsure what to do to get on the bandwagon of social media . So I decided to establish presence on Twitter and discuss topics of interest , opportunities and challenges , from both individual and professional perspectives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss IT operations and plans . It helps me personally stay current with the latest trends and thinking . It 's very exciting to now see a growing interest and demand for learning and understanding Social Media among later adopters at KCKCC , especially those who directly interact with our students . <h> 4 . How did the arrival of social interplay with your organization 's culture ? <p> I think when social media was first introduced into organizations , no one imagined that such platform could impact the internal structure of an organization . Everyone realized later that its powerful impact can go well beyond businesses and can extend to the political world . It is remarkable what happened in Egypt when an organized movement on a social media network , specifically Facebook , ousted former president Hosni Mubarak after 18 days of public demonstration . Executive leadership and politicians thought of social media only as a mean to communicate to customers and citizens . KCKCC has always been adept in listening to the voice of the communities we serve . What social media brought to KCKCC is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic form one-on-one connection between KCKCC and each individual in the community rather than the community as a whole . <h> 5 . How did you mitigate the change management aspects of introducing social ? <p> Keeping in mind the wide reach that social media has and the uncensored platform it offers to interact with humans across the globe , it is important to be cognizant of the different types of risks it brings for organizations , in general , and academic institutions , in particular . Our experience at KCKCC is not different from that of other organizations that have been compelled to work their way into social media networks . I think for any social media movement to be successful , organizations must define protocols and ground rules for utilizing social media . That is exactly what we did at KCKCC . We created a strong social media policy that lucidly describes what is appropriate and what is not . We also offered training sessions to help interested users develop social media skills . Through these sessions , we encouraged newcomers to the world of social media to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by the institution . I think it is of paramount importance to have policies and guidelines in place to guide and educate employees and their employers about social media best practices . <h> 6 . What do you see as your biggest social " win " so far , inside your organization ? <p> My presence on social media branded me as a resource and as a thought leader on the Internet . It is humbling and exciting to become the go-to person and a voice that people trust in my industry and among my colleagues at KCKCC . <p> 7 . What is your advice to traditional CIO 's that are leery of " going social " ? Any important lessons learned you would like to share ? <p> Social media is here to stay so embrace social media and put people before hardware and software ! <h> About Jostle 's CIO Series <p> At Jostle we recognize the importance of leadership in making social collaboration work inside of organizations .

Leadership Strategy ! <p> Let 's just put this out there again : Employee Engagement is not a strategy . <p> I just read somewhere that it is ... which tells me that it bears repeating both what it is and what it is n't . Employee engagement is ...... the emotional connection or commitment that an employee has to the organization that then causes the employee to want to put forth the additional effort to ensure the organization and the brand succeed . <p> What the company can do is have a purpose and build a culture that facilitates employee engagement . But keep in mind that t-shirts , free food , and surveys do not a strategy make .

The findings are interesting , but I wanted to see if/how they defined " Employee Engagement . " <p> Aon Hewitt claims that employee engagement is starting to rise , according to their latest study . They define engagement as : " the psychological and behavioral outcomes that lead to better employee performance . " They also define engagement using three attributes that include the extent to which employees : <p> Say : speak positively about the organization to co-workers , potential employees , and customers <p> Stay : have an intense sense of belonging and desire to be a part of the organization <p> Strive : are motivated and exert effort toward success in their job and for the company <p> Edelman called out " Employee Engagement findings from their 2013 Edelman Trust Barometer , " but the research was not focused on employee engagement specifically .

They did , however , uncover a couple of interesting things that relate to the employee experience : <p> Treating employees well is a higher priority for employees than it is for executives . <p> There is a crisis in leadership , led by a distrust in executives and the business ; executives need to rebuild their credibility with employees , reinforce ethical behavior , and adopt an inclusive management approach by listening to other voices - specifically , employees ' - and incorporating those into decision making . <p> This last point echoes a statement - " we have a crisis in leadership in this country " - that Bob Chapman ( Chairman and CEO of Barry-Wehmiller ) made in his Tedx presentation last year .

This is part 1 of a 3-part series . <p> Brad : Nick , to me the interesting part of your story is around the challenges of growth . As I understand it , you started with a bootstrapping approach and a pretty ambitious plan to build the operation fast . Can you tell me about the challenges of growth ? The stages you go through ? The sort of never-ending task of keeping things glued together ? <p> For me the very first thing that I focused on was spending 110% of my time just making sure I had the right leadership team around me . So from scratch , I recruited people with experience and qualifications within our environment , and maybe more importantly , who were aligned around our values and ambition . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing when I was starting up . Ever since then , I 've basically tried to lead through them , doing my best to set the vision and strategy , but not giving a rigid guide , and providing the freedom for them to execute that strategy as they see fit . Gently helping wherever I can , prodding here and there . <p> It has been really interesting in many ways because we 've actually gone from zero to 350 staff in 20 shops in about 10 months . We have grown very quickly and the challenge I think is this : how do you keep the vision that we began with , how do you keep that alive and real , as subsequent wave after wave of new joiners come into the team and dilute whatever sort of culture or vision we might have had . I think to a certain extent this is a bit of a challenge . But we seem to be getting through it . One way we are doing it is , whenever possible , I am literally meeting and engaging with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of hiring for values and are reinforcing this by trying to personally meet with each new hire ? <p> Nick : Oh of course yes indeed . I think that is the really powerful way to ensure that the vision , the values , the business are understood and that there 's real alignment . This is helped by having an amazing People Director , an HR Director . <p> It is really important to have somebody that thinks about culture and values in very innovative ways . <p> She is stretching the boundaries around how we think about people . She is has been a massive , massive aid in this effort and has ensured that there is a very strong cultural identity . <p> Brad : It is very impressive that you knew to place such a high value on that , almost before you even started . <p> Nick : Yeah well , I do n't know if you know the background but I am proud to have developed , and still have , another coffee business with my brother and sister . We saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six years . And yes , we did realize that the single thing that distinguished us from everyone else , and that allowed us to maintain a high-touch , high-quality business when we scaled it , was a really strong cultural identity throughout the business . <p> So in starting Harris + Hoole , we realized very early on that is the important thing to do , to be focused on . Therefore the People Director position was probably the most difficult one to find , but it was one that I was particularly prepared to make sure we did not make the wrong hire . It was very important that I just meet and interview as many candidates as possible until I found her .

Considering how much time the average employee spends at work during a 40-hour work week , what impact do these workspaces have on employee engagement , well-being , and culture ? <p> I recently chatted about this with Alan Hancock of Space at Work . Alan has spent his career learning about and applying best practices for optimizing workplaces for human engagement , comfort , and satisfaction . We talked about the growing future of work movement ( deftly led on many levels by Jacob Morgan and Brian Solis ) and how the workplace will continue to play an important role in employee happiness and interconnection . A great physical workspace helps deliver greater productivity , more effective teamwork , quality interaction , more cohesive culture , and likely greater profitability . <p> If your office space is not conducive to effective work , connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the employee experience will be negative . That makes the road to engaged employees a much harder journey . So , what can be done ? Alan pointed to a few ways that organizations can harness their physical space to improve engagement . He set out these ideas in a recent blog post , shared below . Are you ready to engage ? <p> For more inspiration , you can also check out these tips on building workplace vitality by paying attention to the physical environment of your workplace . <p> Take the time to understand what makes your company unique . Develop some guiding principles and ensure that both your workspace and culture are supportive of them . If new ideas generated by collaboration are critical to your company 's success , then build in spaces where staff can take time out to meet and engage with each other in casual settings and make sure this type of behaviour is not only permitted but encouraged . <h> Build a space where people want to come and work <p> Thanks to digital technology and mobile communications , fewer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Many of us no longer need to be at our desks to get work done because work can happen anywhere . Do n't worry though , the office is n't going to disappear because enlightened companies are turning their workplaces into destinations where staff can come together to get the kind of face time that FaceTimeG ca n't replace . Offices are becoming places where staff come to focus , collaborate , learn , and celebrate . The most successful workplaces will be designed to maximize employee experience by providing ' fit for purpose ' environments to carry out these activities more successfully . <h> Provide choice <p> There 's recently been a lot of negative press about the open office and the truth is that the majority of people do n't need to be in a collaborative environment all day long . Most need time to conduct focused work and certain personality types need more still . The secret is to build a workplace that provides a variety of places , spaces , and postures that employees can move to throughout their day and that best support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . When combined with supportive technology and culture , this type of agile workplace has been proven to enhance employee engagement . <h> Promote healthy behaviors <p> Sustainability has become a given when it comes to the built environment . The LEEDG standard and public demand has prompted manufacturers to provide products that have recycled content or do n't off-gas . Energy conservation measures have been written into the building code and property developers are focusing on locations accessible by transit or providing eco-friendly options such as electric vehicle charging stations and bike storage/changing facilities . <p> The next logical step is for employers to promote employee sustainability through WELLG certification which explores the connection between the buildings where we spend more than 90 percent of our time , and the health and wellness impacts on us as occupants . WELLG Certified spaces can help create a work environment that improves the nutrition , fitness , mood , sleep patterns , and performance of its occupants and therefore promotes employee engagement . <h> Be inclusive <p> Our workplaces are becoming more diverse and if you want to attract the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be their best . Traditional offices often appear to have been designed for extroverts but clearly many of us do n't thrive in those kinds of environments and do our best work away from the hustle and bustle of the open plan . Why not create quiet spaces that are conducive to focus and concentration so that everyone can find a space that works for them ? These same spaces could double as nap rooms or even quiet contemplation/prayer rooms allowing staff to address their spiritual needs during working hours . <h> Conclusion <p> Implementing all of the above would require some fairly significant commitment from an organizational leadership standpoint , however the potential rewards from an employee engagement perspective are huge . <h> About Space at Work <p> Space at Work are specialists in designing workplaces . They take the time to understand each client 's requirements and by asking the right questions and listening to the responses , provide solutions that incorporate best practices , current and emerging trends to create spaces that are agile , adaptive , and ready to accept whatever change is around the corner .

And you will quickly realize that 1.0 leadership is leaving too much opportunity on the table because the number of person-bytes " the breadth and complexity of capability the enterprise can address " accessible by 1.0 Enterprise is far less than what Enterprise 2.0 can leverage . <p> Let me say that again , because I think its pretty big and you might have missed it . Enterprise 1.0 , with command and control , is limited in its capability by the intelligence and capability of the Executive team . The executive team has most of the accessible person bytes in the company " though they can use others in simplistic ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplify the capabilities of the executives . Looked at another way , Executives are the constraint . After a certain point , it is the executives that restrain growth and capability because the organization can not amplify what the executive ca n't see . <p> In Enterprise 2.0 power and capability flows the other way " from the network to the leadership . In Enterprise 2.0 , executives ( leaders ) inquire and align collective intelligence and capability . They can access the collective capabilities , resources and observations of the workforce and beyond . They can build businesses with greater person-byte potential . <p> Hausmann shows that not only are those products that require more person-bytes more rare and valuable , but they lead to richer adjacent opportunities . Person-bytes aggregate via proximity and connection . You do n't have one kind of expertise " say in manufacturing phones " and then suddenly have a totally different kind of expertise in oil exploration " unless you 've discovered some link between the too . <p> Social , networked companies can build more complex " more person-byte " products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . Hausmann 's data is based on national economies , but if you look at it the connection will be instantly clear
