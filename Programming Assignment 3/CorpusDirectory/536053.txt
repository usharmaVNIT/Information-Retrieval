@@89588399 @5088399/ <p> Non-monogamy seems to be coming out of the closet . A study published in the prestigious Journal of Marriage and Family claims that contemporary marriage is undergoing a process of detraditionalization , which includes an openness to nonmonogamy . The study , which was co-authored by three Canadian sociologists , Adam Isiah Green , Jenna Valleriani , and Barry Adam , 1 may capture media attention , but a closer look reveals that the evidence is shaky and their conclusions are premature , especially when we look at a broader set of studies . This leads me to conclude that the rumors of monogamys death are greatly exaggerated . <p> In their study , the Canadian researchers conducted in-depth interviews with 90 heterosexual and same-sex married Canadians . They found considerable openness to nonmonogamy , but this openness was evident mostly in abstract ideas of tolerance rather than in real life . In other words , most people supported nonmonogamy in theory , but not in practice . Gay married men were more open to nonmonogamy in both ideal and personal practice . Lesbian spouses mostly decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue and based their decisions to be sexually exclusive on pragmatic reasons . But for heterosexual couples , personal monogamy held strong in the study , even when attitudes about others choices were more lenient . Despite these variations , the Canadian researchers interpret their findings to mean that another pillar of institutional marriagethe marital norm of monogamy is showing serious cracks . <p> Certainly , there are social science scholars these days who are questioning the accepted superiority of monogamy . For instance , one group of researchers led by Dr. Terri Conley at the University of Michigan reviewed research on the potential benefits of monogamy to family life and society , and boldly concluded that " there is no definitive evidence to suggest that monogamy is the superior relational state for humans " in contemporary societies.2 They called for empirical research to " reexamine cultural assumptions about monogamy . " <p> More recently , this same team of scholars claimed to have found that there are few differences in relationship qualitysatisfaction , commitment , love , and trustbetween traditional monogamous relationships and most types of consensual nonmonogamous relationships.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent IFS blog4 ) has had widespread media attention , 5 it contains serious weaknesses that limit confidence in its findings . For one , the sample is questionable : Nearly 90 percent of survey participants were recruited from Internet sites such as Craigslist.org ; the remaining participants were recruited by undergraduate students who posted information on their social media sites . This sampling procedure would not yield a representative sample of all individuals in romantic relationships or even those in CNM relationships . Moreover , even though the average length of relationships in the sample was 10 years , the researchers do not inform the reader what proportion of the sample were married or in a committed relationship . Nor do they break down their findings by marital status . Its reasonable to wonder whether among married participants , there were significant differences between monogamous and CNM individuals in terms of relationship quality . Even with these shortcomings , the authors boldly assert that further research on the quality of CNM relationships is " not imperative . " 6 ( I confess that in more than 30 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a research question has been studied sufficiently , even in areas of research with hundreds of published studies ! ) <p> Of course , we know from pretty good data that some people do hold more open attitudes about monogamy , and that infidelity exists in nontrivial numbers . For example , a recent national poll of Americans attitudes and practices regarding nonmonogamy could be interpreted by some as a shift in our attitudes.7 It found that , overall , about 10 percent reported engaging in sexual activity with someone else with the consent of their main romantic partner ( as opposed to old-fashioned cheating ) . This fairly weak showing is qualified by the finding that a little more than one-third of American adults under age 45 described their current romantic relationship as not completely monogamous . Among these younger Americans , 17 percent reported engaging in consensual nonmonogamy . What 's more , only about half of that age group reported that their ideal relationship situation would be completely monogamous . <p> However , the polling data are not broken down by marital status , and I strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the married . As evidence for this assertion , I refer to an excellent national study of young adults ( ages 24-32 , using the Add Health data set ) by three Penn State sociologists . That poll found that only 9 percent of married young women and 12 percent of married young men reported they had ever been unfaithful in their current relationship.8 In addition , 7 percent of married women and 5 percent of married men reported that their spouse had been unfaithful , though the researchers believe that those figures likely underreport spousal infidelity ( because most infidelity is not discovered or disclosed ) . Moreover , 6 percent of married women and men reported that both spouses had been unfaithful . <p> Despite the big changes to the meaning of modern marriage , monogamy is alive and well . <p> Given studies like these , I understand how it might be tempting for some to conclude that normative cracks in the pillar of marital monogamy are beginning to show . So why do I resist that interpretive temptation ? Because the fuller body of research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonmonogamy . <p> As for the Canadian study exploring marital nonmonogamy mentioned at the outset of this article , there are obvious limitations to it . The study employed a small , convenience sample of white , well-educated , urban Canadians whose views wont generalize easily to American society . The researchers claim that this kind of sample would be at the " forefront of detraditionalization. " 9 If they are correct , this suggests that there would be an even less enthusiastic embrace of nonmonogamy in the general population than what they found in their small study . <p> But another reason that I remain skeptical about the imminent crumbling of the traditional ideal and practice of marital monogamy comes directly from the Penn State study using Add Health data ( the same one described above ) . In this study , young men and women reported how important they thought fidelity was to a successful marriage or committed relationship . The average of the responses was 9.8 out of 10 ( SD = .86 ) for women and 9.7 ( SD=1.15 ) for men . So , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as a wistful ideal , but as a key part of a successful marriage . This study also seems to be in line with recent national polling data that shows that more than 90 percent of American adults say that a marital affair is morally wrong.10 Another recent poll found that 64 percent of American adults say that monogamy is " fundamental " in romantic relationships , 11 and I believe this figure would be even higher if the question asked specifically about marital relationships . <p> In addition , the Penn State researchers found that reports of spousal infidelity were strongly associated with the dissolution of the relationship : wives and husbands who reported that their spouse was unfaithful were twice as likely to experience a break-up in the early years of marriage . That study also found that reports of ones own infidelity were substantially higher than reports of spousal infidelity , and they believe this is because spouses are unlikely to disclose infidelity to their spouse . This reticence suggests that there remains a large stigma on unfaithful behavior . <p> And such stigma even remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever studies with samples of young college students conducted by the Conley team of researchers mentioned above , they found consistent evidence of significant stigma surrounding consensual nonmonogamous relationships and a " halo effect " surrounding monogamous relationships.12 They found this for both sexes and within exactly the population groupyoung peoplewho might be expected to be the most open to the idea of consensual nonmonogamy . <p> So , for now anyway , I 'm not buying the " **35;0;TOOLONG " story line . Sure , it bears monitoring , but the pillar of marital monogamy appears to be made of solid stuff , given how strongly people still hold to this ideal . Despite the big changes to the meaning of modern marriage , monogamy is alive and well . In fact , if romantic love has become the core meaning of contemporary marriage , as the detraditionalization thesis suggests , then the monogamy ideal might even grow stronger because it may function as an essential practice of sustaining romantic love in a society devoid of other structural and institutional supports . 
@@89588402 @5088402/ <p> This may seem like an odd question to ask . But an institution is a manifestation of an idea ( at least according to Samuel Taylor Coleridge ) . Understanding the idea that animates the institution of marriage today is an important step towards identifying the complex marital trends of 21st-century societies . <p> In particular , we should look to the people who are still getting and ( largely ) staying married . They turn out , disproportionately , to be the most affluent and most educated . It is a striking fact that arguably the most economically powerful group of women in human historyfemale American college graduatesare the ones who are most likely to get and stay married . <p> These women do not need to get married for sex ; the average American woman now has a decade of sexual activity before her first marriage at the age of 27 . They do not need to get married for economic survival ; their own earning potential is high enough to do without a husband if necessary . They do not need to get married for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupational and social ladder . They do not even need to get married to have children , given the sharp reduction in the stigma attached to non-marital births . The Polish anthropologist Bronislaw Malinoski once described marriage as a means of tying a man to a woman and their children . Nowadays , women do n't  need to be tied to a man . <p> The revolutionary implications of these changes are great . The economic independence of women , a critical battle-cry of the feminist movement , has in large part been achieved . Women with money do n't  need men in the way that their mothers may have . ( One intriguing study of winners in the Florida state lottery found that single women who won more than $25,000 were less likely to get married in the next three years than those who won less than $1,000 . ) <p> Very often , we ask why people are opting out of marriage , either by not marrying or by not investing sufficiently in their marriage to make it last . Given the wide class gaps in marriage trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : why are so many powerful , educated , independent women still opting for marriage ? <p> My answer , in one word , is childrearing . Educated parents are highly motivated to give their children the best chance in life . They know because they read a lot thatother things being equalchildren raised within stable families do better in life . Having two parents means that the responsibilities of caring and earning can be shared more easily . It does n't  make much sense , given the rise in the economic power , to think of a single " Head of Household " ( even though government surveys still do ) . As it turns out , two heads are better than one . As Ashley McGuire writes on these pages , " married couples today typically share responsibility for earning money , keeping up their home , and raising their children . " <p> Childrearing has always been one of the ideas behind the marital institution . But today it is the principal one . <p> Marriage is no longer principally an economic institution , but almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising children together . Of course , childrearing has always been one of the ideas behind the marital institution . But today it is the principal one . <p> The practical significance of marriage as a contract that supports the traditional gendered division of labor has certainly decreased ... for college-educated men and women , marriage retains its practical significance as a commitment device that supports high levels of parental investment in children . <p> It is true , as McGuire points out , that men and women still divide the earning and caring along gendered rather than symmetrical lines , with dads doing roughly two-thirds of the earning , and moms two-thirds of the caring . But the symmetry lies in the power relationship rather than the specific tasks undertaken by each parent . The women in these relationships are choosing their role , not having it forced upon them by economic circumstances . And that role is not about keeping house ; it is about raising kids . Work by economist Jane Leber Herr finds that new mothers with college degrees stay out of the labor market longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr does n't  know . Nor do I , but I 'm willing to speculate . Well-educated mothers want more time with their children because they know its good for the childs development . And they really , really , really care about that . <p> Ive called these institutions High Investment Parenting ( HIP ) marriages , which contrast strongly with both the old-fashioned inegalitarian model , with strong economic dependency on the part of women , and with the romantic , " you complete me " model favored in most Hollywood movies . <p> Children are the glue of these modern , egalitarian marriages . This may in part explain the rise in " gray divorce , " with rates doubling among the over 50s in the last 25 years , and couples honoring their commitment to raise their children together but then going their separate waysless " until death us do part , " than " until our last High Schooler departs .

Against the predictions of most social commentators , in 2017 , marriage still acts as a commitment device to help achieve these goals .

@@89588409 @5088409/ <p> As of 2016 , less than 65% of the 50 million school-aged children in the United States were living in households with two married parents.1 As shown in Figure 1 , more than 12 million24%were living with their mothers only as a result of birth outside of marriage ( 10% ) , parental divorce ( 9% ) , or separation ( 5% ) . Moreover , 2.2 million ( 4.5% ) were living with their fathers only for similar reasons . Another 2 million ( 4% ) were living with neither birth parent , but with other relatives or in a foster family . And 1.3 million ( 2.6% ) were living with two parents who had not ( yet ) married . How does the fact that so many students today come from non-intact or unmarried families affect their progression through school ? <p> Students from unconventional family forms pose a challenge to teachers and school administrators who are striving to give all students the same opportunities to succeed . Single parents are often less able to devote as much time , attention , financial support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption is often accompanied by conflict , turmoil , and parental anger or depression . Parent education and family income levels are typically lower in single-parent and step-families than in married two-parent families , and poverty rates are higher.3 Furthermore , the racial and ethnic identities of students from non-traditional families are more likely to be African-American or Hispanic-American , whereas those of students from married two-parent families are more likely to be European-American or Asian-American.4 So , long-standing ethnic gaps in achievement , concerns about unequal opportunity , and racial sensitivities come into play as well . <p> Childrens conduct and performance in school are profoundly affected by the emotional support , intellectual stimulation , guidance , and discipline they receive at home . And they are more likely to get the attention , affection , and direction they need to thrive in school when they come from an intact , married family . A long line of studies , beginning with the 1966 Coleman Report , have shown this to be the case.5 More recently , our own analysis of trends in Arizona and Florida indicates that school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their families are headed by married parents.6 In this research brief , we examine data from a recent federal survey to explore the influence of family structure and family functioning on student achievement . <p> Data and Methods <p> The survey in question was the 2011-2012 National Survey of Childrens Health , a nationwide telephone survey of parents of some 96,000 children61,000 of whom were of elementary and secondary school ages ( 6-17 years old ) .7 Three indicators of academic progress and classroom conduct were measured in the study : <p> whether the parent had been contacted by the childs school due to learning or behavior problems the child was experiencing at school ; <p> whether the child had repeated one or more grades ; and , <p> whether the child seemed positively engaged in his or her schoolwork by " caring about doing well in school " and " doing all required homework " " always " ( as opposed to " usually , " " sometimes , " " rarely , " or " never " ) .8 <p> We analyzed the extent to which each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family in which the child lived , dividing families into six types depending on whether the child lived with : <p> two married parents ; <p> two parents who were cohabiting ; <p> a biological parent and a stepparent ; <p> single mothers who were separated or divorced ; <p> single mothers who had never married ; or , <p> single biological fathers , other relatives , or foster families.9 <p> We also examined how the school performance indicators were associated with the : <p> education level of the childs parents ; <p> family income and poverty status ; <p> childs race and ethnicity ; <p> childs age in years ; and , <p> childs sex . <p> We carried out multiple logistic regression analyses to adjust the relationship between each of the independent variables and the dependent variable for its association with the other predictors . We repeated these analyses with the national sample for each of the school performance indicators.10 <p> Children Who Live with Married Parents Do Better in School <p> Our analyses showed that schoolchildren who live with both married parents do better on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent education were significantly associated with student performance as well , but children from married-couple families do better even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic correlates of family structure . Here are our findings for each of the indicators in turn : <p> Parents contacted by school <p> Nearly a third of U.S. parents of students ages 6-17 reported that they had been contacted by the childs school at least once due to conduct or learning problems that their child was exhibiting in class . School contact is an indicator of student maladjustment and often foreshadows more serious disciplinary issues or learning failures to come . It may also be an indication that the students behavior is interfering with an orderly classroom environment , thus reducing other students opportunities to learn . <p> Forty-five percent of students living with never-married mothers had their parents contacted by their schools , compared with one-quarter of children living in married , two-parent families.11 Rates of school contact were also significantly higher among students living with separated or divorced mothers ( 40% ) , among those living in stepfamilies ( 37% ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in foster families ( 42% ) . Even students living with cohabiting parents ( i.e. , unmarried biological parents ) had higher rates of school contact ( 38% ) . The differences among single-parent and stepparent family types were not statistically significant , except that students in stepfamilies had significantly lower rates of school contact than did students living with never-married mothers . <p> After taking demographic and socioeconomic disparities into account , differences in school contact rates between students in intact families and those in unmarried , disrupted , or reconstituted families were reduced in magnitude but remained substantial ( see Figure 2 ) . The odds of school contact were between 1+ and 1+ times higher in unmarried , disrupted , and reconstituted families than in married birth-parent families . The differences in school contact rates among the various forms of non-traditional families were not statistically significant , after adjusting for child age , sex , and race , and parent education , income , and poverty status . <p> Grade repetition <p> Being held back a grade in school is not only an indicator of current learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later non-achievement and for dropping out of school . Among all U.S. elementary and secondary school pupils , 9% had to repeat one or more grades in school . The proportion of students who had repeated a grade was nearly four times higher among students from never-married families as among those growing up in intact , married two-parent families : 19% versus 5% . It was twice as high among students from formerly-married families , such as those living with separated or divorced mothers ( 12% ) , or in stepfamilies ( 13% ) . Children living with single fathers , other relatives , or in foster care were three times more likely to have repeated a grade ( 15% ) . Even children living with cohabiting biological parents had an elevated rate of grade repetition ( 10% ) . All of these differences were statistically significant . <p> Grade repetition differences were reduced somewhat when the figures were adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic disparities across family types , as shown in Figure 3 . However , compared to students in intact married families , the adjusted odds of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high among students living with never- married mothers , in stepfamilies , and with fathers or other relatives . The adjusted odds were 1+ times higher among students living with separated or divorced mothers , and nearly as high among those with cohabiting parents . All these elevated odds ratios were statistically significant , except for cohabiting families , where it was only marginally significant . <p> Consistent engagement in schoolwork <p> One of the key indications that a student is on a path to success in school is showing interest and engagement in schoolwork . Based on their analysis of several longitudinal studies , economist Greg Duncan and his colleagues found that a positive approach to learning activities in the early grades was one of the best predictors of future academic achievement as well as of later occupational advancement and earnings.12 School engagement was measured in the National Survey of Childrens Health by asking parents how often in the past month the student " cares about doing well in school " and how often he or she " does all required homework . " Only about half of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about doing well in school and completed all required homework . <p> Among students living with both married parents , a 55% majority displayed consistent engagement in schoolwork . A majority of students living with cohabiting parents were also reported to be consistently engaged in schoolwork . Less than half of those living with separated or divorced mothers , in stepfamilies , or with other relatives showed similar engagement with their studies . These differences were statistically significant . Students living with never-married mothers were not statistically different from students in intact families in this regard . <p> After adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic differences across family types , students from married two-parent families showed more engagement than students from other family types , as shown in Figure 4 . The odds of consistent engagement were from 65% to 71% lower among students living with never-married or formerly married mothers , in stepfamilies , or with other relatives . Students with cohabiting parents were not significantly different from those with married biological parents . Differences in schoolwork engagement among the various forms of non-traditional families were not statistically significant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . <p> Student success is predicated on staying out of trouble in school and on remaining meaningfully engaged in class and with homework . Our analysis of the National Survey of Childrens Health indicates that children from intact married families are more likely to avoid detours that can derail their educational performance and to be successful students , compared to children from unmarried or non-intact families . Specifically , children from unmarried or disrupted families are more than 1+ times more likely to have their parents contacted by their school for problem behavior , about twice as likely to be held back in school , and only two-thirds as likely to be engaged in class and with their homework , compared to children from intact married familieseven after controlling for a range of sociodemographic factors . We also find that poverty and low parent educational attainment are associated with higher rates of schools contacting families and with a student being held back in school . Taken together , our results indicate that student outcomes across the U.S. are strongly associated with three important family factors : family poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , then , our results suggest that student performance can not be understood apart from what 's happening in American families . Families struggling with material want , conflict , or instability appear to be less able to give children the resources , consistent attention and affection , and stability they need to avoid trouble and to thrive in school . Thus , policymakers , educators , business executives , and philanthropic leaders seeking to improve the educational fortunes of children must not lose sight of the ways in which strong families are seedbeds of educational success . To improve education , we also need to enhance the material and marital fortunes of American families . Policymakers , educators , and civic leaders should consider measuressuch as a refundable child tax credit , a social marketing campaign on behalf of marriage , and a family life curriculum that explains the importance of marriage to schoolchildrento strengthen and stabilize American families . <p> Nicholas Zill is a research psychologist and a senior fellow of the Institute for Family Studies .

Forget Mars and Venus . The difference between men and women that matters most is that women have babies .

With moms focus on the child , that has to be dad . <p> If we men can get into our heads that our first task is to love mom , to notice her , to have her in the forefront of our thoughts , our marriage will be terrific . <p> Happy wife , happy life .

When a woman becomes child-oriented , dad needs to become mom-oriented . Somebody needs to take responsibility for the relationship . Remember that this is not about who does what role . Couples can take on whatever roles they like . <p> So , how do you turn around an unhappy marriage ? <p> Have hope . When you 're in a bad place , you cant imagine ever getting out . But remember you felt the same in reverse when you were in love . You could n't imagine that things could ever go bad . Yet they did . Unhappiness is rarely permanent .

@@89588413 @5088413/ <p> If childrens natural parents are living together when they are born , does it make any difference whether or not their parents are married ? <p> In the 2017 edition of the World Family Map report and essay released today by the Institute for Family Studies and Social Trends Institute , we explore that question , and more specifically , how the context of parents relationship at birth affects stability in childrens lives . After all , the world has changed a lot since the days when non-marital births generally meant scandal or shame for women who would either give their child away or raise that child without a partner . It has become increasingly common for non-marital births to occur to cohabiting parents rather than lone mothers . <p> For example , in the Dominican Republic , the share of all births to lone mothers stayed almost stable at just over 17 percent from 1991 to 2002 , but the share of all births to unmarried women rose from 75 percent to almost 85 percent ( cohabiting births rose from 58 to 67 percent ) . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no difference for childrens chances of growing up with both biological parents , then we might be concerned about stability in childrens lives in countries where births to lone mothers have been on the rise like Armenia , but not in countries where the share of children born to unions has been stable like the Dominican Republic . <p> In fact , the share of 11-year-old children living with both biological parents fell from 51 percent to 43 percent in the Dominican Republic from 2002 to 2013 . That means the group of children born when cohabiting births were 10 percentage points less common were 8 percentage points more likely to be living with both biological parents at age 11 . <p> Of course , much else can change over time besides what share of births occur to cohabiting parents . Therefore , we tested whether countries that experienced sharper rises in cohabiting births also showed sharper declines in shares of children reared by both parents with data from 68 countries across the world . And they did . For example , Figure 1 ( below ) shows that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in the share of children living with both natural parents later on ( bottom right quadrant ) . There are also a handful of countries that have seen a decline in cohabitation and a rise in the share of children later living with both natural parents ( top left quadrant ) . The countries where cohabitation is on the rise but stability in childrens lives is nonetheless growing are in the top right quadrant : they are scattered through Africa , Central/South America , Eastern Europe , and Northern Europe . <p> Overall , every percentage point increase in the share of births to cohabiting couples corresponded to a 0.27 percentage point decrease in the share of 12-year-olds living with both biological parents 12 years later . This finding is not as damning for cohabitation as much as a one-to-one correspondence would be : It essentially means that many of the cohabiting relationships are stable . But it also indicates that cohabiting relationships are less stable than marriage , and suggests that the growth of cohabitation leads to fewer children having the benefits of living with both parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability of cohabitation and marriage can only be tested using aggregate statistics like I have described above ; therefore , we do n't  know what proportion of cohabiting vs. marital unions fail in the first 12 years of childrens lives . However , richer data are available for many countries in Europe as well as for the United States . These data allowed us to test whether individual children born to cohabiting couples suffered more family instability than individual children born to married couples . <p> Unsurprisingly , we found greater stability among children born to married couples . But many who have paid attention to recent trends around this issue believe that family stability has more to do with family economics rather than marriage per se . That is , those with fewer resources are less likely to marry and also more likely to break up : Low resources affect both marriage and stability , and the link between them is much weaker than it appears . <p> In the overwhelming majority of countries , the most educated cohabiting parents still have a far higher rate of break-up than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , our new World Family Mapreport documents the likelihood of breakup by union type separately for children whose mothers have low , medium , and high levels of education . We showed that children have more stable family lives when born within marriage regardless of their mothers educational background ( see figure 2 below ) . There were some countries like the United States and the United Kingdom where the advantage associated with marriage was smaller at low maternal education levels , but it was still quite sizable : children were 57 and 69 percent ( respectively ) more likely to see their parents split before age 12 if their parents were cohabiting rather than married at the time of their birth . So even if marriage matters less among those with lower socioeconomic status , it still has a large impact on stability for children . In addition , marriage mattered more rather than less among those with lower socioeconomic status in Spain , Belgium , the Netherlands , and Georgia . <p> Figure 2 : Union Status at Birth and Subsequent Stability <p> Source : 2017 World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalization that marriage is a more stable context than cohabitation for childrearing across 17 countries and three education levels . In 13 countries , marriage conferred a stability advantage at all three education levels , and Spain was the only country where cohabiting couples were more stable than married couples at more than one education level ( both low and high : again see figure 2 ) . <p> The Spanish example highlights what academics like to call selection : In a country like Spain where most births are marital , those who self-select into cohabiting births are atypical . The flip side of selection reasoning is that as cohabiting births become more normative , the couples having them become less select ( more typical ) . Research on cohabitants in Europe has , in fact , found that they are more similar to married couples in countries where cohabitation is common than in countries where cohabitation is rare across a number of social and economic measures . Before our work in this report , the question remained : as cohabitation becomes more common , does it become more similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the answer is no . The stability advantage associated with marriage varies a lot between countries , but it is not smaller where cohabiting births are more normative . <p> In sum , the 2017 World Family Map contradicts three myths about cohabitation and family stability for children : <p> 1 ) The first myth is that cohabitation is less stable just because poorer people are more likely to choose it . In fact , cohabitation is less stable than marriage regardless of the mothers educational background . In the overwhelming majority of countries , the most educated cohabiting parents still have a far higher rate of break-up than the lowest educated married couples . <p> 2 ) The second myth is that cohabitation becomes more similar to marriage as it becomes more widespread : That is not the case for children . <p> 3 ) The final myth is that where cohabitation has been a long-standing alternative to marriage ( scholars writing on Latin America and the Caribbean refer to a " dual nuptiality " system ) , further growth of the institution will not affect childrens lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe , the retreat from marriage seems to contribute to instability for children .

@@89588420 @5088420/ <p> What reasons do people give for divorcing ? This is a different , simpler question than why marriages fail . In this post , I 'm exploring the reasons people give about why they divorced by reviewing research reports that have addressed this question.1 The five reports I mention rely on a variety of methods and types of samples , yet yield similar answers across different samples , methods , and eras . <p> In a 2003 study , Paul Amato and Denise Previti used data from the " Marital Instability Over the Life Course " project , which is based on a national survey of men and women in 1980 and 1997.2 Those who divorced were asked , " What do you think caused the divorce ? " The open-ended responses were coded into categories , with the top reasons for divorcing being : <p> Infidelity <p> Incompatibility <p> Drinking or drug use <p> Growing apart <p> In 2001 , a group of family scholars , including myself , conducted a large , random , statewide phone survey in Oklahoma.3 We interviewed over 2000 people and asked those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reasons for divorcing , with the list being developed by the researchers ahead of time , based on our knowledge of the literature . The top three reasons people gave were : <p> A lack of commitment <p> Too much conflict or arguing <p> Infidelity or extramarital affairs <p> These reasons were followed by " getting married too young , " " little or no helpful premarital preparation , " and " financial problems or economic hardship . " The reports of marrying too young likely overlap with the general category of incompatibility , since this is one of the risks of marrying very young : people often do not know themselves or what they expect and desire in a mate at age 18 . Amato and Previti presenting findings in support of this point , finding that incompatibility was more commonly reported as a reason for divorce among those who had married young than those who had married when a little older . <p> Infidelity is on both lists covered so far ( and on every list coming up ) . Clearly , that is a sub-category of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both reports Ive mentioned thus far . For some , infidelity is the main reason their marriage ended , and for others , infidelity is something that happened at the end of years of other problems , such as nasty conflicts , incompatibility , and substance abuse . <p> I Blame You <p> Amato and Previti found that more people blamed their ex for their marriage ending ( 33% ) than blamed themselves ( 5% ) . Similarly , in the report from the survey in Oklahoma , we found that most people ( 73% ) believed that they had worked hard enough on their marriage but that their ex-spouse should have worked harder ( 74% ) . As in Amato and Previti , we see that most people who have divorced believe their ex is more to blame . <p> Reasons for Divorce and Final Straws <p> A study published in 2013 by Shelby Scott , Galena Rhoades , Scott Stanley , Elizabeth Allen , and Howard Markman used a multi-year , longitudinal sample of couples marrying who participated in premarital preparation between the years 1995 and 2001 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the team contacted those who had divorced and interviewed those who responded ( 52 respondents ) about their reasons , using the same list used by Johnson and colleagues . These data are less representative than other samples I cite here , but what the study lacked in sample size may be made up for in the depth of information . Researchers asked respondents not only about the major cause of divorce but also about the " final straw . " The top reported reasons for divorce were : <p> Lack of commitment <p> Infidelity <p> Conflict/arguing <p> That list looks pretty familiar , right ? The most common final straws were : <p> Infidelity <p> Domestic violence <p> Substance abuse <p> Scott and colleagues made an important distinction in that the reasons why a marriage declines , leading to an end , can be different from what finally breaks the back of one continuing . And when it comes to deciding a marriage is over , women are more likely than men to say its done ( found by Amato and Previti and many others ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Johnson and colleagues , women were more likely than men to report a marriage ending because of abuse . I recall a talk by Amato , years ago , where he noted that , on average , many marriages end when women become fed up with men behaving badly . Clearly , plenty of women behave badly also , as many divorced men will attest . Nevertheless , it is a common scenario where one partner ( more often the man ) exhibits behavior that the other partner ( more often the woman ) finally decides is too much to bear . In his talk , Amato described the same deal breakers identified by Scott and colleagues as final straws . Similarly , Johnson and colleagues reported the top reasons men and women gave for divorcing and found that the answers were mostly the same except that women were far more likely ( 44% ) than men ( 8% ) to report that domestic violence was a major reason for the split . <p> For some , infidelity is the main reason their marriage ended , and for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of other problems , such as nasty conflicts , incompatibility , and substance abuse . <p> In 2004 , AARP put out a report based on a large , national survey of older adults , aged 40 and up , on reasons for the divorces they experienced in their 40s , 50s , or 60s . The survey appears to be representative and used excellent methods.5 Cutting to the chase ( because time is of the essence when you are older ) , people reported these top reasons for divorcing : <p> Abuse : verbal , physical , or emotional <p> Differing values and lifestyles <p> Cheating <p> Runner up was " simply falling out of love/no obvious problems . " So , the older set , who now account for a lot of divorce , 6 give reasons for divorce that are very similar to the reasons found in the other reports covered here . <p> In a study published in 2012 , Alan Hawkins , Brian Willoughby , and William Doherty ( 2012 ) 7 reported reasons for divorce in the only study I cover here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bill Doherty , Steven Harris , and colleagues have been doing about the possibility of reconciliations after filingbut before finalizingdivorce , Hawkins , Willoughby , and Doherty reported reasons people gave for ending a marriage within a sample of 886 individual parents who were in the process of divorcing . These parents were involved in mandated parenting classes as part of the legal system in Hennepin County , Minnesota . They found the two most common reasons for divorcing to be : <p> Growing apart <p> Not being able to talk together <p> People who were the least likely to entertain putting the brakes on a divorce reported growing apart , differences in tastes , and money problems . In an interesting twist , given the other findings noted here , abuse and infidelity were not reasons for divorcing that were associated with how much interest someone had in potentially reconciling the marriage . <p> Having My Baby : Or Not <p> There is a lot of consistency across these studies but might there be other reasons emerging as the deal breakers in the current era ? While not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the observations of attorneys in a New York Post piece suggesting that conflicts over having children have become a major cause of divorce . Both I ( @DecideOrSlide ) and Nicholas Wolfinger ( @nickwolfinger ) tweeted that we did not know of research supporting this point . Nevertheless , Larson and I agreed that this is likely to be a growing reason for divorcing . I believe this to be the case for two reasons . <p> First , I think people are more likely than ever before to slide into important relationshipsincluding marriage and parentingwithout making clear decisions about a future together . That means more and more relationships that are poorly vetted . ( In fact , if you are single and want more advice on this , try this article . ) <p> Second , incompatibility has often been given as a reason for divorcing , and different family aspirations could easily become a major driver in this category as having children has become less of a default expectation in marriage . Whether or not two spouses were likely to be good parents , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had children . Now , like everything else , this is much less a given and much more a ( potential ) negotiation ( when not a slide ) . <p> It Takes Two to Tango <p> While no one can anticipate all the changes and circumstances that will impact a marriage in the future , singles interested in marriage do well to make the best choices they can at the start in preparing for a successful marriage ( read more , here ) . And those who are married and happy who want to avoid divorce in the future have ways to strengthen and build on what they have ( read more , here . ) We all know that it takes two people to make a good marriage last . One person can not make it happen without the other person also being willing to invest and grow .

But to make a marriage last , its going to work best if each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I push : " do your part .

@@89588423 @5088423/ <p> We know that nonmarital mothers today are more likely to give birth in a cohabiting union than on their own . But what do we know about those unions and the reasons that women become pregnant ?

Her study sheds a novel light on family formation among unmarried couplesand potentially on the legal and policy debates that underlie these issues . <p> Professor Barbers work builds on the well-known Fragile Families and Child-Wellbeing Study , which followed almost 5,000 children born between 1998 and 2000 in large U.S. cities ; approximately three-quarters of their parents were unmarried . The Fragile Families research dramatically changed our images of unmarried families .

Instead of starting once the children are born , it follows young women before they become pregnant and often before they have entered the relationships that produce the pregnancies .

The goal of the study was to investigate the women and to gather information about their romantic relationships , and the related social and behavioral processes , that lead to unintended pregnancies in early adulthood . The baseline survey was conducted from March 2008 through July 2009 . After that , the researchers collected short weekly surveys on 992 18 to 19-year-old women for 2.5 years , as well as semi-structured interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a number of remarkable findings concerning young womens likelihood to become pregnant , their contraceptive use , and their boyfriends and husbands .

The women who became pregnant were somewhat more disadvantaged than the women who did not , but the bigger differences were in their partners . Pregnant women experienced relationship violence at between two and three times the rate of those who did not become pregnant . Moreover , when the women who became pregnant had more than one partner during the study period , the womens oldest and least educated partners were the most likely to father their pregnancies .

At a symposium focused on her work , Professor Barber explained that although the pregnant women understood their partners weaknesses , they typically believed that their partners were strongly committed to the relationship and that the relationships would last . Yet the majority of relationships proved unstable , with the circumstances that produced the pregnancy likely contributing to the instability . This suggests to us that the most effective public policy interventions may be those designed to target the circumstances that exist before the pregnancy occurs . Increasing access to long-acting forms of birth control , which do not depend on decisions made in the heat of the moment , for example , produced a 40 percent drop in births to teens and poor women in Colorado.3 Improving male employment prospects and rethinking mass incarceration policies might also enhance womens prospects of finding better mates , 4 and foster more cooperative parenting behavior <p> The groundbreaking results serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostering childhood development and maximizing parental capabilities among unmarried couples .

Most of these children subsequently lived in a birth mother-stepfather family.5 Children whose remarried parents divorced are excluded from the analyses . <p> Family Resources <p> During kindergarten , the three groups of children were similar in terms of the economic and educational resources of their parents.6 Their financial circumstances diverged following parental divorce , and then changed again for those whose divorced parents remarried . By the time they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parent group had significantly lower family incomes than those in the other two groups , and a larger minority of them were living below the official poverty level . Children in the Remarried Parent group had family incomes that were higher than in the Single Parent group , and not significantly different from the Parents Stay Married group.7 <p> Classroom Conduct in Kindergarten and Fifth Grade <p> During kindergarten , the three groups of children were similar with respect to their conduct in school . According to their teachers , they exhibited an above-average approach to learning tasks , paying attention well , showing eagerness to learn , and persisting in the face of challenges . Children in all three groups were less likely than the average child to be argumentative or to get into fights with other students . They were also less apt than average to appear unhappy or worried , or to withdraw from group activities . The three groups did not differ significantly from one another on these positive or negative aspects of classroom behavior . <p> Differences in classroom behavior emerged as the children experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade , students in the Divorced Single Parent and Remarried Parent groups exhibited less positive approaches to learning tasks than students whose parents stayed married . The Single Parent children were now at the 44th percentile in teacher behavior ratings , while the Remarried Parent students scored at the 43rd percentile . As Figure 1 shows , both were significantly lower than the Stay Married group , which remained above average at the 55th percentile . The comparisons are statistically adjusted for differences across groups in student age and gender , family income and poverty status , parent education level , and racial and ethnic composition . <p> Note : *Different from children whose parents stayed married , p&lt;0.05 . <p> The fifth-graders from the divorced groups also showed more sad , worried , and withdrawn behavior in class than did students whose parents remained married . Figure 2 indicates that children in the Single Parent group scored at the 54th percentile in teacher ratings of these kinds of emotional distress , while children in the Remarried Parent group were at the 61st percentile . Both groups showed significantly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were at the 47th percentile . ( In this case , higher percentile ranks indicate more troubled behavior , with the 50th percentile being average across all students , including those whose parents were not married while the child was in kindergarten . ) These comparisons are also adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic disparities across groups . <p> Note : *Different from children whose parents stayed married , p&lt;0.05 . <p> School Disciplinary Actions <p> By the time the children became teenagers and reached the eighth grade , the classroom conduct problems of some of them were serious enough to lead to disciplinary action by their schools . One in four students in the Remarried Parent group had received out-of-school suspensions for classroom misconduct . The same was true for one in five students in the Divorced Single Parent group , but fewer than one in ten students in the Parents Stay Married group . After adjustments for differences across groups in student age and gender , family income and poverty status , parent education level , and racial and ethnic composition , students in the Remarried group were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts in the Stay Married group , while those in the Single Parent group were twice as likely . ( See Figure 3 . ) Both the divorced groups were significantly different from the consistently married group , but the apparent difference between the Remarried and Single Parent groups was not statistically reliable . <p> Note : *Different from children whose parents stayed married , p&lt;0.05 . <p> Problem Behavior at Home <p> Compared to teenagers in the Parents Stay Married group , adolescents in the Remarried and Single Parent groups were more apt to seem unhappy and be bothered by fears and worries , according to their parents . Teens in the Remarried group scored at the 61st percentile on these symptoms of anxiety and depression , whereas teens in the Single Parent group scored at the 54th percentile . ( Higher percentile scores indicate more negative symptoms . The 50th percentile is average . ) Teens in the Stay Married group , at the 43rd percentile , were less troubled than average , as the left side of Figure 4 illustrates . These comparisons are adjusted for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : *Different from children whose parents stayed married , p&lt;0.05 . <p> Teens in remarried and single-parent families were also more likely than those in married-parent families to exhibit distractible , hyperactive , and impulsive behavior . Whereas those in married-parent families scored at the 43rd percentile on these symptomatic behaviors , teens in single-parent families were at the 54th percentile and those in remarried families were at the 52nd percentile . ( See the right side of Figure 4 . ) Both the latter groups showed significantly more problem behavior than the married group , but the two divorced groups did not differ significantly from one another . Again , these comparisons are adjusted for the factors listed previously . <p> Grades in School <p> Interestingly , eighth-grade students in the three groups showed a different pattern of disparities with respect to the marks they received in school . Those in both the Stay Married and Single Parent groups had above-average grades . According to their parents , they got mostly As or Bs . Students in the Remarried group were below average . While not failing , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographic factors , the average grades of students in the Remarried group were at the 42nd percentile , significantly lower than those of students in the Married group , who were at the 55th percentile . Students in the Single Parent group were at the 57th percentile , not significantly different from the Married group . These " report card " differences were consistent with the relative performance of students in the three groups on the reading , math , and science assessments that were administered as part of the eighth-grade round of the ECLS-K . <p> Is a Stable Single-Parent Family Better for Children ? <p> In sum , both children in stable single-parent families and those in stable stepfamilies evidenced more emotional , behavior , and learning problems following the divorce , or the divorce and remarriage , of their parents . They did not evidence such problems in kindergarten , prior to the divorce . The single-parent families clearly experienced a decline in their financial circumstances following divorce . Yet this decline did not prevent children from getting good grades in eighth grade , comparable to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the teens from single-parent families showed more symptoms of anxiety and depression at home , as well as more distractible and impulsive behavior . They were twice as likely to have been suspended from school as teens whose parents stayed married . Their problem behavior levels remained elevated after statistical controls for family income and poverty . <p> The teens in remarried families were better off financially than those in single-parent families , and their family resources were comparable to those of teens in stably married families . Yet they had worse grades and were three times as likely to have been suspended as the students whose parents stayed married . They also showed more symptoms of anxiety and depression at home , and more distractible and impulsive behavior . Of course , these children had experienced two major upheavals between kindergarten and eighth grade : the divorce of their birth parents and the remarriage of the birth parent with whom they were living . The children in the single-parent group went through only one upheaval : divorce . <p> As previous studies have shown , the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionship and supervision that a stepparent can provide , do not immunize children against the negative psychological effects of the stress and divided loyalties that they suffer following the divorce of their birth parents.8 In fact , the new spouses attempts to assume a parental role and his or her claims on the biological parents affection may actually exacerbate the internal conflicts that children experience . <p> On the face of it , the findings suggest that remaining in a stable single-parent family during the elementary-school years is better for adolescent behavior and achievement than having the custodial birth parent remarry . However , the apparent behavioral differences between the single-parent and remarried groups were not statistically reliable . The lack of statistical significance is probably due to the relatively small number of children in the single-parent and remarried-parent groups and the consequently large sizes of the standard errors around the group means . The emotional wellbeing and behavior of teens in both groups were reliably worse than those of adolescents whose parents remained married throughout their childhoods . <p> Family transitions like divorce and remarriage are complex processes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes what and which aspects of family life are most significant for the wellbeing of children and adults involved in these major life changes . Disentangling the complex causal web is beyond the limited scope of the present analysis . Several published papers have used sophisticated statistical methodology and the ECLS-K data to try to clarify causal questions.9 I urge the interested reader to examine them . What I hope is clear from the present analysis is that , even in relatively advantaged families , family disruption and reconstitution have effects on children that show up in school . And these effects are not simply attributable to poverty .

@@89588436 @5088436/ <p> Though much of the public seems unaware of it , family scholars believe thatgenerally speakingchildren are best off growing up with their two married parents . These are the children most likely to get the education crucial for maintaining a middle-class life in an advanced economy , to remain stably employed , and to marry and raise their own children to go on and do the same . <p> But it is not well understood why the married coupleor nuclear familyworks so well for kids . The most intriguing explanation Ive seen can be found in a little-known 2002 book by the sociologist Brigitte Berger : The Family in the Modern Age . It recalls an old-fashioned era of sociology . There are no charts , regressions , or metrics ; it is , rather , an exposition of economic , social , and demographic history . Yet it manages to anticipate and explain what todays empirically grounded sociologists have repeatedly discovered about families and child wellbeing . <p> And so to Bergers history : Not so long ago , family scholars labored under the assumption , half-Marxist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution , the extended family was the norm in the Western world . There was more than a little romanticism associated with this view : extended families were imagined to have lived in warm , cohesive rural communities where men and women worked together on farms or in small cottage industries . That way of life , went the thinking , ended when industrialization wrenched rural folk away from their cottages and villages into the teeming , anonymous city , sent men into the factories , and consigned women to domestic drudgery . Worse , by upending the household economy , the Industrial Revolution seriously weakened the family . The nuclear family , it was believed , was evidence of family decline . <p> The nuclear family was the dominant arrangement in England stretching back to the thirteenth century . <p> But by the second half of the twentieth century , one by one these assumptions were overturned . First to go was the alleged prevalence of the extended family . Combing through English parish records and other demographic sources , historians like Peter Laslett and Alan MacFarlane discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " simple house , " as Laslett put itwas the dominant arrangement in England stretching back to the thirteenth century . <p> Rather than remaining in or marrying into the family home , as was the case in Southern Europe and many parts of Asia and the Middle East , young couples in England were expected to establish their own household . That meant that men and women married later than in other parts of the world , only after they had saved enough money to set up an independent home . By the time they were ready to tie the knot , their own parents were often deceased , making multi-generational households a relative rarity . <p> Far from being weaker than an extended family clan , Berger shows , the ordinary nuclear family was able to adapt superbly to changing economic and political realities . In fact , the family arrangement so common to England helps explain why it and other nations of northwest Europe were the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution , the launching ground for modern affluence . The young nuclear family had to be flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forced to rely on their own ingenuity , its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving . <p> These habits were of little use to the idle , landed rich who were wedded to , and defined by , the ancestral property : think Downton Abbey . Similarly , in extended families , a newly married couple was required to move in with the larger maternal or paternal clan , and to work the family land or maintain the family trade . Under those circumstances , people , particularly women , married young , generally before 20 . Between their youth and dependence , the couple was not capable of becoming effective strivers in a changing economy . <p> Another less appreciated advantage to the nuclear family : it was uniquely child-centered . <p> These observations are not unique to The Family in the Modern Age . But Berger finds another less appreciated advantage to the nuclear family : it was uniquely child-centered . In societies that rely on extended families , young women had plenty of time to have five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , had fewer fertile years ahead of them and smaller families , which enabled them to provide more focused attention on each child . Their children became part of a household already steeped in an ethos of hard work , future-mindedness , and ingenuity . This prepared them to take advantage of the new modes of labor introduced by the Industrial Revolution , which would eventually create an urbanized middle class . <p> Over time , with the increasing complexity of the labor market and the arrival of mass schooling , forward-thinking , child-centered parents were best equipped to organize themselves around what Berger calls " the familys great educational mission . " Extended and clan families under the control of an older generation would be less adaptive since grandparents were more likely to bring up baby the old-fashioned way ; larger families , meanwhile , tended to encourage older children to take charge of their younger siblings . <p> So how does all of this help us understand todays debates about married couple vs. single-parent families ? Researchers find that children growing up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills " like self-control and perseverance that are more crucial than ever to school and labor-market success . Some of this could be chalked up to the logistical problems faced by a single parent . <p> But if we follow the logic of Bergers history , another explanation presents itself : the children of married couples are internalizing their parents bourgeois aspirations and child-centeredness , both of which lie deep in the bones of the institution they have chosen to enter . Contemporary parents continue to marry lateat least those who do marryand only after they are equipped to teach their kids the skills that they themselves have already learned . Their parenting style can be described as " concerted cultivation " : they devote great time and attention to developing their childrens skills . Single parents tend to be younger , less-educated , and more inclined to believe in the childs " natural growth , " to use another of Annette Lareaus terms . <p> Helicopter parents with their obsessive interest in their childrens physical , emotional , and cognitive development are the latest , if occasionally absurd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has for centuries now , their child-centeredness and future-oriented planning appears to be paying off .

Almost as many ( 45 percent ) live in single-parent families , most with their mothers only .

But the Census findings do give an indication of the challenges we face in trying to ensure that all children experience a stable and supportive family life .

@@89588444 @5088444/ <p> A new working paper by three economists contains grim news for parents of many kids : Gaining siblings modestly reduces childrens scores on cognitive tests , worsens their behavior , increases their risk of criminal conviction and pregnancy as teens , and lowers their educational attainment and earnings in young adulthood . Yet members of large families might take heart from some lesser-known findings about family size that I 'll share below . <p> Analysis by the new papers coauthorsChinhui Juhn , Yona Rubinstein , and C. Andrew Zuppannsuggests that the time shortage of parents with more children is one important factor behind their results . Having another child does not seem to deprive the familys older child(ren) of parental affection or intellectually stimulating resources in the household , or cause the home to become unsafe or overly messy , but it does mean the older child(ren) will spend less enriching time with their parents , even beyond the new babys infant and toddler years . <p> Juhn et al . do not dwell on parental income in their paper ; however , prior research indicates that the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , parents of larger families are less likely to pay for their childrens college education , and having a college degree and minimal student loan debt gives young adults a better start in life . <p> Juhn and her colleagues reached their conclusions after examining twenty-six years of detailed data on thousands of American mothers and children who participated in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the associated Children and Young Adult Survey . Instead of directly comparing children from different family sizes to one another , they used three methods designed to control for possible confounding factors , such as looking at how individual children behaved and performed cognitively before and after their parents had another child . <p> How Much Does Family Size Matter ? <p> On average and controlling for several demographic and background factors , the researchers find , " raising final family size by an additional child reduces average schooling of children by -0.13 years " not a whole lot . <p> Their estimates based on the outcomes of older children in families with twins are more striking . By early adulthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to have graduated high school , 7.46 percentage points more likely to have been convicted of a crime , and 9.36 percentage points more likely to have experienced teen pregnancy than comparable young people from families without twins , and their educational attainment is 0.395 years lower . ( Again , that 's controlling for background characteristics of mothers and children . ) <p> Examining families with twins offers advantages and disadvantages . They have had a " plausibly exogenous increase in family size , " or an increase unrelated to the familys other characteristics , meaning " differences in outcomes for older children in households with twins versus households without twins can thus be interpreted as a causal estimate of how family size affects outcomes , " per the paper . Having twins is relatively uncommon , however , so even in the large overall sample of the NLSY , there were only 142 children who had younger siblings who were twins , which the coauthors considered a drawback . And its possible that raising twins is harder for parents than having two additional kids who are spaced apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of gaining a sibling on children depend on several other factors , such as their gender , their mothers marital status , their mothers score on the Armed Forces Qualification Testa measure of math and verbal abilityand possibly their home country . The arrival of a new sibling has " large and significant " negative effects on girls cognitive scores , according to Juhn and her coauthors , but small and statistically insignificant effects on boys cognitive scores . The negative effect on behavioral problems , however , is larger for boys than for girls . <p> Less surprising is the significance of parents marital status . Children of mothers who are married ( as of the survey wave prior to the birth of the new child ) are less negatively affected by new siblings than children of single mothers , Juhn told me via email . Presumably that 's because two parents can usually offer more financial and time resources than one . Juhn added that " the effects are still there and strong for the married mothers , " meaning the findings are not all driven by single-parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family size on kids . As Juhn , Rubinstein , and Zuppann explain in their paper : <p> For children with mothers with below median AFQT scores , the arrival of younger siblings has large and significantly negative effects on cognitive skills while for children with mothers with above median scores , the effects are much smaller and not significant . With regards to the " Behavioral Problems " index , however , the results are opposite . It is the children of high ability mothers who are more likely to act up when a younger sibling arrives . <p> The economists found that mothers with above-median AFQT scores cut their work hours more than other mothers after having an additional child , and believe this divergence could help explain the varying cognitive effects of new siblings on kids . They note , too , that mothers with higher AFQT scores likely have access to other resources such as better child care and more generous maternity leave , which should make it easier to support a larger family successfully . <p> Public Institutions and Community Norms <p> Earlier studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to another . Juhn et al . cite research showing that in India and China , as in the U.S. , having more siblings lowers childrens educational attainment , whereas in Israel and Norway , there is no negative association between family size and schooling when careful statistical techniques are used . The coauthors believe these conflicting findings could result from differences in countries public safety nets and education systems . Family size may be relatively important in the U.S. because of our relatively weak safety net and public education system . <p> Other research hints at yet another factor determining the importance of family size : the norms and social integration of a familys community . Douglas Downey , a sociologist at Ohio State University , reports the following : <p> Studies reporting weak relationships between number of siblings and educational outcomes are typically ones that have studied individuals from highly integrated communities with norms supporting large families such as Mormons in the U.S. and Muslim Arabs in Israel . One reason for this pattern may be that a child in this type of community has a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childs well-beingaunts , uncles , older cousins , grandparents , and other adultsand this feature buffers the dilution process occurring within the nuclear family . <p> The factors influencing the magnitude of the negative effects of family size suggest several ways ( albeit not easy ones ) to mitigate them . Ensuring that all families , not only those with high incomes and cognitive abilities , have access to good schools and beneficial work-family policies would be one place to start . Helping couples with children to get and stay married , and involving extended family and community members in caring for children , may also help . <p> The Benefits of Big Families <p> Despite the disadvantages documented above , having siblings appears to help children in some ways . Kids with siblings have greater social skills than those without , and married people who grew up with more siblings are less likely to divorce , controlling for many background factors . One can imagine other tradeoffs as well . Only children may benefit from their parents undivided time and attention in childhood , but wish in adulthood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caring for their aging parents . Kids in big families might spend their childhood bickering and competing with their siblings , but form close relationships with them in adulthoodor vice versa . <p> Finally , the latest published research indicates that the effect of siblings on social skills , at least , hinges on the quality of sibling relationships . In short , the benefits and drawbacks of different family sizes vary between families and over the course of a lifetime , in ways that parents cant always predict .

Wives cook it . " He went on to describe a new model of marriage , which he calls the high-investment parenting ( HIP ) marriage modelwhere both wives and husbands tackle family life in an egalitarian spirit , " recasting family responsibilities , with couples sharing the roles of both child-raiser and money-maker " as the dominant model of married family life for the twenty-first century . <p> While it is certainly true that the 1950s-style " Leave It to Beaver " model of family life is dead and gone , Reeves article obscures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life remains genderedat least for most married couples with childrenin ways that often come closer to mimicking the division of labor of Claire and Phil Dunphy on " Modern Family " than the egalitarian model advanced by Reeves .

Pew estimates that married mothers also do about 68 percent of the housework . <p> Take work hours . Similar patterns can be found when it comes to the amount of time that married fathers and mothers devote to the paid labor force .

Sociologist Pamela Stone , for instance , has argued that " women are not opting out but are instead being pushed out of the workplace . " This is certainly true for some married mothers . <p> But most married mothers in the U.S. tilt in a more neo-traditional than egalitarian direction when it comes to their preferences . In fact , more than three quarters of married mothers do not wish to work full-time : 53 percent prefer part-time work and 23 percent prefer to be stay-at-home mothers .

Prior research suggests that the short answer to that question is " both , " but analyses in a new Census report underline that even after accounting for background factors to the extent possible , having one 's first child outside of marriage is associated for women with worse economic well-being and greater instability down the roadwith negative implications for their kids . <p> Controlling for " the mothers race , Hispanic origin , nativity , age at first birth , years since first birth , and number of children ever born , " researchers ran four logistic regression models to examine the relationship between a woman 's relationship status at the time of her first birth and that woman 's educational attainment , employment , marital status , and family complexity at the time of the survey in 2012 .

Researchers have discovered a lot about the struggles that lead to marital breakdown and the factors that raise or lower couples divorce risk . Strangely , however , we know little about how people consider the option of divorce . What are spouses thinking as they ponder it ? How often and how long have they been having these thoughts ? What marital problems are they facing , and what do they do to address them ? <p> This report provides some answers to these questions from a new national survey of 3,000 individuals ages 25 to 50 who have been married at least one year .

A sizeable minority report having thought about divorce in the last six months . <p> Most spouses who had recently considered divorce want to stay innot leavetheir marriageand fix their problems . <p> Many respondents had thought about divorce in the past but decided to stay married , and almost all of them are glad they did .

Taking direct action to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be the primary path for repairing relationships . <p> One in Four Spouses Has Recently Thought About Divorce <p> Overall , we found that one in four spouses in our national survey had thought about divorce in the last six months . And this number did n't  begin to drop off until people had been married 15 to 20 years . But most of this group had recently thought about divorce only a few times , rather than a lot . About half had been thinking about divorce for more than a year . A significant number said they did n't  really want a divorce and they were willing to work hard on the marriage ( 43 percent ) , or they were willing to work on the marriage if their spouse got serious about making some important changes ( 23 percent ) . Only a few ( 5 percent ) said they were done with the marriage . <p> These infrequent thinkers were reasonably hopeful that their relationship had what it takes to overcome their challenges . They were more likely to report less intense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the tougher problems of infidelity , abuse , and addiction ( 43 percent ) . ( Less intense problems included things like growing apart or losing connection , losing romantic feelings , not paying enough attention to the marriage , and money disagreements . ) <p> Even among those experiencing the harder problems , a third said they really did n't  want a divorce and were willing to work hard on the marriage ; another 25 percent said they would work hard on the marriage if their spouse made some major changes . Ninety percent of all thinkers had not taken legal action to obtain a divorce . Also , most of them were trying to take some action to work on the relationship , although our in-depth interviews revealed that many spouses in this group were struggling with just how to move forward . Thinking about divorcing or staying married occupied a considerable amount of emotional energy and was not something our interviewees took lightly . <p> More sophisticated statistical analyses of responses to many of the questions in the survey confirmed that there are two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be thinking about divorce frequently . In addition , they had higher levels of problems in their marriages , both the more common as well as the more severe kinds . They were less hopeful about the future of their relationship than the other group . Moreover , they were much more likely to say they were done with the marriage ( although this was still a small proportion of the group ) or to say they had mixed feelings about a divorce . The label serious thinkers fits this group well . <p> In contrast , nearly 90 percent of the other group said they had thought about divorce only a few times in the last six months ; only 1 percent said they had been thinking about it a lot . This group reported lower levels of marital problems of all types , and they were more hopeful about the prospects for their marriage . Also , they were almost three times as likely as serious thinkers to say that they did not want a divorce and were willing to work hard to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( " Soft " thinking is n't necessarily fleeting or painless , however : in our in-depth interviews we discovered that soft thinkers can still be confused , discouraged , and hurting . ) Based on this analysis combining many questions , 53 percent of spouses who had thought about divorce recently were soft thinkers ; 47 percent were serious thinkers . The differences between these groups are illustrated in the chart below . <p> Thoughts and Actions <p> Divorce is a scary thing to think about , so we tend to assume people will tolerate a lot of marital problems before starting to consider it . That one in four married people have recently pondered divorce does not seem to bear out this assumption . In a culture with high divorce rates and widespread concerns about the fragility of marriage , perhaps it is hard not to have some thoughts about divorce when problems and disappointments arise in marriage . Its difficult to swim upstream against such a strong cultural current . <p> Furthermore , thoughts about divorce do n't  have to be a sign of impending marital doom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from serious , even dangerous , problems , so thoughts about divorce may take people in that direction appropriately . But usually thoughts about divorce are just that : thoughts , not concrete actions , decisions , or deep doubts . Even among those in our study with more serious reasons for thinking about divorce recently , few said that they were done with the marriage ; a third said they did n't  really want a divorce and were willing to work hard on their marriage . ( About half had mixed feelings . ) Thinking about divorce could spur efforts to strengthen or repair a relationship . <p> Does this mean that soft thinkers are not at risk for divorce ? Probably not . Thoughts are different from actions but clearly can influence them over time . Even " soft , " occasional thoughts about divorce can color peoples perceptions of a relationship , shaping their feelings in more negative ways that can make marriages less satisfying and more fragile . Furthermore , decisions to remain married could be short-term strategies rather than long-term decisions , and the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , we should n't assume that any thoughts about divorce signal impending doom , even if they do suggest greater risk . <p> Addressing and Outlasting Marital Problems <p> Some spouses who reported thoughts about divorce while taking our survey said in interviews a few weeks later that now they were not thinking about divorce . And we also discovered that many people go through tough times in their marriage and not only survive but thrive . In fact , our survey found that more than one in four respondents ( 28 percent ) had thought their marriage was in serious trouble at some point in the past , but had not thought so recently . Nearly 90 percent of them said they were glad they were still married ; less than 1 percent were not glad to be together . So it seems people regularly do work through or outlast their problems . <p> When these " survivors " were asked what helped them through their rough patches , more than 90 percent said , " Over time , things changed and just got better or werent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to keeping my marriage/family together was strong . " Also , " I/my spouse worked at fixing some problems and improving our relationship " was endorsed as helpful by nearly all who reported serious marital problems in the past . About one in four survivors got some counseling ( as individuals or with their spouses ) , and most of them ( 75 percent ) said it was helpful . Patience , perseverance , promises , and some relationship " perspiration " helped many people resolve their marital problems . <p> We hope the findings from our study can help those who are thinking about divorce understand how common their thoughts are and maybe even make them a little less scary . Perhaps , too , our findings can provide them some direction and hope .

@@89588449 @5088449/ <p> In many romantic relationships , one partner desires a higher level of commitmentengagement or marriagewhile the other is content to let the relationship stay in its current form . I suspect that , in about two-thirds of these cases , the partner seeking more commitment is the woman while the man drags his feet . And that 's certainly in line with contemporary cultural stereotypes . <p> The fact that men are legendarily wary of marriage is stranger than it first appears . Both men and women benefit from marriage , but men seem to benefit more overall . In addition to being happier and healthier than bachelors , married men earn more money and live longer . And men can reap such benefits even from mediocre marriages , while for women , the benefits of marriage are more strongly linked to marital quality . <p> Moreover , according to several surveys dating to around a decade ago , men are more likely than women to say that its better to get married than to go through life single , and among the unmarried , men are more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . Some recent surveys , however , suggest this difference may have lessened or even flipped , although we still find men a bit more likely than women to endorse the importance of marriage in our labs national sample of unmarried individuals . <p> Logically , then , men should be the ones pursuing marriage : they seem to view it as desirable , and they are more likely than women to gain major benefits from it . So why would men hesitate to tie the knot ? <p> I believe that men resist marriage more than women primarily because they believe marriage requires a substantial increase in their behavioral commitmentand they do n't  always feel ready for that transition . Three sources lend support to this theory : ( 1 ) qualitative , focus group research by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and David Popenoe presented in 2002 ; ( 2 ) the findings and conclusions of sociologist Steve Nock ; and ( 3 ) the work of my colleagues and me on sacrifice and commitment . <p> Young men associate marriage with increased responsibilities and with a greater possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitehead and Popenoes research , which was published in the 2002 report of the National Marriage Project . The two drew on discussions they conducted with sixty never-married , heterosexual men , who came from a variety of religious , ethnic , and family backgrounds and ranged in age from 25 to 33 . These men reported that the main reason they resist marriage is that they can enjoy many of its benefits without actually getting marriedthat is , through cohabitation . Further , they reported experiencing almost no social pressures to marry ; not from family , not from friends , and not from the families of the women they live with . They associated marriage with a number of increased responsibilities and with a greater possibility of financial loss . I can not imagine that such beliefs are any less prevalent now . <p> On a lighter note , men said that one benefit of not marrying was that , if they were to marry , their girlfriend-now-wife would tell them what to do . This could be evidence of an inner view that , after marriagebut not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . This is totally consistent with the way stronger commitment transforms ones sense of a relationship . Its also amusing to me given the evidence of marriages health benefits for men . Most scholars assume that a major reason for these benefits is wives direct influence on their husbands behavior : " Thats your third beer tonightwhy do n't  you stop with that ? " " You need to go to the doctor and get that mole looked at . " " Youve been working late every night , running yourself ragged . Its time to cut back . " It seems younger men may ironically perceive as a drawback an aspect of marriage that is associated with good health and a longer life . <p> Second , according to the work of sociologist Steve Nock , marriage changes men in fundamental ways . In his book Marriage in Mens Lives ( 1998 ) , he discussed how mens belief systems about themselves and their wives change when they cross the line . His argument rests on the potency of the social role of " husband . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fathers , providers , and protectors when they transition into marriage . <p> These changes in identity are associated with behavioral changes . For example , men earn more income when they 're married , work more , spend less time with friends apart from marriage and family , and spend more time with family and in the community in which the family is embedded . ( Causality can be argued , but research strategies designed to account for selection effects suggest that on at least some of these measures , marriage does have a causal impact . ) In Nocks thesis , marriage brings large changes in identity for men , and those changes are all in the direction of the expectation of increased responsibility to care for others . The data are more scarce on how women change when they get married ; however , there seems to be less reason to believe that women have a similar sense that they or their responsibilities will change dramatically when they get married . <p> Men begin to see themselves as fathers , providers , and protectors when they transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage provides another window on potential differences between men and women . My colleagues and I have found that commitment to the future is more important in explaining male attitudes about sacrifice in marriage than female attitudes about sacrifice . There are a number of possible interpretations of findings like this . For example , women may be more socialized to give to others , regardless of the commitment status of a particular relationship . <p> But I have a hypothesis that goes further : For men to sacrifice for their partners without resenting it , they need to have decided that a particular woman is the one they plan to be with in the future . They need to have decided that " this woman is my future , " and once theyve decided , the internal transformation occurs . In contrast , I believe that the average woman sacrifices more fully , starting earlier on in romantic relationships , than the average man . <p> To summarize the main point , getting married has historically brought a large change in how men see themselves and how they behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in mens committed behavior , it would explain the stereotype of women pushing for marriage and men resisting . Over thousands of years of history , women would have come to expect a substantial change in men from tying the knot . <p> There may be groups where my theory simply does not hold , or it may no longer hold the way it may have at one time . A number of sociologists have found that the motives to get married or to avoid marriage may be different for those at lower incomes than for those who are middle- or higher-income . Some working-class women , for instance , have revealed in interviews that they resist marriage because it is harder to exit than cohabitating relationships . Further , they reported that men would expect a more traditional division of duties by gender in marriage than is expected in cohabitation . In other words , they reported that the men they knew would , indeed , change after getting marriedbut that the change would be negative for these women , so they resist marriage . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different for those at lower incomes . <p> It is doubtless true that womens increased economic opportunities , as well as the changes in the roles of men and women in families , may substantially alter the types of commitment dynamics Ive described . Yet there is a potent counterweight to how far some things can change , and that has to do with the fundamental fact that women get pregnant and men do not . As some scholars argue , given the high personal costs of pregnancy and childbirth to women , it has been crucial throughout human history for women to accurately discern ( and if possible , increase ) the commitment levels of men . The fact that females have better options and personal resources now than in past eras may well change the equation underlying my thesis , but some behavioral differences between men and women seem very likely to remain because of the biological constraint . <p> Regardless of how much the behavior of males and females may change in the years ahead , I believe that Steve Nock had it right when , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing , he predicted that marriage would become an increasingly potent signal of commitment as other relationship forms become more common ( i.e. , cohabitation ) . Not all relationship transitions are transformative , but marriage is meant to be . That means it matters . <p> This piece was adapted from a longer scholarly paper by Scott Stanley , available here , which contains additional background and relevant citations.

And rightly so : Sex plays an important role in the quality and stability of men and womens lives and relationships . Politics are also on our mind a lot , especially given an era of mega-partisanship and a uniquely divisive president in office . Our two parties offer divergent views about the role of sex in American society . Does this translate into different sexual behavior for Democrats and Republicans ? <p> Previously in this blog , W. Bradford Wilcox and I described political differences in family life : Republicans tend to have happier marriages than do Democrats . We showed this finding could be explained by two factors , race and church attendance . On average , whites have happier marriages than African Americans , and the former are much more likely to be Republicans . Republicans are also more likely to be churchgoers , which in turn leads to happier relationships . <p> This finding left me curious about how specific components of relational bliss might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans have more sex than Democrats and cheat less on their spouses . Political independents have sex even more often than Republicans but cheat at the same rate Democrats do . Republican sexual frequency is entirely explained by the fact that they 're more likely to be married than are Democrats . On the other hand , there 's no obvious explanation for the partisan difference in adultery . <p> I explore the effects of party I 'd on sexual behavior using 25 years of data from the General Social Survey , an omnibus survey that 's been conducted annually or biennially since 1972 . I rely on a somewhat vague question about sex : " About how often did you have sex during the last 12 months ? " This may or may not refer to vaginal intercourse , but that probably does n't  matter much for the non-procreative benefits of sexual activity . Slightly over half ( 53% ) of my sample reports having sex at least once a week . <p> As Figure 1 shows , this is especially likely to be true for independents and Republicans . My baseline statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , race/ethnicity , sex , and the calendar year the survey was completed . The results show that independents and Republicans are , respectively , 22% and 11% more likely to have weekly sex compared to Democrats ( in other words , independents have the most sex and Democrats have the least ) . The absolute differences in sexual frequency are n't  largeonly a few percentage pointsbut they are large enough to be statistically significant . <p> Note : * indicates the gap in sexual frequency between Republicans or independents and Democrats is statistically significant . <p> The more active sex lives of Republicans are entirely the product of political differences in marriage : married Americans are more likely to be Republicans , and anyone with a live-in relationship has more sex than does an otherwise comparable single person . <p> Its harder to understand why independents have more sex than do their peers without stronger partisan leanings . Socioeconomic status ( SES ) measured by education , employment , and family incomeaccounts for about a third of the independent-Democrat sex gap . Further analysis indicates that education is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might that be ? Weirdly , Americans with four-year college degrees are far less likely to have weekly sexabout a quarter less likely , according to the GSSand independents are less likely to have college degrees than are either Democrats or Republicans . There is certainly a lot to think about here , but in short , education is part of the story behind sexually-active independents . <p> Even after adjusting for differences in relationship statussingle , married , cohabitingand SES , independents are still more likely to have weekly sex than are Democrats or , for that matter , Republicans . What gives ? Political science suggests that a relatively small number of independents are probably responsible . Published 25 years ago , The Myth of the Independent Voter showed that most independents are really just crypto-partisans in their beliefs . As such , we would expect them to behave more like either Democrats or Republicans . True independents , small in numbers , are generally detached from political beliefs , let alone political participation . Why these independents may be especially sexually active awaits future inquiry . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of party identification on marital infidelity . Democrats and independents cheat on their spouses at equal rates , but Republicans have starkly lower rates of infidelity . Controlling only for survey year and basic demographic differences between respondents ( age , sex , race/ethnicity ) , Republicans have 23% lower odds of cheating than do Democrats . The adultery gap between independents and Republicans is nearly as large . <p> Note : * indicates that the gap in extramarital sex between Republicans and Democrats is statistically significant . <p> Measured respondent attributes can explain approximately half of the partisan gap in infidelity . Socioeconomic status does n't  make any appreciable difference , but marital status and church attendance do matter . Marital status measures whether respondents remain in potentially adulterous marriages at the time of the survey ( obviously , adulterous marriages are far more likely to dissolve ) . Given the strong association between marital status and party identification , its not surprising that current marital status can help explain the association between political beliefs and being in or having been in an adulterous union . Church attendance also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd . Republicans go to church more , and churchgoers cheat less . <p> Last year , Bradley Wright looked at adultery by political orientation on this blog . He did n't  conduct multivariate analysis in an attempt to understand why Democrats cheat more , but nevertheless shed some light on the topic : the political gap in adultery is driven by the 31% of party affiliates who consider themselves " strong " Democrats . Its not impossible that some of these Democrats might have different ideas about sex than other Americans . This speculation is abetted by the broad General Social Survey measure of extramarital sex : " Have you ever had sex with someone other than your husband or wife while you were married ? " Although this probably means adultery the vast majority of the time , the wording does n't  rule out polyamory or other forms of consensual nonmonogamy . <p> No authoritative estimate of nonmonogamous relationships in the United States exists . On the basis of extrapolation , one researcher estimated a consensually nonmonogamous population of 9.8 million . Based on my decades as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a ceiling . Even if its several times too high , it still implies that a small but noteworthy percentage of Americans would be producing what amounts to falsely positive results if the GSS is presumed to be measuring adultery per se . <p> Could this be contributing to the propensity for higher rates of extramarital sex among strongly partisan Democrats ? I have no way of knowing with these data , but its certainly possible . But its not the whole story . In the unlikely event there really are almost 10 million polyamorous Americans , its still not enough to explain the partisan gap in extramarital sex ( indeed , presumably some polyamorists are Republicans ) . Finally , I should n't overlook the most basic explanation : Republicans might be simply more inclined to lie about adultery than Democrats . More insight here could be gained from a survey that asked both spouses about their politics and their sexual behavior . <p> Very few of us would deny that sex is important in myriad ways . Its a noteworthy component of satisfaction in romantic relationships . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the scientific literature on relationship satisfaction .

@@89588452 @5088452/ <p> Progressive scholars have emphasized economic explanations for the retreat from marriage , whereas conservative scholars have stressed shortfalls in public policy . In perhaps the most well-known account , sociologist William Julius Wilson argued that the shift to a post-industrial economy starting in the 1970s undercut the availability of good jobs for men , thereby making them less " marriageable. " 1 In contrast , political scientist Charles Murray contends that the increased generosity of welfare benefits in the late 1960s and 1970s played a key role by reducing the need for male breadwinners in lower-income communities and thereby eroded the practical and normative importance of marriage.2 <p> Studies find qualified support for both the liberal and the conservative position , though neither can fully account for either the overall retreat from marriage or the growing educational divide in marriage . Welfare benefits have been linked to higher rates of nonmarital childbearing and lower levels of marriage.3 But the evidence is mixed , and the explanatory power of welfare is modest at best.4 Likewise , economic **32;91;TOOLONG , deunionization , the declining ratio of mens to womens income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have played a role in the retreat from marriage , especially among African Americans and the less educated.5 Nevertheless , economic factors account for only a modest portion of the dramatic retreat from marriage.6 <p> The fact that neither public policy nor economics can fully explain the retreat from marriage suggests that we must incorporate cultural and civic factors into any serious consideration of family trends over the past half-century . In particular , shifts in attitudes , aspirations , and norms , coupled with declining participation in secular and religious civic institutions , have undercut the social pressure to marry , to have children within marriage , and to stay married . But let us be clear : By considering cultural and civic factors , were not advancing individualistic or " personal responsibility " explanations for the retreat from marriage . Culture and civil society are collectively produced , just as much as economics and public policy . Moreover , changing economic conditions have made some Americans particularly susceptible to cultural conditions that undercut marriage.7 <p> Since the late 1960s , five cultural trends have been particularly consequential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " expressive individualism " the idea that personal desires trump social obligationsmeans that Americans feel less obligated to get and stay married , and have come to expect more fulfillment from marriage . In turn , rising expectations for marriage have made Americans more hesitant to marry , quicker to divorce , and less likely to believe that marriage and parenthood must be bundled together.8 <p> Second , the changes in mores and behavior associated with the sexual revolution diminished the connection between sex , marriage , and parenthood , thereby making marriage less necessary and nonmarital childbearing more acceptable and more common.9 Third , second-wave feminism , which arose concurrently with womens rising labor force participation in the 1960s and 1970s , fostered a sense of independence among women and raised their expectations for equality and intimacy in marriage , all of which reduced the imperative to get and stay married.10 Fourth , an increasing number of children were reared in nonintact families.11 Many became pessimistic about their own prospects for a lasting marriage , so they remained unmarried.12 Together these developments made a family-centered ethos less central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth cultural trend : what sociologist Andrew Cherlin calls the transition from a " cornerstone " to a " capstone " model of marriage . Men and women became less likely to see marriage as a foundation for adulthood , as the exclusive venue for sexual intimacy and parenthood , and as a " union card for membership in the adult world . " 13 Instead , marriage became an opportunity for men and women to consecrate their arrival as successful adults , to signal that they were now confident they could achieve a fulfilling romantic relationship built on a secure , middle-class lifestyle . The advent of the capstone model of marriage means that more Americans see marriage as out of their reach , given the perceived economic and emotional requirements to get married nowadays.14 Consequently , Americans are spending less of their lives within the bonds of matrimony . <p> The collective result of these cultural changes is that a less family-oriented , more individualistic approach to relationships , marriage , and family life has gained ground since the 1960s . For instance , young adults have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1970s , less than 40 percent of high school seniors thought that having a child outside of marriage was " experimenting with a worthwhile lifestyle " or " not affecting anyone else . " By the early 2000s , that figure stood at more than 55 percent.15 In sum , expressive individualism , the sexual revolution , feminism , the growing number of children reared in nonintact families , and the rise of the capstone model of marriage all coalesced to weaken the social and behavioral connections among sex , marriage , and parenthood . Consequently , stable marriage functions far less as an anchor and guide to adult life and to the bearing and rearing of children . <p> The retreat from marriage has been fueled by a parallel retreat in American civil society , especially with respect to religious participation . In Bowling Alone , political scientist Robert Putnam documented how many forms of secular and religious civic engagement , from membership in the Shriners to church attendance , have declined since the 1960s.16 Figure 2 shows the downward trend in regular religious attendance ( attending several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally supplied Americans with social solidarity , moral guidance , financial support , and family-friendly social networks , all of which reinforce the marriage norm and strengthen family life .

First , cultural shifts that gathered steam in the late 1960s and the 1970s undercut a cornerstone model of marriage as the preeminent venue for sex , childbearing and childrearing , mutual aid , and economic supportall understood to be secured by an ethic of marital permanence .

Prior research suggests that the short answer to that question is " both , " but analyses in a new Census report underline that even after accounting for background factors to the extent possible , having one 's first child outside of marriage is associated for women with worse economic well-being and greater instability down the roadwith negative implications for their kids . <p> Controlling for " the mothers race , Hispanic origin , nativity , age at first birth , years since first birth , and number of children ever born , " researchers ran four logistic regression models to examine the relationship between a woman 's relationship status at the time of her first birth and that woman 's educational attainment , employment , marital status , and family complexity at the time of the survey in 2012 .

@@89588463 @5088463/ <p> In many romantic relationships , one partner desires a higher level of commitmentengagement or marriagewhile the other is content to let the relationship stay in its current form . I suspect that , in about two-thirds of these cases , the partner seeking more commitment is the woman while the man drags his feet . And that 's certainly in line with contemporary cultural stereotypes . <p> The fact that men are legendarily wary of marriage is stranger than it first appears . Both men and women benefit from marriage , but men seem to benefit more overall . In addition to being happier and healthier than bachelors , married men earn more money and live longer . And men can reap such benefits even from mediocre marriages , while for women , the benefits of marriage are more strongly linked to marital quality . <p> Moreover , according to several surveys dating to around a decade ago , men are more likely than women to say that its better to get married than to go through life single , and among the unmarried , men are more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . Some recent surveys , however , suggest this difference may have lessened or even flipped , although we still find men a bit more likely than women to endorse the importance of marriage in our labs national sample of unmarried individuals . <p> Logically , then , men should be the ones pursuing marriage : they seem to view it as desirable , and they are more likely than women to gain major benefits from it . So why would men hesitate to tie the knot ? <p> I believe that men resist marriage more than women primarily because they believe marriage requires a substantial increase in their behavioral commitmentand they do n't  always feel ready for that transition . Three sources lend support to this theory : ( 1 ) qualitative , focus group research by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and David Popenoe presented in 2002 ; ( 2 ) the findings and conclusions of sociologist Steve Nock ; and ( 3 ) the work of my colleagues and me on sacrifice and commitment . <p> Young men associate marriage with increased responsibilities and with a greater possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitehead and Popenoes research , which was published in the 2002 report of the National Marriage Project . The two drew on discussions they conducted with sixty never-married , heterosexual men , who came from a variety of religious , ethnic , and family backgrounds and ranged in age from 25 to 33 . These men reported that the main reason they resist marriage is that they can enjoy many of its benefits without actually getting marriedthat is , through cohabitation . Further , they reported experiencing almost no social pressures to marry ; not from family , not from friends , and not from the families of the women they live with . They associated marriage with a number of increased responsibilities and with a greater possibility of financial loss . I can not imagine that such beliefs are any less prevalent now . <p> On a lighter note , men said that one benefit of not marrying was that , if they were to marry , their girlfriend-now-wife would tell them what to do . This could be evidence of an inner view that , after marriagebut not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . This is totally consistent with the way stronger commitment transforms ones sense of a relationship . Its also amusing to me given the evidence of marriages health benefits for men . Most scholars assume that a major reason for these benefits is wives direct influence on their husbands behavior : " Thats your third beer tonightwhy do n't  you stop with that ? " " You need to go to the doctor and get that mole looked at . " " Youve been working late every night , running yourself ragged . Its time to cut back . " It seems younger men may ironically perceive as a drawback an aspect of marriage that is associated with good health and a longer life . <p> Second , according to the work of sociologist Steve Nock , marriage changes men in fundamental ways . In his book Marriage in Mens Lives ( 1998 ) , he discussed how mens belief systems about themselves and their wives change when they cross the line . His argument rests on the potency of the social role of " husband . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fathers , providers , and protectors when they transition into marriage . <p> These changes in identity are associated with behavioral changes . For example , men earn more income when they 're married , work more , spend less time with friends apart from marriage and family , and spend more time with family and in the community in which the family is embedded . ( Causality can be argued , but research strategies designed to account for selection effects suggest that on at least some of these measures , marriage does have a causal impact . ) In Nocks thesis , marriage brings large changes in identity for men , and those changes are all in the direction of the expectation of increased responsibility to care for others . The data are more scarce on how women change when they get married ; however , there seems to be less reason to believe that women have a similar sense that they or their responsibilities will change dramatically when they get married . <p> Men begin to see themselves as fathers , providers , and protectors when they transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage provides another window on potential differences between men and women . My colleagues and I have found that commitment to the future is more important in explaining male attitudes about sacrifice in marriage than female attitudes about sacrifice . There are a number of possible interpretations of findings like this . For example , women may be more socialized to give to others , regardless of the commitment status of a particular relationship . <p> But I have a hypothesis that goes further : For men to sacrifice for their partners without resenting it , they need to have decided that a particular woman is the one they plan to be with in the future . They need to have decided that " this woman is my future , " and once theyve decided , the internal transformation occurs . In contrast , I believe that the average woman sacrifices more fully , starting earlier on in romantic relationships , than the average man . <p> To summarize the main point , getting married has historically brought a large change in how men see themselves and how they behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in mens committed behavior , it would explain the stereotype of women pushing for marriage and men resisting . Over thousands of years of history , women would have come to expect a substantial change in men from tying the knot . <p> There may be groups where my theory simply does not hold , or it may no longer hold the way it may have at one time . A number of sociologists have found that the motives to get married or to avoid marriage may be different for those at lower incomes than for those who are middle- or higher-income . Some working-class women , for instance , have revealed in interviews that they resist marriage because it is harder to exit than cohabitating relationships . Further , they reported that men would expect a more traditional division of duties by gender in marriage than is expected in cohabitation . In other words , they reported that the men they knew would , indeed , change after getting marriedbut that the change would be negative for these women , so they resist marriage . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different for those at lower incomes . <p> It is doubtless true that womens increased economic opportunities , as well as the changes in the roles of men and women in families , may substantially alter the types of commitment dynamics Ive described . Yet there is a potent counterweight to how far some things can change , and that has to do with the fundamental fact that women get pregnant and men do not . As some scholars argue , given the high personal costs of pregnancy and childbirth to women , it has been crucial throughout human history for women to accurately discern ( and if possible , increase ) the commitment levels of men . The fact that females have better options and personal resources now than in past eras may well change the equation underlying my thesis , but some behavioral differences between men and women seem very likely to remain because of the biological constraint . <p> Regardless of how much the behavior of males and females may change in the years ahead , I believe that Steve Nock had it right when , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing , he predicted that marriage would become an increasingly potent signal of commitment as other relationship forms become more common ( i.e. , cohabitation ) . Not all relationship transitions are transformative , but marriage is meant to be .

But from Brexit to Donald Trump , the past year has served as a bracing reminder that history does not always head in a progressive direction , and that important constituencies of the progressive coalitionsuch as the white working classdo not always push history in a leftward direction . Now there are new signs that another prized progressive value , gender equality , may be in troublepartly thanks to key members of the progressive coalition . <p> New research indicates that young millennials , who many assumed would be torchbearersfor a more progressive approach to family life , actually take a more traditional view of family arrangements than Generation Xers and baby boomers when they were young adults .

From the 1970s to the 1990s , as baby boomers and Xers came of age , a growing share of young adults ages 18 to 25 rejected the view that it is " much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family .

@@89588478 @5088478/ <p> I 've felt oddly connected to Dorothy Day , the co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement , which is perhaps best known for its houses of hospitality for those on the margins , ever since I discovered an obscure entry in her diary from the year 1944 written during her visit to the small town of Foster , Ohio . Once a thriving place known for its summer island resort and dance hall , today , Foster is unknown except to the small number of people who live riverside in the old cottages and homes . Although I grew up just two miles away , I only recently discovered it , tucked out of sight from the new developments and likely to stay that way because of its location in the floodplain . <p> But I 'm drawn to the place , so whenever I can , I drive the detour , stealing glances to my right at the muddy water and admiring the arcing trees , vibrant green in spring , that make me feel as if I 'm driving through a wooded tunnel . <p> " The world will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . In her diary , she described reaching Foster and getting off the Greyhound bus " right at the edge of a meadow on the other side of a long bridgeThere is the sound of rushing water over a dam and now the river is swollen and turbulent from much rain . " I like to imagine her marvel at the common beauty of Fosternothing terribly out of the ordinary , and yet when the sun illuminates the tree leaves or the wind sends shivers across the waters surface , it is enough to take ones breath away . <p> " The world will be saved by beauty " is also the subtitle of a recent book about Day , written by her youngest granddaughter , Kate Hennessey . For those looking to better understand Days spirituality or the ins and outs of her work , this book may not be the best place to start , but it is a breathtaking and intimate portrait of Days young adult life and family relationships , particularly her relationship with her daughter , Tamar . As other reviewers have noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kaleidoscopic . " For me , it had the emotional power of a film . I did not read so much as " see " the book , which seems fitting given Days own predilection for the sensorymusic , particularly opera ; nature especially the sights and sounds of the Staten Island shore where she and Tamars father shared a cottage by the sea ; a good cup of coffee ( " coffee and a radioit is hard to imagine Dorothy without either one of them , " Henessey writes , describing how during the Depression her grandmother served the men on the line the best quality coffee she could afford , and recalling how Day would drink a cup each morning while reading the Psalms ) . <p> But Days love of beauty coexisted with , and was perhaps deepened by , a life of sufferinga " long loneliness " as she called it in her autobiography . Day did not like to talk about her pre-conversion life , skimming over it somewhat vaguely even in her autobiography . " Least said , soonest mended , " Hennessey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hennesseys bookshe brings before us a part of Days story that was heretofore only cursory , which , though painful , makes her even more relatable and her conversion all the more incredible . <p> While reading , I was struck by how true it is that Day is a figure for our times , a saint , perhaps , for the plight of the working class in an America " coming apart . " For what do they suffer that she did not ? As a young woman , she sat in a New York City cafT and held an acquaintance as he died of a heroin overdose . During her early twenties , she wandered through a revolving door of jobs and romantic relationships characterized by ambiguity and lack of commitment . She knew what it was like to live paycheck to paycheck and to move from place to place . She was arrested multiple times , and during the " Night of Terror " was violently attacked by three guards . She loved a man who held a gun to her head in a jealous rageand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes so well , " knowing what it means to love a man against all reason and intelligence , loving without blindness but in full knowledge of your madness . " When Day became pregnant , " she walked the streets and peered in the windows of families in their homes . Why couldnt I too have home , a husband and babies ? she wondered . " <p> But instead , she got an abortion , which left her with both physical and emotional complications . She made two suicide attempts , married another man " on the rebound " and for his money , but then left him . She lived with another man , Forster Batterham , whom she loved deeply , gave birth to their daughter , and after a few years of back and forth , raised her as a single mother . <p> In short , if Day were alive today , she would feel in her bones many of the challenges facing working-class America . Days daughter , Tamar , might also understand something of this pain , for though she loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having an intact biological family . Hennessey describes an elderly Tamar finding a stack of letters between Dorothy and her father , Forster , and writes , <p> In these letters , Tamar found what she had longed forlove between her mother and father , Dorothy the saint and Forster the scientist , the two halves of her heart . I want to know what happened to bring these two peopleForster and Dorothytogether and what drove them apart . I want to know why Tamar would always feel this father-loss , missing him even when she was too young to know what that meant . <p> The pain of " father-loss " was something my husband David and I heard about often in our interviews with working-class young adultssomething that , no matter their other beliefs about men , women , and marriage , was often experienced as an emptiness . As one young man said , regarding his parents ' split : <p> they would always drop me off at Dennys and trade me off , and it just seemed wrong from very , very early . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its supposed to be , and you know , I think we all kind of wantthats what 's shown to us , this is what 's going to bring you security and happiness . <p> Though she felt this loss , Tamar , too , was a lover of beauty , particularly natural beauty . She was a gardener her whole life long , planting seeds in small containers even from her wheelchair . These two women , Day and Tamar , knew a life of beauty and suffering intermingledas do we all this side of heaven . I wonder at the connection between the two , for something can be so beautiful that it hurts . Both beauty and suffering evoke that heart-tugging longing , a deep , deep restlessness that feels right and uncomfortable simultaneouslyright because it is so human , but uncomfortable because it marks incompletion . <p> And while I do n't  claim to know how to unravel the tangled knots of fragmented family life in America , of instability and the kind of poverty that Day knew at times and worked to alleviate , I do wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " long loneliness " and seeking beauty amidst the sufferingstriving for wholeness but not resenting the complexity of incompletion . <p> In places like Foster , Ohiooverlooked and having seen better daysperhaps that means recognizing both the problems and the potential .

@@89588494 @5088494/ <p> Conversations about the importance of fathers usually revolve around sons : how boys benefit from having a positive male role model , a consistent disciplinarian , and a high-energy roughhousing partner on their way to pursuing career and family success in adulthood . But as recent research shows , fathers also affect the lives of their young adult daughters in intriguing and occasionally surprising ways . <p> In exploring this area , uppermost on the minds of many is a young womans academic and vocational pathhow her relationship with her father influences her academic performance and , as a consequence , her career success and financial well-being . As you might guess , daughters whose fathers have been actively engaged throughout childhood in promoting their academic or athletic achievements and encouraging their self-reliance and assertiveness are more likely to graduate from college and to enter the higher paying , more demanding jobs traditionally held by males . This helps explain why girls who have no brothers are overly represented among the worlds political leaders : they tend to receive more encouragement from their fathers to be high achievers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers for helping them to become tenacious , self-disciplined , ambitious , and successful . <p> Interestingly , too , when female college students were asked what they would do if their fathers disapproved of their career plans , the overwhelming majority said they would not change their plans . But the daughters who communicated the most comfortably and had the closest relationships with their fathers were more willing to reconsider their plans if their fathers disapproved . <p> Todays fathers also seem to be having a greater impact on their daughters academic and career choices than fathers in previous generations . For example , women who were born in the 1970s are three times more likely than those born at the beginning of the twentieth century to work in the same field as their fathersa finding that researchers have attributed not just to societys changing gender roles but also to daughters receiving more mentoring from their fathers . <p> Another question on many peoples minds is : how does a father influence his daughters romantic lifewho she dates , when she starts having sex , and the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has a secure , supportive , communicative relationship with her father is less likely to get pregnant as a teenager and less likely to become sexually active in her early teens . This , in turn , leads to waiting longer to get married and to have childrenlargely because she is focused on achieving her educational goals first . <p> The well-fathered daughter is also the most likely to have relationships with men that are emotionally intimate and fulfilling . During the college years , these daughters are more likely than poorly-fathered women to turn to their boyfriends for emotional comfort and support and they are less likely to be " talked into " having sex . As a consequence of having made wiser decisions in regard to sex and dating , these daughters generally have more satisfying , more long-lasting marriages . What is surprising is not that fathers have such an impact on their daughters relationships with men , but that they generally have more impact than mothers do . <p> Their better relationships with men may also be related to the fact that well-fathered daughters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders . They are also less dissatisfied with their appearance and their body weight . As a consequence of having better emotional and mental health , these young women are more apt to have the kinds of skills and attitudes that lead to more fulfilling relationships with men . <p> An emerging body of research suggests one more way that dads may shape their daughters mental health and relationships in adulthood : scholars have found an intriguing link between the way daughters deal with stress as adults and the kind of relationships they had with their dads during childhood . For example , undergraduate women who did not have good relationships with their fathers had lower than normal cortisol levels . And people with low cortisol levels tend to be overly sensitive and overly reactive when confronted with stress . Indeed , the low cortisol daughters were more likely than the higher cortisol daughters ( who had the better relationships with their dads ) to describe their relationships with men in stressful terms of rejection , unpredictability or coercion . <p> Given the benefits a woman gains from communicating well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship and communication matter a great deal . Yet both sons and daughters generally say they feel closer to their mothers and find it easier to talk to her , especially about anything personal . This is probably due to the widely held belief that childrenbut daughters especiallyare " supposed " to talk more about personal issues with their mothers than with their fathers . <p> Furthermore , daughters tend to withhold more personal information than sons do from their fathers . Compared to sons , daughters are also more uncomfortable arguing with their dads , and take longer to get over these disagreements than when they argue with their moms . Most daughters also wish their fathers had talked with them more about sex and relationships , even though they admit that the conversations would probably have been uncomfortable at first . Considering the benefits of being able to talk comfortably with their fathers , these findings are discouraging . <p> So how can fathers and daughters forge a close , positive relationship ? Some research suggests certain turning points or significant events can draw them closer . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities together , especially athletic activities , while she was growing up made them closer . Some daughters also mentioned working with their dads or vacationing alone with him . Her leaving for college , getting married , and having children often deepened their relationship and made it less stressfullargely because the daughter gained a better understanding of her fathers perspective and because he began treating her more like an adult . <p> In sum , fathers have a far-reaching influence on their daughters livesboth negative and positive . Many still seem to believe that daughters should spend the most time and share the most personal information with their mothers , but women miss out if they neglect the bond they have with their fathers . And while fathers may find it easier to relate to and connect with their sons , they should make the effort to build a close relationship with their daughters , too .

After all , the man has been running for president for over a year now . <p> After Trump allegedly pushed her up against a wall and forced his tongue down her throat , Stoynoff still submitted her story and for the most part kept silent ( telling only a colleague but not her editor ) . Explaining her silence , she wrote : <p> Like many women , I was ashamed and blamed myself for his transgression . I minimized it ( Its not like he raped me ) . I doubted my recollection and my reaction .

Did she not learn that men do n't  have the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime , that it is not the fault of the victims , that it should be reported to the authorities , that womens bodies are their own , and that " no " means " no " ?

In fact , according to the National Institute for Justice , some of the reasons many women and girls do not report rape and sexual assault include : guilt , shame or embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of someone running for president , there will be those who blame or refuse to believe the victim simply because they want their candidate to win , and Trump is certainly not the first presidential candidate to be accused of sexual assault years after the fact ( think former President Bill Clintons many sexual assault accusers ) . <p> But in most other cases , women like Stoynoff and Leeds would find a sympathetic ear . Indeed , it is hard to imagine that if Stoynoff were working for a news outlet besides People that such a story would have hurt her career . Imagine if Trump tried to put his hands on a reporter for the Miami Herald or the New York Times . It would have been a front-page story .

@@89588506 @5088506/ <p> No one would be surprised to learn that kids suffer when their parents argue . Still , detailed research on exactly how kids are affected and which aspects of parental conflict are most harmful can help families and communities to address the problem effectively . Parental Conflict : Outcomes and interventions for children and families , a short volume from the UK think tank One Plus One coauthored by four researchers , offers an accessible but detailed overview of scholars ' findings on these subjects . Here are some highlights of the research they present . <p> Which aspects of parental conflict matter ? <p> There is no such thing as a relationship entirely free from conflict and disagreement , and surely all children see their parents argue at one time or another . When parents relate to each other calmly and positively even during a disagreement , solve the problem together , and show children through their subsequent interactions that the conflict has been resolved , then the children may be unaffected ( and a small body of research suggests they may even learn conflict-resolution skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , from such situations ) . <p> Parental conflict is harmful to kids , however , when it is frequent ; when it is heated and hostile , involving verbal insults and raised voices ; when parents become physically aggressive ; when parents withdraw from an argument or give each other the silent treatment ; when the conflict seems to threaten the intactness of the family ; and when it 's about the child . ( The impact of witnessing domestic violence on kids is not explored in detail in this book , but of course it too has been shown to be very harmful . ) And conflict is harmful regardless of whether parents are married or even living together . <p> How exactly do children suffer from their parents ' conflicts ? <p> From a very early ageas young as six months , some researchers saychildren show distress when their parents fight . Their reactions can include fear , anger , anxiety , and sadness , and they are at higher risk of experiencing a variety of health problems , disturbed sleep , and difficulty in focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their distress in the form of " aggression , hostility , anti-social and non-compliant behaviour , delinquency and vandalism , " or " internalize " it in the form of " depression , anxiety , withdrawal and dysphoria . " <p> In addition , " children from high-conflict homes are more likely to have poor interpersonal skills , problem solving abilities and social competence . " Those problems negatively impact their romantic relationships in adolescence and adulthood , as conflicts cause children to " perceive themselves and their social worlds more negatively " and to " have more negative pictures or internal representations of family relationships . " Thus the high-conflict relationship of one couple can produce other negative relationships in the next generation . <p> Why does parental conflict produce these effects ? <p> Conflict between parents harms kids in part because of a spillover effect : parents in high-conflict relationships tend to be worse parents , engaging in more criticism , aggression , making threats , shouting , and hitting . High-conflict relationships can also produce lax and inconsistent parenting : parents who simply do n't pay much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may fail to form a secure attachment to parents as a result . <p> But parental conflict also seems to harm kids even apart from its effects on parenting . Researchers have proposed a variety of frameworks and mechanisms that may explain this process . To give one example , in the struggle to understand their parents ' conflict , children can come to blame themselves or find harmful ways of coping with the conflict . In addition , on top of their negative emotions , children experience physiological reactions related to stress that may harm their brain development . <p> Why do the effects of parental conflict affect some children differently from others ? <p> A large number of variables shape the impact of parental conflict : the age , sex , and temperament of the child ; the child 's coping strategies ; and the child 's physiological reaction to stress . Family characteristics matter , too : sibling relationships , attachment to parents , parents ' mental health and substance use , and socioeconomic pressure all affect how children react to conflict . <p> While socioeconomic pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict , the link between conflict and child outcomes remains significant when socioeconomic pressure is accounted for . ( In other words , " children are vulnerable to the impact of a high conflict home regardless of their parents ' socioeconomic situations .

In a subsequent post I 'll outline the researchers ' findings about preventing couple conflict and intervening in high-conflict relationships .

In his words , " I would much rather buy a $75,000 condo by the beach in Florida working 1020 hours a week with plenty of time and money to relax at the beach , sail , play golf and tennis as well as hang out with friends than marry a 30-year-old woman and take care of her into old age by working 50 hours a week at a job I do n't  like .

The sex is passionate and did not require begging like married men often have to do , as the women are physically attracted to me rather then just interested in my ability to provide . <p> Let 's call him six-pack Craig . His bill of particulars with marriage is long and hyperbolic . But he does a good job of expressing a view that is increasingly popular among a growing number of men : Marriage is of little benefit to the average guy , especially the kind of guy who lives for the hedonistic moment . Indeed , the increased popularity of views like this are probably one reason why the share of young men ( aged 20-39 ) who are married has fallen in recent years as the figure below indicates . <p> Worth the Sacrifice Six-pack Craig is right about one thing : There is no doubt that marriage requires sacrifices and lots of them . Successful marriages require men to work harder , avoid cheating , spend less time with friends , and make a good-faith effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their spouses . Many men find these sacrifices hard . <p> But it turns out that the sacrifices pay for themselves and more .

" Aristotle <p> Deep in the human heart is the desire to be together with people that we love . Human happiness is always a shared happiness : shared especially with a small number of people . For most of us a fulfilled life will only be found in walking its hills and valleys in communion with family , and a few friends . <p> We do n't  need the latest study to show us that we are losing the ability to live in communion , even with those closest to us . And not only does this problem start in our homes , it grows there . Homethe very word should resonate with feelings of warmth , belonging , togetherness . It should be the most reliable place of real personal intimacy , the surest antidote to the great bane of human existence : loneliness . But more and more , it is not . <p> Perhaps the central reason that we are not really living-together in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For starters , most of us spend very few hours of the day within , or near , our homes . But even more to the point , how do we spend those hours that we are at home ? <p> Writing about the shared life of true friends , Aristotle says , " This will be realized in their ... sharing in discussion and thought ; for this is what living together would seem to mean in the case of man , and not as in the case of cattle , feeding in the same place . " I do n't  think Aristotle intended a critique of Greek dining practices , but I wonder whether " feeding in the same place " would describe meal times in many of our contemporary homes . Of course meals in the home can and should be a primary context for " sharing in discussion and thought . " Such mealtime conversation is surely what Aristotle has in mind in quoting the proverb about eating salt together . One version of the proverb has it as eating a peck of salt together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmingly saline diet , eating a peck of salt together will require several thousand meals . So the proverb seems to imply that deep human relationships grow only from consistent quality conversation , like what should be found at household meals . <p> If Aristotle is correct that the truest human intimacy takes place in good conversation , then here we have a prism through which to consider our customs of home life , beginning with meal times . Though cows usually feed in the vicinity of other cows , they are not particular about eating together . Household meals , on the other hand , can be configured to be regular occasions for communion between family members . But given the various pressures on home life today , such a configuration will need to be a conscious object of intention . Otherwise our meal practices might tend toward the bovine . <p> Household meals can be occasions for communion between family members . But that will require conscious intention . <p> Outside of meal times there are two other main household contexts that can be suited to rational and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have been largely removed to venues outside the home , while what is left behind has taken forms less conducive to communion . <p> Households were once the primary locus of human work . Much of what was needed for human life was produced , as well as consumed , therein . Even after the industrial revolution removed much production from the home , traditional " home arts " retained a significant place in household life for a number of generations . Yet the last couple of generations have seen a notable drop of even these activities . The art of cooking seems more associated with dining out , or edgy parties with peers , than with keeping a family well fed , around a table spread and seasoned with love . The arts of growing and preserving foods , while certainly not dead , are far from commonplace . The same can be said of home carpentry , sewing , knitting and the like . <p> Apart from other negative consequences of the demise of these arts , our home life suffers the loss of a natural context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , not only does such work provide the satisfaction of communal achievement and shared competency , it also often allows for regular , sustained conversation . Who would not start to speak with a fellow potato-peeler , or sander of wood ? The repetitive yet varied and fruitful work of such arts is one of the great hidden treasures of a way of life that for many of us can only be had by re-discovering what has been lost . <p> If one were to judge by the sales of flat-screen TVs and the like , it might seem that the life of leisure is alive and well in the home . But Aristotle distinguishes leisure and amusement . In a rather remarkable line , he reflects : " It would , indeed , be strange if the end ( goal ) were amusement , and one were to take trouble and suffer hardship all ones life in order to amuse oneself . " Amusementof which what we call entertainment is surely a kindhas a place in the home . It serves work by providing a break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure , which is a time of richer activities . <p> Leisure time in Aristotles sense , while indeed relaxing , is much more than relaxation . Its activities are rich in meaning , and consequently have an unmatched power to unite the people that engage in them . A group reflection upon blessings received ; the reading or performance of a drama ; stories of family history or great heroes ; music appreciation ; common prayer . Here a family community is especially alive , present to one another in a unique way . <p> Salt gives seasoning to food . But good conversation , especially that occasioned by the rich and regular activities of the home , does more than give seasoning to life . It is the beating heart of a real communion of persons , of a happy life-together with those we love . <p> John A.

I arrived at the community center later than intended , but still in time to visit with the young mothers who had gathered to hear me speak . <p> Despite the weather , their mood was jovial , in anticipation , I suspect , of my message about sex and intimacy . Their unrestrained chatter revealed a desire to hear immediate and magical solutionsnot unlike most couples with whom I speak , who want to build or restore a lasting marriage . <p> This was n't the first time I 'd addressed such a crowd ; over nearly 30 years , I have dedicated my efforts to researching and writing on family formation , and sharing that information with young couples . <p> That night , as on many other occasions , I doled out my wisdom , drawing upon anecdotes from hundreds of committed couples , sharing intricate workings of my own long-term marriage , and honing in on " time-honored solutions " offered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yet , for the first time , my heart just was n't in it . Secretly , I questioned my effectiveness . Did I really have any ideas for these eager young women ? There are no guarantees , after all , that doing just the right thing , at just the right time , assures marital longevity . Clouded in skepticism , I doubted I could inspire one mother , even one iota . <p> And if they were looking to my generation for a blueprint of a lasting marriage , well , perhaps we did n't  have one . Just that morning , I 'd read the recent report by the Pew Research Center on " gray divorce . " Based on data from the National Center for Health Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau , Pew reports that the divorce rate among adults age 50 and older " roughly doubled " between 1990 and 2015 . During this same timeframe , the divorce rate nearly tripled for adults over age 65 . <p> These numbers simply hit too close to home . I know firsthand many real-life situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men and women that have fueled this rise in divorce are , after all , my contemporariesBaby Boomers born between 1946 and 1964 . They were certainly old enough to be the parents , and maybe the grandparents , of those in my audience that night . Statistically , many of the young mothers before me may have experienced this so-called " graying of divorce " that had doubled in their lifetime . <p> I mentally shuffled through the long list of divorces I knew intimatelythose of family members and friends and the many couples I 'd come to know professionally . Despite differences , their stories were the same . Each had once cared for the other fiercely , yet failed to overcome less than affable qualities that emerged since they married , or to forge the unbreakable bond that keeps couples tethered together forever . <p> We were the generation that married . Inspired by the on-screen romance between Ali McGraw and Ryan ONeal in Love Story , we walked cross-stage for our diploma one day , and through church doors the next . Our marriage rate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 than was recorded some 40 years later . We also married earlier , beating todays couples to the altar by a good six years , on average . <p> While Love Story led us to believe that " love means never having to say you 're sorry , " we learned that simply was n't true . One in four marriages ended within five years , a dissolution rate nearly a third higher than estimates for that same time span following marriage in 2014 . <p> Few couples labored over whom to blame for a marriage that was n't working : by then , the " No Fault Divorce Law " was enacted in California and adopted thereafter in most states , thus fueling a jump in divorces by 20 to 25 percent , followed by a gradual rise in ensuing years . <p> Ever believers in the institution of marriage , the bulk of Baby Boomers that divorced , went on to remarry , have children and grandchildren , and for many , live happily ever afterat least for a decade or two . <p> Marriages flourish only when we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really do n't  feel like doing those things that make a marriage work . <p> Researchers now link this earlier pattern of marital instability among Baby Boomers to todays rising divorce rate for those over the age of 50 . Nearly half of divorces among those over 50 involve men and women in remarriages , which , according to Pew , " are less stable than first marriages . " Among all adults 50 and over who divorced in 2015 , 48 percent were in their second or later marriage . <p> Couples that remarry later in life also face a greater risk of divorce . Among adults 50 and older who have been married for less than 10 years , the divorce rate is roughly a third higher than for couples married longer at 20 to 29 years , according to the Pew report . <p> Of course , these generalities do n't  hold for all remarriages or for all later-in-life unions .

Even long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been married 30 , 40 , even 50 years , are n't  immune from gray-divorce . In fact , Pew notes that a sizable share of gray divorces ( 34 percent ) occur among couples that have been married for over 30 years , and one-in-10 couples ( 12 percent ) have been married for more than 40 . <p> The reasons that possess men and women to end a marriage after what seems " a lifetime together " are as varied as the couples themselves . We may think we know what causes the rift between a man and a woman : Its her cooking , his drinking , her carousing . Maybe she swears , or he snores . Perhaps its the house , or their jobs , or the kids , or all three . No one really knows what goes on within the four walls of a home .

I expounded on the so-called " behaviors of love , " the common courtesies and everyday exchanges that add sparkle to a marriage or tarnish it with their absence . We touched upon the art of the simple smile , and identified trigger points of conflict and how to deflect them . The ideas I shared werent flashy or new , oras I reminded the womenfoolproof . <p> I chose not to share the results from Pew haunting me that evening .

@@89588528 @5088528/ <p> In post-2016 election takes , one factor has largely been overlooked : the family factor . At first glance , 2016 looks no different than previous presidential elections . The Republican Party presidential nominee usually does better with married voters and in counties with more two-parent families . This was certainly true for Donald Trump . <p> The 2016 CNN Exit Poll found , for instance , that Trump won among married voters , winning 52 percent , but lost decisively among the unmarried ( see table below ) . The 26-point marriage gap in the 2016 electorate is large.1 In fact , it surpasses the 24-point gender gap also found in the CNN Exit Poll of the 2016 electorate . <p> Trumps advantage among the married electorate was also paralleled in his county-level performance among two-parent families . In general , Trump did better in counties with more two-parent families and worse in counties with more single-parent families . As the figure below indicates , our analysis of county-level voting data indicates that Trumps vote share decreased by 5.7 percentage points for every 10 percentage point increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sources : CNN , Measure of America County Data <p> What accounts for this classical Republican advantage among voters in more traditional families ? Elsewhere , I have argued that cultural and economic factors help account for the Republican edge among married , two-parent families . Specifically : <p> one reason is that married Americans tend to be more socially conservative and religious than their unmarried peers , and that explanation has gotten a lot of attention . But I think economic security is a big factor here as well . We know that men , women , and children in married families are more likely to enjoy financial success , economic stability , and private health insurance . This means that married adults typically pay more in taxes and depend less upon the government for their financial welfare . These financial factors , then , probably help to explain why marrieds are more likely to vote Republican . <p> But the standard story about partisanship and family demography does not completely explain 2016 . A closer look at the exit polls indicates Trump did slightly worse among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney ) , and slightly better among the unmarried ( 37 percent for Trump , 35 percent for Romney ) , compared to Romney .

As the figure below indicates , Romneys vote share decreased by 6.0 percentage points for every 10 percentage point increase in the share of single parents in a county in 2012 ( versus Trumps decrease of 5.7 percentage points ) . <p> Sources : CNN , Measure of America County Data <p> In fact , the counties that flipped from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 had higher rates of single parenthood than the typical Republican pattern .

Undoubtedly , concerns and motivations related to trade , immigration , and race were important in explaining the rise of Trump in counties where Obama had previously won . But the breakdown of the family in some of these predominantly middle American counties may have also played a role , giving rise to concerns about the social fabric , lower levels of physical and psychological health , and more economic insecurityall of which could have made Trump attractive as a candidate of change who will " make America great again , " particularly for the less-educated whites who predominate in these counties . <p> In recent decades , as I argued in When Marriage Disappears , working-class whites have seen marked declines in marriage and family stability . The psychological , social , and economic consequences of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this retreat from marriage may have also helped make some Middle Americans more open to dramatic political changes , includingin this caseswitching from Barack Obama to Donald J.

@@89588531 @5088531/ <p> In 2010 , we began the Homeward Bound project , hoping to study the intersection of modern families and elder care because we saw , all around us , how elder care is changing . Seven years later , it is exciting to see the results of the project in the form of a published book , Homeward Bound : Modern Families , Elder Care , and Loss , and to share some of what we learned in this post . <p> The catalyst for the project was a conversation with a dear friend of ours , Julie , whose Baby Boomer parents are divorced ; each parent then remarried and divorced again . One of Julies ex-stepparentsher ex-stepmother Tinawas about to undergo critical surgery , and Julie did n't  know what to do . Tina had been married to Julies father for 15 years , starting when Julie was a toddler . While Julie was growing up , she spent holidays with her father and Tina . After the divorce , Julie no longer visited Tina , but they remained in regular contact by phone and email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her during childhood illnesses and crises , and she felt some responsibility for Tina , especially since Tina had no children of her own . However , Julie felt overwhelmed as she thought of handling all of the medical , financial , and legal caretaking that her parents , stepparents , and ex-stepparents would need from her as they aged . Julie , who also has two young children , explained that she simply was not prepared financially or emotionally to care for all the people who might need herand she felt alone in her worries , with few resources and little support . <p> Of course , Julie is not alone . The Baby Boomers were the first to divorce in unprecedentedly high numbers in their young adulthood , and even now , they continue to divorce in high numbers , leading to the term " gray divorce . As we looked at the sociological data on divorced , single , and remarried Baby Boomers , we realized that the nature of caretaking is changing . There are not only more potential family members who can be involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those new family members because of divorce and remarriage . <p> To figure out how caretaking is actually happening in these often complex families , we interviewed members of Julies generational cohort who have already cared for and now grieve a parent or stepparent to learn what worked and what did n't  in their care experience . We used our expertise in hospice care , law , and religion to analyze and tell the stories of todays modern families who are caring for a parent . <p> We learned three key lessons : <p> 1 ) Families shape the quality of the elder care and grieving experience of grown children . Their caretaking and mourning processes are profoundly affected by whether or not their mother and father are married , or are married to a stepparent . <p> The National Alliance for Caregiving reported in 2015 that the estimated prevalence of adults caring for another adult over the age of 50 is 16.6 percent , or 39.8 million Americans . Our current elder-care support systems presume a married-parent family where the healthy parent , the dying parent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts arise , which they always do , they are resolved privately , without much intervention from professionals . The death of a parent is mediated by shared normsand a surviving spouse . <p> By contrast , single-parent families and stepfamilies are typically more emotionally complex , so they demand a higher level of intentional sensitivity from family members as well as professionals . A parent often serves as the cog connecting siblings , stepsiblings , and a stepparent . But when that connecting person dies , the remaining family members must cope with the loss , and , because their connecting cog is gone , they may scatter . If a blended family remained in contact a year after the death , the grown child described the care and grief experience as understandable , manageable , and personally or spiritually meaningful . <p> 2 ) Formal planning helps facilitate a positive experience . All families benefit from formal planning , but , for single- and remarried-parent families , planning is even more critical because it can mediate conflicts and compensate for a lack of shared , private norms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance medical directive that established his or her wishes on a substitute decision-maker or on end-of-life care . Very few had bought life insurance , or written a will .

Medical professionals , lawyers , and clergy members can play a critical role in helping single and blended families manage elder care , loss , and wealth transfer . We recommend hospice and palliative care usage whenever possible . Most advanced planning in our research happened once a family was already enrolled in hospice . The interdisciplinary professionals in hospice or palliative care are well equipped to assess the unique family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> Baby Boomers are now facing end-of-life issues , and blended and single-parent families are the new normal . Our research shows how critical it is for medical , religious , and legal professionals to adapt to the heightened needs of families who do not have a shared history and common norms to resolve conflicts and clarify roles at the end of life . <p> Ultimately , we learned that daughters and stepdaughters , like our friend Julie , have a reason for hope , as well as the need to respond to a call to action . Many family members showed great resilience in finding ways to understand each other , to work together to each contribute something to the care process , and to decide that they would remain a family after the death of one of its members . In other families , the lack of shared norms and an absence of experienced professional support meant that caretaking and grief became a time of division , rather than unity . But , as we also learned , the time to plan is now .

In harmony , these qualities can help parents see their children as their own persons with a soul which must be nurtured into good , mature , responsible members of society .

The core of this idea is that cohabiting would provide a test of a relationship . This seems logical but , mysteriously , decades of research do not show this benefit . In fact , until recently , the overwhelming majority of studies showed that cohabitation before marriage was associated with poorer odds of stability and happiness in marriage.i More recent studies show that the association with higher risk has dissipated or disappeared for some groups.ii And yet the headlines tend to say there is no longer any risk , but that 's misleading in many cases . <p> Among those who cohabited before marriage , only those who fit the following categories are likely to have marital outcomes similar to those who did not live together before marriage : <p> That leaves the mystery . How could the widely held belief that cohabiting before marriage actually improves ones odds of marital success have virtually no evidence to support it ? ( I hedge slightly here because there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having improved odds . ) <p> There are several explanations for how cohabiting could seem so logical but still not be generally associated with better marriages . Ill cover the two I think matter most . <p> First , those who live together before marrying tend to already be at greater risk in marriage because of other factorsfor example , having parents who divorced or never married , having fewer economic resources , less education , and so forth . These are called " selection " factors among researchers . Selection suggests that some part of peoples odds for how their relationships or marriages turn out was already baked in their cake , so to speak , before their relationships even began , and an experience like cohabitation may not have altered those odds . There is a lot of evidence that selection is a major factor underlying the mystery I am addressing . The same types of selection factors that are associated with cohabitation and less stable marriages are also associated with greater odds of cohabiting with numerous partners ( serially ) and cohabiting prior to having clarified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before marrying tend to already be at greater risk in marriage because of other factors . <p> The second explanation is about what people do with their cake after its baked . If you like a different metaphor , everyone is dealt a hand of cards , and some people get dealt better hands than others . But no matter what hand they were dealt , it also matters how they play it . <p> Inertia <p> All other things being equal , if two people are sharing one address , they will have a harder time breaking up than a non-cohabiting couple , even if their relationship has serious weaknesses or problems . That is , cohabitation has more inertia than dating . When they move in together , many people increase their constraints for staying in a relationship , or raise the costs of ending it , before they have reached a mutual dedication to being in the relationship . <p> I found an article a few years ago that nails the way inertia works . In it , Marguerite Reardon describes her commitment dilemma with her iPhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nokia 's Lumia 900 ? " ( Her piece is a couple years old , so insert the name for some hot Samsung model into her title . ) here 's a quote from her article . <p> But sadly now I 'm feeling a bit stuck with Apple . I 'd like to check out other smartphone platforms , but doing so is going to require some work on my part . Like many who have been sucked into Apples clutches , it was innocent in the beginning . . . . Initially , I did n't  realize the commitment I was making . I did n't  think about the fact that I was locking myself into a platform for the rest of my life . But with each new product I bought from Apple , the deeper I fell into the borg . And now I feel like it would be painful to break up with Apple . Not because I love the products or company so much , but because it would be a huge pain in the butt to transfer all my stuff to a new platform . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you check out her story , she actually goes on to liken the mobile phone dilemma to living together . Most people think readily about inertia related to their mobile plan and being locked in for a year or two . Reardon is addressing a more powerful type of constraint that produces inertia based in the difficulty of moving on because of the depth of what you are already into . <p> When they move in together , many people increase their constraints for staying in a relationship before they have reached a mutual dedication to doing so . <p> The idea of inertia as it relates to cohabitation and marriage is a little scary . We believe that some people marry a partner they would not have married if theyd never moved in together . They got " inertialized " they made it hard to break uptoo soon . That 's why my colleague Galena Rhoades and I have predicted and found over and over again that couples who wait to cohabit until marriage or until they have clear , mutual plans to marry report , on average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so forth.iv Those couples are less likely to be prematurely caught in inertia . <p> For some individuals who made it harder to break up before committing to a future with their partner , cohabitation probably decreased their odds of happiness in marriage . Many people who move in together before having clarified anything still do fine in marriage and/or life together . Its just that they face a greater risk of divorce or unhappiness in marriage than the other group , and it makes sense why that would be the case . <p> If you are thinking , " well , I do n't  really believe in marriage anyway , so what 's this got to do with me ? " Inertia is important to understand in any relationship . If you are not already in a committed relationship and youd like to be , the relevant personal questions are these : What things could I avoid that could make it harder for me to break it off with someone before I 'm sure I want to be with that person ? How would I know I 'm sure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it clearly . We all experience it in many ways in modern life . But a lot of people think its only an issue when it comes to marriage , not cohabitation . Its actually everywhere . When its time to really commit to someone , its worth accepting that commitment requires making a choice to give up other choices . But too many people give up options before making a real choice .

She does n't  want to make excuses for him , but she says : <p> It did n't  matter if he took off for three months on a binge . They had HUD housing , they had food stamps , fuel assistance , tribal health care . He was n't needed . If he thought his family would n't have had food , he would have behaved differently . A man does need to feel needed . But the government took care of all that . <p> Most Indians living on reservations are living in dire povertyAmerican Indians are the poorest racial or ethnic group in Americabut they are also receiving steady payments and other forms of assistance from the federal government . As these payments have increased , the situation on reservations has continued to deterioraterates of suicide , violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent decades . <p> There are those on the left who would argue that the problem is that American Indians are not getting enough assistance from the government : Indians are poor because we took their land and have not fulfilled our obligations to take care of them in return . But the truth is that money , per se , is not the problem . <p> According to a report from the Cato Institute , federal funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs various programswhich support education , economic development , tribal courts , road maintenance , agriculture , and social serviceswas almost $3 billion in 2012 . About $850 million of this goes to the Bureau of Indian Education ( BIE ) to provide for its 42,000 students , although most children on reservations do n't  attend BIE schools . This amounts to about $20,000 per pupil , compared to a national average of nearly $12,300 . Indian Health Service had a 2015 budget of over $4.6 billion . And HUDs Native American Housing Block Grant Program had a 2015 budget of $650 million . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray , have glommed onto the idea that the problem with payments from the federal government to poor Americans is not that they are too large but that they are too restrictive . This has led them to the idea of a Universal Basic Income as a substitute for the welfare state . <p> Writing for Catos website , Matt Zwolinski notes that a Basic Income Guarantee would be " a cash grant with no strings attached . Unlike other welfare programs which encourage or require recipients to consume certain specific kinds of good such as medical care , housing , or fooda BIG simply gives people cash , and leaves them free to spend it , or save it , in whatever way they choose . " <p> Obviously , the fact that the government is not only choosing to give people money but also choosing the way people will spend that money is a problem . And if you spend any time on reservations , you will find that the bureaucracy and regulations start to simply overwhelm you . As I explain in my book , The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that reservation land is held in trust by the federal government , which means that Indians can not buy homes , take out loans , start businesses , sell property or do a variety of other things the way most Americans can . They need a bureaucrats permission to perform the simplest economic transactions . <p> But there are Indian communities that do provide something like a Basic Income Guarantee : Reservations and territories that have successful casinos distribute a share of the profits in the form of annuities . <p> The Seneca Nation has made well over $1 billion in profits from its gambling facilities , according to interviews I conducted with its leaders . And during the past decade , that largesse has begun to trickle in ever-larger amounts into the hands of the Seneca people . The current annuity for an adult between the ages of 18 and 60 on the reservation is about $8,000 , disbursed in quarterly payments . Elders get a larger amount , in a kind of American Indian social security program . Half the money for children under 18 is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a trust . When a Seneca youth turns 18 and can show that he or she has graduated from high school or earned a GED , he or she receives a lump sum of $30,000 . Those who do n't  get a high-school degree have to wait until they 're 21 to receive the money . With each passing year , the annuities get larger , because the tribe invests its earnings . <p> Government officials and other members of the nation tell me that the best thing most young adults do with this money is to buy a new truck . These are kids who have never had very much before ; so when someone hands them a huge check , they clearly do n't  know what to do . Store owners report that young people will come in to buy candy , handing $50 or $100 without expecting any change . These young people seem to have no concept of saving or investing . They 're not unlike lottery winners , who tend to be no better a few years after hitting the jackpot than they were before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in these annuities is almost never saved for education . Despite a vast apparatus to help Seneca members set up businesses , almost no one starts one . Unless people are employed by the tribe ( either through the casino or in tribal government ) , they are largely unemployed . Theft is also a problem . One official told me that they have had reports of elder abuse where children and grandchildren were stealing payments from older members of the tribe . <p> The results of all this can be seen in the poverty rates for the Senecas , which have continued to rise . Their territory is divided into two reservations . As of 2011 , the Allegany reservation poverty rate was 33.3 percent and the Cattaraugus reservation poverty rate was 64.9 percent , the highest in Cattaraugus County . During the first decade that the casino was operating , the poverty rate in Cattaraugus County , which includes part of the Seneca Territory , increased from 12.8 in 2000 to 18.7 in 2011 . <p> Writing about the concept of a Universal Basic Income last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track record of divorcing personal rewards from personal contributions hardly justifies more of the same , even when it is in a more sophisticated form .

@@89588541 @5088541/ <p> Have you ever taken your child to the park and looked at the parents around you ? What do you see ? <p> If you 've managed to look up from your own device , youve probably seen a lot of parents looking down at their devices . Indeed , observational research has found that 35 percent of parents spend about 1 in every 5 minutes of their time ( or even more ) on their phone while at the playground with their child.1 But really , what is the harm in that ? I mean , the kids are safe and busy playing , right ? Keep reading . <p> Now , most of us are really trying to be good parents , and parenting can be demanding , tiring , and even downright boring at times ! And for those of you thinking , " Oh how could he say that ? ! Does n't  he love his kids ? " Yes , I do love my kids .

Most of us have our phone with us all the time and rarely turn it off , 4 and we use it for practically everythingits our clock , connection to work , connection to the web , social hub , map , doctor , teacher , and can even listen to and talk with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about phones ?

You check it . Nope , no important message , but you end up on Facebook , then Instagram . About 10 minutes later , you look up , and your child has wandered off to play by herself . <p> Scenario 2 : " Mom , mom , mom , mom , can I have a snack ?

You scold them for making a mess and ask if they really brushed their teeth ( as you feel the dry toothbrushes ) . <p> I would say that these sorts of occurrences are becoming increasingly common . In one of our recent studies , 65 percent of mothers stated that technology devices interrupted their interactions with their child during playtime sometimes or more often , and 22 percent said this happened at least sometimes even during disciplining their child . <p> Of course , parents have had tons of things distracting them for ages , so what 's the big deal ? Well , smartphones and mobile devices have been designed to absorb your attention . They are better at keeping and rewarding you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some researchers have found parents distracted by phones ( as opposed to other types of distractions ) are less likely to respond to a childs attempts to get their attention .

As a parenting researcher , I often look for whether parents are interpreting their childs cues and needs correctly and then responding appropriately and in a timely manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parenting quality , leading you to be less in sync with your childs cues , to misinterpret your childs needs , to respond more harshly than usual , and to respond much too long after the need arose . These are all components of parenting sensitivity , which are connected to the type of attachment ( or emotional bond ) a child forms with his or her parent . Children then go through life with an internal working model of what relationships should be like in terms of how they have been treated by their own parents or caregivers . In other words , these distractions could have very real meaning for how the rising generation begins to see the world around them and what it means to love and be loved . <p> My coauthor , Jenny Radesky , and I recently examined whether technoference in parent-child time was linked with child behavioral problems ( see study in Child Development here ) . We asked a sample of 170 U.S. couples with young children about their mobile device use behavior , how often technoference happened during time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we found that parents with problems managing their mobile device use were more likely to experience technoference during time with their child , and this technoference in the parent-child relationship was linked with more child internalizing ( e.g. , anxiety , depression ) and externalizing ( e.g. , hyperactivity , disruptive behavior ) problems . These links persisted even when taking into account factors like parents stress and depression levels . In brief , these findings suggest that parent technology use and child behavior are intricately connected , and also add to previous work , showing associations between technoference and potential relationship problems in couples and parenting . <p> Although its not clear yet whether parents are responding to difficult child behavior by using mobile devices more around the child , or whether the mobile device use leads to more child behavior problems ( in reality , it is likely both ) , this study is the first to show links between parent technology use , technoference , and child behavior . Parents should critically examine their device use and seek to minimize distractions and time spent on technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that even minor , everyday interruptions in parent-child interactionseven in fairly high functioning familiesare intricately linked with child behavior.6 <p> What Can Parents Do to Avoid Technoference ? <p> 1 . Be mindful of your phone and other technology use . Most of us do n't  even realize how much we are using our devices . There are apps we can download that will track our use and let us know how we are doing . This can be really eye opening ! For instance , you might notice that you are most tempted to look at your device during certain times of the day and so forth . <p> 2 . Develop strategies to keep yourself " present " with your children . You can get creative with these , but I might suggest at least coming up with some technology free zones and/or times in your home . You can also set a goal for yourself to put your phone down or look up from your tablet/computer immediately when your child or other family member walks into the roomin a sense , you want to show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment . <p> 3 . Try to ask yourself the following question every time you pull your phone out while with your children : Can this wait until later ? If the answer is yes , then practice re-engaging with your child instead of pulling out the device . Our research suggests that the fewer technological interruptions , the better behaved your child will likely be over time . Also , as you actively re-engage with your child , this will help to create a new habit to replace your old phone habit . <p> 4 . If you are married or have a romantic partner , make sure you are on the same page . Our research has linked technoference with lower relationship and co-parenting quality , and the quality of your relationship will inevitably spill out into your parenting relationship with your children .

@@89588545 @5088545/ <p> Last week , we published part one of our exclusive interview with best-selling author , educator , and activist , Warren Farrell , Ph.D. , on his forthcoming book , The Boy Crisis ( Jan. 2018 ) . This is the second installment of that interview , which focuses on solutions to the crisis facing boys . <p> Alysse ElHage : One area where boys are really struggling today is in the classroom : they are less likely than girls to graduate high school on time and to earn a college a degree . You argue that one reason boys are falling behind is the lack of male teachers . Why do boys benefit from male teachers ? And why do n't  we see more of them ? <p> Warren Farrell : Boys in divorced families often go from mother-only homes to female-dominated elementary schools , sometimes seeing no constructive male role model who specifically sees something special in him . With this void , when a gang leader takes an interest , the fatherless boy sees a male role model who wants him and is vulnerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , because we do n't  have a cultural push for males to feel they are needed as kindergarten or elementary school teachers . Males go where they are told they are neededeven if its to die . However , the young man who does contemplate becoming a kindergarten or elementary school teacher is often afraid for fear that holding a crying child on his lap , or even holding a child to comfort her or him , could lead to an accusation of molestation that will stick in everyones memory even if he is found innocent . Hell go to war to risk death because he wants to be thought of as a hero ; he will avoid being a kindergarten teacher because he never wants to be thought of as a villain . <p> AE : You offer fathers a lot of advice in the book , writing that : " The pathway to your son becoming a healthy hero is nurtured by dad as a crockpot , not dad as a microwave . " Explain what you mean by that . <p> WF : Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , game-playing time , time to be teased and knowing how to appropriately tease back , and in cases of divorce , equal time ( rather than visitor time ) with approximately equal overnights . Dads tend to encourage more risk-taking , but when a boy takes a risk at his dads encouragement , he needs his dad there to process the risk , not to just feel he was pushed out there and then dad disappears . <p> Dads need to be aware of what I call the three Cs : Consistency ; Consistency , and Consistency . Add lots of time to consistency , and you have the crockpot , not the microwave ! <p> AE:You also suggest family dinner nights as a way to help boys . And by this , you do n't  just mean simply eating together as a family but a sit-down dinner . Tell us more about family dinner nights and why they matter for boys especially ? <p> WF : Family-Studies readers already know that families that often have dinner together do better together . But while togetherness is important , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So in The Boy Crisis , I outline six essentials to maximize family dinner night effectiveness . <p> And it is n't easy . Parents encounter a Gordian Knot with boys : preparing him to " be a man , " yet allowing him to be the open , curious , sensitive boy that you know is under his mask of masculinity . <p> One reason is a lack of judgment . When it comes to emotions , few boys are good self-starters . Boys need parents to " kick the ball into play " and give their son time to see if it is safe for him to join the gameto have an opinion that varies , or is even outrageous . If he feels he wont be judged for his input , then hell share what rings true and false , and his own story will unfold . However , if parents give adviceeven excellent advicehell often experience that as judgment , a lack of trust in him , and withdraw . <p> So , I explain the importance of everyone at the table making it part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the advice he or she would give if someone else had that problem . That starts with the assumption that within the person sharing the problem is a " best guess " as to a solution . And if the boy is first asked , and has no answer , then he s more willing to hear others answers . <p> While family dinner nights need to delay advice-giving , they need to be fearless when it comes to discussing " the elephant in the room " or tough topics . Kids are attracted to videos that deal with plenty of tough stuff and are turned off by boredom and euphemisms , which they often label as hypocrisyespecially boys . So make the family dinner nights something his friends would beg to come to because the conversations are so interesting and real . <p> For our children to not fear marriage , they need to see that their parents have learned how to do what does not come naturally : sustain love . <p> AE : Can mentoring help boysparticularly fatherless boys ? <p> WF : Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by becoming a mentor . A boy who becomes a mentor begins to become an adult as he watches himself vigilantly to see if he is a good role model . Being mentored and mentoring is important for all boys , but its crucial for boys raised by single moms . <p> I outline in The Boy Crisis how the Boy Scouts have honed over the decades an almost-perfect developmental program to develop the best of masculinity . They introduce character and then solidify it through ritual . Their merit badges reward boys for learning by doingthe way boys tend to learn . <p> The Cub Scouts , Boys Clubs , and the Mankind Project offer very well-vetted programs for boys . Many faith-based communities also offer much-needed support , and if yours does n't  , consider helping them create that support . <p> If you are vetting for an individual as a mentor , vet for consistency . If long-term consistency is not availablefor example , an older boy who will be going to off to college in a year or solet your son know that ahead of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain his mentors interest . <p> AE : Another solution to the boy crisis that you suggest is to make marriages better . What do healthy marriages have to do with how boys are doing ? <p> WF : Boys are even more vulnerable to broken families than girls . In addition to it usually being their role model who is disappearing , studies of children years after divorce report moms of divorce are five times as likely to bad-mouth the dads as vice versa . So a boys attachment to his role model often becomes precarious . <p> Making marriages better serves everyone . Many couples with children who are legally married are psychologically divorced . Divorces are due less to problems with money , sex or children , and more to each partner feeling that her or his perspectives on money , sex , or children are rarely heard . When our partner airs her or his perspective , we often take it as criticism , and the Achilles heel of human beings is our inability to handle personal criticism from a loved one without becoming defensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " : while " falling in love " is biologically natural , sustaining love is biologically unnatural . For our children to not fear marriage , then , they need to see that their parents have learned how to do what does not come naturally : sustain love . <p> This creates the greatest single opportunity for the most radical solution to the boy crisis : parental modeling of how to sustain love . I introduce in The Boy Crisis my " Altered Mindsets Method of Non-defensive Communication , " which has allowed couples to emotionally associate their partners criticism as an opportunity to deepen their love . Its a method I have honed over two decades via couples communication workshops Empathy communication skills need to be part of every elementary schools core curriculum This is the most important single global change for love in our families and peace in the world . 
@@89588547 @5088547/ <p> Decision making about sexual practices and family formation has become complex for those who identify with counter-cultural and sub-cultural groups ( or who simply ascribe to traditional views about sexuality and family life ) . The widening gap between modern and traditional family norms and values has created an internal dissonance between societal and group specific beliefs about many aspects of sex , marriage , and family . <p> I have devoted the majority of my professional and academic pursuits to examining how ones professed religious belief influences family formation patterns ( specifically individuals likelihood of cohabitating ) . In my own research , I have examined the cohabitation patterns of Catholics , Protestants , and those who identified as having no religion , in Canada . Ultimately I found that although Catholics held the most firm beliefs regarding the behaviors encompassed in cohabitation ( extra-marital sex and possibly contraceptive usage ) , they did not exhibit lower rates of cohabitation than other religious groups ( in this case Protestants and those who do not affiliate with a religion ) . What is more , Catholics odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups observed or occasionally similar to that of respondents of no religion . <p> Why was this case ? Why was the only group with established doctrine about the behaviors encompassed in cohabitation ( as something not beneficial and immoral ) , similar to individuals that do n't  affiliate with a religion in practice ? <p> First , my results were specific to Canadas unique cultural factors and regional factors . Canadas figures are largely skewed by the many Quebeckers that identify as Catholic ( almost half of the Catholics in my sample resided in Quebec ) but do n't  live religious lives . Second , mirroring trends in the global decline of religion , individuals in Canada may be developing more liberal views of religion . So while many may report religious affiliation , few exhibit religious behavior in all areas of their lives . <p> Beyond my own research on the subject , much of the past and current research about religion and family formation indicates that religious factors have a significant influence on adherents behavior in matters of sexuality and family life and that often religion decreases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as cohabiting ) . 1 <p> Among more recent findings , a report about the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth by Goodwin , Mosher , &amp; Chandra found that " 60% of non-Hispanic white women for whom religion was very important in their daily lives were currently married , compared with 36% of white women for whom religion was not important . Similar patterns in marital or cohabiting status by importance of religion were found for non-Hispanic men and women , black men , and Hispanic men and women . " Similarly , Eggebeen and Dew found that Catholics who attended Church regularly and displayed " fervor " were actually less likely to cohabit than " devout " Conservative Protestants . Furthermore , Thornton , Axinn , and Xie found that the higher the religiosity of ones family , the greater the likelihood of marrying and the lower the likelihood of cohabiting : " Young adults who are from more religious families and are more religious themselves " they found , " have substantially higher marriage rates and lower cohabitation rates than young adults who are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gault-Sherman and Draper found that religious networks and communities and the religiosity of ones geographic location influences union formation negatively , and that the degree at which religion influences union formation patterns varies by geographic location and religious group . Evangelicals were less likely to cohabit and being a Southerner and Christian influenced union formation patterns the most . <p> Given that past literature on the topic suggests that religion has a notable influence on adherents family formation practices and that religion is associated with more traditional attitudes and family formation structures , going forward it will be particularly important to assess what specific qualities of religious factors contribute to the noted consistencies between adherents beliefs and behavior . For instance , in the case of Eggebeen and Dews finding about the religious factors that point to the different cohabitation rates between Catholics and Conservative Protestants ( see above ) , what about displaying " fervor " aids individuals to behave counter-culturally ? How does religious fervor come about ? Research models that include the greatest number of religious measures , such as Cornwalls model , which consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious socialization , and socio-demographic characteristics , " could allow scholars to determine the most accurate results about the role that multiple facets of religiosity have on peoples lives . Additionally , given that the Catholic Church is not the only religious group that does not view the behaviors encompassed in cohabitation as beneficial , 2 future studies should aim to include as many religions as possible and should differentiate Protestants groups by denomination . Doing so could help to clarify how the specific religious beliefs of a group influence their behavior . <p> As cohabitation and other changing practices in the realm of sexuality and family life , become more prevalent in Western countries , further research about the association between religion and family formation will be of great importance for both scholars who study culture , religion and family , and for the many groups that hold norms , values , and beliefs that are in opposition to these societal trends .

@@89588548 @5088548/ <p> Its no secret that marriage has evolved in radical ways over the past half century . Men and women meet romantic partners in different settings , 1 value different traits in prospective spouses , 2 and marry at significantly later ages than they did before the Sexual Revolution.3 And while marriage in the U.S. once featured relatively rigid gender roles , and especially before the twentieth century , gave husbands greater rights than wives , 4 married couples today typically share responsibility for earning money , keeping up their home , and raising their children . <p> Yet the extent to which men and women play the same roles in marriage is sometimes overstated , 5 presumably because many contemporary scholars and journalists are ideologically committed to a version of gender equality in which men and women are effectively identical . Even today , married American parents typically split up paid and domestic work along gendered lines because that 's what most of them want to do . <p> Consider , for example , how mothers and fathers spend their time . According to a Pew Research Center analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers of children under eighteen devote , on average , fourteen hours a week to child care , whereas fathers devote seven hours to it . Mothers spend eighteen hours a week doing housework , while fathers spend ten . And fathers engage in paid work thirty-seven hours a week , compared to twenty-one for women . In other words , fathers contribute roughly two-thirds of their households hours of paid labor , and mothers shoulder roughly two-thirds of the housework and child care , making their total weekly work hours essentially equal . <p> Much has indeed changed since 1965 when mothers spent just eight hours a week performing paid work and fathers devoted a paltry 2.5 hours to the care of their children.6 But little has changed in the past twenty years , 7 not because inequality between the sexes persists in marriage today , as many would have you believe , but because sex difference is stubborn . Most Americans still do n't  desire a marriage in which both spouses work full-time and all other tasks are divided on a fifty-fifty basis . <p> Despite unprecedented economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among men , studies continue to find that we want different things out of marriage and family life . <p> A 2012 poll by the Pew Research Center reveals that the majority ( fifty-three percent ) of married mothers say their ideal situation would be to work part time . Other married mothers are as likely to prefer staying at home as they are to desire full-time work ( twenty-three percent each ) . Fathers , in contrast , generally value full-time employment . Three-quarters say a full-time schedule is ideal for them , while only fifteen percent prefer part-time work and ten percent would like not to work at all.8 <p> The extent to which men and women play the same roles in marriage is sometimes overstated . <p> Of course , many if not most motherseven those with employed husbandsare not able to achieve their ideal . One 2000 survey showed that only forty-nine percent of married mothers with college degrees and forty-four percent of those without college degrees were able to live out their labor force preference . Among those whose work schedule did not align with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work less , not more.9 As feminist psychologist Eleanor Maccoby concluded in The Two Sexes : Growing Up Apart , Coming Together , even in a society that seeks to minimize the penalty women pay in the workplace for becoming parents , " there is no reason to expect that men and women will want to make exactly the same choices about the way they invest their time . " 10 <p> If dividing labor along gendered lines remains the societal norm and the average American couples preference , might it also be linked to greater marital satisfaction and individual happiness ? The scholarly literature does not provide a simple answer . As one 1998 study documented , " the relationship between wives employment and marital satisfaction has changed over the last 30 years . " Wives employment predicted lower marital quality in the 1960s , but not in subsequent decades , and by the 1980s , some studies suggested working women were happier in their marriages.11 Womens full-time employment may even be linked with lower divorce rates , according to another study , 12 or only increase the risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study using more recent survey data from thirty-two different countries , including the U.S. , concluded that how couples with children divide paid and domestic work is unrelated to individuals overall happiness in almost all regions of the world.14 <p> On the other hand , a 2006 study using a large , nationally representative sample of Americans found , to quote a press release , that " women whose husbands earn the lions share of income , who do n't  work outside the home , or who share a strong commitment to lifelong marriage with their husbands report the highest levels of marital happiness . " 15 <p> Perhaps the most natural way to make sense of these contradictory findings is a common-sense hypothesis : different couples prefer different work-family arrangements , so their happiness may depend more on whether they can fulfill their personal ideal than on the precise division of their labor . Researchers have marshaled some support for this theory . For example , in a 2013 analysis , W. Bradford Wilcox and Jeffrey Dew found that " no one work-family strategy is linked to higher reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy in ones marriageamong married mothers with children under eighteen . " The fulfillment of individual preferences , however , mattered quite a bit : " Wives who are working full-time or who are at home in violation of their preferences are , respectively , 46 percent less likely and 39 percent less likely to be very happy in their marriages , compared to stay-at-home wives who prefer to be at home . " Whether wives preferences are fulfilled also affects their husbands satisfaction.16 <p> An earlier study on the same topic arrived at similar conclusions . The effects of the division of labor on both spouses marital satisfaction " are largely explained by the mediating variables of perceived unfairness and perceived empathy , " the researchers concluded . And " personal preferences regarding the division of both domestic and paid work significantly influence marital satisfaction for both wives and husbands . " 17 The actual division of labor appears to matter less than dividing it the way a couple wants toand that usually means the husband will take the lead in paid work and the wife in parenting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both men and women , holding down a job is a crucial part of a husbands role , while labor force participation remains optional for wives . <p> While the question of how traditional versus gender-neutral arrangements affect couples happiness does not have one clear answer , the research is more straightforward in cases where traditional gender roles are reversed . When a husband works fewer hours or earns less money than his wife , as is the case for about one in four dual-earner married couples today , 18 he is less happy and the marriage is more likely to dissolve . According to some studies , his wifes happiness also declines . <p> In Wilcox and Dews study , the only work-family arrangement that predicted the marital satisfaction of men with children was working less than their wives . Married fathers whose wives worked more than they did were sixty-one percent less likely to be very happy in their marriage than men whose wives stayed home.19 Even when the wives preferred this non-traditional arrangement , these husbands were less happy . Husbands whose wives worked more also showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " how far into the process of considering or pursuing a divorce they had ventured " that has proven to predict divorce likelihoodthan other men.20 <p> Drawing on some of the same survey data , other researchers recently looked at how mens and womens relative incomes affected various aspects of relationships . They found that aversion to wives out-earning their husbands had widespread effects , impacting " marriage formation , the wifes labor force participation , the wifes income conditional on working , marriage satisfaction , the likelihood of divorce , and the division of home production . " Couples in which the wifes income was higher than the husbands were six percentage points less likely to say their marriage was happy , and six percentage points more likely to have discussed separating in the past year.21 Other research has shown that in couples where women earn more money , and especially when they are the sole breadwinner , men are more likely but women are less likely to cheat.22 A 2013 study of Danish couples even suggested that a counter-traditional balance of income undermines mens sexual performance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss likewise show that marriages in which the husband is not employed are more likely to end in divorce . One longitudinal study published in 2011 showed that when married men are not working , both they and their wives become more likely to initiate divorce . The authors attributed this finding in part to expectations about what marriage should look like . ( Womens employment did not affect mens odds of seeking a divorce , and only made women more likely to seek divorce if they assessed their marriage negatively. ) 24 <p> A 2014 study incorporating recession-era data on job loss , and focusing solely on " involuntary displacement resulting from reduced business demand or firm closing " rather than terminations , indicated that job loss only produces a higher divorce risk if it is the husband rather than the wife who was displaced.25 Seemingly , in the minds of both men and women , holding down a job is a crucial part of a husbands role , while labor force participation remains optional for wives . <p> The studies make clear that while there is no one-size-fits-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clear preferences that break down by sex . Ignoring those fault lines and exalting an androgynous vision of marriage undermines the supportive role that men clearly value and takes away the choice that women prize most . <p> 7 .

@@89588549 @5088549/ <p> Their parents are generally well-educated and affluent . They receive more time and educational resources from those parents than the average child gets from theirs . Yet they get into more conflicts with their classmates at school , display relative little interest and enthusiasm about learning tasks , and register only middling academic performance . About whom are we talking ? Adopted children . This is the paradox of adoption in America . <p> Reliable estimates on the school adjustment and academic performance of adopted children have been hard to come by . State laws bar children from being identified as adopted in school records or vital statistics . Children living with two adoptive parents represent only one percent of all children in the U.S. , so there are relatively few of them in national sample surveys of children and families . When special surveys on adopted children have been done , they have relied on parents as informants.1 <p> To expand what we know about adopted students , for this Institute for Family Studies research brief , I carried out a fresh analysis of data from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the National Center for Education Statistics beginning in 1998 . This study , known as the ECLS-K , contains enough cases of adoption ( 160 children and families ) for some reasonably robust estimates of its effects , at least in the early grades . Because the study began in kindergarten , we know the adopted children were all adopted early in their lives , if not at birth . The ECLS-K has the further advantage of being based on direct assessment of student knowledge and skills , and teachers rather than parents reports about classroom conduct.2 This is the first study of adopted childrens school behavior that is based on independent teacher reports and makes use of a representative national sample of students from adoptive families . <p> Previous analyses of federal survey data indicate that adoptive families tend to be better off financially than other families with children in the United States.3 This is partly due to self-selection and partly because of the screening that adoptive parents must go through before they are allowed to adopt . In addition , adoptive parents have higher levels of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological parents do.4 Yet my analysis shows that adoptees do not do as well in school as one would expect from their highly advantaged home environments . The results call into question the widely held assumption that larger investments of money and time in children can overcome the effects of early stress and deprivation and genetic risk factors . <p> Classroom Conduct <p> Kindergarten and first-grade teachers were asked to rate the classroom behavior of children in the ECLS-K samplehow well they got along with other children in a group situation . In both the fall of kindergarten and the spring of first grade , adopted children were more likely than biological ones to be reported to get angry easily and often argue or fight with other students . In kindergarten , the average problem behavior rating for the adopted group was at the 64th percentile , whereas for children with both birth parents , it was at the 44th percentile . ( Higher percentile ranks indicate more problem behavior . The 50th percentile represents the average rating score for all students . ) Children in single-parent , step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , not significantly different from the adopted group . <p> These gaps in problem behavior scores in kindergarten widened slightly after adjusting for differences across groups in average child age , parent education level , and racial-ethnic and gender composition , as shown in Figure 1 . The adjusted average problem behavior rating for the adopted group was at the 66th percentile ; for children with both birth parents , it was at the 45th percentile . After adjustment , adopted children showed significantly more problem behavior than children in single-parent , step , and foster families , who were at the 56th percentile as a group . <p> A similar pattern was evident in the behavior ratings provided by first-grade teachers . Adopted students were at the 63rd percentile in raw teacher ratings of problem behavior , vs. the 43rd percentile for students from families with two biological parents . Students from other types of families were at the 60th percentile , not significantly worse than adopted students .

Scores on these measures have proven to be predictive of later academic performance and career success beyond elementary school.5 Adopted children were rated less highly with respect to such positive approaches to learning than were children being raised by both birth parents . In kindergarten , the adopted groups average rating score was at the 45th percentile , whereas for the two-biological-parent group , the average was at the 57th percentile . The learning-approach ratings for adopted students were not significantly different from those for students living with single or remarried birth parents or foster parents , who were at the 43rd percentile .

The adopted group was also lower than the single- , step- , and foster-parent group , now at the 47th percentile , although this difference was only marginally significant . <p> The approach-to-learning ratings of first-grade teachers revealed a similar pattern . Prior to adjustment , adopted children were at the 44th percentile , significantly lower than students with both birth parents ( 56th percentile ) and not significantly different from students from other family types ( 39th percentile ) . After adjustment , the adopted group was at the 39th percentile , significantly lower than the two-birth-parent group ( 53rd percentile ) and not significantly different from the students from other family types ( 42nd percentile ) . The adjusted percentiles for both kindergarten and first-grade teachers ratings are shown in Figure 2 . <p> Early Reading Skills <p> In addition to gathering teachers reports of childrens behavior and attitudes , the ECLS-K tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between students from different family types , though they are generally smaller in magnitude than on the measures reported above . <p> As the participating children began kindergarten , the ECLS-K assessed their pre-reading skills , such as recognizing letters by name , associating sounds with letters , identifying simple words by sight . Adopted children seemed to perform these tasks fairly well : their average score on the reading assessment reached the 53rd percentile . This was not significantly different from the average score of children being raised by both birth parents ( 55th percentile ) . And the adoptees outperformed children from other family types ( single-parent , step , or foster families ) , whose observed average score was at the 38th percentile . <p> When the early reading scores were adjusted for differences across groups in age , sex , parent education , and racial-ethnic composition , a different picture emerged , however . As shown in Figure 3 , the adjusted average score of the adopted group fell to the 44th percentile , primarily because of the high educational attainment of their adoptive parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " other family types " group , whose adjusted score rose to the 45th percentile .

Children were tested on grade-appropriate skills like reading and understanding words in context . Once again , the reading skills of children with both birth parents ( 56th percentile ) exceeded those of children in single- , step- , and foster-parent families , who were at the 41st percentile . Adopted children , at the 49th percentile , were not significantly more advanced than the latter group . <p> The picture was similar after adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic differences across groups .

Again , the adopted children did fairly well . Their average raw score was about the same as that for all U.S. kindergartners , that is , at the 50th percentile . However , they did less well than children with both birth parents , whose average math skills were at the 59th percentile . And their performance was not significantly better than that of children from single-parent , step , and foster families , who were at the 41st percentile ( again , the apparent difference was not statistically significant due to a larger margin of error ) . <p> When childrens math scores were adjusted for the same demographic and socioeconomic factors mentioned above , the performance of the adopted group was significantly worse than that of both the birth-parent group and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Figure 4 , the adopted groups adjusted math score was at the 39th percentile , while the adjusted score of the both-birth-parent group reached the 52nd percentile and that of children from other family types was at the 47th percentile . <p> In first grade , ECLS-K children were tested on grade-appropriate math skills like carrying out simple arithmetic operations . Students with both birth parents were at the 56th percentile , significantly more advanced than those from single-parent , step , and foster families , who were at the 38th percentile . Adopted first graders , at the 40th percentile , were not significantly ahead of that group . After adjustments for demographic and socioeconomic disparities , the percentile rank for adopted children fell to the 32nd percentile . Their adjusted math performance was significantly inferior to that of biological children in two-parent families ( 52nd percentile ) and children in other family types ( 46th percentile ) . <p> Why Do n't  Adopted Children Do Better ? <p> The data presented in this research brief show that adopted children in kindergarten and first grade display above-average levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes , and score below average on reading and math assessments , despite their advantaged family background . Why do n't  the plentiful resources and strenuous nurturing efforts of adoptive parents lead to better classroom conduct and higher achievement by their adopted children ? Possible reasons why family resources do not always produce great outcomes may be found in attachment theory , traumatic stress theory , and behavior genetics . <p> Attachment theory holds that a warm , intimate , and continuous relationship with at least one adult , usually the mother , is essential for the mental health of infants and young children . Children who do not develop a stable and secure bond during early childhood , or have the bond disrupted , are subject to both short-term distress reactions and longer-term abnormalities in their feelings and behavior toward other people . Not having a stable maternal bond is apt to produce long-lasting deficits in the childs social development , deficiencies that are not easily remedied by a new home environment , no matter how favorable . <p> Some adopted children experienced neglect , abuse , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress theory , the likelihood of long-term emotional scars depends on the intensity and duration of the stress . Severe or prolonged early stress can have long-lasting effects on a childs development , effects that a supportive adoptive family may only partly ameliorate . <p> Behavior genetics is relevant because adoptive parents usually can not choose or control the genetic endowment of the children they adopt . Indeed , often they are not even fully informed about the educational attainments or occupations of the childs birth parents , nor do they learn much about their family histories . In other instances , adoptive parents consciously select children with known disabilities , hoping that the parental care they provide will enable the children to thrive . <p> Because the educational attainments of adoptive parents are exceptionally high , the genetic endowment of most children available for adoption is likely to be less favorable to intellectual accomplishment than the endowments of their adoptive parents . No matter how much intellectual stimulation and encouragement the parents provide the child , they may not be able to overcome the limitations of the childs genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to offer in accounting for the paradox of adoption in America . However , none of the findings presented here is meant to minimize the tremendous contribution that adoptive parents make to the children they take in or to society in general . Many adopted children do reasonably well in school and enjoy lives that are far better than they would have experienced had they not been adopted . And they do so at less cost and burden to the public than if the children were raised in foster homes or institutions . <p> At the same time , it is important for both prospective adoptive parents and policy-makers to be realistic about what adoption can and can not accomplish . The availability of the " adoption option " does not do away with the need for better prevention of unplanned and unwanted conceptions , so that fewer children are born into high-risk situations where they are likely to experience neglect or abuse and become in need of adoption . <p> Nicholas Zill is a psychologist and survey researcher who has written on indicators of family and child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the head of the Child and Family Study Area at Westat , a social science research corporation in the Washington , D.C. , area .

In interviews my colleagues and I conducted with 100 parents around the United States , parents discussed communication and intimacy more than any other topic we did n't  ask them about directly . Their comments reveal a strong desireeven a felt obligationfor warm , continual , spontaneous , and anti-authoritarian communication with their children . <p> Jonathan , a married father who works as a nurse and has four kids , says the joy , intimacy , and affection his children show him is the greatest part of parenthood : " Its joy that they bringcoming home from work and having your children run up to you with arms open wide and say , Daddys home ! There 's just something about that that 's joyful . " <p> Because he feels very close to his children , Jonathan says that " receiving that kind of love and affection unrequested , unrehearsed , un-demanded is very much a joy . " <p> Felicia , a single mother who works in food services , says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you for certain things , and the love that they give . " She explains that her daughter writes her a lot of notes that say , " I love you Mommy " and puts them under her door . Felicia appreciates these gestures of intimacy : " Especially when they carry the little pictures and notes that they write and leave for you , cause my kids , they 're really sentimental . It really makes me proud because I know that my kids , they love me and they care about me and I 'm important to them . " <p> In addition to appreciating these emotional rewards , parents expressed the desire to communicate freely with their children , often contrasting this to their own parents stricter disciplinary approach . <p> James , a married father of three sons , says the hardest part of raising kids is " teaching them right from wrong . " He says he does this differently than his parents did : " its more , instead of whipping , more talking .

" <p> He says that with his own son , hed " rather sit down and talk with him than raise my voice with him . " James thinks that when they sit down and talk " man to man , " his son " respects that more " and they " can communicate better about it . " <p> Adults have not always sought this level of communication and intimacy with their sons and daughters . <p> Although this feels quite natural and " right " to most parents today , adults have not always sought this level of communication and intimacy with their sons and daughters . <p> Historically , children were " economic assets " : they served as workers , contributing to the household economy by performing essential tasks around the farm . As the United States shifted from an agrarian society to a more industrial one in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , children started to work in factories , which meant they were still expected to contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution on the family farm . <p> But the emergence of child labor laws reflected a change in societys expectations for children , and by the 1930s childrens economic contributions to the home had decreased significantly . As Viviana Zelizer point out in Pricing the Priceless Child : The Changing Social Value of Children , proponents of child labor laws argued that " true parental love could only exist if the child was defined exclusively as an object of sentimentality and not as an agent of production . " As children decreased in economic value , they increased in sentimental value , which gave rise to notions of the " priceless " and " vulnerable " child . Children moved from being economic assets to being emotional assets . <p> The field of child psychology developed to reflect and reinforce these changes in childrens roles , as historians Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg have documented . Psychologists began to focus on the development of the childs personality , which brought about distinct changes in childrearing ; strict discipline gave way to " a more humanistic and empathetic approach .

Parents are not exactly sure why its better than before , but they think it is , and they feel pressed to comply . <p> One dad described a strong cultural norm for communication with your kids this way : " you 're just supposed to do itIts important ; communication is important , that 's what everybody stresses .

And yet parents old role as authoritative disciplinarians has not disappeared , for parents use closeness and communication and intimacy to influence and direct their children .

It is more affectionate and warmer for sure , and perhaps better characterized as " influence " or soft power . Nevertheless , it remains a form of parental authority . <p> This is not to suggest that this new focus on intimacy and communication is necessarily bad for kidsits undoubtedly a kinder , gentler approach . Yet this new culture of intimacy , like any culture , entails a set of compelling norms to which parents must conform . And even as parents focus on these newer forms of emotional rewards and intimacy , there 's still a lot of " old-fashioned " ( albeit subtler ) authority , discipline , and control at the heart of the parent-child relationship . <p> Jeffrey S.

@@89588559 @5088559/ <p> Their parents are generally well-educated and affluent . They receive more time and educational resources from those parents than the average child gets from theirs . Yet they get into more conflicts with their classmates at school , display relative little interest and enthusiasm about learning tasks , and register only middling academic performance . About whom are we talking ? Adopted children . This is the paradox of adoption in America . <p> Reliable estimates on the school adjustment and academic performance of adopted children have been hard to come by . State laws bar children from being identified as adopted in school records or vital statistics . Children living with two adoptive parents represent only one percent of all children in the U.S. , so there are relatively few of them in national sample surveys of children and families . When special surveys on adopted children have been done , they have relied on parents as informants.1 <p> To expand what we know about adopted students , for this Institute for Family Studies research brief , I carried out a fresh analysis of data from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the National Center for Education Statistics beginning in 1998 . This study , known as the ECLS-K , contains enough cases of adoption ( 160 children and families ) for some reasonably robust estimates of its effects , at least in the early grades . Because the study began in kindergarten , we know the adopted children were all adopted early in their lives , if not at birth . The ECLS-K has the further advantage of being based on direct assessment of student knowledge and skills , and teachers rather than parents reports about classroom conduct.2 This is the first study of adopted childrens school behavior that is based on independent teacher reports and makes use of a representative national sample of students from adoptive families . <p> Previous analyses of federal survey data indicate that adoptive families tend to be better off financially than other families with children in the United States.3 This is partly due to self-selection and partly because of the screening that adoptive parents must go through before they are allowed to adopt . In addition , adoptive parents have higher levels of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological parents do.4 Yet my analysis shows that adoptees do not do as well in school as one would expect from their highly advantaged home environments . The results call into question the widely held assumption that larger investments of money and time in children can overcome the effects of early stress and deprivation and genetic risk factors . <p> Classroom Conduct <p> Kindergarten and first-grade teachers were asked to rate the classroom behavior of children in the ECLS-K samplehow well they got along with other children in a group situation . In both the fall of kindergarten and the spring of first grade , adopted children were more likely than biological ones to be reported to get angry easily and often argue or fight with other students . In kindergarten , the average problem behavior rating for the adopted group was at the 64th percentile , whereas for children with both birth parents , it was at the 44th percentile . ( Higher percentile ranks indicate more problem behavior . The 50th percentile represents the average rating score for all students . ) Children in single-parent , step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , not significantly different from the adopted group . <p> These gaps in problem behavior scores in kindergarten widened slightly after adjusting for differences across groups in average child age , parent education level , and racial-ethnic and gender composition , as shown in Figure 1 . The adjusted average problem behavior rating for the adopted group was at the 66th percentile ; for children with both birth parents , it was at the 45th percentile . After adjustment , adopted children showed significantly more problem behavior than children in single-parent , step , and foster families , who were at the 56th percentile as a group . <p> A similar pattern was evident in the behavior ratings provided by first-grade teachers . Adopted students were at the 63rd percentile in raw teacher ratings of problem behavior , vs. the 43rd percentile for students from families with two biological parents . Students from other types of families were at the 60th percentile , not significantly worse than adopted students . After adjustment , the adopted group was at the 64th percentile , significantly worse than the both birth-parent group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students from single-parent , step , and foster families ( 56th percentile ) . <p> Positive Approach to Learning Activities <p> Children in the ECLS-K were also rated by their teachers on how well they paid attention in class , whether they seemed eager to learn new things , and whether they persisted at challenging learning tasks . Scores on these measures have proven to be predictive of later academic performance and career success beyond elementary school.5 Adopted children were rated less highly with respect to such positive approaches to learning than were children being raised by both birth parents . In kindergarten , the adopted groups average rating score was at the 45th percentile , whereas for the two-biological-parent group , the average was at the 57th percentile . The learning-approach ratings for adopted students were not significantly different from those for students living with single or remarried birth parents or foster parents , who were at the 43rd percentile .

The adopted group was also lower than the single- , step- , and foster-parent group , now at the 47th percentile , although this difference was only marginally significant . <p> The approach-to-learning ratings of first-grade teachers revealed a similar pattern . Prior to adjustment , adopted children were at the 44th percentile , significantly lower than students with both birth parents ( 56th percentile ) and not significantly different from students from other family types ( 39th percentile ) . After adjustment , the adopted group was at the 39th percentile , significantly lower than the two-birth-parent group ( 53rd percentile ) and not significantly different from the students from other family types ( 42nd percentile ) . The adjusted percentiles for both kindergarten and first-grade teachers ratings are shown in Figure 2 . <p> Early Reading Skills <p> In addition to gathering teachers reports of childrens behavior and attitudes , the ECLS-K tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between students from different family types , though they are generally smaller in magnitude than on the measures reported above . <p> As the participating children began kindergarten , the ECLS-K assessed their pre-reading skills , such as recognizing letters by name , associating sounds with letters , identifying simple words by sight . Adopted children seemed to perform these tasks fairly well : their average score on the reading assessment reached the 53rd percentile . This was not significantly different from the average score of children being raised by both birth parents ( 55th percentile ) . And the adoptees outperformed children from other family types ( single-parent , step , or foster families ) , whose observed average score was at the 38th percentile . <p> When the early reading scores were adjusted for differences across groups in age , sex , parent education , and racial-ethnic composition , a different picture emerged , however . As shown in Figure 3 , the adjusted average score of the adopted group fell to the 44th percentile , primarily because of the high educational attainment of their adoptive parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " other family types " group , whose adjusted score rose to the 45th percentile .

Children were tested on grade-appropriate skills like reading and understanding words in context . Once again , the reading skills of children with both birth parents ( 56th percentile ) exceeded those of children in single- , step- , and foster-parent families , who were at the 41st percentile . Adopted children , at the 49th percentile , were not significantly more advanced than the latter group . <p> The picture was similar after adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic differences across groups .

Again , the adopted children did fairly well . Their average raw score was about the same as that for all U.S. kindergartners , that is , at the 50th percentile . However , they did less well than children with both birth parents , whose average math skills were at the 59th percentile . And their performance was not significantly better than that of children from single-parent , step , and foster families , who were at the 41st percentile ( again , the apparent difference was not statistically significant due to a larger margin of error ) . <p> When childrens math scores were adjusted for the same demographic and socioeconomic factors mentioned above , the performance of the adopted group was significantly worse than that of both the birth-parent group and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Figure 4 , the adopted groups adjusted math score was at the 39th percentile , while the adjusted score of the both-birth-parent group reached the 52nd percentile and that of children from other family types was at the 47th percentile . <p> In first grade , ECLS-K children were tested on grade-appropriate math skills like carrying out simple arithmetic operations . Students with both birth parents were at the 56th percentile , significantly more advanced than those from single-parent , step , and foster families , who were at the 38th percentile . Adopted first graders , at the 40th percentile , were not significantly ahead of that group . After adjustments for demographic and socioeconomic disparities , the percentile rank for adopted children fell to the 32nd percentile . Their adjusted math performance was significantly inferior to that of biological children in two-parent families ( 52nd percentile ) and children in other family types ( 46th percentile ) . <p> Why Do n't  Adopted Children Do Better ? <p> The data presented in this research brief show that adopted children in kindergarten and first grade display above-average levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes , and score below average on reading and math assessments , despite their advantaged family background . Why do n't  the plentiful resources and strenuous nurturing efforts of adoptive parents lead to better classroom conduct and higher achievement by their adopted children ? Possible reasons why family resources do not always produce great outcomes may be found in attachment theory , traumatic stress theory , and behavior genetics . <p> Attachment theory holds that a warm , intimate , and continuous relationship with at least one adult , usually the mother , is essential for the mental health of infants and young children . Children who do not develop a stable and secure bond during early childhood , or have the bond disrupted , are subject to both short-term distress reactions and longer-term abnormalities in their feelings and behavior toward other people . Not having a stable maternal bond is apt to produce long-lasting deficits in the childs social development , deficiencies that are not easily remedied by a new home environment , no matter how favorable . <p> Some adopted children experienced neglect , abuse , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress theory , the likelihood of long-term emotional scars depends on the intensity and duration of the stress . Severe or prolonged early stress can have long-lasting effects on a childs development , effects that a supportive adoptive family may only partly ameliorate . <p> Behavior genetics is relevant because adoptive parents usually can not choose or control the genetic endowment of the children they adopt . Indeed , often they are not even fully informed about the educational attainments or occupations of the childs birth parents , nor do they learn much about their family histories . In other instances , adoptive parents consciously select children with known disabilities , hoping that the parental care they provide will enable the children to thrive . <p> Because the educational attainments of adoptive parents are exceptionally high , the genetic endowment of most children available for adoption is likely to be less favorable to intellectual accomplishment than the endowments of their adoptive parents . No matter how much intellectual stimulation and encouragement the parents provide the child , they may not be able to overcome the limitations of the childs genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to offer in accounting for the paradox of adoption in America . However , none of the findings presented here is meant to minimize the tremendous contribution that adoptive parents make to the children they take in or to society in general . Many adopted children do reasonably well in school and enjoy lives that are far better than they would have experienced had they not been adopted . And they do so at less cost and burden to the public than if the children were raised in foster homes or institutions . <p> At the same time , it is important for both prospective adoptive parents and policy-makers to be realistic about what adoption can and can not accomplish . The availability of the " adoption option " does not do away with the need for better prevention of unplanned and unwanted conceptions , so that fewer children are born into high-risk situations where they are likely to experience neglect or abuse and become in need of adoption . <p> Nicholas Zill is a psychologist and survey researcher who has written on indicators of family and child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the head of the Child and Family Study Area at Westat , a social science research corporation in the Washington , D.C. , area . 
@@89588560 @5088560/ <p> Decision making about sexual practices and family formation has become complex for those who identify with counter-cultural and sub-cultural groups ( or who simply ascribe to traditional views about sexuality and family life ) . The widening gap between modern and traditional family norms and values has created an internal dissonance between societal and group specific beliefs about many aspects of sex , marriage , and family . <p> I have devoted the majority of my professional and academic pursuits to examining how ones professed religious belief influences family formation patterns ( specifically individuals likelihood of cohabitating ) . In my own research , I have examined the cohabitation patterns of Catholics , Protestants , and those who identified as having no religion , in Canada . Ultimately I found that although Catholics held the most firm beliefs regarding the behaviors encompassed in cohabitation ( extra-marital sex and possibly contraceptive usage ) , they did not exhibit lower rates of cohabitation than other religious groups ( in this case Protestants and those who do not affiliate with a religion ) . What is more , Catholics odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups observed or occasionally similar to that of respondents of no religion . <p> Why was this case ? Why was the only group with established doctrine about the behaviors encompassed in cohabitation ( as something not beneficial and immoral ) , similar to individuals that do n't  affiliate with a religion in practice ? <p> First , my results were specific to Canadas unique cultural factors and regional factors . Canadas figures are largely skewed by the many Quebeckers that identify as Catholic ( almost half of the Catholics in my sample resided in Quebec ) but do n't  live religious lives . Second , mirroring trends in the global decline of religion , individuals in Canada may be developing more liberal views of religion . So while many may report religious affiliation , few exhibit religious behavior in all areas of their lives . <p> Beyond my own research on the subject , much of the past and current research about religion and family formation indicates that religious factors have a significant influence on adherents behavior in matters of sexuality and family life and that often religion decreases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as cohabiting ) . 1 <p> Among more recent findings , a report about the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth by Goodwin , Mosher , &amp; Chandra found that " 60% of non-Hispanic white women for whom religion was very important in their daily lives were currently married , compared with 36% of white women for whom religion was not important . Similar patterns in marital or cohabiting status by importance of religion were found for non-Hispanic men and women , black men , and Hispanic men and women . " Similarly , Eggebeen and Dew found that Catholics who attended Church regularly and displayed " fervor " were actually less likely to cohabit than " devout " Conservative Protestants . Furthermore , Thornton , Axinn , and Xie found that the higher the religiosity of ones family , the greater the likelihood of marrying and the lower the likelihood of cohabiting : " Young adults who are from more religious families and are more religious themselves " they found , " have substantially higher marriage rates and lower cohabitation rates than young adults who are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gault-Sherman and Draper found that religious networks and communities and the religiosity of ones geographic location influences union formation negatively , and that the degree at which religion influences union formation patterns varies by geographic location and religious group . Evangelicals were less likely to cohabit and being a Southerner and Christian influenced union formation patterns the most . <p> Given that past literature on the topic suggests that religion has a notable influence on adherents family formation practices and that religion is associated with more traditional attitudes and family formation structures , going forward it will be particularly important to assess what specific qualities of religious factors contribute to the noted consistencies between adherents beliefs and behavior . For instance , in the case of Eggebeen and Dews finding about the religious factors that point to the different cohabitation rates between Catholics and Conservative Protestants ( see above ) , what about displaying " fervor " aids individuals to behave counter-culturally ? How does religious fervor come about ? Research models that include the greatest number of religious measures , such as Cornwalls model , which consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious socialization , and socio-demographic characteristics , " could allow scholars to determine the most accurate results about the role that multiple facets of religiosity have on peoples lives . Additionally , given that the Catholic Church is not the only religious group that does not view the behaviors encompassed in cohabitation as beneficial , 2 future studies should aim to include as many religions as possible and should differentiate Protestants groups by denomination . Doing so could help to clarify how the specific religious beliefs of a group influence their behavior . <p> As cohabitation and other changing practices in the realm of sexuality and family life , become more prevalent in Western countries , further research about the association between religion and family formation will be of great importance for both scholars who study culture , religion and family , and for the many groups that hold norms , values , and beliefs that are in opposition to these societal trends .

This observation , well-supported by years of research , will come as a surprise to no one . Having better-educated parents means a higher household income , which for kids translates into attending better schools , among many other benefits . And more educated parents are more likely to marry before having kids and to stay married long-term , so their kids reap the benefits of family stability . Furthermore , since intelligence is linked to educational attainment and is partially heritable , children of college-educated parents may have inborn , genetic advantages over other children . <p> But the effects of parents ' education do not boil down to these factors alone ; according to a variety of studies , their educationparticularly a mother 's educationalso has a causal impact on children 's outcomes through many separate mechanisms .

Essentially , it refers to individuals ' knowledge , skills , and abilities , which they develop primarily through education and " capitalize " on in the workforce . In the realm of parenting , a college degree ( or the knowledge and skills it stands for ) seems to make people interact with their kids differently . Take the famous thirty-million word gap , for example : some scholars estimate that children of parents on welfare hear 30 million fewer words by the age of four than the children of professional parents . <p> The gap is not only about quantity , but quality : Better educated parents also use a wider vocabulary , and they dole out affirmations ( not just complimenting kids , but repeating and building on what they say ) more generously than less educated parents .

" Think visiting museums and taking music lessonsthe sort of activities that upper-middle class parents emphasize . Participating in such activities " has been associated with teacher-reported academic outcomes for children and adolescents in a number of studies that have adjusted for other factors , " and it bolsters high school students ' college applications . <p> Cultural capital also helps kids to navigate the education system successfully : more educated mothers are more comfortable with schools , so they are more likely to advocate for their kids there ( say , requesting that their child be assigned a certain well-regarded teacher ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves ( for instance , telling a child how to request the opportunity to re-take a failed test ) . <p> Social Capital <p> Social capital encompasses " interactions that take place between mothers and people in their social networks or between people in mothers ' social networks and children .

College-educated mothers are more likely to be part of social networks containing " knowledge , skills , and resources that are relevant to children 's academic success , " the researchers propose . For instance , their relatives , colleagues , and friends are likely to also have college degrees , meaning mothers can easily pick up tips about the best schools or gain advice about the college application process .

The entire paper underlines just how deeply children 's lives are shaped by their parents ' background . In a free country , it seems to me , that means there will never be such a thing as perfectly equal opportunity : People with different education levels and abilities are always going to raise their kids differently , and no set of programs can entirely close the gaps that result .

@@89588568 @5088568/ <p> If you hope to avoid divorce , what 's the ideal age to get married ? For years , it seemed like the longer you waited to marry , the better . That 's because the relationship between age at marriage and divorce risk was almost linear : The older you were , the lower the chances of divorce . Although teens still face an elevated divorce risk relative to older adults , my analysis of more recent data shows that those who tie the knot after their early thirties are now more likely to divorce than those who marry in their late twenties . <p> Its no mystery why people who marry as teens face a high risk of divorce . Just recall your high school boyfriend or girlfriend . Along with the exhilaration of first love often came jealousy , insecurity , pressure from parents or friends , and tearful doubts about the future . Now imagine getting married under the same conditions . Scholars have long known that youthful marriage is a strong predictor of divorce . For instance , someone who marries at 25 is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who weds at age 20 . Most youthful couples simply do not have the maturity , coping skills , and social support it takes to make marriage work . In the face of routine marital problems , teens and young twenty-somethings lack the wherewithal necessary for happy resolutions . <p> Scholars have long known that youthful marriage is a strong predictor of divorce . <p> What about age at marriage past the twenties ? Delaying marriage from the teens until the early twenties produces the largest declines in divorce risk , for totally understandable reasons : were all changing a lot more from year to year as teenagers than when were in our twenties or thirties . Our parents and friends are likely to disapprove of a teenage marriage , but their feelings probably wont change much once we hit our mid-twenties . Still , earlier scholarship found that the risk of divorce continued to decline past that point , albeit at a milder rate ( as the figure using 1995 data shows below ) . And why wouldnt it ? Couples in their thirties are more mature and usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correlated with lower educational attainment , which compounds divorce risk no matter how old you are . <p> But what was true for decades no longer seems to be the case . I analyzed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from the National Survey of Family Growth ( NSFG ) . The trick is to use statistical methods that permit nonlinear relationships to emerge ( click here for more information on these methods ) . My data analysis shows that prior to age 32 or so , each additional year of age at marriage reduces the odds of divorce by 11 percent . However , after that the odds of divorce increase by 5 percent per year . The change in slopes is statistically significant . The graph below shows what the relationship between age at marriage and divorce looks like now . <p> This is a big change . To the best of my knowledge , its only recently that thirty-something marriage started to incur a higher divorce risk . It appears to be a trend that 's gradually developed over the past twenty years : a study based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who married in their thirties was flattening out , rather than continuing to decline through that decade of life as it previously had . <p> How can this change be explained ? The first step to answering this question is to see if the pattern persists after adjusting for a variety of social and demographic differences between survey respondents . Indeed it does : thirty-something marriage continues to yield a higher divorce rate even after controlling for respondents sex , race , family structure of origin , age at the time of the survey , education , religious tradition , religious attendance , and sexual history , as well as the size of the metropolitan area that they live in . Note that the NSFG is a cross-sectional survey , which means that all respondent information was collected at a single point in time . Consequently the effects of education , religious attendance , and other impermanent demographic attributes on marital stability may not be causal . Results involving these variables should therefore be treated as provisional . <p> Past the age of 32 or so , the odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . <p> None of these variables seem to have much of an effect on the relationship between age at marriage and divorce risk . Additional tests revealed that the relation seems to function more or less the same for everyone : male or female , less or more educated , religious or irreligious , intact or nonintact family of origin , and limited versus extensive sexual history prior to marriage . For almost everyone , the late twenties seems to be the best time to tie the knot . <p> Does the experience of staying unmarried well past the age of 30 somehow make people unfit for a lasting marriage ? Its possible to envision a scenario where this might be the case , particularly in the form of a complicated relationship history . If you 've had many boyfriends or girlfriends , your exes might play havoc with your marriage . They may offer the temptation of adultery . If you 've had children with one or more of your exes , there could be " baby mama drama . " Indeed , having multiple sexual partners prior to marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it may , the number of prior sexual partners NSFG respondents had does not explain the relationship between age at marriage and marital stability . This result suggests that the mere experience of waiting past your early thirties to get marrieda so-called " direct effect " can not explain why thirty-something marriages now have higher divorce rates than do unions formed in the late twenties . <p> Instead , my money is on a selection effect : the kinds of people who wait till their thirties to get married may be the kinds of people who are n't  predisposed toward doing well in their marriages . For instance , some people seem to be congenitally cantankerous . Such people naturally have trouble with interpersonal relationships . Consequently they delay marriage , often because they cant find anyone willing to marry them . When they do tie the knot , their marriages are automatically at high risk for divorce . More generally , perhaps people who marry later face a pool of potential spouses that has been winnowed down to exclude the individuals most predisposed to succeed at matrimony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explanation . Its easy to imagine that selection produces higher divorce rates for people past their early thirties . Its also easy to provide evidence that selection is , in fact , responsible for high divorce rates ( I have done so by controlling for potentially confounding variables like sexual history ) . Its much harder to identify the mechanisms responsible for selection . Accordingly this should be a focus of research going forward . <p> The kinds of people who wait till their thirties to get married may be the kinds of people who are n't  predisposed toward doing well in their marriages . <p> The other pressing question about this theory concerns how matrimony has changed : marrying late only recently became associated with a heightened risk of divorce , and would n't a similar process of selection have operated in the past ? To answer this question we should ponder the social forces that discourage marriage in the United States . As of 2011 , the median marriage age was 29 for men and 27 for women , the highest its been in decades for men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proposed for the record-setting rise in peoples age at marriage , two stand out . First , people are waiting to marry because they cant afford it ( or feel like they cant afford it ) due to wage stagnation . People now need more work experience to make the same wages , so they delay tying the knot . Second , there are now many more alternatives to matrimony . Young adults need not be married to have sex lives , and they are free to live with their partners out of wedlock . <p> I view the newly heightened divorce rate for people who wed after their early thirties as a sort of practical pushback against the social forces that are driving up the median age at marriage . Many people who delay marriage nowadays for financial reasons marry as soon as they feel they can afford it . These are the people who wed in their late twenties , the years of peak marital stability . The folks remaining in the pool of marriage-eligible singles are the kinds of people who are n't  well suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In previous years , when people did n't  feel like they were holding off on marriage because of money , the folks who waited into their thirties perhaps did n't  represent people ill-disposed to have lasting marriages . Its also possible that some of the modern alternatives to marriage are too successful at siphoning people out of the marriage pool . Maybe some of the thirty-somethings who would have made good spouses now feel perfectly comfortable being single , or living with partners out of wedlock . Finally , we can not definitively rule out causal arguments . With median marriage ages as high as they 've ever been , perhaps some people who delay marriage get so used to single life that they make lousy spouses should they ever decide to give marriage a try . <p> This is all conjecture . But we do know beyond a shadow of a doubt that people who marry in their thirties are now at greater risk of divorce than are people who wed in their late twenties . This is a new development . This finding changes the demographic landscape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case for earlier marriage . <p> Note : Unadjusted estimates of divorce in NSFG in 1995 and 2006-2010 . <p> Update , 1:15 p.m. : Some readers have asked about the Y-axes in this post . The figures were generated using Generalized Additive Models , so the Y-axes are in a standardized metric that would n't resonate with most readers . To illustrate what the divorce levels look like for different ages at first marriage , I estimate the percentages of people in each age group who will divorce after five years of marriage in the figure above . They are consistent with the graphs and numbers in the article . <p> Qualifications : There is right censoring for the 35+ group . What that means : the NSFG is a sample of adults ages 15-44 , so people in the 35+ group are especially likely to have married within a year or two of the data collection . Thus their divorce rates appear lower than theyd actually be if these people had been more fully observed ( i.e. , had they been followed for a few more years ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1995 is small ( N = 74 ) . This wasnt of any great concern , because the story here is the same as it is for every other study on this topic : the divorce rate declines monotonically with age at marriage .

@@89588577 @5088577/ <p> Parents in a recent survey agreed , by a six-to-one margin , that parenting is seen as more difficult today than in the past . <p> Indeed , to hear today 's moms and dads tell it , Ruth Graham wrote recently at Slate , parents " never get their houses clean , never have sex , never read books or have adult conversations , never shower , and never , ever have a moment to themselves . " That 's hyperbolic , as Graham and parents themselves know , but ( many parent-bloggers seem to say ) it 's not far off the mark . <p> How could parenting be so hard today , when the basic tasks of feeding , clothing , protecting , and educating kids have never been easier ? Responding to Graham 's piece and drawing on Jennifer Senior 's book All Joy and No Fun : The Paradox of Modern Parenthood , Ross Douthat suggests one major reason that parenting seems tougher now than ever before : <p> It is n't necessarily that family life has changed that dramatically in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waysbecause babies still need what babies needwhile outside the domestic sphere there 's been an expansion of opportunities , a proliferation of choices and entertainments and immediately available gratifications , that make child rearing seem much more burdensome by comparison . <p> I 'd add two more theories to the ones Graham and Douthat mention . First , only in recent decades has becoming a parent truly been a choice . For most of history , it was a given : You were a child , you grew up , you got married , you had kids , you grew old , you died . Now the " having kids " stage is totally optional ( even if a stigma is still attached to declining or not being able to do so ) . And the downsides of our choices seem to weigh more heavily on us than the downsides of inevitabilities . Contrast parenting with , say , working . For most Americans , having a job is not an option : it is a necessity . You may find work boring , frustrating , or exhausting , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you complain about work , you know that most of the human race could make similar complaints . <p> But in the contemporary U.S. , having a child , even for those who feel a moral obligation and a strong desire to do so , is an option . It marks a major but not inevitable change in life , and so its burdens feel especially heavy . You are not sharing the experience of parenting with everyone in your generation , in the way that all teenagers share the turbulence of adolescence or all octogenarians share the struggles of aging . Parenting is something you took on voluntarily---and now you must live with the consequences , many of which you never expected . <p> My second theory about why raising kids seems so hard today is the proliferation of parenting philosophies , health guidelines , educational options , and more . Being a parent today does n't just mean having a baby and raising him or her to become a reasonably healthy , literate adult . From the positive pregnancy test onward , it means navigating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to eat and avoid during pregnancy , what painkillers ( if any ) to accept during childbirth , whether or not to let your infant cry himself to sleep , how to potty-train her , at what age he should enter kindergarten , whether and how to pass on your religious faith to her , at what age he can stay home alone , how much time she should spend watching TV , exercising , reading . . . <p> It 's no wonder even the most conscientious parents are overwhelmed---and as a consequence , sometimes both uncertain and defensive about their choices . The blogger Jennifer Fulwiler once described parents ' feelings perfectly . Despite the inconvenience of teaching her kids about the Tooth Fairy and Santa , she finally decides to continue the tradition simply because " it is the way our families have always done it " : <p> And I needdesperately , seriously , **29;159;TOOLONG needone area of my life as a parent that I do not have to agonize about .

I cant even send my kids to the school down the street without second-guessing it because now we have the options of homeschooling and charter schools . <p> There was a time when mothers just did things the way their own mothers did , and that was that . There are plenty of downsides to that kind of cultural environment , but I 'd imagine that one huge upside is that you do n't  burn up half your mental energy questioning everything you do . Ultimately I 'm glad that we live in an age where were all free to break from tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw the line somewhere , and I 'm drawing the line with our fairy traditions . <p> Unfortunately , there 's no good way out of the quandaries Fulwiler describes . Of course parents should put some thought into how they feed , educate , and raise their kids , even if today 's multiplicity of choices means those decisions are harder to make than they were for previous generations . Maybe the best option is simply to realize that most parents really are trying to do what 's best for their kids , and to extend a little more grace to the parents who raise their kids differently than you raise yours .

What 's going on here ? <p> Larry Mead advances one interpretation in his essay in Does Character Matter ? He points to the qualitative research of people like Kathryn Edin and Elijah Anderson and says , " Their respondents see marriage and work largely as moral issues . They assume jobs are available . They know that they can and should work . If they do not , they do not blame the society . Rather , they blame themselves or others for moral shortcomings . " Mead says that " Character mostly means a capacity to commit to difficult tasks , " and it is that capacity to commitnot opportunitythat has declined . " The nonworking poor do n't  talk like trade unionists , " he says . <p> To Meads point , we heard plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Dana stagehand who struggled to find full-time hours during the winterabout his friends jobs , he was to the point . <p> I do n't  believe I have any friends that are actually unemployed . All my friends work . Because somebody who does n't  work in my mind is just lazy . Because I mean , as hard as it is to find a job , there is work out there . There is people hiring . But like I said , you got ta get your foot in the door . You can always get a job in the restaurant , but most people do n't  wan na lower themselves to getting a restaurant job . But like I said , a paycheck is better than no paycheck if you suck it up . Once you 've got that money , you can buy yourself a suit and go out and get another job , or put yourself through vocational school . <p> But the " people are lazy " story was n't the only one we heard . Some people noted the fragility of factory work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be successful , you should get a four-year college degree . So , in this interpretation , its not so much laziness on the part of working-class young adults that is the culprit , as it is noting the signs of the times and doing what society tells them they should do . In this view , avoiding factory work is simply being smart . <p> In the view of some , avoiding factory work is simply being smart . <p> For instance , Ricky told me that hed be fine with a factory job , " even though they 're bad about laying off people . " <p> Carly was one of those people . For about eight years , she and her cohabiting boyfriend had great jobs at a factory , and they bought a house in the process . But six months after the birth of their child , Carly was laid off , and the life they were building together crumbled . Her boyfriend also got laid off eventually , and she filed for bankruptcy . Her next fiancT also worked at a factory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her fiancT would lose his position . But he was able to keep the jobas she said , they " dodged a bullet . " We heard other stories like this . In that light , can you really blame people for judging that factory work is just too unstable ? <p> Then there is the message that young people hear from their elders . Mark told me about an older friend of his , who " right out of high school , he was offered a job at AK Steel , Ford , somewhere else . I mean , he worked at Ford at thirty years , retired . No degree , no nothing . " <p> When I asked if the same thing would have been available to Mark straight out of high school ( he graduated in the early 2000s ) , here is what he said : <p> No .... I remember going to high school and they have the career center . And theyll be like , " All the people at the career center are idiots . You 're dumb if you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the career center . They got a high school diploma and a certification at the same time . " Yeah , that 's really dumb of them , now was n't it ? <p> In retrospect , Mark wishes that he had gone to the career center for anything from welding to automotive . That way , hed have been on track to do the kind of skilled work that ( at least in his mind ) hed have a better shot at getting than the opportunities currently available to him . Instead , Mark did what he heard society telling him to do : go to a four-year college . But after he could no longer afford it and his grades were suffering , he dropped outand a decade later , he was stuck with a minor criminal record and struggling to find decent work . <p> In other words , well-paying jobsincluding manufacturing jobsmay have been available to Mark , but because he spent a decade trying to do what he thought was the right thing to do ( get back to college ) , he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize those opportunities . <p> Finally , another way to understand some working-class young peoples avoidance of factory work would be to examine both character and structures , as Mark did during the course of his interview . He mentioned all " that 's been raked away from the middle class for the last twenty years , " and how " the white mans already strugglin more than anybody to find work " ( not an accurate claim , judging by statistics on unemployment ) . He sounded the note of a person who is part of a marginalized class . Most people did n't  put it that strongly , but many did seem to feel like victims of a struggling economy . But when I asked Mark to identify the biggest thing that kept him from feeling like an adult , he paused for a while , and said , " Life choices , just living above my means . Spending more than you make , managing money : they 're two of my biggest issues right there . " <p> Moreover , when I asked him why he thought so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults , he said , " Just everybody is so lax with the video game age and everything . Couch potatoes.It has to do a lot about society . Now , peoples morals are n't  the way they used to be at all . So , you know , everybodys morally lackadaisical almost careless . " In Marks mind , then , young peoples failure to find steady work was partly their own fault and partly the fault of a poor economy . <p> Of course , complaints about factory worksome of which I quoted in my last postare hardly new . You see them in research with older generations of working-class people , as well . When Lillian Rubin asked working-class men in the 1970s how they felt about their work , she found that in their early work life they tended to move from job to job , searching for " some kind of work in which they can find meaning , purpose , and dignity . " As one man said about his work in a factory , " God , I hated that assembly line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running you , you 're not running it . " <p> Alex , a twenty-something factory worker I interviewed , told me that he got into factory work despite his grandfathers admonitions to avoid it . His grandfather was not lazy : he got up at 4:00 every morning and worked in a factory for about thirty years . And he urged his grandson to find a different career . <p> Alex also told me the story of a 62-year-old coworker of his who had worked at the factory for more than twenty-five years , and only had to work six months longer until he could receive Social Security benefits . But he jeopardized all that by suddenly quitting one day . As Alex recounted , the man turned off his machines at the 9:30 break and turned in his paperwork to his supervisor with the announcement , " I quit . " He had had a heart attack recently , he explained , which got him thinking about the kind of life he wanted to live . " Ive been thinking and reading the Bible more and thinking about deathand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . When the supervisorwhom Alex described as " hard-ass " " started getting shitty , " the old man let everything rip . He took off his gloves , threw them on the ground , and " started flippin out on him , " yelling his goodbye to the manager , " I 'm tired of you treatin us like crap ! " <p> That weary , aging mans complaint says a lot , I think . The working-class person who says that he does n't  want to work in factories because the work is uninspiring and the stability uncertain is not just being lazy or cautious , he is listening to the experience of older men like Alexs coworker . He is taking seriously the voices of alienationthe advice of people who feel like factory work asks them to become a drone . Who experience the work as offensive to their dignity ( " Its not fulfilling to me " ) . Who do not see their work as meaningful , or an important way of helping others ( " Doing the same thing , repetitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who suspect that the factory could replace them with a faster machine or someone else ( " they 're bad about laying off people " ) . <p> You could say those are excuses for laziness . However , I 'd want to work in a factory myself for a few months before leveling that broad charge . I 'd also want to examine the character implications of the " short termism " in corporate behavior that Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck describe in a new paper . They note that , if you exclude the recession years of 2001 and 2008 , stock buybacks and dividends at 454 large companies " have averaged 85 percent of net earnings for all corporations since 1998 . " " The problem , " they point out , " is that these kinds of heavy rewards to investors leave only 14 percent for internal investment and compensation increases for workers .

Let 's talk about character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than singling out the working class . <p> Let 's talk about character and workbut not only among the working class . <p> A final point : its not just alienation from work that many working-class young people experience , but from social life in general . The person who quits factory work after a few days is many times the same person who is angry at his father or mother for leaving the family , or stinging from the betrayal of a boyfriend or girlfriend or spouse , or frustrated by the feeling that his supervisor is " using " him . " Social life goes on as though beyond themnot so much in opposition to them but rather at their expense , " as the future John Paul II put it in the essay " The Person : Subject and Community , " which includes a profound meditation on alienation as the antithesis of participation . Its harder to trust that your supervisor or company has your best interests at heart when you have reason to distrust the people closest to you in life . Its harder to thrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , young people experience their frustration and alienation as a moral drama , with the conviction that things could be different at work if they just applied themselves with a little more stick-to-itiveness . I 'd add ( as Larry Mead has pointed out ) that once a person participates in work , he also has the right to say something about how to improve the workplace , as well as the economic structures that his workplace is situated within . And whenever the working class does have something to say about work , we should listen with reverence . Their participation can combat the new alienation.

According to one report , the campaign included a poster " picturing a woman holding an hourglass in one handthe other one on her stomachnext to the words : Beauty has no age limit . Fertility does. " <p> Countries like Russia have created financial incentives for women to have babies . And certainly , the generous family leave policies and affordable childcare available in countries like Denmark and France should relieve parents of any potential economic stress that might come from having more children . But those things are apparently not enough . <p> These policies remind me a little of the " What 's the matter with Kansas ? " argument . Policymakers and pundits look at people and wonder why it is that they do n't  act in their economic interests ? But just like the folks in Kansas , the people in Sweden are not simply rational economic actors . They are peoplepeople who have time to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from work to spend with their children , and who know someone will mind these children when they do return to their jobs . <p> The real problem is a literal existential crisis . In a world where we can achieve total material comfort and satisfactionthe Danes are obsessed with getting cozy , of all thingsbut are lacking in a more spiritual or religious purpose , the question is why should we have more children ? And that is something for which no government bureaucrat has the answer .

@@89588613 @5088613/ <p> I got angry with my husband one recent morning when he was n't home when I returned from taking our school-aged daughters to the bus . Our preschooler likes to come with me on these bus drops , but my husband is the one who does our little girls hair and gets her off to preschool afterwards . His unexpected absence actually did n't  inconvenience me much : I needed to go swimming before work as part of rehabilitating a hamstring injury , and I had planned on dropping our daughter off for him on my way to the pool . But it nonetheless triggered my anger because if I 'm going to absent from a responsibility , I typically ask for help . When my husband did n't  ask for my help , I felt like he was treating his contributions as optional , as if I was the default childcare provider . <p> Leave aside how we got past that because my point is not about conflict resolution , but rather that couples with children are negotiating their relationships on different terrain today than they were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers responsibility , a husband could run an errand before work without askingand without leaving a mother feeling presumed upon . The current issue of European Sociological Review has a study about children and parents union stability that speaks to big issues like living out gender role ideals , plus the similarities between marriage and cohabitation . Let 's talk about children and gender roles first . <p> Children present a challenge to egalitarianism . It is easier to fairly divide paid work by assigning equal hours to each partner than it is to figure out just what constitutes a fair division of childcare . Living out a fair bargain is also complicated because we do n't  have scripts to guide us in how it is to be done right . The authors of this new study , Rannveig Kaldager Hart , Torkild Hovde Lyngstad and Elina Vinberg , contend that their evidence indicates that even in Norwaya country that scores very favorably on international indicators of gender equality like the United Nations Gender Inequality Indexpatterns over time are indicative of an incomplete gender revolution . <p> Their study checked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child together affected Norwegian couples chances of staying together . Couples with children have always been more stable than childless couples for a number of reasons , including both partners having more to lose by splitting up if there are children , a greater likelihood of childbearing in stronger relationships , and " stark ( and likely internalized ) norms against dissolving a two-parent family . " Nonetheless , the authors argued that the stability premium associated with shared children could wane with the progress of the gender revolution because children can increase the mismatch between ideals and lived experience , therefore destabilizing relationships . In other words , in a country like Norway , children present a greater challenge to egalitarian norms than in countries where gender roles are less equal even without children . <p> But what happens when the gender revolution progresses still further , and men move into the domestic sphere to the same extent that women have moved into paid work ? Frances Goldscheider and her colleagues have theorized about two halves to the gender revolution in these terms , with the first half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on families , but the second half being an increase in mens involvement at home that relieves stress on families ( particularly those with children ) . Hart et al . argue that if the second half of the gender revolution were stabilizing Norwegian families , we should see the stability premium associated with having a child increase over time . Instead , the stability gap that favors couples with children over childless couples was largely unchanged across four decades . <p> I 'm unimpressed with their interpretation . First , even though I 'm clearly sympathetic to the idea that children can heighten tensions around gender role expectations , I do n't  think anyone is arguing that Norway should be past all that by now . Those who believe that the genders are essentially different do n't  expect us to ever get past it , and those who believe that gender differences arise from socialization do n't  expect us to jettison past ( socialized ) expectations overnight . Second , Hart and her colleagues give us a number of reasons to think that the stability premium associated with having a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to financially support children alone now than in the past . In other words , even if mens participation at home were strengthening families with children , we might not see the stability gap between parents and childless couples grow because other social forces might offset that change . <p> Yet Hart et al. , conclude that their results " do not underpinoptimism " about mens participation strengthening families with children . Fair enough : The unchanging stability premium associated with children does not support the idea that mens participation is strengthening families with childrenbut neither does it provide any evidence against that claim . <p> My critique of their claim about a growing similarity between cohabitation and marriage has much the same flavor : It is possible , but not supported , given their evidence . First , they document what they call " a persistent super risk for co-habitants . " I like this term , " super risk . " They introduce it to differentiate between the stability advantage children have if their biological parents are married rather than cohabiting , and change over time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means that the super risk associated with having cohabiting parents can obtain in all time periods , even while shared children begins to strengthen cohabiting unions . From 1970-85 , cohabiting couples with children were no more stable than those without children , and in the later time periods having a young child significantly increased the stability of cohabiting unions . <p> But I have trouble interpreting the emergence of a stability premium associated with children within cohabitation as supporting statements in their conclusions like " Childbearing in cohabitation seems to have lost much of its strength as a signal of social and demographic difference . " The " persistent super risk for co-habitants " is evidence against this : over all time periods , cohabiters were three times as likely to split as those who married without first cohabiting . <p> Moreover , Hart et al. , do not provide any evidence that the advantage to marriage for children has declined over time . Their discussion also indicates that they think children stabilize cohabitations now when they did not do so in the 1970s because cohabitating childbearing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people . In fairness to the authors , the conclusion I am quibbling with could be properly interpreted as cohabiters simply becoming less select over time , but I am concerned it might be interpreted as marriage and cohabitation becoming indistinguishable over time , even though the research provides no evidence of that . <p> Laurie F.

But is it affecting more affluent Americans just as much as its affecting the poor and working class ? <p> Many accounts and studies Ive looked at , including Sam Quinones excellent book on the epidemics origins , suggest that the scale of the heroin crisis is the same across all social classes , without actually exploring educational attainment or income . The assumption seems to be that because most people abusing heroin today are white and do n't  live in the inner city , they must be reasonably well off . As Quinones said , puzzling over why the heroin crisis has hit white America so hard , whites are a group " that life has generally treated pretty well , particularly in the last twenty years . " <p> But according to the Centers for Disease Control , people with the following characteristics are most likely to use heroin : white race , male sex , young age ( 18 to 25 years ) , urban residence , income below $20,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making less than $20,000 , 5.5. per 1,000 Americans use heroin . Among people making $50,000 or more , the rate is 1.6 per 1,000 people . ( Both figures have risen about 60 percent over roughly the last ten years . ) For people making between $20,000 and $49,999 , the rate is 2.3 per 1,000 people , a 77 percent increase in roughly the last decade . <p> Moreover , since 20022004 , there has been a 114 percent increase in the rate at which whites use heroin , while rates have actually gone down for people from other races and ethnicities . A 2014 study published in the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry found that almost 90 percent of people who used heroin for the first time in the last decade were white . Among recent users , 75 percent say they were introduced to heroin through prescription drugs like OxyContin . In other words , its mainly whites , not blacks or Latinos , who are flocking to heroin . <p> And it would make sense for the heroin crisis to be the most severe among poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as Quinones himself observes in his books portraits of Appalachian cities and small towns , working-class whites as a group have had a rough few decades . They have been at the forefront of negative U.S. trends from family fragmentation to deindustrialization . Moreover , as a Brookings report shows , more poor people now live in the suburbs than in big cities or rural towns . Just because heroin has moved into white suburbs does n't  mean that its affecting middle-class and affluent Americans just as much as poor and working-class ones . <p> In the white , working-class neighborhood where I live , moms worry about letting their kids go to the playground because discarded heroin syringes have been found there . Last year , a team of neighbors sweeping the town for discarded syringes found one on the street in front of our house .

( Then again , that 's just anecdotal , and perhaps more affluent families are just more private about heroin addiction when it affects them . ) <p> They live in a war zone where they 're losing their people all the time to heroin. <p> Another indication about the severity of the heroin crisis among poor and working-class whites is the recent research finding that mortality rates are rising among middle-aged whites with a high school education or less , even as they continue to fall for better-educated whites , as well as for blacks and Hispanics from all educational backgrounds . Economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton concluded that the change in death rates among less-educated whites was " largely accounted for by an increasing death rate from external causes , mostly increases in drug and alcohol poisonings and in suicide . " ( Drug- and alcohol-related deaths also rose among college-educated Americans , but less-educated people saw the most marked increases . ) Im left with two perplexing questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly whites who have succumbed to heroin ? Quinones says that after spending three years doing research for his book , this is the question that still stumps him . He wonders if the heroin outbreak that devastated Latino and black neighborhoods in the 1970s left a collective scar that makes todays Latinos and blacks averse to heroin . But he suspects there is more to the story . <p> Second , why do many people who legally take prescription pain medications like OxyContin never develop an addiction , while others do ? Its a question that journalist Johann Hari pursues in his book Chasing the Scream ( which I wrote about here ) . He interviews psychologist Gabor MatT , who , based on his long work with drug addicts in Vancouver , thinks that trauma or childhood loss is the " universal template " for addiction . <p> But even if its plausible that trauma is something that many addicts have in common , it seems forced to think that all addiction is a result of trauma . What about the well-off kid from a loving family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a football injury and dies of a drug overdose ? Must we always unearth some hidden trauma to fit the theory ? <p> Finally , and to MatTs point , I ca n't help but wonder if the heroin crisis might have been less catastrophic had another revolution not zeroed in on the working class : the family revolution , marked by rises in divorce and single-parent families . In making sense of how heroin and opioids have devastated Rust Belt cities like Portsmouth , Ohio , Quinones points to the economic misery that followed deindustrialization . I suspect that on top of the economic dislocation , the traumatic effects of family fragmentation and childhood loss have made the white working class especially vulnerable to heroin . A working-class friend who suffered through his parents divorce and childhood abuse did n't  abuse heroin , but he describes his struggle with meth addiction this way : " By the time I got to high school , I was just looking for an escape from everything that had happened . Next thing you know I 'm in a basement smoking a whole bowl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some people who get hooked on heroin . <p> Whatever the roots of the crisis , one cant but help think of the thousands of children caught in the storm , like that seven-month-old child in his hospital room . As the physician and anti-heroin crusader Jeremy Engel told the Cincinnati Enquirer , " Heroin has created a situation where individuals whose family members are on heroin have constant exposure to trauma , drama , and layered grief . Its a recipe for post-traumatic stress disorder . " <p> Engel was responding to the news that a 12-year-old girl had found her mother dead in their bathroom , a needle in her hand , just three days before Christmas . He added , " They live in a war zone where they 're losing their people all the time to heroin . " <p> The presidential candidates may not realize that opiate addiction has n't  affected all of America equally , but I 'm glad some of them are talking about this .

@@89588651 @5088651/ <p> As I noted in this space yesterday , improving the health of American kids will ultimately require tackling deeply rooted social problems . But as much as the broader social environment affects each child 's health , the child 's family matters quite a bit , too . Do her parents take her to the doctor , feed her a healthy diet , and encourage her to exercise ? Do his parents meet his psychological need for affection ? Is she disciplined with a spanking or a time-out ? <p> Lawrence Berger and Sarah Font explain in a Future of Children article that the answers to these questions are linked not only to parents ' income levels but also to family structure and stability . Their explanation of how these factors relate to disparities in child health is worth quoting at length : <p> Children who experience family complexity and fluidity tend to exhibit poorer average health and to have less access to regular health care . In part , this reflects differences in parents financial and behavioral resources ; family complexity and fluidity are particularly common among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower levels of psychological distress , warmer and less harsh parenting , and higher-quality caregiving environments . <p> At the same time , the association between family complexity and fluidity and childrens health may also reflect differences in how parents invest their financial and behavioral resources in their children . Married two-biological-parent families , for instance , not only tend to be better off , they also tend to make greater average investments in children regardless of available resources . The reason may be that biological parents have greater incentives to invest in their children , that the institution of marriage encourages better parenting , and/or that individuals who choose particular family types differ in other ways as well . <p> Higher-income and married biological parents also make higher-quality behavioral investments . On average , children in lower-income and complex families ( loosely defined to include families other than those consisting solely of a married couple and their joint biological children ) have poorer sleep routines , housing , nutritional intake , child care , home environments , schools , and neighborhoods than do children in higher-income and noncomplex families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are exposed to more stress , conflict , and environmental toxins both in and outside their homes . Each of these factors can adversely affect their health . <p> Likewise , compared with children in stably married , two-biological-parent families , children in other ( heterosexual ) family settings experience , on average , lower levels of parental support , supervision , and monitoring , as well as less consistent discipline . They also face greater levels of stress and parental conflict , and their parents have poorer psychological wellbeing . Each of these factors is associated with lower levels of parental support , engagement , and warmth , and limited parental attention to childrens health and emotional needs . These factors may be compounded when families experience fluidity and instability . <p> Long story short , kids are healthier according to a number of measures when their parents are married . But Berger and Font deem relationship education programs , which aim to increase the proportion of kids being raised by married or at least stably cohabiting parents , " unlikely to play a substantial role in improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about helping parents care for and supervise their kids more effectively , whatever their family structure . They examine two avenues through which public policy can do this : boosting families ' financial resources and teaching parents how to parent more effectively . Programs in the former category , particularly the earned income tax credit ( a refundable tax credit for low-income workers that keeps millions of families out of poverty ) , have been associated with better children 's health outcomes , such as increased birth weight . Relieving financial strain might also make families more stable , which would have its own positive effects on children . <p> Programs in the latter category , teaching parents how to parent , have yielded mixed results . Perhaps most promising is the Nurse Family Partnership , in which registered nurses visit low-income first-time moms on a regular basis to help them achieve healthy pregnancies and become effective mothers . The program " improves maternal parenting behaviors , reduces child maltreatment and child injuries , and improves childrens social-emotional functioning , " evaluations show . Not all home visiting programs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communitiessuch as public awareness campaigns and universal ( one-time ) nurse home visitingare harder to evaluate and more expensive to implement , but a few have been associated with better parenting and lower rates of child maltreatment . Parent training programs outside homes seem to have only small and temporary effects , in general , according to a recent meta-analysis . <p> As I emphasized yesterday , there 's no easy way to ensure kids become and remain healthy . But if policy-makers on the right want to help parents do right by their children , and those on the left want to relieve poverty and close social gaps , then family-supporting programs shown to promote child health might attract wide support .

On the Republican side is a front-runner who matter-of-factly admits to an extramarital affair . On the Democratic side is a front-runner whose husband has been accused of multiple sexual improprieties ( and who has n't  always matter-of-factly admitted to them ) . <p> Sexual misconduct is also often discussed in the context of religion , perhaps to give journalists something to write between elections . So why not put all three topics forbidden in polite companysex , politics , and religioninto one blog post ? <p> Ill focus on extramarital sex using a question from the General Social Survey ( GSS ) : " Have you ever had sex with someone other than your husband or wife while you were married ? " Obviously , this is only one type of sexual misconduct , and it does not apply to people who have never been married . Still , its misconduct that most Americans disapprove of . <p> The GSS first asked this question in 1991 , and its been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) since then . Pooling the data from 1991 to 2014 , 13.2% of the GSS respondents who had ever been married reported having had extramarital sex . There 's a strong gender effect here , with 16.5% of men acknowledging it but only 10.7% of women . There is also an age effect , with older people reporting extramarital sex more often ; this is to be expected because they have had more years to have ever strayed . <p> In analyzing the association between extramarital sex and politics and religion , I 'll limit my analyses to men between ages 18 and 65 interviewed in the GSS . Let 's start with politics . As shown in the first figure , there is some variation in extramarital sex by political identification . Who is most likely to have cheated in marriage ? Strong Democrats . A full 18.8% of them have stepped out of their marriage at some point compared to only 15.4% of the strong Republicans . <p> Analyzing the religion-cheating link is more complicated , since religion has multiple dimensions . Perhaps the most straightforward one is religious affiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a particular religion ? A commonly used framework for analyzing American religions is the RELTRAD classification , which categorizes seven distinct religious traditions in the U.S. As shown in the figure below , rates of extramarital sex vary across these traditions . At the low end are Jews ( 13.2% ) and Catholics ( 13.6% ) . At the high end are black Protestants ( 21.9% ) . In between are evangelicals , mainline Protestants , members of other faiths , and the religious " nones " ( those with no religion ) . <p> Based on just affiliation , religion does not make much difference in mens odds of having extramarital sex . But , as is often the case , this changes when we move to other measures of religion . When it comes to attending religious services , a little religious involvement goes a long way . Close to 18% of men who rarely if ever attend church services have engaged in extramarital sex . Men who attend services weekly ( 14.3% ) , monthly ( 15.7% ) , or even just yearly ( 14.3% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look at extramarital sex and various religious beliefs . Men who do not believe in God have the highest rates of extramarital sex ( 17.6% ) , but those who are certain that God exists have the next highest ( 16.3% ) . At the low end are those who think it is not knowable whether God exists ( 12.5% ) , and the remaining categories of belief are at about 14% and 15% . <p> When it comes to religious ideology , liberals and moderates have modestly lower rates ( 14.9% and 15% ) than religious fundamentalists . <p> However , men who view the Bible as just a book of fables have higher rate of extramarital sex ( 16.1% ) compared to those who view it as the inspired word ( 15.7% ) or the word of God ( 14.3% ) . <p> When I set out to write this blog post , I was going to look at politics and religion separately and leave it at that . But as I started analyzing the data , I wondered if there is an interaction between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex vary by political affiliation ? To test for this interaction , I plotted the relationship between religious service attendance and extramarital sex separately for men who identify themselves as strong Democrats versus those who are strong Republicans . As you can see in the next figure , there is something going on here . Among strong Democrats , there is little relationship between attending religious services and extramarital sex . Non-attenders have high rates ( 19.3% ) as do frequent attenders ( 19.7% ) . Among Republicans , however , service attendance means much lower rates of extramarital sex . Who is most likely to have extramarital sex ? Republicans who do n't  go to church ( 22.3% ) . Who is least likely ? Republicans who go to church often ( 13.2% ) <p> How do we interpret this relationship between religion , politics , and extramarital sex ? To take a more in-depth look at the interaction between religion and politics , I estimated a logistic regression equation that had politics , religion , and the interaction between them predicting extramarital sex . The interaction term is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , when I controlled for age , education , gender , and region . However , when I controlled for race , the magnitude of the interaction term dropped by about half and became statistically insignificant . <p> In laymens terms , the relationship between religious service attendance and extramarital sex does vary by politics , as shown above , and the explanation appears to have something to do with the different racial composition of the two political parties . Among the strong Democrats that I 've been analyzing ( i.e. , men between 18 and 65 ) , a full 32% are black . Among strong Republicans , just 2% are . Why does controlling for race nullify the interaction between political affiliation and religious attendance ? I do n't  know . It could be due to several things . Maybe religion affects sexual behavior differently across race . Or maybe politics affects sexual behavior differently across race . Or maybe the meaning of race itself varies by political affiliation . Or by religious affiliation . Maybe something else . Were inching our way to a possible three-way interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to tease apart in a full journal article , let alone a humble blog post . <p> Now a couple of caveats . The analyses above are simply descriptive . Stronger statements about possible causality would require more sophisticated multivariate models . Also , its possible that people reply differently , more or less honestly , to questions about extramarital sex as a function of their politics and/or religion . Maybe Christians are less likely to admit to doing it , or , conversely , maybe Christians are more likely to " confess " their wrongdoings to a survey-taker . Finally , I 've assumed that religion influences sexual behavior , but the reverse could equally be true . Maybe someone engaged in extramarital sex would be less motivated to be involved in religion . <p> These qualifications notwithstanding , the analyses here give us a better sense of the social patterning of extramarital sex . These patterns roughly fit the political actors described at the start of this post .

The resulting economic turmoil put a strain on many marriages.1 That the recession took a toll on relationships is not surprising ; multiple social science studies have demonstrated a link between financial stress and marital difficulties.2 Whether or not the recent stock market upheaval signals the beginning of a wider economic crisis , most married couples will face some type of financial strain at some point in their marriage . Consequently , identifying how couples can prepare to face financial challenges while retaining a high-quality marriage is important . <p> For this reason , Mark Jackson and I recently examined3 whether financial preparation , pro-marriage attitudes , and positive marital behaviors would help spouses maintain their marital quality amid financial strain .

We asked them how much they worried about meeting their financial needs every month , and to assess their financial preparation , we also asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credit card debt ) . We measured pro-marriage attitudes by asking participants about the commitment they felt toward their spouse and marriage . Participants reports of how often they showed respect , affection , and forgiveness toward their spouse , as well as how often they engaged in small acts of kindness toward their spouse , formed our measure of positive marital behaviors . Finally , we asked couples how happy they were in different dimensions of their marriage , and how likely they felt that their marriage was to end in divorce . <p> Having a rainy day fund in place and having lower levels of consumer debt helped somewhatcouples with more savings and less debt were less likely to experience financial stress , for examplebut they did n't  protect the marriages of those who reported financial strain .

Husbands with high commitment to their marriage reported low levels of divorce likelihood regardless of their level of financial stress , as Figure 1 illustrates . Even at the highest levels of financial stress , highly committed husbands reported the same level of divorce likelihood as highly committed husbands with low economic stress . <p> Positive relationship behaviors also strengthened marriages during financial strain . Among wives indicating financial strain , those whose husbands engaged in positive relationship behavior reported being happier in their marriage and reported a lower likelihood of divorce than those whose husbands were not as attentive ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) . Interestingly , neither wives commitment nor their positive relationship behavior was particularly helpful amid financial stress . Although wives commitment and positive relationship behavior were related to reports of higher marital happiness and lower divorce likelihood , this effect was the same for all couples , not just those who faced financial strain . <p> Why might the commitment and positive relationship behaviors of only husbands , rather than wives , be especially protective during financial strain ? It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviors than women.4 In other words , because it is not as normative for men to exhibit these traits , when men do exhibit them , their wives take notice and feel more satisfied with their marriage . These behaviors and responses may then play a protective role during financial stress . This is only speculation , however . This finding needs additional research before we can definitively know the reason for the gender differences . <p> In summary , although sound financial management might help couples perceive less financial strain , if couples are actively in the middle of financial difficulties it is preparation in the realm of marriage that matters most for their relationship . The actions of both spouses affect a couples marital quality , but when finances are poor , husbands commitment and positive relationship behaviors seem particularly important to weathering the storm . <p> Jeffrey Dew is an Associate Professor at Utah State University .

@@89588662 @5088662/ <p> Editors note : Earlier this month , the New York Times David Leonhardt published a brief letter arguing that increasing economic inequality is both a cause and an effect of changing family structures . He suggested that this is one area where conservatives , who emphasize the causal impact of family structure on economic factors , have a greater claim to the evidence than liberals . We asked a few scholars to weigh in on the significance of his piece . Their responses are below . <p> The Marriage-Income Relationship Goes Both Ways Shoshana Grossbard <p> David Leonhardt recognizes that in addition to family structure depending on economic achievements and income inequality , it also drives economic outcomes . I agree . In my book The Marriage Motive ( published by Springer , 2015 ) I argue that marriage influences whether we work or stay home , how much we work , what we produce at home and what we buy , and how we deal with our finances . Were the marriage-income relationship simply a reflection of how income affects marriage , it would not follow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an indicator of marriage market conditions , the ratio of men to women in societythe sex ratioaffects what we buy , what we produce at home , how much we save , and our employment patterns . Where sex ratios are higher women work less in the labor force , men work more , and savings rates are higher , which in turn affects incomes and income inequality . <p> Furthermore , laws that influence family structure also have an economic impact . For example , Victoria Vernon and I have shown that in states with common-law marriage laws , where cohabitation is more likely to be considered as marriage , women are less likely to be in the labor force . Geddes et al . ( 2012 ) have shown that when women gained the right to keep their own earnings in the U.S. , the terms of marriage changed and women acquired more education . Laws regarding marriage and cohabitation thus have real effects on the economy . <p> Education , employment , savings , consumption : all economic decisions that result in where people stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market conditions , such as sex ratios , and by laws aimed at regulating marriage and cohabitation . Variation in marriage prospects and successes is thus more than a side effect of the income distribution . <p> Shoshana Grossbard is Professor of Economics at San Diego State University and founding editor of the Review of Economics of the Household . <p> Home Economics June Carbone and Naomi Cahn <p> David Leonhardts decision to take " sides " on the debate over whether diverging family structures cause inequality or whether inequality causes diverging family structure conflates two things that should be kept separate : core values about marriage ( is it a Biblically mandated ideal or a matter of personal preference ? ) and the relationship between inequality and family change . <p> On the first question there will never be agreement . On the second , there is overwhelming consensus that growing economic inequality and the change in family structure are interrelated , and no doubt that the changing family makes inequality worse . Between 1982 and 2006-08 , family change has become a hallmark of class , not cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate parents ( white or black ) became more likely to be raised in a two-parent family , while family stability declined for everyone else . Societal support for families accordingly tends to remain marriage-centered , as elites call the shots on support for the terms of family life . Moreover , greater inequality increases both community and family instability , weakening schools and after-school programs and increasing crime in the neighborhoods in which single-parent families are most concentrated . The effects of these changes are interactive and cumulative . <p> The critical question is what to do about it , and here the causal issues matter . Many conservatives make the same move Leonhardt does . They see the class-based division in families and say if only single parents married , they would be more like the elite . Yet there is scant evidence that any of the marriage promotion efforts of the last two decades have succeededand one reason why they can not succeed is that they do not address the causal factors that connect inequality with family instability . Explaining that takes a book not a blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conservative solutions : jobs . <p> Progressives such as Paul Krugman and Ezra Klein often hammer the right for ignoring , downplaying , or distorting the science on topics like evolution or climate change when the evidence challenges conservatives beliefs . Not surprisingly , however , progressives are generally unable to see the cases where their own ideology blinds them to the facts .

He suggested that this is one area where conservatives , who emphasize the causal impact of family structure on economic factors , have a greater claim to the evidence than liberals . We asked a few scholars to weigh in on the significance of his piece . Their responses are below . <p> The Marriage-Income Relationship Goes Both Ways Shoshana Grossbard <p> David Leonhardt recognizes that in addition to family structure depending on economic achievements and income inequality , it also drives economic outcomes . I agree . In my book The Marriage Motive ( published by Springer , 2015 ) I argue that marriage influences whether we work or stay home , how much we work , what we produce at home and what we buy , and how we deal with our finances . Were the marriage-income relationship simply a reflection of how income affects marriage , it would not follow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an indicator of marriage market conditions , the ratio of men to women in societythe sex ratioaffects what we buy , what we produce at home , how much we save , and our employment patterns . Where sex ratios are higher women work less in the labor force , men work more , and savings rates are higher , which in turn affects incomes and income inequality . <p> Furthermore , laws that influence family structure also have an economic impact . For example , Victoria Vernon and I have shown that in states with common-law marriage laws , where cohabitation is more likely to be considered as marriage , women are less likely to be in the labor force . Geddes et al . ( 2012 ) have shown that when women gained the right to keep their own earnings in the U.S. , the terms of marriage changed and women acquired more education .

On the second , there is overwhelming consensus that growing economic inequality and the change in family structure are interrelated , and no doubt that the changing family makes inequality worse .

Societal support for families accordingly tends to remain marriage-centered , as elites call the shots on support for the terms of family life . Moreover , greater inequality increases both community and family instability , weakening schools and after-school programs and increasing crime in the neighborhoods in which single-parent families are most concentrated . The effects of these changes are interactive and cumulative . <p> The critical question is what to do about it , and here the causal issues matter . Many conservatives make the same move Leonhardt does . They see the class-based division in families and say if only single parents married , they would be more like the elite . Yet there is scant evidence that any of the marriage promotion efforts of the last two decades have succeededand one reason why they can not succeed is that they do not address the causal factors that connect inequality with family instability .

@@89588672 @5088672/ <p> During the Great Recession , millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure , and millions more lost their jobs . The resulting economic turmoil put a strain on many marriages.1 That the recession took a toll on relationships is not surprising ; multiple social science studies have demonstrated a link between financial stress and marital difficulties.2 Whether or not the recent stock market upheaval signals the beginning of a wider economic crisis , most married couples will face some type of financial strain at some point in their marriage . Consequently , identifying how couples can prepare to face financial challenges while retaining a high-quality marriage is important . <p> For this reason , Mark Jackson and I recently examined3 whether financial preparation , pro-marriage attitudes , and positive marital behaviors would help spouses maintain their marital quality amid financial strain . We used data from a national sample of married couples who were randomly selected to participate in the study . We asked them how much they worried about meeting their financial needs every month , and to assess their financial preparation , we also asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credit card debt ) . We measured pro-marriage attitudes by asking participants about the commitment they felt toward their spouse and marriage . Participants reports of how often they showed respect , affection , and forgiveness toward their spouse , as well as how often they engaged in small acts of kindness toward their spouse , formed our measure of positive marital behaviors . Finally , we asked couples how happy they were in different dimensions of their marriage , and how likely they felt that their marriage was to end in divorce . <p> Having a rainy day fund in place and having lower levels of consumer debt helped somewhatcouples with more savings and less debt were less likely to experience financial stress , for examplebut they did n't  protect the marriages of those who reported financial strain .

Husbands with high commitment to their marriage reported low levels of divorce likelihood regardless of their level of financial stress , as Figure 1 illustrates . Even at the highest levels of financial stress , highly committed husbands reported the same level of divorce likelihood as highly committed husbands with low economic stress . <p> Positive relationship behaviors also strengthened marriages during financial strain . Among wives indicating financial strain , those whose husbands engaged in positive relationship behavior reported being happier in their marriage and reported a lower likelihood of divorce than those whose husbands were not as attentive ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) . Interestingly , neither wives commitment nor their positive relationship behavior was particularly helpful amid financial stress . Although wives commitment and positive relationship behavior were related to reports of higher marital happiness and lower divorce likelihood , this effect was the same for all couples , not just those who faced financial strain . <p> Why might the commitment and positive relationship behaviors of only husbands , rather than wives , be especially protective during financial strain ? It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviors than women.4 In other words , because it is not as normative for men to exhibit these traits , when men do exhibit them , their wives take notice and feel more satisfied with their marriage . These behaviors and responses may then play a protective role during financial stress . This is only speculation , however . This finding needs additional research before we can definitively know the reason for the gender differences . <p> In summary , although sound financial management might help couples perceive less financial strain , if couples are actively in the middle of financial difficulties it is preparation in the realm of marriage that matters most for their relationship . The actions of both spouses affect a couples marital quality , but when finances are poor , husbands commitment and positive relationship behaviors seem particularly important to weathering the storm . <p> Jeffrey Dew is an Associate Professor at Utah State University . He studies the association between families resources and their relationship quality .

It is not house ruleswhich may be stricter than the surrounding culturethat drive children toward rebellion ; it is the attitude in which those rules are applied in the home . <p> ResearchGate conducted an interview with researcher Rochelle Hentges about her new study on harsh parenting that was published journal , Child Development .

Harsh parenting may make the parents look like the enemy , pushing children to view their peers as those who care about them . Once the parents are seen as the enemy in the eyes of the child , the child has no qualms disregarding parental authority and disobeying house and school rules .

But given that children from low-income families , for instance , are more likely to live apart from their father in the first place , it can be hard to tell to what extent an absent father causes the problems that father absence is associated with , and to what extent other factors related to both family structure and child outcomes ( like household income ) are to blame . <p> Researchers Sara McLanahan , Laura Tach , and Daniel Schneider published a paper last year on exactly this problem . They reviewed 47 studies that used a variety of methods designed to uncover the causal effects of father absence , such as lagged dependent variable models , natural experiments , and individual fixed effects models .

@@89588695 @5088695/ <p> Growing up in a family with a history of substance abuse , mental illness , or incarceration places kids at higher risk of childhood depression , anxiety , and conduct disorders . And for a disproportionate number of kids , these risks come on top of those associated with their family structure . That is , compared to children who live with their married birth parents , children living with divorced or never-married mothers , or with a birth parent and a stepparent , are more likely to come from families with histories of drug or alcohol problems , mental illness , or criminal conduct . The presence or absence of such histories of family pathology may help explain why some young people show longer-term i 'll effects of family disruption , whereas others do not . <p> In the 2011-2012 National Survey of Childrens Health , 21 percent of children cared for by a divorced or separated mother had lived with someoneusually a parent or siblingwho " had a problem with alcohol or drugs .

Twenty percent of stepchildren had lived with a household member with a substance abuse problem ; 13 percent lived with a parent , sibling , or guardian with a mental health condition ; and 13 percent had had a parent incarcerated .

The causal arrow probably goes both ways . Adults who abuse drugs or alcohol , become mentally i 'll , or engage in criminal behavior are more likely than other adults to have turbulent romantic relationships and to have their marriages break up or never get started . They are also more likely to have unplanned pregnancies and babies outside of marriage . Of course , a parent becoming depressed , drinking heavily , or using drugs may also be a reaction to the stress of domestic conflict and the strain of raising children as a single parent , often in trying financial circumstances . <p> Whether preexisting condition or response to relationship turmoil , the combination of parental psychopathology and family disruption increases the risk of emotional or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone .

Nearly all kids feel a mixture of anger , sadness , and anxiety when their parents argue and split up , and many show short-term behavioral disturbances as well . But after a period of time , provided their subsequent life circumstances are not too toxic , most are able to adjust and do reasonably well . Significant minorities , however , show longer-term impairments , such as high-school dropout or college non-completion , chronic joblessness , premature sexual involvement and parenthood , and juvenile delinquency or adult criminality .

When parents have a history of drug or alcohol abuse , mental illness , or violent or dishonest behavior , their children may be burdened not only by a less than ideal home environment , but also by a genetic legacy that may incline them toward emotional instability or learning challenges . Future studies that measure and control for genetic as well as family environment factors will help us to understand better how families shape the health and behavior of the young people who grow up in them .

Indeed , other research suggests that shared family religious activities and praying together are likewise associated with greater relationship satisfaction and greater levels of trust.6 Shared religious activities like praying together may help couples deal with stress , and allow them to focus on shared beliefs and hopes for the future , and deal constructively with problems in their relationship . Thus , for those who already consider themselves religious , both religious service attendance and joint prayer may be vital resources for strengthening marriage and trust , and for promoting happier , healthier , and fuller lives . <p> Tyler J.

@@89588723 @5088723/ <p> In my previous piece , I discussed the benefits of Canadas Child Tax Benefit , the brainchild of the Family Caucus in the early 1990s . Could a similar program work well in the United States ? Within the last year , groups across the political spectrumfrom the liberal Center for American Progress and the Childrens Defense Fund to conservative policymakers such as Republican Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubiohave put forward several proposals for child tax credit reform.1 Although all are noble efforts and promise to be pro-family , each has critical shortcomings that should worry those concerned with building strong families . Before extending support to any proposal , family advocates should examine whether it meets three requirements in regard to marriage , work , and family stability . <p> First , a reformed child tax credit ( CTC ) should be pro-marriage . One of the problems with the current tax/transfer system is that families are subject to marriage penalties under certain circumstances.2 This occurs when parents receive more benefits if they remain single ( or cohabiting , as is often the case ) than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in income-tested programs where the infusion of income from a new spouse can lead the family to receive fewer benefits . For example , after a certain threshold , the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program ( SNAP ) or " food stamps " withdraws benefits at a rate of 30 percent for each new dollar earned . Such losses are significant disincentives for marriage among low-income families . <p> Second , the reform should be pro-work . The same dimensions of income-tested programs that discourage marriage can also discourage work . Parents find that income and payroll taxes combine with the withdrawal of benefits to create steep marginal tax rates , up to 80 percent in some cases , on any new dollar earned from working additional hours . Both the marriage and work penalties can be minimized or eliminated by moving away from income-testing to broadly universal programs.3 <p> Lastly , CTC reform should contribute to family stability by consolidating the current array of benefits . Raising a family is hard enough today . Families should not have to navigate a maze of programs in order to maximize support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eligible for SNAP , the child tax credit , the earned income tax credit , the dependent exemption , and the child and dependent care tax crediteach with its own eligibility standards and benefit rates . This not only creates unnecessary complexity but , as new research shows , also can be downright detrimental to family life by putting additional pressures on parents.4 <p> For instance , consider a family experiencing job loss , and under immense economic and psychological pressures as a resultpressures linked to divorce and family instability.5 In addition to filing for unemployment or disability benefits to compensate for the loss of their paycheck and family tax benefits , parents must then take time away from their job search and family in order to apply to temporary food stamps for their children . The stigma is so great and the process so unpredictable that a large number of eligible families do not even bother to apply . As a result , many children are deprived of much-needed resources at a precarious time in their lives . Those who do receive benefits are tainted with the stigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetus for Canadas reforms was a series of studies showing that children who received stigmatized welfare benefits did worse on a number of educational and emotional dimensions relative to similarly poor children not receiving welfare.6 To avoid this , the ideal CTC reform would take children off food stamps altogether without leaving them to go hungry . <p> Families should not have to navigate a maze of programs in order to maximize support for their children . <p> Unfortunately , none of the CTC reform proposals floating around the U.S. does anything to consolidate our maze of programs . Proposals to make the current CTC fully refundable in the absence of consolidation will only make marriage and work penalties worse . Proposals to introduce a new nonrefundable CTC will increase complexity and the debt burden on future generations while doing little for low- to moderate-income families . These are the same issues that the Family Caucus faced in Canada more than two decades ago . Their solutionconsolidating a number of disparate tax/transfer programs into the refundable Child Tax Benefitis a model for pro-family policymakers in the U.S. today . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families along those lines . Policymakers could consolidate the child tax credit , dependent exemption , child and dependent care tax credit , head of household filing status , and childrens portion of SNAP into one refundable child tax credit ( RCTC ) worth $2,500 per child . Like the current CTC , it would phase out after family income reached $110,000 at a rate of 5 percent for those filing jointly . The below figures depict the main benefits available to a single parent of one child today and compare the value of the RCTC to the value of the programs I believe it should replace.7 The RCTC would have several advantages over the todays complicated tax/transfer system . <p> First , my proposal increases child benefits for almost all families , recognizing the importance of children and families in public policy . The Department of Agriculture estimates that it costs at least $9,130 per year to raise a child.8 Far from incentivizing childbearing , a $2,500 RCTC is only a small token of appreciation for the service performed by parents . Second , as a near universal benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the programs it would replace . Moreover , consolidation eliminates complexity so the benefits of marriage and work become more salient to parents . Third , it would enable families to make ends meet , even during unemployment spells , without applying for stigmatized welfare benefits . In effect , it takes children off food stamps . <p> Lastly , the RCTC would not necessarily balloon the deficit . Most of the cost of expanding the child tax credit and making it refundable would be offset by the elimination of other tax-transfer programs . Eliminating various loopholes in the tax code could certainly offset the remainder without raising income tax rates . The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost of marriage penalty relief provisions in the 2004 tax legislation to amount to $114 billion . Most of this relief went to couples earning more than $75,000.9 Given the crisis of marriage among poor and working-class families , surely Congress could find the money to extend relief to the majority of parents making less than this . <p> Though it would not cure all that ails American families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put the U.S. on the right track by eliminating many of the marriage and work penalties inherent in the current system while channeling more benefits to children in need . In sum , it is the fiscally responsible pro-family policy for which reform conservatives have been searching . <p> Josh McCabe is the Freedom Project Postdoctoral Fellow at Wellesley College , where his current research project looks at the politics and consequences of child-related tax credits in the United States , Canada , and United Kingdom . Follow him on Twitter @JoshuaTMcCabe . <p> 7 . Assumptions for comparison of RCTC to current system of child-related benefits <p> My calculations are only a first estimate , and I encourage additional estimates for different situations . Depending on income , family structure , and use of childcare , benefits can vary quite a bit . For example , low- and moderate-income married families are likely to see bigger gains from my proposed reform relative to the current system , while some high-income families claiming the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit ( CDCTC ) are likely to see losses under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low- to moderate-income single parent with one child not utilizing childcare eligible for the CDCTC . I chose these assumptions for several reasons including : <p> Single parents are typically seen as more vulnerable . <p> Single parents may be more concerned with the marriage and work penalties I discussed above . <p> Child benefits in the tax/transfer system are more important to the economic wellbeing of low- and moderate-income families . <p> It is not clear how many lower-income families actually utilize the CDCTC and nearly impossible for me to estimate its value without all sorts of additional assumptions . <p> As a regressive tax measure , most of the benefits of the CDCTC accrue to families making $100,000 . <p> Getting the numbers for each component <p> I simulated value of tax and transfer benefits at increments of $10,000 in annual income ranging from $0 to $100,000 . I include Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program , the current child tax credit , head of household filing status , and the dependent exemption because I am proposing to consolidate all of these into a single refundable child tax credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dependent Care Tax Credit in this consolidation , I have excluded it for the reasons discussed above . ) <p> SNAP : Benefits calculated using the North Dakota Department of Health SNAP Calculator found online at LONG ... I assumed a two-person household with only earned monthly income ( $0 , $833 , $1,666 ) and rental costs equal to 30 percent of income . <p> CTC : Benefit is equal to 15 percent of income over $3,000 up to $1,000 total . <p> Head of Household Filer : I calculated benefit based on difference between this filing status and filing as single in order to isolate amount related to having children . In 2015 , this amounts to $2,950 ( $9,250 minus $6,300 ) . Benefit is calculated after accounting for parent-portion of head of household filer status and standard deduction . <p> Dependent Exemption : It is worth $4,000 in 2015 . Benefit is calculated after accounting for head of household filer status and standard deduction . 
@@89588724 @5088724/ <p> The father of my friends five-year-old daughter proposed to her , and she said yes . They have n't set a wedding date , and she told me that she hopes he sets one before she changes her mind . <p> Even though I 've told you very little about this couple , I doubt you 'd rate the chance of success for their marriage very highly .

" There are far worse reasons to get married , but even those of us who have outgrown fairy tales would still hope for a little more : some indication of a spark between them , something about liking or loving ( ideally both ) , something about readiness for commitment . <p> New research on the marital prospects of single mothers published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news for my friend . The good news is that biological father marriages are more enduring than stepfather marriages . In other words , saying yes to her daughters father means that she is more likely to stay married than if she had said yes to someone else . The bad news is that even though she opted for the better bet , the odds are still stacked against her marriage lasting . <p> I stared at the numbers in Christina Gibson-Daviss article , and I did n't  like them . " Among marriages that involved a black mother and a biological father , " she found , " 20% had dissolved within five years , and 47% had dissolved within 10 years . " That gives five-year-old Kylie about a flip-of-the-coin chance of having still-married parents by her fifteenth birthday ( if her father does set a date before her mother changes her mind ) . I reminded myself that her mother is 41 years old and has a college degree . As any good demographer knows , both older age and higher educational attainment are associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article to adjust Kylies parents odds . Unfortunately , I found that maternal age and education are insignificant predictors of divorce risk for black women marrying after childbirth . So I did n't  get to adjust their odds . They stayed bad . <p> Very few personal characteristics affect the divorce risk of women who have had a child before marrying . <p> Then I noticed that very few personal characteristics affected the divorce risk of women of any race in the study . Their husbands characteristics did n't  matter , either . Even though factors like age and education have been shown to matter quite a bit for ten-year divorce rates overall , they did n't  make a difference among the women that Gibson-Davis studied : those who gave birth outside of marriage . <p> I keep thinking about what that means . It means that the normal advantages that my friend should enjoy get swamped by her single mother status . It means that her chances of a successful marriage are n't  statistically different from those of a kid who drops out of high school , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turns 18 . <p> All my demography training has taught me that aggregate statistics do not predict individual outcomesthat I should n't assume that I know whether Kylies parents will stay together based on Gibson-Daviss tables . But knowing Kylies mom gives me some insight into why the numbers in the table are so depressing . She has n't  married Kylies dad yet . I suspect that one major reason is that fidelity is not something that Kylies dad expects of himself . Couples who did not marry before their child was born have opted out for some reason . Some of those reasons can change over time , as when someone gets a job or both partners become mature enough to commit . But some of those reasons do n't  change over time ; some of the factors that cause people to forgo marriage are the same factors that cause people to divorce . I would love to see Kylie grow up in a home with both parents , but I would hate seeing my friend endure adultery to make that possible . <p> By showing that a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after giving birth , and that such a marriage is less likely to end in divorce than marriage to another man , Gibson-Davis has provided some limited , encouraging evidence to those championing marriage promotion programs . Nevertheless , she correctly stresses that much work remains for those seeking to encourage single mothers to marry because enduring unions are relatively rare , even among biological parents . I have one window showing me why that is true . There are many others . The bottom line is that post-birth marriages are likely to be more difficult and less stable than others , and strengthening them is indeed an uphill battle .

Our research on this topic at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health links religious service attendance to a number of better health outcomes , including longer life , lower incidence of depression , and less suicide . Our work also indicates that religious service attendance is associated with greater marital stabilityor more specifically , with a lower likelihood of divorce.1 <p> We are not the first to study the relationship between religious service attendance and the likelihood of divorce . In fact , a number of studies have found similar results : namely , that those who attend religious services are about 30 to 50 percent less likely to divorce than those who do not.2 <p> One of the critiques of this research is the possibility that those who may be contemplating divorce may be more likely to stop attending religious services .

Religious communities can provide important resources for a healthy marriage . <p> Finally , other research indicates that religious service attendance is associated with a number of other positive results ( see figure below ) . For example , our research at Harvard indicates that regular religious service attendance is associated with a lower risk of dying over a 16-year follow-up and also a lower incidence of depression.4 Additional research finds that religious service attendance is associated with greater levels of meaning in life and greater levels of happiness.5 These things are generally associated with greater marital satisfaction and a lower likelihood of divorce .

@@89588737 @5088737/ <p> On February 11 , W. Bradford Wilcox testified before the Subcommittee on Human Resources , part of the House Committee on Ways and Means , about how the retreat from marriage contributes to the challenges low-income families face in todays economy . This is the text of his testimony . <p> Chairman Boustany , Vice Chair Doggett , and other distinguished members of the Subcommittee on Human Resources , thank you for inviting me to participate in todays hearing , " Challenges Facing Low-Income Individuals and Families in Todays Economy . " This is a topic on which I have focused my scholarship in recent years and is a central focus of my recent research at the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for Family Studies . <p> I. Introduction <p> This hearing focuses on the challenges facing lower-income individuals and families in todays economy . As my testimony makes clear , I think economic factorssuch as declines in the wages of non-college educated menand social factorsfor example , high levels of residential segregation by income and raceinhibit economic mobility , contribute to poverty , fuel economic inequality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The research also indicates that the nations retreat from marriagemarked by increases in non-marital childbearing , single parenthood , and family instability over the last four decadesis also inhibiting economic mobility , making poverty more common , and driving up inequality . Moreover , the retreat from marriage is concentrated among lower-income families . This means we are now witnessing a growing marriage divide where well-educated and affluent Americans enjoy comparatively stable , high-quality marriages , whereas other Americans are much less likely to enjoy such marriages . Thus , one major challenge facing lower-income men , women , and their children is that they are less likely to benefit from the social and economic advantages associated with growing up within or being a member of a stable , married family . <p> There are three points I will make today about this retreat from marriage in the United States : <p> 1 . First , in recent years , the retreat from marriage is concentrated among Americans who do not have college degrees . This means fewer lower-income Americans are living in stable , married homes . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income inequality more extreme than they would otherwise be , and it limits economic opportunity . Men , women , and children from lower-income communities are most affected by the social and economic consequences of this retreat . <p> 3 . The retreat from marriage is rooted in economic , policy , and cultural changes . Thus , public and private efforts to renew marriage and family life should be broadly gauged , seeking to strengthen the economic , policy , and cultural foundations of family life for the twenty-first century . Such efforts should focus on the families most affected by the retreat from marriage , namely , lower-income families . <p> II . The Retreat from Marriage and the Growing Marriage Divide in America <p> In recent years , the United States has witnessed a dramatic retreat from marriage that has had a disparate impact on lower-income Americans , in particular , and , more generally , among Americans who do not hold a college degree . Because education is a good proxy for social class , I rely upon adult educational attainment to explore how the retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers . Among Americans without college degrees , the divorce rate is comparatively high , and non-marital childbearing , family instability , and single parenthood have been rising since the 1970s . By contrast , Americans with college degrees enjoy comparatively stable marriages and low rates of non-marital childbearing and single parenthood , and thus their children experience higher rates of family stability.1 <p> Take trends in adult marriage . Figure 1 indicates that stable marriage is now much less common among moderately educated men and women ( i.e. , those with a high school degree or some college ) and men and women with the least education ( i.e. , high-school dropouts ) than it is among those who are highly-educated ( i.e. , the college-educated ) . This means men , women , and children in lower-income communities are less likely to be living in stably married homes . <p> Figure 1 : Percentage in Intact First Marriage , 2560-year-olds , by Education and Decade <p> Or take trends in non-marital childbearing . In Figure 2 , we can see that bearing a child out of wedlock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school or some college ) and women with the least education ( i.e. , high-school dropouts ) than it is among those who are highly-educated ( i.e. , the college-educated ) . This means that lower-income women are much more likely to have children outside of marriage than middle- and upper-income women . <p> Trends in family instability for American teenagers also indicate that the retreat from marriage has had a disparate impact on the less educated . Figure 3 indicates that 14-year-old girls from less-educated homes are much less likely than those with college-educated parents to be living in a stable , two-parent home . This means that family instability is much more common today among lower-income families . <p> Figure 3 : Percentage of 14-year-old Girls Living with Mother and Father , by Mothers Education and Year <p> In sum , the United States is witnessing a retreat from marriage that reduces the odds that men , women , and children spend their lives in a stable , married home , a retreat that has hit less-educated and lower-income families with particular force . <p> III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from marriage has had a number of important consequences for children , adults , and families in the United States . When children are raised outside of an intact , married family , they are less likely to acquire the human capital they need to thrive in todays labor market ; they are less likely to avoid major detours in young adulthood , such as incarceration or a teen pregnancy ; and they are less likely to be working successfully as young adults . Specifically , Figure 4 shows that todays young adults are more likely to do well in school , and to avoid a teen pregnancy or incarceration , if they grow up in an intact , two-parent family . <p> The retreat from marriage also has increased the odds that families are poor , both because single parents can not pool income and assets with a second parent , and because unmarried fathers tend to work less and earn less than their married peers.2 A 2013 Census report found , for instance , that poverty rates are five times as high for children headed by a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are for children living in married-couple families ( 6 percent ) .3 Likewise , a recent American Enterprise Institute-Institute for Family Studies study finds that men work more hours and make more money if they are married rather than single ; this is true even among men with a high school degree or less . Such men also worked more hours and made at least $17,000 more per year if they were married , compared to their single peers with a similar background . This same study found that women now face no marriage penalty in their individual income.4 Taken together , these findings suggest marriage provides financial advantages to the average American family . <p> Of course , one reason that poverty is more common among single parents than it is among married-couple families is that men and women who experience the stresses and disadvantages of poverty are less likely to get and stay married . That is , lower-income Americans are more likely to select into unstable family situations . Nevertheless , given the fact that this retreat from marriage is concentrated among less-educated and lower-income Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : individuals with limited education and weak economic prospects have children outside marriage ; children raised outside two-parent families are less likely to complete college and flourish in the labor market ; and the cycle continues . The research of Raj Chetty of Harvard University and his collaborators indicates a strong association between rates of upward mobility for poor children in our nations communities and family structure , with poor children in communities headed by large numbers of single parents much less likely to climb the economic ladder than poor children living in communities with large numbers of two-parent families . So , for instance , poor children raised in the Salt Lake City metro areawith large numbers of two-parent families in their communityare much more likely to experience rags-to-riches mobility than children from the Atlanta metro areawith large numbers of single-parent families in their community . More research is needed to understand the association between mobility and two-parent families , but the association is striking , and needs to be acknowledged by scholars and policymakers alike.5 <p> More generally , the retreat from marriage is linked to important economy-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes , family income inequality , and declining male labor force participation in the country as a whole . Specifically , Lerman and Wilcox ( 2014 ) estimate that " the growth in median income of families with children would be 44 percent higher if the United States enjoyed 1980 levels of married parenthood today . Further , at least 32 percent of the growth in family-income inequality since 1979 among families with children and 37 percent of the decline in mens employment rates during that time can be linked to the decreasing number of Americans who form and maintain stable , married families . " To be clear : the retreat from marriage is not the only factor contributing to negative economic outcomes in the nation , but it is one important factor that must be addressed if the United States seeks to reduce poverty and economic inequality , and to increase the odds that every man , woman , and child has a shot at the American Dream . <p> IV . Why Marriage Is in Retreat <p> Progressive scholars have tended to argue the retreat from marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural changes in the economy , whereas conservative scholars have tended to point the finger at public policies and cultural trends they think have weakened marriage and the family . I think both sides are correct in this case . <p> For instance , sociologist William Julius Wilson has argued that the shift to a post-industrial economy has reduced the odds that less-educated men can find stable , good-paying jobs . This , in turn , reduces their ability to be breadwinners for their families , making them less " marriageable , " and reducing the odds that less-educated men ( and their partners ) get and stay married.6 Indeed , research suggests that economic **26;442;TOOLONG , the declining ratio of mens to womens income , etc.have played a role in the retreat from marriage , especially among the less educated.7 <p> But research focusing on economic factors can account for only a portion of the dramatic retreat from marriage.8 This means we must also look elsewhere to understand why marriage is in retreat , and why this retreat has been concentrated among lower-income families . When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline of a kind of marriage-centered familism , is certainly one factor accounting for the retreat from marriage in society as a whole.9 Furthermore , we now know that the decline of a marriage-centered life script , especially in connection with the bearing and rearing of children , has proved more common in poor and working-class communities than in college-educated communities.10 Means-tested transfer policies that both penalize marriage and make it less necessary for lower-income families undoubtedly have played some role in the retreat from marriage.11 As economists Adam Carasso and C. Eugene Steuerle point out , " most households with children who earn low or moderate incomes ( say , under $40,000 ) are significantly penalized for getting married . " 12 There is something , then , to conservative claims that welfare policies and cultural shifts may have undercut marriage , especially in lower-income communities . <p> To these standard accounts , I would add only one other major development . As political scientist Robert Putnam noted in Bowling Alone , Americans are now less civically engaged than they used to be , and declines in civic engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular and especially religious civic institutions have historically supplied moral direction and social support to marriage and family life in the United States . All this means that a growing number of Americans , especially those without a college degree , do not possess the economic resources , the cultural commitments , and the civic ties that have long sustained a strong and stable middle-class family ethic in the nation . <p> V. Policy Recommendations <p> In summary , the nations retreat from marriage , a retreat that has been concentrated among the less educated , is one reason why poverty remains unacceptably high , economic inequality is on the rise , and the American Dream continues to prove so elusive to millions of men , women , and children across the nation . The growing marriage divide associated with this retreat from marriage is fueled by a range of economic , policy , cultural , and civic changes that have ended up jointly reinforcing the increases in non-marital childbearing , family instability , and single parenthood that lower-income communities have witnessed in recent decades . The concern here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a separate-and-unequal family regime , where the highly educated and the affluent enjoy strong and stable households and everyone else is consigned to increasingly unstable , unhappy , and unworkable ones . " 14 <p> To renew the fabric of marriage and family life , and to bridge the marriage divide , three sets of policies should be considered:15 <p> 1 . First , public policy should " do no harm " when it comes to marriage . Accordingly , policymakers should eliminate or reduce marriage penalties embedded in many of the nations means-tested welfare policies designed to serve lower-income Americans and their families . One way to do this would be to use separate schedules for married couples and single individuals when it comes to determining eligibility for means-tested transfers . To reduce the cost of such a policy shift , the policy could be limited to the first five years of marriage , a period when couples are more likely to be bearing and rearing young children . <p> 2 . Second , public policy should strengthen the economic foundations of middle- and lower-income family life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $3,000 and extend it to both income and payroll taxes ; ( b ) expand the maximum earned income tax credit ( EITC ) for single , childless adults to $1,000 , with the intention of increasing their ties to the labor market and , hence , their marriageability ; and ( c ) expand and improve vocational education and apprenticeship programssuch as Career Academiesthat would strengthen the job prospects of less-educated young adults . The Career Academies model is particularly promising because the research indicates that young men who went through a Career Academy were more likely to flourish in the labor market and to get married than their peers from similar backgrounds.16 <p> 3 . Third , federal and state governmentsjoined by a range of public and private partners , from businesses to public schoolsshould support a public campaign around a " success sequence " that would encourage young adults to sequence schooling , work , marriage , and parenthood in that order.17 This campaignmodeled upon the success the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy has achieved on the issue of teen pregnancywould stress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born to married parents with a secure relational foundation . And , using the National Campaign as a model here , it would be better for this campaign to be directed and designed by a major nonprofit , rather than by the federal government . <p> I recognize that some of the policies that I have proposed todaysuch as the EITC expansion and the public campaign on behalf of a success sequenceare not yet proven . Given that , it might be wise to roll them out in a few states or municipalities , evaluate them , and see if they achieve their intended objectives . Indeed , a version of the EITC expansion is currently being tested right now in New York , NY . I also recognize that governments role when it comes to strengthening marriage and family life is necessarily limited . Any successful twenty-first-century effort to renew the fortunes of marriage in America will depend more on civic institutions , businesses , and ordinary Americans than upon federal and state efforts to strengthen family life . <p> But given the toll that the nations retreat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower-income families , the federal government should continue to experiment with a range of economic , educational , and cultural measures to strengthen family life and bridge the nations marriage divide . After all , the alternative to " seeking strategies like these is to accept a country where college-educated Americans enjoy stable and strong families ; everyone else is consigned to increasingly unstable and fragile families ; and high rates of economic inequality , male joblessness , and economic immobility are locked in by a marriage divide that puts working-class and poor Americans at a major family disadvantage . " 18 I think we can all agree that such an alternative is unacceptable and un-American. 
@@89588738 @5088738/ <p> In my previous piece , I discussed the benefits of Canadas Child Tax Benefit , the brainchild of the Family Caucus in the early 1990s . Could a similar program work well in the United States ? Within the last year , groups across the political spectrumfrom the liberal Center for American Progress and the Childrens Defense Fund to conservative policymakers such as Republican Senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubiohave put forward several proposals for child tax credit reform.1 Although all are noble efforts and promise to be pro-family , each has critical shortcomings that should worry those concerned with building strong families . Before extending support to any proposal , family advocates should examine whether it meets three requirements in regard to marriage , work , and family stability . <p> First , a reformed child tax credit ( CTC ) should be pro-marriage . One of the problems with the current tax/transfer system is that families are subject to marriage penalties under certain circumstances.2 This occurs when parents receive more benefits if they remain single ( or cohabiting , as is often the case ) than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in income-tested programs where the infusion of income from a new spouse can lead the family to receive fewer benefits . For example , after a certain threshold , the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program ( SNAP ) or " food stamps " withdraws benefits at a rate of 30 percent for each new dollar earned . Such losses are significant disincentives for marriage among low-income families . <p> Second , the reform should be pro-work . The same dimensions of income-tested programs that discourage marriage can also discourage work . Parents find that income and payroll taxes combine with the withdrawal of benefits to create steep marginal tax rates , up to 80 percent in some cases , on any new dollar earned from working additional hours . Both the marriage and work penalties can be minimized or eliminated by moving away from income-testing to broadly universal programs.3 <p> Lastly , CTC reform should contribute to family stability by consolidating the current array of benefits . Raising a family is hard enough today . Families should not have to navigate a maze of programs in order to maximize support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eligible for SNAP , the child tax credit , the earned income tax credit , the dependent exemption , and the child and dependent care tax crediteach with its own eligibility standards and benefit rates . This not only creates unnecessary complexity but , as new research shows , also can be downright detrimental to family life by putting additional pressures on parents.4 <p> For instance , consider a family experiencing job loss , and under immense economic and psychological pressures as a resultpressures linked to divorce and family instability.5 In addition to filing for unemployment or disability benefits to compensate for the loss of their paycheck and family tax benefits , parents must then take time away from their job search and family in order to apply to temporary food stamps for their children . The stigma is so great and the process so unpredictable that a large number of eligible families do not even bother to apply . As a result , many children are deprived of much-needed resources at a precarious time in their lives . Those who do receive benefits are tainted with the stigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetus for Canadas reforms was a series of studies showing that children who received stigmatized welfare benefits did worse on a number of educational and emotional dimensions relative to similarly poor children not receiving welfare.6 To avoid this , the ideal CTC reform would take children off food stamps altogether without leaving them to go hungry . <p> Families should not have to navigate a maze of programs in order to maximize support for their children . <p> Unfortunately , none of the CTC reform proposals floating around the U.S. does anything to consolidate our maze of programs . Proposals to make the current CTC fully refundable in the absence of consolidation will only make marriage and work penalties worse . Proposals to introduce a new nonrefundable CTC will increase complexity and the debt burden on future generations while doing little for low- to moderate-income families . These are the same issues that the Family Caucus faced in Canada more than two decades ago . Their solutionconsolidating a number of disparate tax/transfer programs into the refundable Child Tax Benefitis a model for pro-family policymakers in the U.S. today . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families along those lines . Policymakers could consolidate the child tax credit , dependent exemption , child and dependent care tax credit , head of household filing status , and childrens portion of SNAP into one refundable child tax credit ( RCTC ) worth $2,500 per child . Like the current CTC , it would phase out after family income reached $110,000 at a rate of 5 percent for those filing jointly . The below figures depict the main benefits available to a single parent of one child today and compare the value of the RCTC to the value of the programs I believe it should replace.7 The RCTC would have several advantages over the todays complicated tax/transfer system . <p> First , my proposal increases child benefits for almost all families , recognizing the importance of children and families in public policy . The Department of Agriculture estimates that it costs at least $9,130 per year to raise a child.8 Far from incentivizing childbearing , a $2,500 RCTC is only a small token of appreciation for the service performed by parents . Second , as a near universal benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the programs it would replace . Moreover , consolidation eliminates complexity so the benefits of marriage and work become more salient to parents . Third , it would enable families to make ends meet , even during unemployment spells , without applying for stigmatized welfare benefits . In effect , it takes children off food stamps . <p> Lastly , the RCTC would not necessarily balloon the deficit . Most of the cost of expanding the child tax credit and making it refundable would be offset by the elimination of other tax-transfer programs . Eliminating various loopholes in the tax code could certainly offset the remainder without raising income tax rates . The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost of marriage penalty relief provisions in the 2004 tax legislation to amount to $114 billion . Most of this relief went to couples earning more than $75,000.9 Given the crisis of marriage among poor and working-class families , surely Congress could find the money to extend relief to the majority of parents making less than this . <p> Though it would not cure all that ails American families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put the U.S. on the right track by eliminating many of the marriage and work penalties inherent in the current system while channeling more benefits to children in need . In sum , it is the fiscally responsible pro-family policy for which reform conservatives have been searching . <p> Josh McCabe is the Freedom Project Postdoctoral Fellow at Wellesley College , where his current research project looks at the politics and consequences of child-related tax credits in the United States , Canada , and United Kingdom . Follow him on Twitter @JoshuaTMcCabe . <p> 7 . Assumptions for comparison of RCTC to current system of child-related benefits <p> My calculations are only a first estimate , and I encourage additional estimates for different situations . Depending on income , family structure , and use of childcare , benefits can vary quite a bit . For example , low- and moderate-income married families are likely to see bigger gains from my proposed reform relative to the current system , while some high-income families claiming the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit ( CDCTC ) are likely to see losses under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low- to moderate-income single parent with one child not utilizing childcare eligible for the CDCTC . I chose these assumptions for several reasons including : <p> Single parents are typically seen as more vulnerable . <p> Single parents may be more concerned with the marriage and work penalties I discussed above . <p> Child benefits in the tax/transfer system are more important to the economic wellbeing of low- and moderate-income families . <p> It is not clear how many lower-income families actually utilize the CDCTC and nearly impossible for me to estimate its value without all sorts of additional assumptions . <p> As a regressive tax measure , most of the benefits of the CDCTC accrue to families making $100,000 . <p> Getting the numbers for each component <p> I simulated value of tax and transfer benefits at increments of $10,000 in annual income ranging from $0 to $100,000 . I include Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program , the current child tax credit , head of household filing status , and the dependent exemption because I am proposing to consolidate all of these into a single refundable child tax credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dependent Care Tax Credit in this consolidation , I have excluded it for the reasons discussed above . ) <p> SNAP : Benefits calculated using the North Dakota Department of Health SNAP Calculator found online at LONG ... I assumed a two-person household with only earned monthly income ( $0 , $833 , $1,666 ) and rental costs equal to 30 percent of income . <p> CTC : Benefit is equal to 15 percent of income over $3,000 up to $1,000 total . <p> Head of Household Filer : I calculated benefit based on difference between this filing status and filing as single in order to isolate amount related to having children . In 2015 , this amounts to $2,950 ( $9,250 minus $6,300 ) . Benefit is calculated after accounting for parent-portion of head of household filer status and standard deduction . <p> Dependent Exemption : It is worth $4,000 in 2015 . Benefit is calculated after accounting for head of household filer status and standard deduction . 
@@89588752 @5088752/ <p> Editors note : We were saddened to learn last week that the Dutch sociologist Jaap Dronkers has passed away at the age of 71 . He was known among his colleagues not only as an influential and prolific scholar but as an independent thinker unafraid to cause controversy . His work primarily revolved around education ; we summarized some of his most recent studies on the subject late last year . Yet he took an interest in family issues as well . Below , we reprint one of his contributions to our blog on the factors linked to relationship ( in ) stability in Europe and the United States . <p> There has always been a fierce debate about the relationship between cohabitation and divorce risks . Some argue that cohabitation lessens peoples commitment to partnership and thus increases their risk of divorce , while others believe that a cohabitation phase before marriage ( as a trial marriage ) would strengthen marital stability . In the United States , data suggest that the effect of cohabitation on marriage is at best neutral ; however , in European countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to a study covering the last decade of the twentieth century ( Liefbroer and Dourleijn , 2006 ) . <p> I replicate some of Liefbroer and Dourleijns analyses with data from the first decade of the twenty-first century : the Gender and Generations Programme ( GGP ) , a longitudinal survey of 18- to 79-year-olds in 19 European countries . I use the available harmonized data of the first wave of GGP . The harmonized data are purposely recoded and cleaned in order to ensure the highest level of cross-national comparability of union formation , childbearing , and union dissolution . Data from the American National Survey of Family Growth and the British Household Panel Study were included by GGP in the harmonized data , allowing me to test whether the USA is an outlier in family formation and union instability . I used the same data in my blog post about the optimal age to marry in Europe . <p> Cohabitation and Marriage <p> Figure 1 and the first three columns in the below table show the cross-national variation in the first unions of heterosexual individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who were interviewed at the beginning of the twenty-first century . " Only cohabitation " refers to all unmarried cohabiting relationships ( regardless of their legal status ) , while " cohabitation and marriage " means a marriage preceded by cohabitation . " Only marriage " means a marriage not preceded by cohabitation . In some countries , like Austria and the USA , over 30 percent of individuals first unions were cohabiting relationships , while in other countries , like Bulgaria , Germany , Hungary , Lithuania , Romania , Russia , Spain , and the UK , more than half of all first unions were marriages not preceded by cohabitation . Cohabitation followed by marriage is most common ( describing more than 30 percent of first unions ) in Austria , Germany , and Norway . <p> Notes : Table shows only EU member-states plus Russia and the U.S. , and only countries with valid information on religious affiliation . Only first unions that started after the age of 20 are included . Unions ending in the death of a partner are excluded . Weighted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and account for non-response and research design . <p> Why such variation in union formation and stability ? The legal foundations of cohabitation and marriage differ from one European country to another . In some countries , like the Netherlands , simply living together for a few years provides a legal basis to the cohabitation and allows the couple to act together ( for instance , to obtain a home mortgage based on both partners incomes ) . In other countries , establishing a legal basis for cohabitation may require a contract drawn up by a notary , or a registration at the town hall ( France ) . Further , in some countries , dissolving a legalized cohabitation has to be done in court , especially if there are children involved . <p> In most European countries ( especially those that have used the Napoleonic Code Civile for their own laws ) , getting married is not a religious act , but a secular one that must take place before any religious marriage ceremony . This is the case in the Netherlands , for example . And even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a religious ceremony , only civil laws , not the laws of the religion , are relevant for the ceremonys consequences ( for instance , divorce ) . Therefore , in some nations , the differences between a legalized cohabitation and a marriage are slim . When couples can enjoy some of the legal and financial benefits of partnerships without marrying , they may be more likely to simply cohabit . <p> Of course , many other factors relevant to union status and relationship stability also vary from country to country , such as religion . Bradley Wright recently showed that in the United States , Catholics , Jews , and mainline Protestants have lower divorce rates than Americans of other religious backgrounds . European countries levels of public non-religiousness and religious composition deviate strongly from those of the USA , however , so the story may be different in Europe ( Bruce , 2002 ; Davie , 2002 ) . I also investigate this question below . <p> Disruption Risks <p> Figure 2 and the fourth column in Table 1 show the prevalence of union disruption by union type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning of the twenty-first century . For example , in the United States , 70 percent of individuals whose first union was a cohabiting relationship not leading to marriage have dissolved their union , versus only 23 percent of the individuals who cohabited then married and 21 percent of those whose first union was a marriage not preceded by cohabitation . There is a large variation in union disruption across union type and country , but France , Norway , Russia , and the USA have the highest disruption risks across the three union types . However , this might be explained by differences in background variables ( like union duration , education , and religion ) . <p> The last column of Table 1 shows the mean union duration by union type and country for the same group of individuals . In most countries , cohabiting relationships had the shortest duration , and marriage-only unions the longest duration , with cohabiting-then-married unions in between . Austria and the USA are exceptions : cohabiting-then-married and marriage-only unions have the same average duration . Cross-national variation in duration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible processes : 1 ) Cohabitation lasts less long , while marriage has a lower dissolution risk ; 2 ) Any union has a higher overall disruption risk the longer it lasts ; 3 ) The older respondents could only choose marriage , while the younger respondents could also choose cohabitation . Therefore , it is important to control for variation in union duration . <p> Table 2 shows the risk that each type of marriage will end in divorce , relative to the likelihood that a cohabiting relationship will dissolve , controlling for union duration . However , the results of the first column of Table 2 ( with the duration control ) more or less correspond to the percentages in the fourth column of Table 1 ( without controlling for duration ) . The cohabiting-then-married and marriage-only unions are much less likely to end in a split than cohabiting relationships , even if one takes duration into account . ( The disruption risks for both types of married individuals in all countries are far lower than 1.00 , the number that would indicate a break-up rate identical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notes : Lower than 1.00 means lower disruption risk . Cox regression with union duration . Controls : year of birth , religious affiliation , age at union , square age at union , educational level , partner divorced previously , parental divorce , and children of the first union . Stars refer to the significance of the difference between the disruption risk of the two types of married individuals . All differences between " only cohabitation " and " cohabitation &amp; marriage " or " marriage " are significant at p &lt;.001. * = difference between " cohabitation &amp; marriage " and " marriage " significant at p &lt;.05 ; ** idem at p &lt;.001 . <p> The divorce risk of married individuals who cohabited first and those who did not are similar in most countries . In some countries , individuals whose first union was a marriage following cohabitation faced a slightly lower divorce risk than those who married without cohabitation ( Austria , Bulgaria , U.S. ) , while in other countries the reverse was true ( France , Germany , Hungary , Norway , Romania , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading , because union type might be related to variables that also influence dissolution risks . One example is age at first union : Young couples might prefer cohabitation , but being young also increases the risk of disruption . Another example is the commitment of the partners to their union . Making children is one symbol of commitment ( family planning is very common in European countries , including Catholic ones ) . Therefore , in Figure 3 and the fourth column of Table 2 , I control for a number of variables , including age and the presence of children , that might bias the results . Controlling for these variables does not change the overall outcome , though it makes the differences in disruption risks between cohabiting unions and marriages smaller . In France , Lithuania , Romania , Russia , Spain , and the UK , the controls make the differences statistically insignificant . <p> Notes : * = difference between " cohabitation &amp; marriage " and " marriage " significant at p &lt;.05 ; ** difference significant at p &lt;.001 . Controls : year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age at union , educational level , partner divorced previously , parental divorce , and children of the first union . <p> Unmarried cohabiting individuals faced a much higher disruption risk than married individuals in all countries , even after controlling for background variables and union duration . Although there is a lot of cross-national variation in the magnitude of the difference , unmarried cohabiting relationships were three to five times more likely to dissolve than both types of marriages . There is no country in which the disruption risk of cohabiting individuals in their first union is less than twice as high as the divorce risk of married individuals . <p> Simple explanations of the elevated disruption risk of cohabitation are not available . First , all unions starting before the age of 21 were excluded and union duration is controlled for , so young age at union formation can not explain the results . Second , since I controlled for religious affiliation , age at marriage , educational level , and children , it is unlikely that cohabitants elevated risk of breaking up can be entirely attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cohabiting couples in France and Norway , nations with generous public welfare systems , face the same high disruption risk as cohabiting couples in the United States , meaning the weaker social safety net in the U.S. can not explain American couples disruption risk . But it also means that the economic reasons behind cohabitation instability in the USA do not apply as much in countries like France and Norway , while the disruption risk in these countries is as high as that of the USA . The only explanation might be negative selection of cohabiting individuals who did not marry : Brien , Lillard , and Stern ( 2006 ) show that a significant cause of cohabitation is partners desire to learn about potential partners and to hedge against future surprises . These dynamics lead to a negative selection into " only cohabitation " and a positive selection into " cohabitation and marriage " : only the strongest , most committed cohabiting couples get married . The more structural control variables do not sufficiently cover this unmeasured selection . <p> Religion and Disruption Risk <p> Table 3 shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies quite a bit between the countries . In Austria , France , Lithuania , and the USA , the first unions of Catholic individuals ( cohabiting and married ) are less likely to break up than other individuals , but in Russia and Spain , they are more likely to break up . In Norway , only Protestants have a lower disruption risk than those without any religious affiliation . In Hungary , only the Eastern Orthodox do . Adherence to Islam increases disruption risk in France , but lowers it in Bulgaria , Germany , and Russia . The only conclusion from this table is that there is no inherent protection against disruption risk in any religious affiliation . <p> Notes : Reference category is no religious affiliation . ( Lower than 1.00 means disruption risk is lower than that of the religiously unaffiliated. ) * significant at p&lt;.05 ; ** significant at p&lt;.001 . <p> Conclusion <p> These simple analyses suggest that cohabitation itself does not increase disruption risks in an individuals first union , but that those who cohabit without strong commitment ( commitment symbolized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution risk . There is no systematic difference in divorce risk between individuals whose first union was only marriage and individuals who cohabited with their eventual spouse prior to marrying . These results hold true for many countries , and thus cross-national differences in social welfare policies , legal arrangements , and cultural and social characteristics can not explain them away . Religious affiliation seems to give no automatic protection against union dissolution : in some cases , it can even lead to higher disruption risks than unaffiliated individuals face . Much depends on the historical background of the various religions in the different countries .

Fingerman of the University of Texas at Austin used data from the Family Exchanges Study on some 600 Philadelphia-area parents between the ages of 40 and 60 who had at least one child over age eighteen .

( A third study suggests that in working-class and poor families , financial support sometimes flows in the opposite direction : from adult children to their parents rather than vice versa . ) Higher-SES parents also listened to their children talk about daily life more often .

For instance , people age 65 and above accounted for 12.5 percent of our population in 2015 . The share will rise to 20 percent by 2026 and to 40 percent by 2060 , according to the projection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In particular , Baby Boomers in Taiwan , the cohort born between 1950 and 1966 , accounted for 26 percent of the current total population ( 23.5 million ) . Taiwanese Baby Boomers are continuously reaching retirement age , which increases the burden of elder care for both the family and the government . According to the DGBAS , the time frame from aged society ( in 2018 ) to super-aged society ( in 2026 ) in Taiwan is projected at less than 8 years , an unprecedented rate in the world . <p> Furthermore , Taiwan is undergoing changes in marriage patterns and family structure mainly due to demographic changes . Between 1950 to 1980 , statistics showed a significant increase in the number of newly-married couples . This was primarily due to the large number of Baby Boomers in the marriageable age range . For the next two decades , the number of newly-married couples stayed around 150,000 until 2004 . Meanwhile , the number of divorced couples has been increasing for the past 30 years . In 1981 , for example , 14,897 couples were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 , which marked the beginning of the upward trend . During the global financial crisis in 2009 , only 116,392 couples registered for marriage , but the number of couples registered for divorce still reached 57,227 . The ratio of divorced couples to newly married couples came to approximately 1:2 . In 2011 , although the number of registered marriages increased to 165,323 , the number of registered divorce still reached 57,008 couples . In recent years , the ratio remained at l:3 and crude marriage rate was around 2.5 per thousand , higher than the average of OECD countries . <p> Although birth rates are low , and death rates are even lower , the size of the total population is still increasing . However , the downturn point was projected to be around 2020 . Along with the demographic changes and the vulnerability of marriage , the family structure in Taiwan is becoming smaller in size and diversified in living arrangements . <p> Figure 1 indicates the change of living arrangement in this century in Taiwan . First , the total number of households increased over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , the nuclear family comprised the largest share but has waned over time ( 47.9% to 37.3% ) . Third , the traditional stem family ( where three or more direct lineages cohabit ) was still important but declining in share ( 15.2% to 14% ) . Fourth , the smaller-sized households , such as single ( 10.8% to 11.9% ) and couple-only ( 12.5% to 17.9% ) , are increasing . Finally , unconventional family forms , such as one-parent families and grandparents with children ( atavistic ) , have increased in quantity , although they take up a smaller proportion . <p> Figure 1 : Living Arrangements in Taiwan , 2000-2015 <p> Note : " Atavistic " refers to grandparent-headed families , and " stem " refers to families where three or more direct lineages cohabit . <p> It worth noting that in the traditional Taiwanese society , there were indeed one-parent families , but these mainly resulted from the early death of one of the spouses . One-parent families did not become a significant event until the rise of divorce in Taiwan after 1990 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent decade mainly due to declining birth rates and the divorce of young couples , who are the most likely to experience divorce among age cohorts . <p> With the rapid changes in population and the family , Taiwan is now facing several challenges . One challenge is a declining number of students , which has resulted in a surplus of universities and schools . At the same time , the retirement population is increasing , causing a financial crisis of pension systems and the need for long-term elder care . Finally , the decreasing working-age population and the aging of the labor force will harm economic development in Taiwan . <p> James C.T .

Still , toenails are a metaphor for the whole range of little things that many of us will need help with at some point , for a season or for the rest of our lives . <p> Toenails and the Future of Families <p> This all got me thinking about the future of families and about toenails .

The researchers found that richer parents offer more financial support than poorer ones ; however , parents of lower socioeconomic status ( SES ) give their adult children more of several kinds of intangible support , and on other measures parental SES does not seem to matter . <p> A group of scholars led by Karen L. Fingerman of the University of Texas at Austin used data from the Family Exchanges Study on some 600 Philadelphia-area parents between the ages of 40 and 60 who had at least one child over age eighteen . The parents answered questions about how often they provided their kids with many types of support : financial , practical , emotional , and technical support ; advice and companionship ; and listening to them talk about daily life .

( A third study suggests that in working-class and poor families , financial support sometimes flows in the opposite direction : from adult children to their parents rather than vice versa . ) Higher-SES parents also listened to their children talk about daily life more often .

" It turned out that three factors " were significantly associated with overall support to the average grown child in a family : ( a ) marital status ( married parents gave more ) , ( b ) smaller family size , and ( c ) having a child under age 18 .

While there are academic arguments about how great the average risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the relative risks . Some people face a higher risk of divorce , and others a very low risk .

To really avoid the possibility of such pain , one would need to avoid love , sex , and children altogether .

Nor , when you are already married , can you go back and change the history of things like if you cohabited prior to engagement or had a child before marriage . But even with static risk factors , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have their impact on your present life through other dimensions that are dynamic . For example , although having parents who divorced seems to weaken adults views of commitment in marriage , xiii you can control your own beliefs about marriage and your own level of commitment to your partner . <p> Advice for Those Not Yet Married <p> If you have not yet married or even chosen a partner , you have , by far , the most power to affect your eventual likelihood of divorce . Those who are already married can only change how they think and act in their existing marriage . Singles who have not yet chosen a partner have a lot more that is still on the table for change . In other words , your stage of life shapes what is dynamic and static in terms of factors associated with your risk for divorce . The earlier you are in the process of finding a mate , the more your choices going forward can affect your future . Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you proceed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person very well before deciding to marry . We all know people who fell in love at first sight and married within months , and who have done well over many years in marriage . But there are many other couples who married fast and blew apart . By taking more time , you can see how a potential partner treats others , responds to stress , and handles disagreements with you on things that matter . Also , if your relationship is moving toward marriage , take some time to clarify expectations about marriage , family , and life . If you are not sure what to talk through , my colleagues and I have chapters on expectations in most of our books , including a detailed list of topics to talk through ( e.g. , here and here ) . <p> 2 . Pay attention to major red flags . If you see evidence of controlling or abusive behavior , or serious substance use problems , do n't  move blindly ahead hoping things will work out . Love does not conquer all . If you have trusted friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the person you are dating . Do n't  marry a makeover projector , at the least , do n't  do so until there is great evidence of real , lasting change when there are concerns . And do n't  move in together to test such a relationship . That 's the worst reason you can have to move in together.xiv <p> 3 . Look for someone who shares your beliefs and values . What are your central values in life ? Are they shared ? Avoid situations where you might fall for someone prior to determining these things . Once you sense some chemistry , its hard to hold onto what had been non-negotiable for what you wanted in a mate . This is where people can use online dating sites effectively : You can be clear about the big things you are looking for in life before you meet someone and it gets all complicated with chemistry . Chemistry is great . You want to have that . But chemistry is best developed in a sequence , not as a blinding , binding glue in a relationship you 'd otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Look for mutual dedication . There should be sustained evidence that you and a prospective mate are equally devoted to the relationship ; for example , that you are both willing to make sacrifices for each other . If you consistently think you are more dedicated to the relationship than your partner , consider moving on . That 's a bad sign for future marital quality . Its fine to be looking for love , but its smarter to be looking for sacrifice . See here for a specific example . <p> 5 . Do n't  let constraints for staying together increase before you establish mutual commitment to be together . Many people slide into situations that make it harder to end a relationship before they have made a clear decision about what is best . My colleague Galena Rhoades and I believe that this is what many people do not see about the risk of living together prior to marriage ( or at least before engagement ) . For too many couples , living together makes it harder to break up before its clear that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing this problem . <p> 6 . Do premarital training : While marital experts debate everything , there is solid evidence that completing premarital training ( education , counseling , whatever its called ) together can improve your odds in marriage.xv Although this does not guarantee marital bliss , there is much more potential upside than downside . The one " downside " I sometimes think about is actually an upside : you could learn something concerning about your partner or relationship that you did n't fully appreciate before--something that could lead you to get more help or go slower . Because of this , I recommend that you seek premarital training as far before a wedding date as possible . Why ? Because the further in advance you complete it , the more you have a chance to find out something that could lead you to change your mind about marrying each other . I know I just lost a few of you . But consider carefully why you just checked out . Instead of doing something like living together , which has virtually no evidence of making marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your decision without simultaneously making it harder to break up . <p> If you are likely to marry in a religious setting , contact that group and see if they provide premarital training . If not , check around to see if another group provides this service in a way that fits for the both of you . If you can not find that , try a relationship education workshop if they exist in your community . Or , as another option , ask around about a local marital therapist who is skilled in helping couples prepare for marriage . If you do n't  have any local options , there are online resources for assessing relationships before marriage ( e.g. , here ) or for strengthening relationships ( e.g. , here , and here ) . <p> What makes a great marriage is not two perfect people aligning their lives , but two imperfect people transformed by a life of commitment and love . <p> 7 . Be realistic about potential mates . There are things I like about the concept of a soul-mate . For some people , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep level of connection and perhaps of shared beliefs who can be a fellow traveler in life . I have no problem with that . For others , however , the concept is dangerous : what they really mean by " soul-mate " is a perfect lover who is ideal for them . here 's the risk in that : You may well marry someone you believe is your soul-mate , in this extreme view of perfect love . But someday , you will realize that this person is not perfect . You will get hurt . You will be misunderstood or maybe even challenged about some of your imperfections . <p> Some very sound marriages fail because one or both partners expected a level of acceptance , passion , or perfection that is just not possible or exceedingly rare . That 's a real shame . What makes a great marriage is not two perfect people aligning their lives , but two imperfect people transformed by a life of commitment and love . Look for someone who can commit and grow and sacrifice , and be that person to your eventual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps you realize that you bring a high risk for divorce to a marriage . Some people get dealt a worse hand in life , and you may have been dealt a tough one . Further , individuals with a greater risk for divorce are more likely to marry other individuals with greater risk for divorce . What can you do ? Consider the hand you were dealt and play that hand as well as you can . Even just committing to my first suggestion above , to go slower , could make a huge difference in your life and odds of divorcing . Marriage involves a choice to risk loving another for life , but that is different from gambling with your love life . Just make sure you are deciding rather than sliding your way into your future . <p> Disclosure : I am co-author of two books I referenced here , and I am a partner in the company that publishes the online intervention , ePREP , that is linked as an online resource .

Often central European governments establish measures for workers to balance work and family and policies that allow parents to obtain paid or unpaid leaves to care for their children . Yet the lives of most families revolve around towns , whether big or small , so towns or villages often provide kindergarten centers or parenting services for families with children . Nevertheless , scholars have paid little attention to family policies at the local level . There was not a coherent body of literature on such policies in Europe as of 2010 , according to Francesco Belletti and Lorenza Rebuzzini , nor does it seem to exist yet .

@@89588833 @5088833/ <p> In church , Christians , especially evangelical Christians , are often told that they get divorced as much as , if not more often than , non-Christians . In the sociological research literature , however , the message is different . Religion is linked to fewer divorces . <p> Well , which is it ? Both sources ca n't be right . In answering this question in 2006 , I ended up writing a protracted blog series on divorce rates in America , which spawned a published article and a book . <p> Since then I have gotten about nine years older and the world has changed in various ways . We got our first African-American president and gas prices went back to below $3 a gallon . Americans marry less often and more children are raised without both parents in the home . And the General Social Survey ( GSS ) collected several more waves of data . So let 's revisit the relationship between religion and divorce rates and see where they are at now . <p> Using data from the GSS , I took all the respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys ( dropping several oversamples ) . Among them , I selected the respondents who had ever been married , and calculated how many had ever been divorced ( or were currently separated ) . The answer for the whole sample was 45 percentquite close to the " half of all marriages end in divorce " statistic that is widely passed along . <p> Then I separated the respondents into seven religious groups , using the RELTRAD classification system developed by Steensland et al . 2000 . It divides GSS respondents into seven broad religious affiliations based on the type of religious group they are involved with ( e.g. , which religious denomination ) . As shown in Figure 1 , there are substantial differences in divorce rates by self-reported religious affiliation . The highest rates are among attendees of historically black Protestant churches and people who have no religious affiliation ( i.e. , the " nones " ) . The lowest rates were among Jews , Catholics , and mainline Protestants . In the middle are evangelical Christians and members of other religions like Islam , Buddhism , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now the case , as it was nine years ago , that evangelical Christians do not have dramatically high divorce rates . Higher than ideal ? Absolutely . Higher than could be ? Maybe . But higher than all other Americans ? Not at all . <p> There 's no reason to stop here with the data , for the Common Sociological Era ( CSE ) started in 1972 , when the General Social Survey collected its first wave of data . Figure 2 presents the divorce rates for all GSS respondents since 1972 . To make this line smoother , I calculated the average divorce rate for each group separately in each decade and then connected the decade data-points with a line . <p> As you can see , the percentage of respondents who had ever been divorced has climbed since the 1970s , with the greatest increase being in the 1970s and 1980s and a smaller increase in the past 15 years . Over this 53-year span , the percentage of Americans who had ever divorced just about doubled , from 24 percent to 45 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of time , and its significant given the many social , emotional , and financial costs of divorce . <p> Figure 3 replicates this analysis for the seven different religious groups . The rank order of the groups has stayed mostly the same , with black Protestants and the " nones " being highest in each decade and Catholics and Jews being lowest . However , the religious groups are more tightly packed now than before . In the 1970s , the observed range was from 12 percent ( for Jews ) to 40 percent ( for black Protestants ) . Now , its 37 percent ( for Catholics ) to 56 percent ( for black Protestants ) . The increasing similarity between religious groups could result from our nations culture having an increasingly large impact on peoples moral beliefs . As people of different religious groups are influenced by the broader societys view of divorce , they become more tolerant of divorce and between-religion differences lessen . <p> In looking at religious differences so far , I have focused on religious affiliation , but there are other aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliated with the same religion but have very different levels of engagement . Perhaps the most straightforward measure of engagement is attendance rates for religious services . I took all of the respondents GSS and divided them into three groups : those who worshipped weekly or more often , those who attended every several weeks to every several months , and those who attended never or just a few times a year . As Figure 4 illustrates , the differences in divorce rates by religious service attendance are substantial . People who attend religious services every week are 15 percentage points less likely to have ever been divorced than those who rarely attend . Clearly religious involvement matters for ones chances of a lasting marriage , above and beyond which religious group one is a part of . <p> Another pattern is hinted at with the data in Figure 4 . Over time , the Christians who attend services monthly are looking more and more like those who attend weekly . In the 1980s and the 1990s , the divorce rate of the monthly group was closer to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the divorce rate of the weekly group . This could reflect new norms in church attendance . Whereas in the past , church attendance meant weekly attendance , now its more acceptable to miss some services and to attend several times a month , even if you 're fully committed . <p> For the coming nine years , I would expect divorce rates to remain level or even decrease . As marriage rates continue to decline , the couples who do get married are those most likely to stay together in the long run , meaning a lower base divorce rate . Also , the divorce patterns of religious groups should continue to become more similar to each other . With the many ways that morals and culture are shared in our society , people might gravitate toward similar approaches to marriage and divorce . So differences in divorce rates are apt to continue diminishing between Catholics and mainline Protestants , between Jews and evangelicals . <p> Bradley Wright is an associate professor with the Department of Sociology at the University of Connecticut .

@@89588840 @5088840/ <p> Nobody is advocating in favor of teen pregnancy . Whether agendas are feminist , economic , or moral , there 's a consensus that it is better to delay pregnancy . What , then , does the latest Demography article on the effects of teen pregnancy contribute ? First , it explains that scholars may not agree on the estimated costs of teen pregnancy because different groups of teens actually experience different costs . Second , it makes policy recommendations informed by the background factors that help predict how much a teen pregnancy really costs . <p> Let me take you to sub-Saharan Africa for a moment to help emphasize the importance of class differences in the United States with respect to teen pregnancy . A little-known fact is that only a small proportion of school dropouts in Africa are pregnancy-related . How can this be on a continent where educational attainment is low and teen childbearing is common ? It is n't much of a paradox when you consider that the girl who dropped out of school at age twelve was n't pregnant at the time , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her counterpart who was still in school and still unmarried at fifteen . <p> There are two realities relevant to teen pregnancies in the U.S. embedded in my African example . One is that the girl who dropped out of school early was n't on the fast track for upward mobility , with or without early pregnancy . The other one is that the same conditions that limit economic prospects also reduce the cost of early pregnancy : If dreams of a well-paying job are just pipe dreams , you sacrifice very little by devoting part of your adolescence to childrearing . Or , as Christina Diaz and Jeremy Feil put it in the recent Demography article , " opportunity costs are concentrated among those with the most opportunity . " <p> So back on this side of the ocean , I introduce you to Anne and Trisha . Anne was from a wealthy Connecticut community and a senior in high school who had already been accepted to an Ivy League college when she became pregnant . Trisha lived in Southeast D.C. with her 30-year-old mother and her 45-year-old grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether these pregnancies would affect their futures the same way , it would clearly be a rhetorical question . It is almost like asking if the African girlshe deserves a name too , so let 's call her Akuawould have gone to university if she had n't  gotten pregnant at 15 . Akua and Trisha both have low opportunity costs from teen pregnancy because they had bleak socioeconomic prospects prior to becoming pregnant . Neither of their pregnancies even has the potential to keep them out of the Ivy League . <p> Diaz and Feil estimate young women like Anne have earnings between the ages of 25 and 35 that are 67 percent lower than their peers who did not become pregnant as teens , but among young women like Trisha , earnings are 23 percent lower than among their peers . These differences are still greater when they estimate the costs of teen childbearing rather than teen pregnancy . <p> Through their research , Diaz and Feil also emphasize that teen pregnancy also costs less among those with greater social supports . Akua likely has a lot of social support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that advantage , but she does have a mother and a grandmother who were teen mothers themselves . Diaz and Feil found that teen pregnancy exacted higher costs among teens whose mothers were older , and among teens who had weak relationships with their parents . On the positive side , this means that strong parental support can buffer the negative effects of teen pregnancy . On the negative side , it means that teens who become pregnant in families and communities where early fertility is not normative suffer greater consequences . Differently put , women who are less prepared for motherhood by communities that emphasize ( and model ) other adult roles , or who face greater social stigma associated with teen pregnancy because it is rare , " pay " more for teen pregnancy . <p> There are very few social scientists who advocate policy interventions targeted toward those with higher socioeconomic status , but this is exactly where Diaz and Feil end up . They argue that their findings support the conclusion that " efforts to prevent early pregnancies will have limited impacts on the disadvantaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , disadvantaged teens are more likely than their wealthy counterparts to get pregnant precisely because they are rational actors : They have more social support and face fewer economic costs .

For disadvantaged women , Diaz and Feil advocate policies that allow young women to further their own educational attainment during pregnancy and childrearing . <p> I like this two-pronged approach because it targets prevention efforts where they will be most effective while still having the potential to weaken the intergenerational transmission of poverty . Even though Trisha wasnt dissuaded from early pregnancy by her mother and grandmothers poverty , maybe her child might delay childbearing if Trisha herself were able to finish an associates degree . <p> But I left out part of Trishas story : She does n't  have a child because she miscarried at thirteen .

@@89588845 @5088845/ <p> According to a recent survey , more than six in ten 18- to 44-year-old mothers in the U.S. report that one or more of their births was unplanned . It may seem strange to mention this fact so soon after a national holiday honoring moms , as unintended pregnancies are seldom cause for celebration . Yet American women who have experienced an unintended birth are more likely to report that having a child unexpectedly had mostly neutral or no effects on important areas of their lives than to report mostly negative impacts . <p> These findings come from a recent Urban Institute report , " Prevalence and Perceptions of Unplanned Births , " which drew on a nationally representative survey of nearly 2,000 women ages 18 to 44 and on more detailed interviews with 26 survey respondents . When participants were asked how an unplanned birth would affect various areas of a womans life , their responses were generally negative . <p> About two-thirds of women thought an unplanned birth1 negatively affects a womans education and income , and almost six in 10 said the same for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of women thought that an unintended birth would have either no effect or a positive effect on a womans physical health . And women were more likely to say an unintended birth would boost a womans relationship with her partner and her motivation to achieve goals than to predict negative effects in those areas . Overall , just over half of women ( 52 percent ) anticipated that an unplanned birth would negatively impact at least four of these seven areas of life . ( The other 48 percent of women fell into three groups of roughly equal size , anticipating mostly positive effects , mostly neutral effects , or mixed effects . ) <p> Certain demographic traits predicted different views of the consequences of an unintended birth . Women who were white , had at least some college education , and had a family income about 138 percent of the federal poverty line were more likely to say an unintended birth would have mostly negative consequences than respondents who were black or Hispanic , had a high school diploma at most , and had low household income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unintended pregnancy had less negative expectations about how it would affect a woman . ( Marital status and age , however , generally were not linked to respondents views . ) <p> Finally , women who had actually experienced an unplanned birth held more positive perceptions about how such an event impacts a womans life . When asked specifically about how their unintended birth changed their lives , their views were surprisingly varied , as the below figure indicates . <p> These women were more likely to report that their unplanned birth had no effects on most major aspects of their lives ( 36 percent ) than to report primarily negative ( 29.6 percent ) , primarily positive ( 20.4 percent ) , or mixed effects ( 14 percent ) . <p> If you pause to consider the financial , logistical , and personal demands of caring for a new baby , these claims might seem overly rosy . Perhaps women are loath to admitto researchers and even to themselvesthat the child they love has made them worse off in any way . Without discounting this possibility , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many women . <p> In their 2005 book , Promises I Can Keep , Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas record what some young , disadvantaged single mothers told them about how their children changed their lives : <p> In these decaying , inner-city neighborhoods of Philadelphia , motherhood is the primary vocation for young women , and those who strive to do it well are often transformed by the process . Nineteen-year-old Shonta , an African American with one child who became a mother at only fourteen , says she knows motherhood " has its ups and downs , but I never felt my daughter held me back from anything . If anything she taught me how to be responsible and mature . " Nineteen-year-old Adlyn declares that if she were childless , " I would be on the streetbecause I used to be out on the streets getting high . And look at me now ! I 'm going to school , doing what I got to do . I 'm telling everyone , watch me when Im done ! " <p> Over and over again , mothers tell us their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the street , and helped put their lives back together . Children can banish depression , calm a violent temper , or serve as do-it-yourself rehab from alcohol or drugs . Childrenand the minute-by-minute demands they make on their mothers time , energy , and emotionsbring order out of chaos . <p> Joy Pullmanns experience of becoming a mother was much different from Shonta and Adlyns . Married , college-educated , and launching a career that she loved , Pullmann was devastated when she became pregnant years before she had planned to . Becoming a mother , she wrote for The Federalist , " ruined my world to remake it . " Motherhood made her life harderbut she likes the person it is turning her into . <p> What about a womans career ? Heather Havrilesky at The Cuthas argued that having kids actually improved her career ( without specifying whether her pregnancies were planned ) . Once you 're a parent , she says , " the time you spend at workwhich is probably a little shorter nowfeels less meaningless somehow " : <p> Work constitutes a break from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work starts to feel worth savoring , too . But since you probably have far less time to spend at work now , guess what ? You become more efficient ... You are more productive and you enjoy your work morewhich , in turn , makes you even more productive . <p> Maybe that 's why so many women in the Urban Institute study who had experienced an unintended birth said that it had had no effect ( or a positive effect ) on their education and job , and why over half of these women said their unplanned birth increased their motivation to achieve their goals . Whether planned or not , the birth of a(nother) child often causes women and men alike to re-evaluate their priorities and focus on what matters most to them . <p> None of this is meant to downplay the long-term difficulties many couples face when a pregnancy test is unexpectedly positive , nor to imply that the government and private sector are doing enough to accommodate and support parents . My point is simple : If we trust the women who speak from experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might imagine . <p> 1 . Unlike some of the literature on unplanned pregnancies and births , the Urban Institute report did not distinguish between mistimed pregnancies ( to women who wanted to have a baby at some point in the future , but not at the time they became pregnant ) and unwanted pregnancies ( to women who did not want to become pregnant at that point or any time in the future ) . 
@@89588850 @5088850/ <p> Many studies have found that young people raised in single-parent families show more achievement and behavior problems than those who grow up with both their biological parents . Family sociologists often attribute these developmental problems to the meager financial resources that single parents command , and the less adequate supervision they can exercise over their offspring . But research has also shown that childhood disturbances are linked to conflict between parents , especially when the conflict is intense or prolonged . My analysis of recent national survey data here shows that children of divorced and never-married parents are far more likely to have been exposed to domestic violence than children in married two-parent families . <p> In the 2011-2012 National Survey of Childrens Health , conducted by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics , parents of 95,677 children aged 17 and under were asked whether their child had ever seen or heard " any parents , guardians , or any other adults in the home slap , hit , kick , punch , or beat each other up .

Note also that a childs family structure was a better predictor of witnessing family violence than was her parents ' education , family income , poverty status , or race . <p> Experiencing family violence is stressful for children , undercuts their respect and admiration for parents who engage in abusive behavior , and is associated with increased rates of emotional and behavioral problems at home and in school . For example , among children of never-married mothers who had witnessed family violence , 58 percent had conduct or academic problems at school requiring parental contact .

Or the child support judgment may impose onerous financial obligations . It is a well-established psychological principle that extreme frustration leads to aggression , particularly in individuals with low impulse control and aggressive tendencies to begin with . Sexual jealousy may play a role as well , as one or both parents develop new intimate relationships . Such relationships are rarely symmetrical .

Less tolerant public attitudes about partner battering , more stringent enforcement of domestic abuse laws , and the greater financial independence of women have likely played a part here . The NSCH data provide another insight into the trend : Children born to mothers who were teenagers or young adults ( ages 2024 ) at the time of the childs birth were more likely than those born to older mothers to have witnessed family fights that became physical , and there has been a steep decline in the numbers of children born to teen and young adult mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in intact families are less likely to have witnessed domestic violence than those in disrupted families . <p> Nicholas Zill is a psychologist and survey researcher who has written on indicators of family and child wellbeing for four decades .

@@89588867 @5088867/ <p> Senator Marco Rubio ( R. , Fla. ) has become the first politician in many years to propose scaling back the future costs of Social Security . President George W. Bush offered his own proposal in 2005 , but it never came to a vote in Congress and was widely seen as putting an end to his political momentum following his re-election . Rubios proposal will and should be evaluated mostly in terms of its impact on retirement security , national saving , and economic growth . It has modest implications for family structure as well , however , that should not be wholly overlooked . <p> Public pensions for the elderly began in Germany in the late 1800s , and the German economist Hans-Werner Sinn has noted that a kind of familial decay lurked in the background of their origin . " The idea of having children in order to ensure satisfactory consumption in old age had been common before Bismarcks reforms , " he writes . Since few people could invest in financial capital , such as stocks and bonds , they invested in human capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old agean intergenerational bargain within a family in which parents took care of their children when young and in return received care from them later in lifehad several drawbacks .

Sinn writes that Bismarck " mistrusted the benevolence and generosity of the new type of family that had emerged from urbanization and industrialization and saw the pension system as an enforcement device for ensuring a resource transfer to the old generation , one which would not have come about through voluntary private actions . " The various risks involved in the old dispensation means , as Sinn demonstrates , that a " moderately sized " pension system enhances social welfare . If parents are giving back part of their pension in the form of bequests , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overly large system is that it will undermine the incentive to invest in human capital . Public pensions partly socialize the returns to raising childrenyou do n't  have to make the sacrifices entailed in raising them yourself to benefit from their having been raised to a productive adulthoodand therefore result in fewer of them being , er , produced . Several studies suggest that , just as Sinn argues , public pension programs such as Social Security have reduced birth rates by a significant amount in the developed world . ( Obviously , nobody claims that they are the only reason birth rates have declined . ) <p> Even more than rising life expectancies , declining fertility rates have made these public pension programs harder to finance . Together they mean that there are fewer working-age adults to support the retirement of the elderly . This demographic difficulty is the backdrop to Sen. Rubios proposal . <p> That proposal has several components . A few of them would encourage people to extend their working lives . Rubio would gradually raise the age at which Social Security benefits begin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that those earnings would not decrease seniors benefit levels . He would make it easier for people to save for their own retirements by allowing those without access to company pension plans to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal workers . <p> Rubio 's changes to Social Security may yield a modest increase in the investment in human capital that is child-rearing . <p> Perhaps most important , in terms of the programs solvency , Rubio would change the way future benefits are calculated . His goals in making that change are to extend the life of the program , slow the growth of benefits for high earners , and give low earners more . It is entirely possible to achieve these goals simultaneously because benefits are now calculated in a way that has them grow with time at all income levels . ( The retiree of 2045 is supposed to get a check that is significantly higher , even in inflation-adjusted terms , than the retiree of 2015 ; the bigger check results from the economic growth that should happen in the interim . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future costs : the increase in the retirement age and the change in benefit levels . These changes should yield an increase in the supply of labor and the stock of capital , as people work , save , and invest more for their old age and rely on the government less . They should also yield a modest increase in the investment in human capital that is child-rearing . They do not eliminate what might be called , borrowing the language of economists , the " free rider " problem of Social Security : The returns to raising children will still be partly socialized . ( Not least because Medicare has the same feature . ) They will , however , reduce this effect . <p> For people who would like to see larger families ( or see them shrink more slowly ) , and people who would like government policies to have a smaller effect on family size , this feature of the Rubio plan should serve as an under-appreciated point in its favor .

@@89588876 @5088876/ <p> With all the arguing about whether you can be for women and for abortion , itd be good to talk about what abortion means to the women who face it most often . <p> Anyone paying attention knows the overarching themes of both sides : on the one side are those who equate abortion with womens freedom and equality . On the other , women like myself who denounce the killing of human beings and an industry regularly indifferent to womens suffering and their right to fully informed consent . <p> Yet an honest assessment of the situation of women most likely to have an abortion today easily reveals that there 's more to it . The Guttmacher Institute reports that 86 percent of abortions are performed on single women . Three-fourths of all abortions are performed on women living at or below the poverty line . While poor women have a disproportionate share of abortions , however , they are less likely to abort any given pregnancy than their wealthier sisters . <p> Rates of nonmarital births are over 40 percent , led by disadvantaged women in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-parent families and suffer the poverty associated with it . Birth control has never been more available , with billions of taxpayer funds spent on it annually , and yet , its not the panacea many say it is in the nonmarital pregnancy or abortion conversations . <p> To understand what nonmarital pregnancy and abortion mean to women who face both , we have to understand what romance , sex , and motherhood mean to them . <p> The leading book about the lives of single momsPromises I Can Keep : Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriagesociologists Kathryn Edin ( John Hopkins University ) and Maria Kefalas ( St. Josephs University ) bring to life the voices of these women . For the purposes of their study , Edin and Kefalas moved into the poorest neighborhoods in Philadelphia and Camden , New Jersey , and over the course of five years , befriended individuals they sought to understand . <p> When Birth Control Fails <p> They found that " the large majority of unwedded births among the poor are neither fully planned nor actively avoided . Most often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth control prior to conception . " ( emphasis in original ) <p> Access to birth control is not a concern , Edin and Kefalas note , " Planned Parenthood , area hospitals , and Philadelphias network of free clinics offer family planning services , and these institutions are so well known in these neighborhoods that few have to look in the phone book to find the address . " Furthermore , poor women complained to Edin and Kefalas about the side effects caused by the Pill , patch , or other methods . <p> Additionally , once the relationship with their childs father moves to a perceived higher level of intimacy and trust , they abandon contraception or use it less consistently . " As a new romance deepens , young women who are not exactly planning to have children may nonetheless begin to look for signs of their partners willingness to do the right thing if they were to wind up pregnant , " Edin and Kefalas report . The significance of a man saying he wants to have a baby with a woman is huge : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone knows that a young man who proclaims his desire to have a baby by a young woman is offering high tribute to her beauty , for this avowal expresses a desire for a child that will have her eyes and her smile . ( emphasis in original ) <p> The Fathers Role <p> Oftentimes , this desire for deeper " trust " is expressed early in the relationshipsometimes as early as the first days of a new relationship . The fathers then wield tremendous influence in the future of the pregnancy . " For their part , women believe that the response to a pregnancy is the measure of a man , and hope the crisis will force their partners to move toward maturity , " Edin and Kefalas explain . But a pregnancy premature to a lasting commitment rarely forges the intimacy women desire . <p> " Many men do not cope with the stress of a pregnancy well , " Edin and Kefalas write , " What seemed like an enchanting possibility in private moments of courtship can become a terrifying responsibility in the harsh light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father that introduces abortion . <p> " Get an abortionIf you do n't  get an abortion , we are n't  going to be together , " one father said to his pregnant girlfriend . " Take it out , take it out , " another man said , even providing $600 for the abortion . But among the women that Edin and Kefalas spoke with , rarely do a young woman and her community find abortion justifiable . <p> " Mothers who choose abortion when they have the means to avoid it are viewed as immature at best and immoral at worst , unable or unwilling to face up to the consequences of their own actions , " with few situations in these communities being considered " dire enough " to qualify for an abortion , as they explain . <p> For these women , " choosing to end a pregnancy is thus like abandoning hope .

" For these women , " choosing to end a pregnancy is thus like abandoning hope . " <p> A child offers something young women in these communities need and lack " love and intimacy . " As one mother explained , " I think I got pregnant mainly because I wanted to be loved . I went through childhood without it . " <p> Further , for many young women , becoming a mother was the impetus to make better choices for their life and future . <p> " Thats why I stopped dancing . I stopped doing a whole lot of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , and I cant raise him around that stuff . " <p> " I was n't going to return to school for me , it was for the sake of my child ... " another mother explained ( emphasis in original ) . <p> In fact , they repeatedly heard mothers say things like " my child saved me , " or " its only because of my children that I 'm where I am today . " According to Edin and Kefalas , " women in these communities believed their children were what finally set them on the right track . " <p> Pro-life pregnancy centers and pro-life religious charities are already helping poor womenmarried and singlechoose life for their kids and themselves , and to not force women to abandon hope . But we must go further . <p> Data from scholars on both sides of the political sphere assert that children born in single-parent homes are more like to suffer physically , emotionally , educationally , and economically than their peers born to their married mom and dad . <p> " The poor avoid marriage , " Edin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of it , but because they revere it . " To them , divorce strips marriage of its meaning . As one woman told them , " I 'm not going to make any promises I cant keep . " <p> Like their more advantaged sisters , poorer women want and deserve stable , romantic , and nonviolent partnerships , married parenthood , and a decent chance for their kids to escape single parenting , low education , and the cycle of poverty . In the end , freedom and equality are the right words to describe what women want , but its a different sort of freedom than either abortion or nonmarital pregnancy promises . As we face an administration promising to support significant pro-life legislative gains , and promising to support forgotten Americans , both sides need to think long and hard about what they can do privately , alongside the government , to realize less advantaged womens overarching hopes for marriage and children as a package deal . <p> Meg T.

@@89588883 @5088883/ <p> Ever wonder about whether the size of a wedding relates to marital quality and divorce ? When it comes to weddings , two important indicators of size are the amount of money spent and the number of guests who attended . Here , we will consider findings from two recent reports . Neither has been peer reviewed , but the findings make sense and they reinforce each other . <p> In our recent report for the National Marriage Project ( Before " I Do " : What do Premarital Experiences have to do with Marital Quality Among Todays Young Adults ? ) , we focused on how relationship history before marriage relates to marital quality . We examined the history of relationships that came before the relationship with the eventual spouse and premarital experiences with the eventual spouse . For example , having more sexual partners , having cohabited with partners other than the spouse , or having children from prior relationships were all associated , on average , with lower marital quality later on . Further , those who had child with their eventual spouse before marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or who said they slid into living with their eventual spouse ( if they cohabited premaritally at all ) , also reported lower marital quality . <p> While there is no end to controversy about the implications of such findings , these findings were really not controversial themselves . There is a history of similar findings as well as strong reasons why such variables will be related to marital outcomesincluding selection but also the consequential impacts of the actual behaviors. i <p> Wedding Guests : Does the Number Matter ? <p> In the Before I Do report , we presented an analysis that was , to our knowledge , totally new in this field . In our national , longitudinal sample , we had asked those who got married how many people attended their wedding . We did n't  ask this on a lark . We asked because of a strong theory for why those having more attendees at their weddings might have an edge in marriage . <p> Those who reported having more guests at their wedding reported , on average , higher levels of marital qualityeven when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and income . While we controlled for individual income , we did n't  have measures of other possibly important variables to control for such as the cost of the weddings , parental wealth and contributions to the wedding , or a straightforward indicator of the size of the couples social network . So , caveat emptor . ( If you want to read more on the technical issue of included and unmeasured variables , see one of the follow-up pieces we wrote that was posted here at the Institute for Family Studies . ) <p> here 's some of what we said about this finding in our report . This section describes the strong theory that may explain , at least in part , the association between wedding attendance and marital quality . <p> There is some reason to believe that having more witnesses at a wedding may actually strengthen marital quality . According to the work of psychologist Charles Kiesler ( 1971 ) , commitment is strengthened when it is publicly declared because individuals strive to maintain consistency between what they say and what they do . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our past conduct . The desire for consistency is likely enhanced by public expressions of intention . Social scientist Paul Rosenblatt applied this idea specifically to marriage ( Rosenblatt , 1977 ) . He theorized that , early in a marriage , marital stability and commitment would be positively associated with the ceremonial effort and public nature of a couples wedding . Rosenblatt specifically suggested that holding a big wedding with many witnesses would lead to a stronger desireor even needto follow through on the commitment . <p> Our findings suggest that he may have been right . Nevertheless , it is also important to keep in mind that because these questions about weddings have received so little attention in prior studies and because only a small percentage of respondents reported not having a wedding , these findings should be tested in other samples . <p> This is why we asked the question in the first place . Despite the strength of this idea ( and its overlap with clear findings in the study of cognitive dissonance ) , one of the best alternative explanations was that the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of guests . After all , couples with more economic resources tend to have many advantages in life and marriage . But we did not have the cost of the wedding in our national data set , so we could not analyze it . <p> Wedding Guests and Wedding Costs <p> Thanks to a tweet by Samantha Joel ( @datingdecisions ) , who is , like us , quite interested in relationship decision making , we came across a study that looks at the number of guests people had at their wedding but also other variables such as the cost of weddings . Economists Andrew Francis and Hugo Mialon of Emory University examined how expenses related to getting married ( the cost of weddings and engagement rings ) and a host of other variablesincluding the number of guestswere associated with the likelihood of divorce . They examined a different outcome than we did , divorce not marital quality , but you can see the overlap . <p> Some of what Francis and Mialon found is complex . Overall , while controlling for a host of variables , they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with more stable marriages . In fact , those who spent the most on their weddings ( $20,000 or more ) were , on average , at greater risk for divorce . The economists speculate about why this could be , and they further examine factors such as the stress a large debt from an expensive wedding might place on a marriage . <p> here 's the part we zeroed in on . In a variety of analyses ( some without controls and some with a large number of control variablesincluding wedding costs ) , Francis and Mialon found that higher wedding attendance was associated with lower odds of divorce . Although the findings related to costs of weddings and rings had shown complicated patterns , the pattern related to number of guests was always in the same direction and always clear . <p> We think this one line from Francis and Mialons paper best exemplifies their overall findings : " Thus , the evidence suggests that the types of weddings associated with lower likelihood of divorce are those that are relatively inexpensive but are high in attendance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone from no findings ( that we know of ) related to the wedding attendance to two reports showing consistent results . There are surely many possible explanations , including some we will to try to investigate further in the future , but this second study seems to rule out one explanation we were most concerned about when interpreting our own findingthe cost of the wedding . <p> Can I get a Witness ? <p> Some couples planning a life together do not want a wedding or may want one that is very modest with just close friends and family attending . Personal preferences matter a lot in all of this . Surely , what we are talking about here is just one small part of the overall puzzle of how a couple might build a life together . Many other things matter and matter more , but let 's say you are open to some tips on the size and scope of your wedding . Here are some thoughts . <p> First , do n't  break the bank when getting married . Many young adults have debts already , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expensive wedding . It is unfortunate that the image so many now have is of lavish , costly weddings . This wild expectation puts weddings out of reach for those with fewer means and adds greater burdens to parents , brides , and grooms for those with more . <p> Second , it may be worth finding ways to prioritize the network of friends of family you have , and inviting them to be guests at your wedding . The benefits of having more witnesses at your wedding may come from both the psychological consequences of making a very public declaration of commitment ( which should increase follow through ) and from having more friends and family who see your relationship as something to rally around , root for , and support . <p> Third , for couples who do not have a strong network of friends or family , think about how you might build one . We do n't  mean trying to do this just in time for your wedding . We mean doing this over time for your marriage . When its possible ( and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship with another couple or getting involved in some community group together might be just the thing to start building a network of support and connection around your marriage . <p> If you like the idea of a big , expensive wedding , can well afford it , and it wont cause a lot of additional stress , sure . Knock yourself out . But the power of the thing is far more likely to lie in the connections and the commitment than in the lavishness of the spectacle . Building social capital trumps burning economic capital . Prioritize your social network , not the duck canapTs . <p> i We wrote a couple follow-up pieces on those subjects for those interested more in what social scientists argue about , here and here . The latter piece discussed particularly challenging issues about how social scientists approach and interpret their analyses . 
@@89588884 @5088884/ <p> My phone vibrated with the text from Savannah , a woman in her mid-20s , who wrote : <p> I have three more months of pregnancy and have nowhere to live or to go . Its embarrassing for me to know Im going through this especially being pregnant . Ive been staying place to place at friends houses . I was with the father of my child and a lot happened that 's not safe for me to be in . I have insurance , baby doctor everything but a home with a stable environment . <p> A recent documentary from FRONTLINE and NPR investigating the affordable housing crisis makes it clear that Savannah is not alone . According to an analysis by the National Low Income Housing Coalition in 2015 , there were only 35 rental homes for every 100 households at the lowest income level . Since 2007 , the number of households that spend more than half of their income on rent has grown roughly 25 percent . <p> Savannahs phrase " everything but a home with a stable environment " struck me : not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an environment where her baby can grow up , a place in which she can envision a future . That 's something that the couches of friends and constant shuffling do not provide . <p> Its easy for me to hear the phrase " homeless " and think of bearded men asleep in subway cars . And it is obvious that being without a home is a deprivation of needed shelter and protection from the elements . But what I had not reflected on until recently was the way in which people are affected when they are not technically on the streets , and yet have no stable place to go . <p> In an era of family fragmentation , the young adults my husband and I interviewed sometimes told us stories of being kicked out of the house by stepparents , or , if not technically kicked out , of moving in with friends to escape drama at home . Mike , a barista who was living out of his van , told us that he had " never had a good mother figure " and his " horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a young adult . Instead , he drove to Colorado to live with his aunt , but Mike found that she " was n't as nurturing or loving " as he had hoped . He then fell in love with another barista and moved in with her . " I kind of crashed at her place for little awhile before she kicked me out , " he explained . Next , he found a room to rent in a large communal house , but he was struggling to keep up with child support payments and eventually took to the road again in his van . " Just instability all over the place , " he said . Because of that instability , Mike said he felt he had no choice but to allow his ex-wifes new husband to adopt their son . Of his son he said , " he needed regularity , and he was n't getting that coming over to my house . " It was a painful decision , made , in part , because Mike felt he had no proper home to help raise a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from couch to couch , and young adults who moved in together or got married and took in additional renters to help pay the billsand sometimes life with these new renters caused tension in the marriage or relationship . We met a young family living in a grandparents unfinished garage , and a family living in a hotel room . <p> Meanwhile , a handful of abandoned homeslegacies of foreclosure and the occasional meth labsit vacant in our town . Its something that puzzles the young adults we talked withthere are houses available , so why is there nothing available for them ? <p> Few of these young adults we interviewed had the experience of ever being homeless in the sense of being on the streets . Instead , they were homeless in the same sense that Savannah is : forced to rely on the hospitality of friends and family , and moving from place to place whenever they wear out their welcome . But this kind of living situation is difficult , particularly for young families . They may have literal shelter , but a home environment is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound social , emotional , psychological , even spiritual , effects for people searching for places to live out their family lives . <p> Ive been thinking about this because my own family recently found ourselves away from home for almost three weeks . During that time , my husband and I and our three young children went from a hotel in Washington D.C. to my in-laws house in Pennsylvania to a friends house in Ohio , and then finally to the home of an acquaintance from church . Financial insecurity did not incite these movementswe went to D.C. for work and a day of vacation , and then stayed with friends because our house was getting some major lead remediation work doneso I was surprised by how stressful the time was and how it seemed to affect our children . Not only sleep schedules , but other daily habits and routines changed , and our three-year-old , who loves order and relies on predictability , struggled . There were tantrums and tears that I knew in my gut were the result of the strangeness for him of not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little ones behavior changed so much in just three weeks of transitions , how much more might children be affected when their families have no place to call home , no " stable environment " like Savannah was searching for ? I also felt myself struggling emotionally , wondering if my moods and exhaustion were depression or simply the result of my circumstances . Our trips were fun and meaningful , and our friends were lovely hosts full of refreshing hospitality , yet I still longed to be settled . <p> I describe my recent experience not to even remotely suggest that it is similar to the struggles facing the millions of Americans who are looking for affordable housing , but to wonder aloud at the way people can face such turmoil in their home environment ( or lack thereof ) and still function at work and school and in their relationships . Many have critiqued the modern age as an age of rootlessness in the metaphysical sense of the term . But I am also struck by how many among us , even here in America , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the comfort of a predictable environment . I wonder how the two kinds of drifting might be relateddoes lack of physical home feed a sense of spiritual dislocation ? Is it more difficult to plan for the future or discern purpose and meaning when the immediate environment is choppy and changing ? <p> The Millennials I know , who might be considered " severely cost-burdened " when it comes to rent , sometimes emphasize that a home is not measured by its size or grandeur . As I discussed at the recent Catholic Womens Forum on poverty , expectations for housing are remarkably simple . One single mother told me that even if she won a million dollars she would just buy " just a little ranch , nothin like crazy . " Others dream of owning a trailer and parking it on a plot of land in the country . In light of this , recent experiments with tiny home villages for the homeless are an intriguing , if insufficient , response to the affordable housing crisis . <p> In its deepest sense , the housing crisis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stabilityexternally and internallythat comes from having some place to call home . <p> Amber Lapp is a research fellow at the Institute for Family Studies , an Affiliate Scholar at the Institute for American Values , and co-investigator of the Love and Marriage in Middle America Project . 
@@89588885 @5088885/ <p> Thank goodness for September : August is one of the two months of the year in which couples are most likely to get divorced . Indeed , we hear much about divorce rates and high-profile divorce battles over money , but much less about other financial aspects of divorce , such as the impact on inheritance . But that impact could be significant . Baby Boomers anticipate inheriting $6 trillion , and they may be passing on as much as $30 trillion to their children . And , the divorce rates continue to be high , perhaps as high as 50 percent , so parents need to consider what happens to their money when their children get divorced . <p> A recent court case caught our attention , and well provide a slightly modified version of the case here ( the names have been changed for privacy ) . Soon after " Charles " and " Dena " married , Charles father , " Frank " set up a trust to benefit his " issue , " that is , his " lawful blood descendants . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , maintenance , welfare and education " of the recipients . During a little more than two years of their more than 10-year marriage , Charles received $800,000 from the trust , money that " augmented " his familys " upper middle-class lifestyle . " Once Charles filed for divorce , he received no more money from the trust because " the trustees deemed it too risky to distribute funds to Charles at a time when he might be required to share the funds with Dena , a nonbeneficiary . " As part of the divorce , the courts had to decide whether Dena had any legal rights to Charles interest in the trust . The trial court judge valued Charles interest in the trust at more than $2 million , included it as part of the marital property to be divided , and awarded Dena with 60 percent of that amount . After several appeals , the Massachusetts Supreme Court determined that Charles interest in the trust was not " sufficiently certain " to be treated as marital property . <p> As we discussed this case , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter-in-law ? " Given the way the trust is set up , and in light of how the trustees acted after Charles filed for divorce , we suspect it may have been . However , the initial trial court judge interpreted the details of the trust in favor of the ex-daughter-in-law . Ultimately , elements of the case highlight key lessons for modern families as they broach the wealth transfer and estate planning process , especially when a descendent divorces . <p> Understand the Underlying Principles of Inheritance Laws <p> Formal estate planning can include drafting a will , creating a trust , and/or drafting various types of powers of attorney for health care or financial decision-making . Depending on state law , a will may need to be witnessed or notarized in order to be legally binding . And , laypeople may not fully understand how a trust works . For example , once someone has set up a trust , it is the terms of the trust that control . So , using our above example , even though he set up the trust , Frank was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to comply with state law concerning changing the terms of the trust , and that might involve going to court . So , even if Frank intended that his former daughter-in-law would benefit in some way from the trust , the terms of the trust take precedence . <p> In the absence of planning , default inheritance laws generally follow bloodlines . A core assumption is that individuals want " flesh and blood " ( now including adoption ) to inherit , so spouses and stepchildren are out , but biological or adopted children and descendants are in . So , inheritance descends down the line ( in the absence of a will ) and across , to the decedent 's spousebut not to an ex-spouse nor to the descendants ' spouses . According to current default rules , excluding Dena , an ex-spouse of a descendant , follows logically . However , these default inheritance laws may not reflect the values or needs of modern families . <p> Modern Views of the Family Challenge Those Underlying Principles <p> In their work surveying societys perceptions regarding inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sociologists Lawrence Ganong and Marilyn Coleman observed that some social scientists believe that " intimacy and sentimentality are the major cohesive factors " in families today . Thus , for many families , divorce might not necessarily dissolve kin ties if relationships are emotionally or interpersonally satisfying to the participants . Even after a divorce , ex-family members might still feel ongoing obligations of inheritance or care . Indeed , when Ganong and Coleman asked whether a former daughter-in-law should be included in a will after a divorce , they found that one-quarter believed the former daughter-in-law should be included , especially if she remained in contact with her former father-in-law , while his son did not . They believed that " emotional closeness , " regardless of genetic ties , meant she was still a family member . " The vast majority of respondents ( 75 percent ) believed that the son should inherit , although they were even more likely to include him when he remained close to his father . Bloodlines trump quality of relationship for biological kin . However , for family members added by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the quality of relationship to the elder . <p> We do n't  know about the quality of the relationship between Frank and his daughter-in-law . When Frank set up the trust , it would have been easy to include Dena . Like many parents and grandparents , however , he may well have set up the trust to exclude her because he wanted to benefit his descendantsbut then again , he may not have anticipated a divorce . <p> Communicating Intentions to Include OR Exclude <p> A trust or will provides a relatively straightforward way to transfer wealth to the people we wish . An individual can plan to exclude or to include in-laws or step-relatives or ex-step-relatives when developing an estate plan . At that initial point , it is important to consider carefully what choices to make ; and , if someone in the family gets divorced , for example , then it is worth revisiting any planning documents . <p> In todays modern families , affective ties may be stronger than blood . The underlying rules of inheritance law may not follow the intent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child will benefit from the estate . Divorce reinforces that the spouse is not blood kin . If a parent values an in-law ( or ex-in-law ) , monetizing that honor must be intentionally planned . As more and more people divorce , the affective connections between grown children and their in-laws may be strong , and even include a caregiving situation . We should be mindful of protecting the financial interests of all those we consider family , with or without divorce. * <p> *Disclaimer : This post is for general informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice .

Its not just that we all prefer everyday pleasantries to complaints and chore assignments ; its also because the moments of mutual connection protect marriages from the negative interactions we all confront from time to time . <p> The latest piece of evidence for this theory comes from a report by University of Texas at Austin researchers Courtney Walsh , Lisa Neff , and Marci Gleason . Published in the Journal of Family Psychology , the study examined the links between recently married couples shared positive experiences , negative behaviors , and marital satisfaction . The 171 participating couples recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been married less than six months , and had no children at the time the study began .

Your spouses occasional impatience and criticism hurt your day-to-day marital happiness less if the two of you have emotional reserves to fall back on . <p> The key word in that last sentence is " occasional . " According to other scholars , pleasant interactions vastly outnumber negative ones in successful marriages . Renowned relationship researcher John Gottman , who has observed hundreds of couples as they converse and spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable marriage is five to one . " As long as there is five times as much positive feeling and interaction between husband and wife as there is negative , " he wrote in Why Marriages Succeed or Fail , " we found the marriage was likely to be stable . " ( Walsh , Neff , and Gleason did not focus on this question , but they reported that their findings imply that negative experiences weigh more than positive ones in individuals assessments of their relationships . ) <p> So what does the abstraction of emotional capital look like in real life ? When they discuss " emotional capital " and " positive interactions , " scholars have in mind simple things like spouses enjoying a leisure activity together , complimenting and expressing appreciation for each other , laughing together , and responding generously to each others " bids " for conversation and connection . ( Brett and Kate McKay recently suggested even more ideas at The Art of Manliness . ) In the metaphor of Gottman and others , positive shared experiences such as these are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broken promises , conflicts that turn nastyare like withdrawals . Without frequent deposits of emotional capital , withdrawals will leave your relationship bankrupt . <p> Unlike an earlier study , this one did not find a link between emotional capital on one day and reactivity to negative spousal behavior on the next . Here it was only chronic emotional capital , measured as the average daily capital in a 14-day survey phase , that mattered . The study results remained significant when general marital satisfaction was controlled for . Walsh , Neff , and Gleason recommend that future research investigate other factors that could influence the links they found , such as individuals personality traits and attachment style , and test whether their findings hold not just for happy newlyweds but also , say , couples confronting serious problems in their marriages . In the meantime , as unromantic as the bank account metaphor may sound , most of us could surely use the reminder that devoting energy to the little moments in marriage pays off in the long run .

On the other , women like myself who denounce the killing of human beings and an industry regularly indifferent to womens suffering and their right to fully informed consent . <p> Yet an honest assessment of the situation of women most likely to have an abortion today easily reveals that there 's more to it . The Guttmacher Institute reports that 86 percent of abortions are performed on single women . Three-fourths of all abortions are performed on women living at or below the poverty line .

" Furthermore , poor women complained to Edin and Kefalas about the side effects caused by the Pill , patch , or other methods . <p> Additionally , once the relationship with their childs father moves to a perceived higher level of intimacy and trust , they abandon contraception or use it less consistently . " As a new romance deepens , young women who are not exactly planning to have children may nonetheless begin to look for signs of their partners willingness to do the right thing if they were to wind up pregnant , " Edin and Kefalas report . The significance of a man saying he wants to have a baby with a woman is huge : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone knows that a young man who proclaims his desire to have a baby by a young woman is offering high tribute to her beauty , for this avowal expresses a desire for a child that will have her eyes and her smile .

The fathers then wield tremendous influence in the future of the pregnancy . " For their part , women believe that the response to a pregnancy is the measure of a man , and hope the crisis will force their partners to move toward maturity , " Edin and Kefalas explain . But a pregnancy premature to a lasting commitment rarely forges the intimacy women desire . <p> " Many men do not cope with the stress of a pregnancy well , " Edin and Kefalas write , " What seemed like an enchanting possibility in private moments of courtship can become a terrifying responsibility in the harsh light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father that introduces abortion . <p> " Get an abortionIf you do n't  get an abortion , we are n't  going to be together , " one father said to his pregnant girlfriend .

" For these women , " choosing to end a pregnancy is thus like abandoning hope . " <p> A child offers something young women in these communities need and lack " love and intimacy . " As one mother explained , " I think I got pregnant mainly because I wanted to be loved . I went through childhood without it .

" another mother explained ( emphasis in original ) . <p> In fact , they repeatedly heard mothers say things like " my child saved me , " or " its only because of my children that I 'm where I am today . " According to Edin and Kefalas , " women in these communities believed their children were what finally set them on the right track . " <p> Pro-life pregnancy centers and pro-life religious charities are already helping poor womenmarried and singlechoose life for their kids and themselves , and to not force women to abandon hope . But we must go further . <p> Data from scholars on both sides of the political sphere assert that children born in single-parent homes are more like to suffer physically , emotionally , educationally , and economically than their peers born to their married mom and dad . <p> " The poor avoid marriage , " Edin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of it , but because they revere it . " To them , divorce strips marriage of its meaning . As one woman told them , " I 'm not going to make any promises I cant keep . " <p> Like their more advantaged sisters , poorer women want and deserve stable , romantic , and nonviolent partnerships , married parenthood , and a decent chance for their kids to escape single parenting , low education , and the cycle of poverty . In the end , freedom and equality are the right words to describe what women want , but its a different sort of freedom than either abortion or nonmarital pregnancy promises . As we face an administration promising to support significant pro-life legislative gains , and promising to support forgotten Americans , both sides need to think long and hard about what they can do privately , alongside the government , to realize less advantaged womens overarching hopes for marriage and children as a package deal . <p> Meg T.

U.S. children born to cohabiting parents are twice as likely to see their parents relationship end compared to children born to married parents : <p> Our new report from the Social Trends Institute and the Institute for Family Studies , The Cohabitation-Go-Round : Cohabitation and Family Instability Across the Globe , shows that the " stability premium " associated with marriage holds even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers will break up with their partner before their child turns 12 , compared to less than one-fifth of mothers who were married when the child was born . <p> Even in Europe <p> The marriage-stability connection is pretty clear in the U.S. But there is a prevailing view that the story is different in Europe . Indeed , Cherlins own work on family instability suggests that cohabitation and marriage are functional equivalents in Scandinavia and France , where he suggests there " are many long-term cohabiting parents who maintain families that are little different from lasting marriages . " <p> But it turns out that even in Europe , cohabitation is markedly less stable for children than marriage . Analyzing data from 16 countries across Europe , we find that children born to cohabiting couples are about 90 percent more likely to see their parents break up by the time they turn 12 , compared to children born to married parents . <p> In France , for instance , children are about 66 percent more likely to see their parents break up if they are born to a cohabiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated couples :

Thus , the question about how religious institutions can help strengthen marriage and families must address how religious leaders can engage young people who are not likely to be in the pews . We have four ideas . <p> 1 . Acknowledge the suffering that many young adults have experienced in their families of origin . <p> Fifty-three percent of adults aged 25 to 44 without a high school education , and 43 percent of adults with a high school education but no four-year college degree say , " Marriage has not worked out for most people I know . " This contrasts to only 17 percent of college-educated adults . Their experiences of family fragmentation , whether witnessed directly or indirectly , are formative and defining . For instance , one young man who never met his father described his struggle to trust people and to trust that marriage that could last . Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Of course that 's gon na make me grow up and feel like I cant trust nobody ... He turned his back on me . " <p> Because of family fragmentation , many young adults carry wounds from their childhood into adulthood , as documented by researchers such as Judith Wallerstein and Elizabeth Marquardt . In response , religious leaders could create safe spaces for young adults from fragmented families to share their stories . In that encounter , religious leaders could also share their own traditions theologies of suffering that might lend meaning and hope to young adults struggling to make sense of difficult family histories . Existing retreat experiences like Christ Renews His Parish , which gives a team of congregants the opportunity to share their life stories with each other , offer potential models . <p> 2 .

Look for the assets that adult children of family fragmentation have . <p> It is true that children of family fragmentation are at greater risk of a host of problems , but it also true that their experiences sharpen their resolve to give their own children the family stability that they did not experience in their own families . As the young man quoted above put it , " Thats one good thing I can say that came out of me not having a father : That makes me a better father , because I know how it feels to not have a dad .

Propose a better story about love and sex and marriage . <p> For divorce-wary young adults who wonder how to make love last , a religious leader could invite a couple celebrating their golden anniversary to share their story .

Its not just that we all prefer everyday pleasantries to complaints and chore assignments ; its also because the moments of mutual connection protect marriages from the negative interactions we all confront from time to time . <p> The latest piece of evidence for this theory comes from a report by University of Texas at Austin researchers Courtney Walsh , Lisa Neff , and Marci Gleason .

Your spouses occasional impatience and criticism hurt your day-to-day marital happiness less if the two of you have emotional reserves to fall back on . <p> The key word in that last sentence is " occasional . " According to other scholars , pleasant interactions vastly outnumber negative ones in successful marriages . Renowned relationship researcher John Gottman , who has observed hundreds of couples as they converse and spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable marriage is five to one . " As long as there is five times as much positive feeling and interaction between husband and wife as there is negative , " he wrote in Why Marriages Succeed or Fail , " we found the marriage was likely to be stable . " ( Walsh , Neff , and Gleason did not focus on this question , but they reported that their findings imply that negative experiences weigh more than positive ones in individuals assessments of their relationships . ) <p> So what does the abstraction of emotional capital look like in real life ? When they discuss " emotional capital " and " positive interactions , " scholars have in mind simple things like spouses enjoying a leisure activity together , complimenting and expressing appreciation for each other , laughing together , and responding generously to each others " bids " for conversation and connection . ( Brett and Kate McKay recently suggested even more ideas at The Art of Manliness . ) In the metaphor of Gottman and others , positive shared experiences such as these are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broken promises , conflicts that turn nastyare like withdrawals . Without frequent deposits of emotional capital , withdrawals will leave your relationship bankrupt . <p> Unlike an earlier study , this one did not find a link between emotional capital on one day and reactivity to negative spousal behavior on the next . Here it was only chronic emotional capital , measured as the average daily capital in a 14-day survey phase , that mattered . The study results remained significant when general marital satisfaction was controlled for . Walsh , Neff , and Gleason recommend that future research investigate other factors that could influence the links they found , such as individuals personality traits and attachment style , and test whether their findings hold not just for happy newlyweds but also , say , couples confronting serious problems in their marriages . In the meantime , as unromantic as the bank account metaphor may sound , most of us could surely use the reminder that devoting energy to the little moments in marriage pays off in the long run .

The average age for a college-educated woman to have her first child today is 30 . At my obstetrical practice , at the hospital where I had my baby , and at my pediatricians office , I was the youngest mother they had ever seen . In their careers . Admittedly , I live in a city where women are highly educated and career-driven , and thus delaying childbearing well into ones thirties is the norm , but even so , times have changed . <p> Though most can see the trend of delayed childbearing illustrated in their own family trees , the overall numbers remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first children born to mothers older than 35 has jumped from 1 percent to 15 .

Women who wait a bit to have children are more likely to make more money , and less likely to get divorced or to have had a child out of wedlock . But I wonder if there is a drawback that many are n't  talking about : With two generations of women now delaying children by a decade or more than previous generations , are babies being born today less likely to know their grandparents and develop relationships with them , especially before they enter their years of decline ? <p> I thought the answer would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing in the opposite direction : increasing life spans have actually made it more likely that children will know not only their grandparents , but their great-grandparents as well .

( Of course , many other factors , such as geographic distance , will affect the relationship of future children to their grandparents , but age is one important factor of increasing salience . ) Having seen my grandparents move from their active years through old age , immobility , memory loss , and even death , I can attest that the relationship children have with their grandparents is entirely different when the grandparents are in their sixties as opposed to their eighties .

This is yet another factor I think about constantly . Most women I know who have careers and children are only able to combine the two because they receive help from their own mothers . One friends mother was the primary caregiver for my friends son from the time her maternity leave ended until his first birthday . Another friend was only able to do a Supreme Court clerkship with a newborn because the two sets of grandparents took turns acting as full-time caregivers .

That makes the first woman nearly 70 when she becomes a grandmother , when it is typically far more of a strain to help with a newborn than it is at age 55 .

The decision to embrace marriage can change those who make the decision and leave them more determined to stay together . <p> Deciding to get married is a different and more reflective process than a slide into cohabitation .

It is harder , however , to judge the legal right to assets in situations when couples have been together for only a short period and the date at which their cohabitation began is unknown or disputed . Moreover , some worry that it is illiberal to impose rights and responsibilities on a couple who may deliberately have never chosen to formalise their relationship . <p> A marriage certificate remains the best legal protection for both members of a relationship and marriage loses its unique importance in a society if its advantages and protections become available to anyone .

The definition for what makes an established adult is more radically up for grabs . In the odyssey period now accepted as " emerging adulthood , " there is an untethered volatility behind the resume-building and Facebook cheer . Recent studies show that while loneliness as classically defined may be declining just slightly , what psychologists call " social network isolation " is on the rise given prompts like " There is always someone I can turn to if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . " More and more emerging adults feel like they do n't  have a web of relationships they can rely on in extended periods of hardship or uncertainty . <p> In the midst of this morphing landscape , the nuclear family stands as one of the few familiar mainstays of support . The problem is , there just are n't  other sorts of healthy , adaptable institutions undergirding and surrounding the family . Growing research around relations between parents and their adult children only hammers this reality home . According to the 2013 Clark University Poll , three-quarters of todays emerging adults receive financial support from their parents . More young people are looking to their parents for advice : 67 percent of mothers say they have daily contact with their young adult child , as opposed to the 50 percent of parents in 1986 who reported speaking to their grown child once a week .

" In thinking about the familys nature and role through Dunkelmans three-ring theory , it does seem like the adult family is perfectly teed up to take residence on the middle ring . But when the ring itself is eroded , when we do n't  recognize our need for it , and when the family becomes the only institution operating between inner- and outer-ring ties , stresses develop . Its simply not designed to carry the whole net . Were now seeing a generation of twenty- and thirty-somethings and their parents struggle to live out their adult relationships in a manner that leads to mutual flourishing and freedom , and very few other middle-ring institutions are there to help pave the road . <p> The recent research on this emerging adult life phase revolves around the challenge of its longevity : What are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than previous generations ? But I wonder if the inquiry could be more productive if it focused instead on identifying , reforming , and creating anew those institutions that could satisfy our middle-ring needs , institutions that could offset the weight many families are carrying . What if we accepted that a decade or more of " emerging adulthood " is likely a permanent reality ? Then we could commit ourselves to building more communities offline that are oriented around 50 to 150 cross-pollinating friendships and a central idea , be it the needs of a real place , the building together of a lifelong set of skills , the contextual exploration of a worldview , a cause that is more than the sum of its parts . If both public and private leaders made an effort to encourage investment in the experimenting and building of these more holistic " colonies " for young adults , the family may be surprised at the middle ring air its suddenly able and quite willing to breathe .

@@89588933 @5088933/ <p> Theres been lots of discussion about inequality in recent years , but the favored analyses ( e.g. Thomas Pikettys Capital in the Twenty-First Century ) maintain a narrow focus on economics . They usually shy away from a trend that likely means that inequality will continue to worsen : family lifestyles are becoming more diverse . <p> On one end of the spectrum , there is a high-intensity , success-oriented culture in which parents work hard and pay close attention to childrens academic prowess . This sector of society has become increasingly competitive , forming pockets that cluster in suburbs and around high-quality schools . <p> On the other end , scattered throughout the country , but especially in the inner city , scattered rural areas , and on Indian reservations , there are concentrations of families ( often single-parent ) who work part-time or not at all , in low-paying jobs , beset by high debt and tempted by opioids . Their children struggle in school and suffer poor health , and compared to their upper-income peers , they spend more time with diversions such as watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . These differences have lasting effects on childrens performance at school and , eventually , in the labor market . <p> The troubling aspect of this situation is that both of these groups are getting larger , and problems arise in both situations . Others have written in detail about this division , most famously political scientists Robert Putnam and Charles Murray . Both are very insightful , but both also have weaknesses . In Our Kids : The American Dream in Crisis , Putnam plays down the role of cultural and lifestyle changes in rising inequality in favor of economic changes . Murray , in Coming Apart : The State of White America , 1960-2010 , is better on the cultural issues , but neglects how a consumer-oriented capitalist society can erode the work ethic of some , make work an obsession for others , and also hurt civic behavior ( which Putnam talked about more in his earlier book Bowling Alone ) . <p> Examining Americans diverse lifestyles and how they are changing will be crucial to understanding issues such as inequality . To do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually inequality scholars focus single-mindedly on the former , and leave out the latter , thus missing at least half of the story , which I will attempt to tell briefly here . <p> Examining Americans diverse lifestyles will be crucial to understanding issues such as inequality . <p> Consumer options exploded over the course of the twentieth century , as the electronic and entertainment revolutions presented people from all walks of life with an array of new ways to spend their money and time . Television , for instance , stimulated the strongest shift in time use over the past century . <p> Low-income groups spend more time consuming media in general ( TV , video games , music , social media , etc. ) than other groups . Because of this , sometimes attempts to address inequalities backfire , as when providing lower-income families with computers actually hurt childrens test scores , since they became a distraction used most often for gaming , according to recent research . Likewise , I fear the oncoming diffusion of virtual reality technology because for many it will simply provide a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously , these technological innovations offer benefits , from health to jobs to personal enrichment , but they also provide easy and tempting access to online gambling , time-eating gaming , and other potential addictions such as porn . <p> Similarly , new consumer options in the world of finance , such as payday loans and easy mortgages , can lead lower-income people in particular into bigger financial holes or foreclosures . Interventions such as new consumer finance laws and regulations have helped address these problems ; however , people also need personal help in dealing with the complexity of the financial system and in building adequate savings . Americans struggle to build wealth for retirement not only because of economic changes , but also because the cultural and consuming environments lend themselves to excess . They continually test good saving and spending habits ; resisting them takes a high level of self-control . <p> Turning from consumption to production , the work lifestyles of Americans have also diverged . More career options are available overall , but there are fewer well-paid blue-collar jobs , which has contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cant just look at jobs from a macro perspective . We also need to understand the lives of people , many of whom find it hard to adjust to an increasingly complex work world that requires not just more technical skills , but better soft skills such as a particular interactive or communicative manner or habits of emotional control and flexibility . Employers trying to fill well-paying trade jobs go begging , partly because these positions often require clean driving and criminal records . Perhaps as a result of such factors , rather than committing themselves to unfulfilling full-time jobs , some Americans pursue other ideals , such as " leisure careers " ( e.g. hobbies or sports ) , or the excitement of " edgework , " or stick with part-time or flexible temp work ( such as Uber driving ) . <p> The trend toward lifestyle diversity will only get more intense . <p> At the same time that some Americans spend most of their time on various leisure and consumption activities , others become " occupational devotees , " wedded to their jobs and careers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same typically well-educated , high-income adults may intensively focus on their kids success . They sign the kids up for enrichment activities , get them into the right schools , and overall put their kids under a great deal of pressure to succeed ( think " Tiger Moms " ) . <p> All of this hard work and success , however , comes with a cost . A raft of reports describe stressed-out kids , tempted to cheat , taking medication , and dealing with depression , angst , and insomnia as they juggle advanced-placement classes and cram in extracurriculars to get into the college of their choice . In suburban areas from Boston and DC to Chicago and San Francisco , stress leading to suicide clusters has shocked parents and school officials ; many are pushing schools to scale back on the homework and urging parents to rein in the pressure they put on kids . <p> The trend toward lifestyle diversity will only get more intense as technology and individualism increasingly give us the ability to go off in different directions ( and , generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are devoted to their careers and accumulating wealth , with others focusing more on families , leisure , traveling , or other pursuits . This is not always bad , of course , as when " downshifters " give up on stressful high-octane careers to live more simply and focus more on family or charitable activities . Still others have few options , being stuck in poverty with few prospects to get out . <p> Political and economic forces get the bulk of attention from scholars and commentators , but for those hoping to reduce inequality , the bigger challenge will come from lifestyle changes that can not be controlled easily by public policy . <p> Michael Jindra is an anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame and is writing a book on the relationship between diversity and inequality .

" New York mayor Bill de Blasio has taken a beating in the polls over perceived failings in his approach to homelessness . <p> There 's little debate among progressives about what the solution should be : more government-subsidized housing . But to what extent is homelessness purely a housing problem ? A close analysis of New York Citys homelessness challenge shows that norms and family structure , not just economic pressures , shape the nature of the problem . <p> To begin with , city data plainly show that single-parent families are the largest driver of homelessness in New York . When most New Yorkers think of the homeless , they have in mind the desperate and/or disturbed man they pass by each day on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of families living in the shelter system maintained by the citys Department of Homeless Services far surpass the number of single adults on the streets and in the shelters . Of the roughly 58,000 New Yorkers now living in a shelter , nearly 40,000 are members of families with children over 90 percent of which are headed by women . The rest of the shelter census is composed of nearly 5,000 members of " adult families " ( couples without children ) and almost 13,000 are single adults . The official count of unsheltered or street homeless is fewer than 3,000 . Children growing up with the benefit of two parents are extremely unlikely to wind up homeless in New York . <p> Poverty and substandard living conditions have been constants throughout New Yorks history . But the homelessness crisis is unique to modern times , as is the rise of the single-parent family . A very different sort of norms prevailed in the past , as explained in the following passage about family life among poor Jews in the South Bronx in the first part of the 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was much marrying in haste after quick courtships , and repenting at leisure as husbands and wives discovered their many differences , always exacerbated by trying to raise a family with never quite enough money . And yet , no matter how bitterly the couples might quarrel , or however leaden the silences between them , they persevered in their marriages . There was no possibility of separation , much less divorce . It was not socially acceptable . Think of the children , think of the shameIn the Jewish culture , the family was too cherished to be easily cast aside . <p> Like many immigrant cohorts before them , New Yorks Asian population is proving the value of a resilient family structure in overcoming economic disadvantages . As the graph below shows , citywide , 78 percent of Asian families citywide are married couple families , compared with nearly 38 percent of black families . Asian single-mother-headed families are almost as likely as single-mother-headed black families to live in poverty in New York ( 24.1 v. 28.7 percent ) , but there are far fewer of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , Asians official poverty rate ( 20.3 percent ) is well below that of Hispanics ( 28.9 percent ) but fairly close to that of blacks ( 23.2 percent ) . The Citys annual " CEO Poverty Report , " which uses an alternative measure than the Census , finds that Asians have the highest poverty rate among all groups ( see Figure 7 in the report ) . In absolute numbers , there are approximately twice as many poor black families as poor Asian families . But , as the table below shows , there are 90 times as many black families with children in the shelter system as there are Asian families with children . <p> Asians low rate of homelessness in New York is especially striking considering the cramped quarters many of them endure . " Doubling up " is often thought of as the penultimate stage to homelessness . Data from New Yorks Housing and Vacancy Survey show that the " severe crowding " rate among Asian renter households is three times that of black households ( see Table 7.51 of the report ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office found that the neighborhoods that contributed the most entrants to the shelter system in recent years were mostly black neighborhoods in the South Bronx and Brooklyn . Predominantly Asian communities in Queens and elsewhere did not even rank . <p> As Asians have maintained a certain resistance to declaring themselves homeless and entering a shelter , my colleague Howard Husock has speculated that , over time , norms have shifted in other poor minority communities . In his forthcoming Homelessness in New York City , Baruch Colleges Thomas Main quotes a former de Blasio administration official who notes with satisfaction that the current policy of granting preferences for public housing units to homeless families has not led to any discontent among existing residents . When Mayor David Dinkins adopted a similar policy in the early 1990s , public housing residents protested over seeing their relatives on waiting lists passed over by the homeless . The former de Blasio official believes that the situation is different now because " at the end of the day , in poor families , homelessness is not such an unknown phenomenon . Your cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you have been homeless at some point . The recognition is that homeless people are just like us , one paycheck away . " <p> This normalization of homelessness in New York is no doubt related to the citys granting a special " right to shelter " and is viewed as an entirely welcome development by many advocates . For now , the point is simply that norms matter and norms change in reaction to official government policy . New York politicians by and large do n't  want to hear about this . When Mayor de Blasios predecessor Michael Bloomberg launched a public awareness campaign aimed at explaining the enormous benefits of getting married before having children , it was denounced as " shaming already struggling teen parents . " <p> Certainly , there is not enough low-rent housing for poor New Yorkers . But expensive rental markets push a subsidized housing solution to the homeless problem beyond the reach of government budgets just as surely as they force many families into homelessness to begin with .

@@89588963 @5088963/ <p> As baby boomers continue to retire from the workforce over the next decade , there will be fewer workers to support children and the elderly , and many fear that economic growth will lag as a result . But the authors of a recent article in Demography , the flagship journal of the Population Association of America , would have us relax : dependency ratios , they argue , have little to do with economic growth . <p> This is surprising because most of us intuitively know that these ratios matter . My husband is the only child of his mother , so none of the costs of her support can be shared with siblings . Plus our three-year-old daughter would be in Montessori school if she did n't  have a younger sister : we could invest in her education now if we did n't  still need a babysitter in order to work . It does n't  take much imagination to abstract family issues up to the societal level in a country where Medicaid will pay for nursing care for destitute elderly and where all kids over age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it makes sense that a lot of dependents could necessitate a lot of expenditures , and that the number of dependents per paychecknot simply the number of dependentswould be crucial . Theories about the " demographic dividend " build on this idea : When less is spent on dependents , more can be invested ( in physical and human capital ) to contribute to future growth , meaning a favorable age structure boosts economic development . <p> But coauthors Jesus Crespo Cuaresma , Wolfgang Lutz , and Warren Sanderson challenge us to think not just about the dependency ratio , but also about the role of education in determining both the dependency ratio and economic growth . Imagine two families , both with independently employed husbands and working wives , but the one family has one child and the other three . The logic of the demographic dividend would predict that the one-child family would have an easier time saving because they would buy less food and fewer shoes , and therefore they could more easily accumulate a surplus to invest in things like advertising for the husbands business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an education dividend . <p> Crespo Cuaresma and his co-authors would re-write this scenario to involve education , too . Let 's say the wife in the one-child family is an investment bankermore educated women both command higher wages and choose lower fertilityand the wife in the three-child family is a daycare worker . Now think about what their jobs mean for investment in their husbands businesses : the families varying expenditures on food and shoes are small compared to the differences in the wives earnings . It is n't that expenditure does n't  matter ; its just that productivity matters more . <p> Thus the authors conclude that what we 've called a demographic dividend is really an education dividend . That is , when education reduces fertility and creates a relatively small young generation , the resulting economic growth is mostly from education itself rather than the favorable age structure . Shifts in the age structure can help and hurt , but relatively little . An educated population has fewer young dependents , and even though they have more elderly dependents , they are productive enough to afford them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major implications for richer countries . First , growth in the proportion of elderly would not create a large drag on economic growth . Second , a drop in U.S. fertility from 1.9 children per woman ( its current rate ) to Europes level of 1.6 children per woman , which would reduce the number of young dependents , would provide only a moderate boost to the economy . Similarly , the fact that Europes fertility is unlikely to fall further does not portend economic difficultiesand neither would a rebound in European fertility . <p> The role played by favorable age structures in helping foster education and launch growth remains untested . <p> But Cuaresma , Lutz , and Sanderson based their investigation on a test for the importance of a demographic dividend in a sample of 105 heterogeneous countries , whereas the theory was developed to explain how the departure from high fertility ( 68 children per woman ) could provide a one-time boost to economic development . Improvements in infant and child mortality ( e.g. , childhood deaths dropping from 200 to 100 per 1000 births ) created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographic overhead " presented an obstacle to further economic development . Fertility decline had the opposite effect , creating a relatively small young-age population and with it fewer maintenance requirements and more opportunity to invest in human or physical capital : the demographic dividend . These changes take place in the initial transition from high to low fertility ; we would not have expected the relatively small changes in fertility that characterize todays wealthy countries to have effects of large magnitude . <p> Extending the concept of a demographic dividend to favorable age structures more generally does not answer the question of whether the demographic dividend helps countries escape the poverty trap . Even the authors finding that past education levels and current improvements in education both promote growth avoids the question of what helped produce the past education levels . Nobody would argue against the importance of investing in education for economic growth , but the role played by favorable age structures in helping foster education and launch growth remains untested . <p> Moreover , even if we accept the authors conclusions for the contemporary world , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both favorable age structures and favorable education trends . Put simply , below-replacement fertility is associated with the retreat from marriage , and children from intact families have better educational outcomes . Stable marriage can help keep fertility close to the replacement rate , which makes old-age support easier , while simultaneously making educational progress easier . Even if education contributes far more to economic growth than a favorable age structure does , both means can be pursued together .

Chris forgave her , and even invited the man with whom she was having sex to church with them . <p> But a few years later , Laura started cheating on Chris again , with the same man . This time , though , she hid her affair from him , and it was n't until much later that she revealed it to him . Even before she confessed , though , Chris and Laura both started coming to the same realization : they werent happy together .

And I would step aside . I would n't try to stop that from happening . Because I do n't  believe in staying with somebody if they 're making you miserable .

" And I wouldve told my wife right off the bat what was going on . " <p> In Chriss view , Scripture says that God is " not a huge fan of divorce , " but at the same time , you have to " seek Gods wisdom " as best as you can .

You have to make yourself happy first before you can even attempt to make anybody else happy . " <p> Chriss now ex-wife , Laura , in an interview with my wife and co-interviewer , Amber , expressed the same sentiments . " Everybodys okay with the divorce , " she said , " because we both agree that its not worth staying together when were gon na be miserable and have unhappy kids . I 'd rather have happy kids from a broken home than unhappy kids from a home where parents fight all the time trying to stay together .

They told no one except their immediate families about their impending divorce . Chris was n't interested in seeking counseling , he explains , because he was " tired of trying . " Laura agreed , explaining that " its not worth it to me to waste someone elses time because Im done . Its not gon na make me fall back in love .

You 're hearts full and you 're happy and well , you cant quit smiling and all that mushy stuff . " <p> She added , " I 'm not in love with Chris , but he s still the father of my children and I love him for being the father of my children .

In that story , love is fixed , rather than dynamic : you are in love , and you fall out of love . If you fall out of love , it means that you will be perpetually unhappyand thus make everyone else around you unhappy . It follows that divorce is the most sensible solution . What is missing is a robust moral vocabulary that can help struggling couples through inevitable periods of unhappiness , and enable them to experience the joy and satisfaction that come from persevering at something worthwhile . <p> In his new book , The Road to Character , David Brooks tries to help us recover that moral vocabulary . Through his profiles of people who achieved character through tenacious " self-combat " people like Dorothy Day , Dwight Eisenhower , and George Eliothe urges us to look again at the tradition of " moral realism . " This tradition , he says , emphasizes that we are sinners made of " crooked timber , " capable of great good , but deeply flawed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the inner struggle against ones own weaknesses is the central drama of life . " <p> But with the flowering of " moral romanticism , " he notes , we no longer believe that you achieve the good life through self-combat ; you achieve the good life through " self-liberation and self-expression . " As he says , " Greater emphasis is put on personal feelings as a guide to what is right and wrong . " Its not that people today are more selfish than people in the past , says Brooks , " but we 've lost the understanding of how character is built . " <p> The older tradition of " moral realism " furnishes us with a way of seeing the world that justifies persevering through difficulty for some greater good . In this view of things , Brooks says , people with character " are capable of a long obedience in the same direction , of staying attached to people and causes and callings consistently through thick and thin . " People looking to build character appreciate that " We do n't  live for happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing for moral masochism . The people he profiles have different answers as to whether you should always accept suffering , or move on . Moreover , he notes that the cultural move toward greater self-expression was especially good for women and minorities . But , he argues , in forgetting about moral realism , we are losing our capacity to " travel the long road to character . " <p> Character is not a **39;724;TOOLONG affair . <p> Some people are wary of talking about character out of a concern that it " blames the individual , " and ignores structural forces ( like deindustrialization ) that are mostly outside the control of ordinary people . But that 's a false dichotomy . Character is not a **39;765;TOOLONG affair ; we learn it through " moral structures , " or what Brooks calls a " moral ecology . " As Brooks says , unless your name is Aristotle , you wont be creating your own moral ecology ; its a social achievement . We all learn about the moral ecology somewhere . For instance , when Amber asked Laura how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chick flicks . " Dirty Dancing is my favorite movie of all time , " she said . Just as we have a collective responsibility to steward the physical environment , so we have a collective responsibility to steward the moral ecology . <p> I am , however , sympathetic to the concern that talking about morality can sometimes become a matter of " blaming a class " : insinuating that poor people are less moral than rich people . I suspect , instead , that many of us are better protected from the consequences of our own bad choices by the " air bags " associated with privilege , as Robert Putnam notes in Our Kids . To take one example , if a college student from an affluent family abuses drugs , his parents might pay for him to enter a rehabilitation program ( and hire him a good lawyer ! ) , whereas drug abuse is a fast track to prison or homelessness for the less privileged . <p> Still , we can not ignore morality and character ; whether we like it or not , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , even though his wife had cheated on him , Chris felt the need to examine his own actions before ending his marriage : he says that he came to peace with divorce after praying earnestly to God , and looking at himself in the mirror and asking if he had done everything he could to save his marriage . Moreover , Laura told Amber that , in retrospect , nothing justified her affair . <p> Chris eventually married again , to a woman with whom he was extremely happy at the time of our last interview . Laura was in a new relationship , but was unsure where it might lead . Its impossible to know if they could have reconciled . But should they ever confront a crisis in their new relationships , they deserve a better rule for discernment than " you got ta go where your heart lies . " 
@@89588970 @5088970/ <p> A new report from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) reveals that support for divorce is declining among Americans , even as we increasingly embrace relationship forms that are less stable than marriage . The report highlights findings from the National Survey of Family Growth ( NSFG ) on 15- to 44-year-old Americans attitudes about marriage , childbearing , and sexual behavior for the years 2002 , 2006-10 , and 2011-13 . <p> Overall , the data reflect increasing approval of recent shifts in family structure away from marriage , especially the rise of premarital cohabitation and unmarried parenthood . But one positive trend is a significant decline in the acceptance of divorce among both men and women . <p> Divorce : According to the NCHS , the percentage of men and women who agree that " Divorce is usually the best solution when a couple ca n't seem to work out their marriage problems " has declined since 2002 . Among women , 46.7 percent agreed with that statement in 2002 , a figure that had fallen to 38.0 percent in 2011-13 . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 44.3 percent in 2002 to 39.3 percent in 2011-13 . <p> Cohabitation : While Americans may be less tolerant of divorce , the NCHS study also found increasing support for cohabitation , which is not a huge surprise since over half of men and women report having cohabited at some point . Specifically , the NSFG data reveal a decrease in the percentage of men and women who agree that , " A young couple should not live together unless they are married . " The percentage of women who agreed with this statement dropped from 34.7 percent in 2002 to 28.0 percent in 20112013 . Among men , it dropped from 32.0 percent to 24.8 percent in the same timeframe . <p> Though it might seem counterintuitive , the increasing acceptance of cohabitation may be related to the decreasing support for divorce . Per the same survey , two-thirds of women and men accept one of the most common myths about cohabitation todaythat living together might help people avoid a divorce . According to the NCHS report , 60 percent of women and 67 percent of men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent divorce , " a similar percentage as in 2006-10 . <p> Unfortunately , the belief that cohabiting is beneficial for marriage does not square with research on cohabitation , marital quality , and divorce . As IFS Senior Fellow Scott Stanley has explained here , cohabiting does not lead to marriage for most couples , and tends to bring more risks than benefits for couples who do marry . For example , having lived with more than one romantic partner before marriage is linked to a substantially higher divorce risk , and moving in together without being engaged first or without clear intentions to marry is associated with poorer-quality marriages . <p> In a related finding , the NCHS report shows that three-quarters of Americans agree that cohabiting with children is acceptable . Specifically , 74.7 percent of women and 75.9 percent of men in 2011-13 affirmed that , " It is okay to have and raise children when the parents are living together but not married . " <p> Again , this finding makes sense , considering the growing number of children being raised by cohabiting parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children will spend some time in a cohabiting household , according to recent estimates . <p> Unfortunately , when it comes to the well-being of children , cohabiting parenthood is not equal to married parenthood . The main reason is that cohabiting parents are more likely to split up than married parents . As Wendy Manning noted in a report in The Future of Children , kids born into cohabiting unions experience almost three times as many family transitions ( their parents " entering into or dissolving a cohabiting or marital union " ) as those born to married parents . <p> Single Motherhood : The NCHS report also found overwhelming support among both men and women for the statement : " It is okay for an unmarried female to have and raise a child . " 1 Among women , the percentage who agreed with unmarried motherhood increased from 69.5 percent in 2002 to 78.3 percent in 201113 . Among men , agreement rose from 58.9 percent to 69.2 percent . <p> These findings are consistent with the increase in nonmarital births and the growing number of children raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , births to unmarried women accounted for 40.2 percent of all births , according to the CDC . Additionally , 2014 Census Bureau data shows that over one-quarter of American children today live in single-parent families , the vast majority with their moms . <p> Still , the overwhelming acceptance of unmarried motherhood is troubling in light of the well-established risks faced by single moms and their children . In addition to experiencing the highest rates of poverty , children in single-mother households face a heightened likelihood of various negative life outcomes , including abuse and neglect , cognitive and behavioral problems , and poor health . <p> The NCHS report raises an important question : why are Americans becoming more cautious about divorce , but at the same time more supportive of nonmarital relationships ? While there are likely many factors at play , perhaps one reason is that more of us have grown up in broken homes . According to the 2014 General Social Survey , 41 percent of Americans aged 18 to 50 were raised in non-intact families , as the chart below illustrates . Having experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any wonder more Americans abhor divorce , and delay or avoid marriage because they fear it ? <p> Wariness about marriage and divorce is something IFS Research Fellows Amber and David Lapp believe is prevalent among young , working-class Americans , many of whom were raised in broken families . " When it comes to marriage , what we heard over and over again from our interviewees was anxiety about the prospect of divorce , " they write . " Anyone who wants to understand how many young adults are thinking about marriage must grapple with the anxious legacy of divorce . " Similarly , in a recent article , W. Bradford Wilcox , Nicholas Wolfinger , and Charles Stokes cited the increasing number of children raised in non-intact families who are " pessimistic about their own prospects for a lasting marriage " as one of five cultural factors that help explain the nations declining marriage rates . <p> That more Americans are rejecting the notion of divorce as the best solution for a troubled marriage is a welcome trend that is likely driven , at least in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight for our own marriages . But if we are growing less likely to consider marriage the first and best place to form families , we will be less equipped to create the stable families we desire . It is not enough to merely view divorce as a negative option , if we are making relationship choices on the way to the altar that lower our chances of having a lasting marriage and undermine the well-being of children . The increasing support for cohabitation and unmarried parenthood are trends that need to be reversed if we hope to rebuild a culture where marriage and families can thrive . <p> 1 . In 2002 and 2006-10 , the NSFG survey prompt read " It is OK for an unmarried female to have a child . " In 2011-13 , it was changed to " have and raise a child . "

@@89588989 @5088989/ <p> A vast body of research indicates that parents , especially American parents , are less happy , on average , than non-parents . In fact , a Council on Contemporary Families study published last year found that U.S. parents experienced the largest parent-happiness gap out of 22 countries . But in a recent study published in the journal , Review of Economics of the Household , Chris Herbst and John Ifcher challenge the assumption that the " parent-happiness deficit " is settled science by analyzing trends in parental happiness over time for U.S. parents with children at home . <p> Their study examined parental happiness using two nationally representative surveys : the General Social Survey ( GSS ) and the DDB Lifestyle Survey ( LSS ) , which both include questions related to happiness and/or life satisfaction . In addition to critically evaluating previous studies on the parental happiness , the authors estimated the average happiness gap between parents and non-parents over the periods 1972 to 2008 ( for the GSS ) and 1985 to 2005 ( for the LSS ) . They also estimated the time trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 ) Were parents and non-parents becoming more or less happy over time ? 2 ) Was the relative happiness of parents ( compared to non-parents ) increasing or decreasing over time ? <p> Arizona State University Professor Chris Herbst , who co-authored the study , discussed the findings with IFS ( note : the following interview has been edited for clarity ) . <p> IFS : Previous studies have documented a parent-happiness gap , where parents report being less happy than non-parents . But you and your co-author reviewed this literature and found several flaws . Give us a few examples of the problems you discovered . <p> Chris Herbst : Our literature review uncovered two main concerns . First , to study the relationship between parental status and happiness , researchers generally analyze datasets that are comprised of random samples of individuals over a 20- to 30-year period . Doing so provides an estimate of the average happiness gap between parents and non-parents over the entire observation period . Implicit in this empirical framework is that the parental happiness gap remains constant over time . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time , then previous research potentially mischaracterizes the nature and extent of contemporary happiness differences between these groups . <p> Second , previous studies generally define a parent as anyone who reports having children in response to questions similar to the following : How many children have you ever had ? Please count all that were born alive at any time ( including any you had from a previous marriage ) ? This definition commingles noncustodial parents and empty nesters with parents who are actively parenting and also commingles adoptive and step-parents with non-parents . In other words , we felt there was too little nuance and texture to the definitions used in previous studies . There is no one-size-fits-all definition and experience of parenting , yet most prior studies tended to define parents in this manner . <p> IFS:So instead , you focused on " active parenting " rather than just anyone who has ever had a child ? <p> CH : Thats right . The definition of parent used in our study is any respondent who reports having children ages 0 to 17 residing in the household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not make a distinction between parents with and without the presence of children residing in the household . Thus , our work attempts to understand the happiness of those who are likely to be actively engaged in parenting . <p> One downside to our more restrictive definition of parents is that a number of interesting groups are defined as being non-parents , including parents with children ages 18 and over , and parents whose children do not live in their household . <p> IFS : One of the studys most interesting findings is that non-parents happiness is decreasing , while parents relative happiness is increasing over time . Tell us more about that finding . <p> CH : Our analysis of the trend in happiness for parents and non-parents revealed two interesting results . First , over past few decades , the happiness of parents has not changed much . That is , parents today are about as happy as they were several decades ago . Conversely , non-parents have witnessed a sizeable reduction in their happiness ; they are less happy today than they were several decades ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one interpretation is that parents have become relatively happier over time . <p> A related finding is that , up until the mid-1990s , non-parents were happier than parents . But starting in the mid- to late-1990s , the fortunes of parents and non-parents suddenly flipped , with parents reporting that they were happier . This difference persists , and becomes even larger , throughout the remaining years in our datasets . Thus , the happiness gap in favor of parents is a relatively recent phenomenon . These results also confirmed our concern that estimating a single happiness gap over a 30-year period may potentially hide or mischaracterize changes in the well-being gap over time . <p> IFS.What else can you tell us about the decrease in non-parents happiness compared to parents ? <p> CH : One of the striking things about the absolute decline in happiness among non-parents is its pervasiveness : the reduction applies to men and women , the working and non-working , whites and non-whites , and the low- and highly-educated . This implies that whatever is eating away at the well-being of non-parents is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis , we find that non-parents have witnessed relative reductions in a wide range of alternative measures of subjective well-being . For example , we find that non-parents perceive their financial situations to be deteriorating relative to parents . They have also become more likely to express regrets about their lives , more likely to want to alter their lives , and less likely to be confident . <p> IFS:You considered several possible explanations for the increase in parental happiness over time , including whether or not children protect parental happiness . What did you find ? <p> CH : One key explanation we pursue is whether having children protects parents against the social and economic factors that may be reducing well-being . Examples include the decline in community and political involvement , growing disconnectedness from family and friends , and the growth in economic insecurity . To explore this possibility , we estimate parents and non-parents time-trends in outcome measures organized around the themes of ( 1 ) social and political connectedness , ( 2 ) social and political trust , and ( 3 ) economic well-being . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erosion in Americans social and civic connectedness , interpersonal trust , and economic security . Across almost every measure , however , the reduction has been substantially less dramatic among parents . Parents over time have become relatively more likely to visit friends , to get the news every day , and to remain engaged in politics . And these relative improvements apply to the economic realm as well : Parents are increasingly likely , relative to non-parents , to agree that family income is high enough to satisfy nearly all important desires , and perhaps because of this , have become less likely to confide that our family is too heavily in debt. <p> IFS:Every study has limitationswhat were some of the limitations in your study that might have impacted your results ? <p> CH : The major limitation is that we can not pinpoint the causal effect of having kids on adults happiness . Individuals choose to have kids ( or not ) for a variety of reasonsand it could be the case that any preexisting differences in happiness are being attributed to those who ultimately choose ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another limitation that arises when you study changes in an outcome for statically-defined groups over a long period is that there may be compositional shifts in who becomes a parent , which may ultimately drive the observed relative increases in parental happiness observed in this paper . In other words , it is not the impact of parental status on happiness that has changed over time ; rather it is that parents themselves are different . For example , if adults feel freer now than before to choose to not be a parent , then the observed relative increase in parental happiness might be due to better sorting of adults into parents and non-parents . Thus , we can not discount the possibility that compositional shifts among parents and non-parents have driven the change in parental happiness . <p> *Chris M.

Although giving fathers , like mothers , the right to take a few paid weeks off work after the birth of a child has the potential for wide support---what mom would n't appreciate a bit more help caring for a newborn ? ---the typical arguments for paternity leave are bound to have less than universal appeal . <p> While paid paternity leave may feel like an unexpected gift , the biggest beneficiaries are n't  men , or even babies . In the long run , the true beneficiaries of paternity leave are women , and the companies and nations that benefit when women advance .

It may seem like a threat or a bit of an insult : Paternity leave is good because it keeps women " tethered to the workforce " and overturns traditional gender roles ! <p> If they hope to appeal to skeptics and to Americans with more conservative views on parents ' roles , proponents of paternity leave should place less emphasis on its gender-role implications and more emphasis on the ways that babies and children stand to benefit from it .

To quote Popenoe again , " father involvement is related to children 's improved quantitative and verbal skills , improved problem solving ability , and enhanced academic achievement . " <p> Dads also affect kids ' psychological well-being into adulthood . In one study , sociologist Paul Amato examined how both closeness to mothers and closeness to fathers affected older children and young adults .

@@89589002 @5089002/ <p> Ever since the cohabitation boom took off in the 1980s , people have become a lot more relaxed about whether or not it is best to marry before having children . In 1989 , three-quarters of the British public said people who want children should get married . By 2012 , this had dropped to less than half . Our attitudes to marriage have reflected the trend away from marriage . <p> But does this shift in opinion fit with the evidence ? Or is it more a case of going with the flow and not wishing to judge ? <p> Marriage Foundation recently published the first-ever UK analysis of who stays together and who splits up among couples who marry before having children , those who marry afterward , and those who do n't  marry at all . It seems amazing that this has n't  been done before ( so far as I know ) , other than one study from 1999 that only covered the first five years of parenthood . <p> Together with Professor Steve McKay at the University of Lincoln , we analyzed data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at 1,783 mothers with children aged 14 or 15 who were surveyed in the years 2009 or 2010 .

We then looked at which couples stayed together and which did not . We also looked at mothers age and whether or not they had a university degree . <p> The proportion of mothers who married before having kids but divorced by the time their child was a teen was 24 percent . Mothers with a degree did even better , with just 18 percent splitting up . Of those who had a child together and subsequently married , 56 percent went on to divorce . This was a new and surprising finding , being much higher than expected . Couples who had a child together but never married fared worst : 69 percent split up by the time their child was fourteen or fifteen . This was another new finding , confirming what models had predicted but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a lot more detail on this if you want it . Suffice to say we found several other interesting new findings : <p> Among mothers whose relationships remained intact , almost all92 percentwere married . For those with a degree , it was 96 percent . For those without , 91 percent . <p> Half of couples who are not married when their child is born will then go on to get married at some stage . This was a higher fraction than I had expected . <p> Age and education did not significantly affect womens odds of splitting up . This came as a really big surprise . The key factor was not mothers age or education but whether they married before their babys birth , after the birth , or not at all . For example , among mothers who married first , 82 percent of those with a degree split up compared to 74 percent of those without a degree . <p> Even after taking into account mothers age and marital status , staying together was linked to the same apparent boost to household income as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of a 14- or 15-year-old child who married before her child was born had 35 percent more household income if she was still living with the father than if she was not . That 's a gain as large as the university degree gives her . <p> The bottom line of our analysis was that couples who marry before having a child have the best chance of staying together . Couples who get married after a child is born have a risk of break-up one-fifth lower than those who do n't  marry . Yet the majority of couples who are committed enough to get married at some point after their child is born will have given up on their promise by the time their child is fifteen . Not marrying at all is by far the riskiest option . Fewer than a third of couples who do n't  formalize their commitment by getting married will stay together throughout their childs upbringing . <p> All of which evidence shows that the dwindling , yet significant , minority of the British public who still think it best to marry before having a child are right . 
@@89589005 @5089005/ <p> As we 've documented on this blog , marriage continues to be central to family formation among the immigrant population in the United States .

This finding is detailed in a recent Pew Research report , which analyzes National Center for Health Statistics data , and shows that unmarried births have declined significantly among immigrant women . <p> The report credits the recent stabilization in the share of unmarried births in the U.S. to sharp declines in unmarried births among foreign-born women . After peaking at 37 percent in 2008 , 33 percent of all births to immigrant women occurred to unmarried mothers in 2014 .

In a brief report published by the Council for Contemporary Families , Kristi Williams , associate professor of sociology at the Ohio State University , argues that the marriages of single mothers are not necessarily beneficial to the women or their children . Therefore , she concludes , taxpayer-funded programs like those of the Healthy Marriage Initiative should not promote marriage as a way to help single mothers and their kids climb out of poverty . <p> The research is indeed clear that when women who have children out of wedlock later get married , in many instances the marriage does not last . It is n't only that these women cant find men who are good marriage material . They themselves often are not good marriage material , either .

In this way the government is undermining its efforts . <p> Research released by the CDC in 2010 clearly indicates that children who live in a home with their married mother and father are generally healthier , more likely to have access to health care , and less likely to have definite or severe emotional or behavioral difficulties than children living in non-nuclear families . According to the 2010 Census , only 6 percent of children under the age of 18 living in a home with their two married biological parents were living in poverty , compared to over 40 percent of children under the age of 18 who lived with their single mother . Obviously this gap is partly attributable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , but most research suggests that family structure also has a causal effect on income levels and child poverty . <p> Williams suggests that the government might get more bang for their buck if they used the $150 million spent annually on marriage and fatherhood initiatives to instead fund programs to improve the financial futures of young , low-income women , including helping to reduce unintended pregnancies and subsidizing child care for children under four . Currently , the government spends nearly $1 trillion annually on 80 services for poor and low-income Americans ( including subsidized child care ) . The $150 million spent annually on promoting marriage and relationship skills is a rounding error by comparison . <p> To stop promoting the benefits of marriage , given its limitations , would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater .

It recruited more than 1,000 children ( along with their mothers ) in 1991 from 10 different research sites , and followed them from the first month of life to age 15 . Among other purposes , the NICHD Study was designed to investigate the claim that long hours of day care initiated very early in life posed risks to childrens social and emotional development ; and , should this prove so , to evaluate the proposition that such negative effects would be due to the poor quality of care that children received , not the quantity of care they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its quality , stupid " is one way to describe my critics argument that the risks I saw associated with early and extensive care three decades ago were solely a function of its poor quality . <p> As it turned out , NICHD Studys findings on the effects of day care proved more consistent than inconsistent with my " developmental risk " claim . And they provided virtually no support for the idea that it was poor quality care that accounted for the negative effects of " early , extensive , and continuous " care ( initiated very early in life , for long hours , and continuing for many years ) .2 Specifically , our many research reports revealed that the more time children spent in any kind of non-familial child care , and sometimes specifically in centers , the more aggressive and disobedient they proved to be at two ( but not three ) and 4.5 years of age , as well as across their elementary school years ; and the more impulsive they proved to be at age 15 , at which age they also engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less non-familial care across their first five years of life . Critically , despite spending millions to carefully measure the quality of care , using methods and measures developed by the proponents of the " its quality , stupid " view , the study never found that the quality of care accounted for these quantity-of-care effects . In other words , the problem behavior associated with early , extensive , and continuous care emerged irrespective of whether quality of care was good or bad . <p> Beyond the NICHD Study <p> The NICHD Study was not without its limits , most notably its inability to control for all the factors that might affect a childs development , despite prodigious efforts to do so . Such a limitation makes a brand new report out of Canada so important , especially given the current discussion of universal preschool advocated by the mayor of New York City , the president of the United States , and many others . This 2015 report3 evaluates the effects on children of a major policy change that increased the availability , utilization , and quality of child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s . The reform dramatically reduced the cost to families of child care and increased the pay and training of child-care workers . Economists , using state-of-the-art econometric approaches and comparing children in Quebec with those from other provinces , documented numerous negative effects of the universal child care program . Notably , compared with children growing up in other provinces , those growing up in Quebec proved to be more anxious and aggressive at ages two and three as well as from ages five to nine , while also proving to be more hyperactive at these latter ages . Moreover , children in Quebec with increased child care access later had worse health , lower life satisfaction , and higher crime rates than other children . <p> Just as notable as these longer-term findings are those from an earlier report on the Quebec policy , which revealed that negative effects of the program were most evident among children who enrolled in care at earlier ages.4 Although there is suggestive evidence that the quality of care provided in Quebec was not especially high , 5 there is as yet no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summarized here . <p> Quality Does Matter , Somewhat <p> It would be a mistake , based on what I have written here , to throw the quality-of-care baby out with the bathwater . And this is because there is evidence that quality matters . Indeed , in the NICHD Study , more attentive , responsive , and stimulating care across the infant , toddler , and preschool years predicted enhanced cognitive and language development from age two through age 15 . And many other investigations have documented similar results . <p> But , to repeat , this does not meanin the NICHD Study , the Quebec Study , or any other that I am aware ofthat poor quality of care explains and thus accounts for the negative effects of a large quantity of care . Another piece of evidence suggesting that total dosage of non-familial care across the first five years of life remains important comes from Norway . There , children do not start high-quality , publicly funded child care until after their first birthday , and spending lots of time in child care does not produce adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of quality or quantity of care , it would be a mistake to exaggerate their importance , for the effects of both are comparatively modest . It is for this reason that I am astonished when academics draw on the NICHD Study to argue in favor of policies promoting high-quality care , but virtually within the same breath dismiss the findings linking quantity of care with negative effects because they are " small and unimportant " when the positive effect of quality on cognitive functioning and the negative effects of quantity on social-emotional functioning are the same ! <p> All but forgotten in many discussions about child care is how the effects ( both positive and negative ) of day care on child development compare to the effects of families , a subject the NICHD Study was well positioned to address . And here the results were clear and consistent , too : family factors ( e.g. , single parenthood ) and processes ( e.g. , sensitive-responsive parenting ) were far more predictive of virtually all developmental outcomes at virtually all ages of measurement than were child-care factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figures 1A and B , which show that while both parenting quality and child care quality matter , the effect of parenting quality is more than three times the size of child-care qualitys effect on pre-academic skills and almost six times the size of child-care qualitys effect on linguistic competence when children are 4.5 years of age . <p> Prepared for the NICHD Study <p> Prepared for the NICHD Study <p> Careful consideration of Figures 2A and 2B reveals more or less the same thing . These figures contrast the effects of amount of exposure to center-based child care and parenting on three different aspects of socioemotional development ( measured repeatedly as children aged ) . Not only are parenting effect sizes larger than those of child care quality ( note the differing scales on the y-axes ) , but whereas parenting proves to be a statistically significant predictor of all outcomes ( as indicated by the asterisks ) , this is not the case for child care . As I tell my students , " if the good Lord came to a fetus and said , I can either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality child care for most of your early life , or a seriously troubled family and great quality of child care , which would you prefer ? " , the astute response would be to choose the former rather than latter condition . <p> Prepared for the NICHD Study <p> Prepared for the NICHD Study <p> Conclusion <p> All this does not mean we should disregard the quality of child care . One of my major concerns about how child care is discussed in the policy arena is that the conversations either disregard what children want , only discussing the preferences of parents , or treat children as investment vehicles and thus more or less like a commodity . From the latter perspective , if the costs of quality of care do not yield sufficiently beneficial effects on behavior and development , then one could argue that those costs should not be incurred and we should not worry about providing children with high-quality care . <p> I look at this issue from a more philosophical point of view . Children never asked to be here . They deserve a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the short or long term , simply because they are children . Providing high-quality child care should not ( only ) be about its short- or long-term effects , then , but about a decent quality of life for those children who find themselves in non-family care , whether on an early , extensive , and continuous basis or not . <p> Jay Belsky is the Robert M. and Natalie Reid Dorn Professor of Human Development in the Department of Human Ecology at the University of California , Davis .

@@89589020 @5089020/ <p> The core piece of the 1996 welfare reformpassed into law 20 years ago this monthwas its work requirement . The reform changed the Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) program to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) program . For the first time , able-bodied adults were required to work , prepare for work , or look for work in exchange for receiving benefits . <p> Provide assistance to needy families so that children can be cared for in their own homes . <p> Reduce the dependency of needy parents by promoting job preparation , work , and marriage . <p> Prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies . <p> Encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families . <p> Although opponents claimed that a work requirement would greatly increase poverty , the opposite occurred : child poverty dropped , employment rates among low-income individuals increased , and the TANF rolls were cut in half within about five years , plummeting from 4.3 million families to about 2 million . The unwed childbearing rate leveled off for a few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it continued upward and stands at more than 40 percent today ) . <p> Work <p> Despite this initial success , however , and the fact that the TANF caseload has remained at a stable low compared to many other welfare programs , work rates among TANF participants are far too low today . In fact , TANFs rolls are full of adults who are doing either little or no work activity . In 2013 , an average of only one-third ( 33.5 percent ) of adults on TANF fulfilled the work requirement ( 20 to 35 hours of work or work activity per week ) . Nearly 60 percent of adults were not working at all , performing zero hours of work or work activity during the average month . <p> Low levels of TANF work participation are due to two main factors . One is that state bureaucracies use loopholes to lower their work participation rate requirement or to artificially boost the number of working adults on their TANF rolls.1 The main reason for low work participation , however , is that the original work participation rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform required only 50 percent of work-eligible adults to fulfill the work requirement , meaning that half of TANF recipients could be doing no type of work activity whatsoever . <p> Not only is TANFs work requirement too weak , but welfare reform touched only one program out of the currently more than 80 means-tested programs that provide cash , food , housing , medical care and social services to poor and lower-income Americans . Most of these programs are void of a work requirement , thus undermining work and self-sufficiency . <p> Marriage and Unwed Childbearing <p> While the initial goal of moving individuals off of the roles and towards work was very successful , the goals of strengthening marriage and reducing unwed childbearing were far less so . The percent of U.S. children born outside of marriage has continued its steady upward climb , although at a somewhat slower rate . <p> The crisis of family breakdown is complex , and efforts to strengthen marriage are needed from leaders at every level of society . Regrettably , few states used their TANF funding towards strengthening marriage and reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all TANF funding goes to " two-parent family formation and maintenance . " To make matters worse , the rest of the means-tested welfare system is rife with marriage penalties . <p> The trends in marriage today should be of great concern to those who desire to promote a strong and prosperous society . Marriage is one of the greatest protectors against poverty . Children are more likely to thrive if they are raised in married-parent homes . Married men are more likely to stay in the labor force compared to their single counterparts , and they also earn more money than unmarried men . <p> Unfortunately , over 40 percent of children are born to unmarried mothers every year , and marriage rates have steadily been declining for decades now , particularly among those in lower-income and working-class communities . A welfare system that is hostile towards marriage only exacerbates these problems . <p> Going Forward <p> While welfare reform was initially successful at promoting work , the reform effort fizzled too soon . It should have been just the beginning of a series of reforms . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to successfully promote work . The next stage of welfare reform should build upon this pattern . <p> Welfare reforms goals of strengthening marriage and reducing nonmarital childbearing were also the right goals . However , state leaders must recognize the crucial importance of healthy marriages and strong families , and work towards the goal of strengthening both , rather than turning a blind eye to family breakdown . Community , business , education and political leaders should also come together to spread the message that marriage matters and to help promote healthy marriage in their communities . <p> The 1996 reform provided the correct principles on which to build . Unfortunately , since then we have taken several steps backward , as the rest of the welfare system balloons and most TANF recipients today are not working , while unwed childbearing is at historic highs . Its time to regain that lost ground by moving towards policies that promote the most important anti-poverty institutions : work and marriage . <p> Rachel Sheffield is a policy analyst at the Institute for Family , Community , and Opportunity at The Heritage Foundation .

@@89589044 @5089044/ <p> When marriage breaks down , boys are more likely than girls to act up . From delinquency to incarceration and schooling to employment , a mounting body of research suggests boys are affected more by family breakdown than girls . As Richard Reeves , the co-director of the Brookings Center on Children and Families , recently put it , when it comes to thriving in difficult family environments , girls may be more like dandelions , while boys may be more like orchids . <p> " In psychology , people used to talk about dandelions and orchids ... but the idea is that dandelions pretty much survive whatever you do , and orchids need to be carefully looked after , " said Reeves , " Well , it looks from the evidence as if it 's the boys who are the orchids in many cases . " That is , girls appear to be more resilient in the face of family instability and stress than boys . <p> Is Reeves right about boys and girls ? Up until now , I have taken the view that boys now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability . Recent research by economist David Autor and his colleagues indicates that one major reason why boys are falling behind girls in school is that they are affected more by fatherlessness than girls when it comes to their behavior and academic progress . The figure below , taken from Autors new research in Florida , indicates that the gender gap in school absences is larger for boys from unmarried , father-absent homes than for boys born to married parents . Likewise , the gender gap in school suspensions and high school graduation in Florida is also smaller for boys from married homes . <p> Similarly , economist Raj Chetty and his colleagues have found that young men ( at age 30 ) are less likely to be employed if they come from single-parent families than from married-parent families . Moreover , as the figure below indicates , young men from lower-income families do relatively worse than their female peers if they hail from single-parent families . But young men from married , lower-income families do relatively better than their female peers . In other words , Chettys new research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negatively by single-parenthood than young womens employment prospects , especially when both are raised in a lower-income family . Overall , the research indicates boys and men are affected more by family instability and single parenthood while growing up than their female peersat least when it comes to behavioral problems , incarceration , schooling , and employment . <p> As Ron Mincy and I noted in USA Today earlier this year , Autor offered two explanations for this pattern : " Boys particularly seem to benefit more from being in a married household or committed householdwith the time , attention and income that brings , " Autor said . The lack of a male role model in impoverished , fatherless households led by single mothers seems to be having a disparate effect . " Its quite possible that daughters are drawing the lesson that I 'm going to be the sole provider and the head of the family , " Autor further noted . " Sons could be drawing the lesson that the men I see around me are not working or committed fathers . " <p> To date , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely to be fragile orchids and girls are more likely to be resilient dandelions in the face of family instability . <p> But its also possible that family instability and single parenthood affect girls and young women in ways that are not directly related to antisocial behavior , which is a classic male expression of emotional turmoil . In other words , perhaps both boys and girls are orchids in the face of family instability , but their vulnerability is simply expressed in different ways . <p> This possibility came to mind after I reviewed data from the 2016 " American Family Survey " conducted by YouGov for Deseret News/BYU . The new survey indicates that on two outcomesrelationship trouble and financial distresswomen appear to do worse than men when they have a history of family instability while growing up . For example , adult women are much less likely to report that their current relationship is " in trouble " if they come from a stable married home , and the advantage they enjoy from stability is clearly larger than the advantage that man from a stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Likewise , todays women are much less likely to find themselves in a financial crisis if they hail from an intact , married family , as the figure below indicates . If the results of this survey are replicated in other data sets , they suggest that women may be affected by family instability more than men when it comes to their relationship success and freedom from economic distress . <p> This survey suggests women have greater difficulty in forging and maintaining strong relationships as adults when they have been exposed to family instability or dysfunction as children . This , in turn , may lead to more relationship " trouble " and also to a higher incidence of single parenthood as adults . A higher incidence of single parenthood , in turn , may help explain why women with unstable families are more likely to report financial distress . Finally , if the absence of a stable , married home has a bigger impact on girls future relationship trajectories than boys , it may also explain why the gap in relationship trouble and financial distress by family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey . <p> Additional research , using different data , is needed to explore whether the relational and economic fallout of childhood family instability in adulthood is now bigger for females than it is for males . But this years American Family Survey suggests that Reeves might be wrong about boys being orchids and girls being dandelions when confronted by family instability . It just may be that girls are orchids too , but their vulnerability shows up not so much in their odds of incarceration , school failure , and idleness , but in their odds of being less able to successfully forge strong and stable marriages as adult women . <p> W.

@@89589050 @5089050/ <p> We were waiting in line , shuffling slowly as a crowdsomething we did often at this past weeks World Meeting of Familieswhen a woman asked about our research and wanted to know the thing that surprised us most about young adults and marriage trends . <p> She was surprised when Amber told her that contrary to the doom and gloom talk , the young adults we interviewed overwhelmingly still want to get married . They believe that marriage demands fidelity and commitment and sacrifice . Many of themeven those who do not attend church regularlydescribe marriage as " sacred . " They share memes on their Facebook pages that say things like " I want my first marriage to be my only marriage . " <p> Yes , these same young adults also extol cohabitation . But not because they do n't  believe in marriagerather , they see living together as a way to make sure that when they do get married , they will not divorce . And although this strategy is misguided , it is also a sign of how seriously young adults take the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In other words , young adults do not delay marriage because they no longer aspire to it , but because , all too often , they are afraid of it . <p> They cite high divorce rates . They tell stories of the pain they felt when their own parents divorced or never married in the first place . They alternate between tears and anger when describing difficult break-ups with exes . In this context , they struggle to trust other people , and marriage itself . They worry that " marriage ruins relationships . " With few positive models , they are zealous to avoid divorce . As one single mom from a fragmented family told us , " I only want to be married once . I do n't  want to get married then divorced , remarried then divorced , like my whole family has been . " <p> Young adults do not delay marriage because they no longer aspire to it , but because , all too often , they are afraid of it . <p> This is the same message that Pope Francis heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some fears about getting married , " the fiancTe said . " In our country , there is a high rate of divorce and we often wonder , How can we be sure that this will not happen to us ? " And in a poll conducted in real time during another session at the World Meeting of Families , audience members text-messaged their responses to a question about the biggest obstacles they faced on the path to marriage . The word " fear " emerged as the second most common response , second only to " time . " These anecdotes are hardly scientific conclusions , but they echo what researchers are hearing in interviews with young people . <p> Our approach to young adults must be guided by this reality . If the problem is that they are basically anxious about getting married in an age of family and economic fragmentation , those of us who care about marriage should not approach them as ideological enemies , badgering and lecturing and lamenting . An anxious age demands a different response . <p> In his address to Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pope Francis suggested the outlines of such a response . He stated that " the family is not first and foremost a cause for concern , but rather the joyous confirmation of Gods blessing upon the masterpiece of creation . " He told the bishops that young people grow up in a social environment wasted by a consumerism " consuming relationships , consuming friendships , consuming religions , consuming , consuming " that shreds trust and produces what he describes as " the root " of so many contemporary problems that confront young people : " a kind of impoverishment born of a widespread and radical sense of loneliness . " He is describing alienation . <p> How , then , should we respond to young people , the pope asked ? " Should we condemn them for living in this kind of a world ? Should they hear their pastors saying that it was all better back then , the world is falling apart and if things go on this way , who knows where we will end up ? " <p> " No , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Moreover , he said , we would be " mistaken " to interpret young peoples posture toward marriage as " indifference " or " pure and simple selfishness . " Instead , in his reading of things , young people come of age in an era of alienation , " a culture of discouragement , " and feel paralyzed in the face of marriage . In the meantime , he said , for young people " life goes on , without really being lived to the full . " Francis is describing young people who are afraid , but very capable of achieving marriage and family life . <p> The right response to a social problem is to throw a feast . <p> To address this reality , he said , " We need to invest our energies not so much in rehearsing the problems of the world around us and the merits of Christianity , but in extending a sincere invitation to young people to be brave and to opt for marriage and the family . " Pastors , he said , should focus on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family lifeless " talking , " more " shepherding " and " wasting " time with people .

Gregory Jones , a theologian and author of several books on reconciliation , has suggested that the right response to a social problem is to throw a feast .

The show of " unity within diversity " prompted a Hispanic member of a band on the Logan Square Stage to comment how remarkable it was that such a diverse crowd could come together in such peace . <p> We were the " polyhedron " that Francis extolled on the steps of Independence Hall : each people , vibrant in our own colors , together cheering the pope who had invited us all here .

@@89589051 @5089051/ <p> Welfare reform is 20 years old today , and its as controversial as ever . <p> As I explained in this space in February , welfare reform affected different people in different ways . It encouraged many to get jobs and gave them additional subsidies for doing so . But those who failed to find work were cut off from cash assistance . <p> The most popular argument about the law involves the latter group : Are the poorest of the poor worse off today ? More specifically , is there a growing share of Americans who live on just $2 a day ? A new paper by Scott Winship of the Manhattan Institute argues that these claims are overblown . <p> Today , Winship and I are both appearing on a panel at the Cato Institute to discuss welfare reform ( full disclosure : I saw and provided some trivial comments about his report in advance ) . Following is an outline of the most important findings from Winships research . <p> The heart of Winships report is a series of charts that show poverty statistics before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , is one showing the poverty rate for the children of single mothersthe demographic most affected by the 1996 law ( the additional lines in the figures indicate child poverty after non-cash government benefits , refundable tax credits , and other factors , such as family size , etc. , are included ) : <p> As I pointed out in my previous piece , even just looking at cash income , these kids were better off after the lawthough the recession later ate away some of the gains . Even that qualification is hardly necessary in some of the adjusted trends shown here . Incredibly , a major economic catastrophe is all but invisible once the full safety net is taken into account . <p> These families have access to benefits that cover basic needs , such as food stamps , as well as to tax subsidies like the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit . This aid helped to keep their poverty rate steady as the recession hit . A better adjustment for inflation , health benefits ( valued at 25 percent of their market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends down further . <p> The bigger debate these days , though , is about not poverty but " extreme poverty . " The idea is that welfare reform made some of the poor even poorer , which does n't  affect the overall poverty rate . <p> One point that 's undeniably true is that there was an increase in people reporting very little cash income in surveysa popular study by Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer claimed that 4 percent of households with children now live on less than $2 per person per day in cash . Winship , however , throws a few wrenches in this narrative . For one thing , he argues that $2-a-day poverty : ( 1 ) began rising even before welfare reform ; and ( 2 ) rose even among demographics that werent affected by the law , such as the elderly . Underreporting of income seems to be a factor here . <p> The role of non-cash benefits is another key issue , and Winship has a chart for that . Actually , he has numerous charts for that , but here 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are the bottom two lines , which suggest extreme poverty is basically nonexistent once the data have been properly adjusted . The " underestimation correction " is calculated using the Urban Institutes TRIM model , which adjusts survey data ( where benefits , like income , are underreported ) so that they correspond with poverty programs administrative data . Based on various criteria , it assigns people as program participants even if they said they werent , and includes program benefits in their income . The TRIM model is the product of decades worth of workthe original version debuted in 1973and is used frequently by leading researchers . But I suspect well see some criticisms of it , especially as applied specifically to the problem of extreme poverty , in the weeks ahead . <p> Also worth noting in this chart : non-cash benefits seem to play a big role in keeping a lid on extreme poverty . That deserves consideration by those who would like to add or strengthen work requirements in those other programs too . <p> Another part of Winships analysis that stood out to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal survey that asks ( to pick just one example ) whether a child in the household has had to skip a meal because there was n't enough money for food . More than a decade ago , these data played a part in one of the most important early analyses of welfare reform , which was authored by Winship with famed Harvard professor Christopher Jencks . <p> Both Winship and Jencks had expected the law to be a disaster , but they found little evidence of it in the data and changed their minds . ( Jencks has since changed his mind back , basically endorsing the Edin/Shaefer claim of rising extreme poverty . ) Not only was poverty down in single-mother families thanks to rising employment , but the extra costs associated with having a job did n't  seem to be hurting these families either , as evidenced by food data . Winship and Jencks explain : <p> Our analysis of nearly 50 such measures revealed that food problems among single mothers and their children declined consistently between 1995 and 2000 when the economy was expanding .... Most measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 . But these increases were almost always much smaller than the declines between 1995 and 2000 , so mother-only families still reported significantly fewer problems at the end of 2002 than they had in 1995 . <p> The new numbers are more troubling : <p> These data , though erratic , would seem to buttress claims that the safety net does n't  respond to recessions as well as we might hope , and it prods us to reconsider the flatter trendlines in some of the previous charts . Hungry children , after all , are the type of outcome were ultimately trying to get at when we look to see whether a households income falls under a threshold for " poverty " or " extreme poverty . " The worst problems are rareand they rose with the recession , not immediately after welfare reformbut they highlight that there is still much to be done in the fight against child poverty ( which , to be clear , Winship does not deny ) . <p> Winships report weighs in at about 100 pages , with reams of data crammed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including consumption , homelessness , surveys from the food-stamp program , etc. ) , and multiple appendixes explaining the methodological choices . It is tempting to call it the definitive analysis of welfare reforms effect on poverty . <p> Of course , its not that simple . Just last week , for example , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released a report claiming that the bottom tenth of single-mother families saw their incomes fall as a result of the law , even after adjusting for underreporting and non-cash benefits . There are numerous differences between their approach and Winships , including different inflation adjustments and the treatment of health benefits ( CBPP excludes them entirely , while Winship values them at 25 percent ) . <p> This debate will go on for a long time . So I 'll put it this way : If its not the definitive analysis of welfare reform , Winships paper is a major contribution to this discussion that deserves a careful reading by everyone concerned with the future of welfare reform .

For example , her tweet on the day of the Womens March broke with the tone of her female peers in Hollywood : <p> " BREAKING NEWS : You can be #ProLife &amp; still care about the poor , disenfranchised &amp; disabled people .

Tricia is 25 and a recovering heroin addict who lost custody of her children , yet she now spends her time caring for her bedridden grandmother . Longtime neighbors pitch in , pushing Mamaw in her wheelchair around the block for some fresh air . <p> Tricia may be caring for her Mamaw , but throughout her life , Mamaw was the person Tricia came back to when she had nowhere else to go .

@@89589054 @5089054/ <p> Half a century ago , Latin America and the Caribbean enjoyed the highest education levels among areas of the Global South , but in recent years , other areas have been catching up . Today , students in Eastern Asian and Pacific countries complete secondary school at higher rates than students in Latin America and the Caribbean . <p> This relatively poor educational expansion has occurred in a region that also has the worlds highest rates of nonmarital childbearing . Although cohabitation has a long history in the region and is so common that scholars refer to Latin America as having a " dual nuptiality system " ( with marriage and cohabitation as coexisting alternatives for life-long unions ) , cohabitation is still less stable than marriage there ( like it is everywhere else ) . Thus , the high rates of births to cohabiting couples contribute to the high proportions of children living apart from at least one biological parent ( 23-60 percent of 8-15 year-olds across the eleven countries ) . Together with a team of researchers from the World Family Map project , I investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Latin America and the Caribbean . <p> It is n't very difficult to imagine why children of lone parents might be disadvantaged relative to children with two parents , in part , because two people have 48 hours in a day . With twice the total hours available to one person , time devoted to income earning and to caregiving can both potentially increase . Income and time are both good things for children , and both can make it easier for kids to succeed in school . <p> After that , it gets more complicated . Stability is also good for kids . So is being raised by a continuously single mother better than having a stepfather , even though he might contribute income and time ? Are parents less important for childrens outcomes where extended family living is more commonthat is , where other people in the household can contribute resources to children ? Our work , published in the Journal of Family and Economic Issues in July , took up these kinds of questions in a context where both family instability and extended family living are common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one biological parent were less likely to be progressing on-time through school ( they had either dropped out or fallen behind grade-for-age ) . This was true among children living with only their mothers , only their fathers , and a mother and stepfather , as well as those living with a father and stepmother . In other words , kids living with both biological parents were the most likely to be on track to complete secondary school . According to our research , having a stepparent did n't  compensate for the educational disadvantage experienced by kids with an absent biological parent . <p> Single parenthood and family instability in Latin America and the Caribbean present formidable obstacles to educational progress for children in the region . <p> Our study also suggested that even though kids whose biological fathers migrate to another country for a job lose their fathers time resources , they do not suffer the same educational disadvantages as children of single mothers . Financial contributions may be more reliable when remitted in the context of intact unions compared to broken unions , plus children may benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We also examined whether living with adults other than parents was associated with good educational outcomes for kids . After all , kids who live with stepfathers might benefit from their income and time but also suffer from the transitions that created the stepfamily , whereas kids who live with grandfathers might have more resources without those consequences . Unfortunately , other men did not seem to substitute for biological fathers for keeping children progressing on-time through school . In some countries , those living with other men ( not including stepfathers ) were actually more likely to fall behind or drop out . Living with other women occasionally carried a modest advantage , but nothing like the advantage associated with living with a biological mother . <p> Overall , our findings suggest that it is very difficult to substitute for intact families in promoting good educational outcomes . But , as the lead author of this study , I am well aware of its limitations in proving that family instability makes educational progress difficult . <p> For instance , if kids in East Asian countries living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Latin America , then family structure is , at best , only a small part of the reason why educational expansion in Latin America has been relatively slow . Perhaps more importantly , when we show that kids not living with both parents are disadvantaged in the most recent data , we have n't actually shown that the growth in family instability has impeded educational progress over time in the region . In further work , we plan to address this weakness by testing whether secondary completion rates have improved more slowly in areas within Latin America that have seen faster growth in family instability . <p> Despite these limitations , our findings suggest that single parenthood and family instability in Latin America and the Caribbean present formidable obstacles to educational progress in the region . These factors may even help explain why Asian countries with stronger marriage cultures have gone from trailing Latin America to surpassing it in secondary school completion rates .

Although her words are unique to the context of her marriage and situation , she captures the difficulty many of our interviewees experienced in arriving at a place of clarity or confidence about whether to remain married or divorce . <p> Steve Harris : Have you had particular moments where you 've had real clarity about the decision to either stay in your marriage or move toward divorce ? <p> Participant : It fluctuates all the time . I think you can know by just talking to me that I do n't  have clarity . I do n't  . <p> Harris:You do n't  ? Is it even possible for people to get ? Tell me what you think about clarity . <p> Participant : Oh , I think that of course you can have clarity . <p> Harris:Can you describe a moment when you 've had clarity or confidence in your decision ? <p> Participant : I do n't  know because I go back and forth so much . Every next bad thing that happens in my marriage I 'm like , okayIm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in this bad thing , I stay and that 's okay . I have to deal with the other bad thing . I do n't  know how to explain it . <p> Harris : I appreciate you hanging in here with me on this because it sounds like its a dynamic process , meaning there 's a lot of movement . <p> Participant : Right , like , it changes all the time . <p> Harris : Yeah , it changes all the time and sometimes you get a moment of clarity and then it vanishes . Some other stress shows up ? <p> Participant : Right . I 'm clear that if I had enough money to not be here , then I would 95 percent not be here . But I do n't  , so I have to make the best out of what I do have . He s not the worst person .

But its not like thatIm not crazy about him all the time , and everything he does drives me crazy , because he s 51 years old and he should be smarter than that .

And I 'm still trying to figure it all out 26 years later . " <p> Harris : I 'm wondering if you could describe what its like to be at this place where you 're thinking about the future of your marriage . So , maybe you could fill in the blank to the following sentence : " Thinking about the future of my marriage is like ? " <p> Participant : ( Pauses ) Like shaking up a snow globe . <p> Harris : Okay , and what exactly happens when you do that ? <p> Participant : I do n't  know , when it the snow falls down , you have an answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came to my mind . <p> Harris : Shaking up a snow globeso when you start thinking about it , everything gets mixed up ? <p> Participant : Its all mixed up .

All that snow going around the snowman and I do n't  knowI know I 'm not clearMy snow globe is very snowy . <p> Harris : You gave me a great picture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused you because I have no clarity on anything . So I 'm probably like the worst person to interview about making a decision on the future of my marriage . I 'm not the type of person who says Oh yeah , right away , I 'm going to divorce him I do n't  know . <p> Harris : Do you want to know what I 'm finding out in these interviews ? It feels like most people we 've been talking to are in the same type of situation as you . <p> Participant : Really ? <p> Harris : I think that a lot of people would really identify with the snow globe . I think its going to be really helpful for us to use it as a metaphor for how people think about where they 're at in this divorce decision-making process . <p> Participant : Well good , because I feel like I 'm all alone . You know ? <p> Harris:Yeah , you 're the snowman trying to figure everything out . <p> Participant : Yeah , you get itSo , all I have is my mixed up snow globe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all falling around me . But I do n't  have the worst marriage . I may not have the best , but I do n't  have the worst . And I 'm still trying to figure it all out 26 years later . <p> A Turbulent and Confusing Process <p> Indeed , many of the people we interviewed seemed to have stories similar to this womans . They did n't  think they had the best marriages around , but they werent the worst marriages either . There seemed to be enough good in their marriages to have kept them from pursuing divorce up to this point . But every now and then , the struggles and trials of their marriages would really tempt them to think that something better might be out there . Its also worth noting that during other parts of the interview , this particular woman talked about good times she had recently enjoyed with her husband , and said she wished they could do more things together to get their marriage back on track . <p> Others we interviewed used different ways to describe what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about their desire for more clarity in how they were thinking about the future of their marriage . They suggested that getting clarity was often elusive or even fleeting . And many participantswell over half of those we interviewedwere worried about making the " wrong " decision , and the impact this would have on them and others , especially their children . This womans particular metaphor seemed to capture the turbulent and confusing nature of the divorce decision-making process , where so much is on the line . <p> What can we learn from the womans story above ? Perhaps we can learn that it is normal for individuals to struggle to find clarity and confidence when thinking about the future of their marriage , and especially when deciding whether or not to divorce . Accurately judging between an unknown future and a current reality is impossible , so the idea that most people head confidently into divorce is probably unrealistic . Based on our research , most people who are struggling to find clarity need to understand that there 's nothing wrong with their desire to be clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably worth taking the time to make a decision that reflects clarity of thought and confidence in the outcome . <p> Steven M.

@@89589056 @5089056/ <p> Imagine a marriage in the years leading up to divorce . You 're probably thinking of a good marriage slowing falling prey to escalating arguments , angry outbursts , hurt feelings , and grief . Or a couple facing socioeconomic and demographic disadvantages and unable to communicate with each other at a deep level . Maybe you 're picturing infidelity or violence . <p> The prevalence of divorce in contemporary American society means that divorce and its effects on adults and children are among the most frequently studied topics in the family sciencesand a growing segment of literature in this area suggests that the popular image of a failing marriage is wrong . <p> For many years , researchers and the population at large have thought about relationship breakdown as typically a linear process that occurred in stages . Prior research identifying marital quality differences between married and divorced couples1 was implicitly interpreted to mean that all divorcing couples experience similar trajectories of marital quality . <p> But recent research examining trends in marital quality over time suggest that there are multiple paths of marital quality throughout the life course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so over the ensuing decades while other marriages begin with lower levels of marital satisfaction that decline with each passing year . If couples who remain married exhibit varying trajectories of marital happiness over time , perhaps divorcing couples do the same prior to divorce . <p> It is this possibility that I set out to explore in my new study , entitled " Variation in Marital Quality in a National Sample of Divorced Women " and forthcoming in the Journal of Family Psychology . The results , using methods that examine levels of marital happiness , communication , and conflict in the years leading to divorce in a sample of divorced women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1979 , revealed that patterns of marital quality do vary among divorcing couples , as the below figure shows . <p> For example , the results showed two different trajectories of happiness . The first class , consisting of 26 percent of divorced women in the sample , reported relatively low happiness levels initially and showed further decline as divorce approached , with a particularly steep deterioration in happiness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of women ( 74 percent ) in the sample reported a somewhat startling pattern : consistently high marital happiness that declined modestly as divorce approached . Even immediately prior to the divorce , however , these marriages were still relatively happy . By conventional norms , these were not particularly unhappy marriages . And these results were not just limited to marital happiness ; the results for communication were very similar , with the largest group ( 89% of sampled women ) exhibiting remarkably high levels of marital communication over the years prior to divorce . <p> This stability in marital quality in the years leading to divorce was particularly visible in the results for marital conflict . While popular images of divorcing couples often involve heavy amounts of conflict in the years immediately preceding marital dissolution , the results here suggest that the seeds of marital discontent and divorce are sown long before the couple begins to consider ending the relationship . In fact , among divorcing women , there is little evidence of any change , much less an uptick , in marital conflict prior to divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relationships , with little if any change thereafter . Some divorcing couples have high levels of conflict ; others , low levels . But the level of conflict typically remains consistent throughout marriage . Surprisingly , women who reported consistently high levels of conflict are the smallest group at only 14 percent of women , with the bulk of women reporting either moderate ( 56 percent ) or low ( 30 percent ) amounts of conflict . <p> So what can we conclude from all this ? First , not all divorcing couples follow the same trajectory . While this may seem obvious at first blush , many programs aimed at reducing the divorce rate focus , to take just one example , on providing couples with better communication and problem-solving skills . Since most divorcing women did not report these as a problem , combating relationship breakdown will require more nuanced approaches <p> Second , divorce is clearly not always or even usually the result of a bad marriage , as popular opinion and media opinion hold . If that were true , we would expect most divorcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and high conflict . But these results suggest that many , probably even most , divorcing women have happy , low-conflict marriages with good communication . <p> Spencer James is an assistant professor of family life at Brigham Young University . <p> 1 .

The results , using methods that examine levels of marital happiness , communication , and conflict in the years leading to divorce in a sample of divorced women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1979 , revealed that patterns of marital quality do vary among divorcing couples , as the below figure shows . <p> For example , the results showed two different trajectories of happiness . The first class , consisting of 26 percent of divorced women in the sample , reported relatively low happiness levels initially and showed further decline as divorce approached , with a particularly steep deterioration in happiness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of women ( 74 percent ) in the sample reported a somewhat startling pattern : consistently high marital happiness that declined modestly as divorce approached . Even immediately prior to the divorce , however , these marriages were still relatively happy . By conventional norms , these were not particularly unhappy marriages . And these results were not just limited to marital happiness ; the results for communication were very similar , with the largest group ( 89% of sampled women ) exhibiting remarkably high levels of marital communication over the years prior to divorce . <p> This stability in marital quality in the years leading to divorce was particularly visible in the results for marital conflict . While popular images of divorcing couples often involve heavy amounts of conflict in the years immediately preceding marital dissolution , the results here suggest that the seeds of marital discontent and divorce are sown long before the couple begins to consider ending the relationship . In fact , among divorcing women , there is little evidence of any change , much less an uptick , in marital conflict prior to divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relationships , with little if any change thereafter . Some divorcing couples have high levels of conflict ; others , low levels . But the level of conflict typically remains consistent throughout marriage . Surprisingly , women who reported consistently high levels of conflict are the smallest group at only 14 percent of women , with the bulk of women reporting either moderate ( 56 percent ) or low ( 30 percent ) amounts of conflict . <p> So what can we conclude from all this ? First , not all divorcing couples follow the same trajectory . While this may seem obvious at first blush , many programs aimed at reducing the divorce rate focus , to take just one example , on providing couples with better communication and problem-solving skills . Since most divorcing women did not report these as a problem , combating relationship breakdown will require more nuanced approaches <p> Second , divorce is clearly not always or even usually the result of a bad marriage , as popular opinion and media opinion hold . If that were true , we would expect most divorcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and high conflict . But these results suggest that many , probably even most , divorcing women have happy , low-conflict marriages with good communication . <p> Spencer James is an assistant professor of family life at Brigham Young University . <p> 1 .

@@89589068 @5089068/ <p> Sheryl Sandberg , arguably the nations most well-known voice in the ongoing conversation about work-life balance , is now the nations most famous widow . No one saw it coming , most especially Sandberg . Her husband , Dave Goldberg , a prominent and successful executive in the tech world in his own right , died in a tragic accident while vacationing with Sandberg in May . <p> In my inaugural post for the Institute for Family Studies , I wrote about Sandberg as a positive testament to marriage . Though she is a weathervane on a host of issues , I argued that her strong endorsement of marriage as something that is not just compatible with female success , but often is a key part of it , is a counter-cultural message that ought to unify people on all sides of the various debates she 's a part of . Its certainly one that young women need to hear more . <p> All too often we are told that marriage is an impediment to success . Sandberg argues to the contrary in her famous ( or infamous ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I truly believe that the single most important career decision that a woman makes is whether she will have a life partner and who that partner is . I do n't  know of one woman in a leadership position whose life partner is not fullyand I mean fullysupportive of her career . No exceptions . And contrary to the popular notion that only unmarried women can make it to the top , the majority of the most successful female business leaders have partners . Of the twenty-eight women who have served as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies , twenty-six were married , one was divorced , and one had never married . Many of these CEOs said they " could not have succeeded without the support of their husbands . " <p> Now , despite losing her own husband at the far-too-young age of forty-seven , Sandberg continues to be a beautiful witness to marriage . Her first public comment about her husbands death was almost entirely centered around their marriage . She updated her Facebook cover photo to a picture of them at their wedding , and wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , happiest marriage , and truest partnership that I could imagine . He gave me the experience of being deeply understood , truly supported and completely and utterly loved -- and I will carry that with me always . Most importantly , he gave me the two most amazing children in the world . <p> She described him as her " rock " and wrote that despite all her pain , if given the chance to do it all over , " I would still have walked down that aisle . Because 11 years of being Dave Goldbergs wife , and 10 years of being a parent with him is perhaps more luck and more happiness than I could have ever imagined . " <p> Her words reminded me of a lesser-known woman who lost her husband : my grandmother . While my grandparents did not live the public and jet-setting life of Sandberg and Goldberg , they clearly enjoyed a marriage that was equally blessed . Nearly ten years after his death , my grandmother only wants to talk about him . She recounts the story of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise , often losing herself in the moment and the memory . No doubt Sandbergs reflections on her marriage have prompted others to recall similarly strong marriages worthy of emulation . <p> About a month after her first remarks , Sandberg spoke again , this time at the end of sheloshim , the traditional Jewish thirty-day mourning period . Her nearly 2,000-word expression of raw grief went viral . Her Facebook post has been liked over 800,000 times and shared by almost 400,000 . She talked of her personal transformation through sorrow , writing , " I have lived thirty years in these thirty days . I am thirty years sadder . I feel like I am thirty years wiser . " <p> Sandberg did not have to grieve her husband publicly . She could have asked for privacy and left it at that . Instead , she chose to use her platform , even after losing her husband most tragically , to continue to honor her husband and to witness to the life-transforming partnership that is a good marriage . Though her situation is profoundly sad , she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about marriage , to desire the experience of being " truly supported and completely and utterly loved " until death , even untimely death . <p> So often we look to newlyweds as reminders of what an exciting and happy marriage looks like .

@@89589069 @5089069/ <p> Over the past couple centuries , declining mortality rates have made it possible for people to spend more years of their lives as sons or daughters , spouses , parents , and grandparents . Yet concurrent changes in marriage , divorce , and fertility patterns mean were spending smaller proportions of our lives in some of these roles . We spend a smaller fraction of our lifespan as spouses and parents of young children now than people did in the year 1800 , for instance . <p> What about as grandparents ? Falling mortality rates and delayed fertility push in opposite directions in this case . Todays older adults tended to have children later in life than their parents did ( if at all ) , and their grown children are putting off parenthood even more . On the other hand , adults can also expect to live longer , which might offset the effects of delayed parenthood on the time they will spend as grandparents . <p> Sociologist Rachel Margolis investigates how these changes have recently played out in Canada in an article for the Journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans have not evolved in identical ways , but are similar enough for her findings to have relevance here . The years she compared , with data from the Canadian General Social Survey and Canadian life tables , were 1985 and 2011 . Trends in declining mortality and delayed fertility were already well underway by 1985 , of course , and continued in the following years . <p> Margolis found that although fertility trends have resulted in people becoming grandparents at older ages , they were just as likely to ( eventually ) become grandparents in 2011 as in 1985 . In the 1985 , almost six in ten Canadian women in their early fifties were grandmothers ; in 2011 , less than three in ten . For men in their early fifties , the figures were 44 percent and 22 percent . <p> Despite first seeing the birth of a grandchild at older ages , women of 2011 could expect to spend a similar amount of time as grandmothers as their 1985 counterparts . Margolis estimated that a 20-year-old woman in 1985 could expect to be a grandparent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 ( a statistically insignificant difference ) . Womens increase in life expectancy meant that the proportion of life spent as a grandmother declined a bit . <p> The story was a bit different for men . Men , too , are becoming grandparents at older ageseven older ages than women . Yet mens larger increase in life expectancy ( about six years at age 20 , compared with around 3.5 years for women of the same age ) outweighed the effect of this trend , such that a 20-year-old man in 1985 would spend 17.0 years of life as a grandparent , whereas his 2011 counterpart would enjoy 18.9 years . Even proportionally , that means a slightly longer period of grandparenthood . <p> Might becoming a grandparent at a later age affect how much people can actually do with their growing grandkids ? The concern is not unfounded , but in Canada , at least , grandparents were healthier in 2011 than in 1985 , despite being older on average . And if people spend more years of grandparenthood as retirees , they could potentially be more involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grandchildren may have mixed effects on individuals health , Margolis writes that " grandparenthood is reported to be one of the most satisfying parts of older age .

@@89589073 @5089073/ <p> To win lifelong love today , many young adults must endure two big battles . <p> The first battle is to confront the past . About 70 percent of the 75 working-class young people my wife and I interviewed in southwest Ohio grew up in unstable families , marked by everything from divorce to abuse to addiction . For them , the task was to prove that they could be different . As Megan told us , " My parents had the craziest relationship in the world . And I always said I never wanted that for my kids . Never , ever , ever . And I always said that I would never get divorced , too . That I would only get married once , and I would never get divorced . I 've always said that . " <p> The legacy of family fragmentation makes some cautious about getting married . As much as they profess their love for their significant other , theyd rather buy time by living together for a few years if they have to in order to ensure that their " first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the children that they bear together are just one proof of a passionate attachment in the making . <p> Confronting the past involves a heroic effort to win trust in an age of distrust . In the background are scenes of their parents divorce , or abuse , or battles with drugs and mental illness . Sometimes a mom reminds her daughter that you ca n't trust men , or a dad admonishes his son that women are just out for the buck . The children acknowledge that their parents have reasons for believing these things , but they will be different . Difficulties become the impetus for grit . <p> The legacy of family fragmentation makes some cautious about getting married . <p> The second battle is to conquer the future : to write a different story than the one they have known in their own families , or at least perceive in the culture . Those who get married proudly mark their anniversaries : they 're like the couple in the country song that got married young , and people said theyd never last , but here they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , for many such couples , something happens . Sometimes its a terrible event : she finds out that he s abusing prescription pain pills ( then heroin ) , or he becomes physically abusive . Just as often , though , its something less dramatic : she becomes slowly bored with the marriage and then acts on her unhappiness by sleeping with the neighbor across the street . Or he loses his job , and they start fighting more often and conclude that theyve fallen out of love with each other . <p> Family researchers Paul R. Amato and Bryndl Hohmann-Marriott found that in a sample of more than 500 couples who divorced , about half had been in " high-distress " relationships , and about half in " low-distress " relationships . They also found that about a third of couples who divorced had at least one spouse who came from a divorced family , compared to only 16 percent of couples who stayed married . <p> Most of us understand how marriages marked by dramatic problems like violence or addiction or chronic infidelity dissolve . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do couples who say things like " I always said that I would never get divorced , " as Megan did , go on to divorce ? <p> In our interviews , my wife and I heard many young peoplewhether they were single , married , or divorcedrepeat a version of something that Tanya , who had filed for divorce , had told us : " Theres just a big , huge difference between loving somebody and being in love with somebody . " As she further explained , " I do n't  think that a woman or a man should be in a relationship where they are unhappy . Because when you have children and you 're unhappy , they 're unhappy . " She still loved the father of her children , she said , but she had fallen out of love with him ( which happened after he lost his job because of health issues ) , and that was the way life went . Her grandparents had a great marriage , she said , but life had changed since thenher own parents relationship did n't  work outand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In other words , the event that had been an impetus for gritthe breakdown of the parental relationship , or the perception that " divorce is everywhere " becomes the very force that withers grit . Judith Wallerstein , who spent years listening to the stories of children of divorce ( most of whom came from relatively affluent families ) , explained it this way : " A central finding to my research is that children identify not only with their mother and father as separate individuals but with the relationship between them . They carry the template of this relationship into adulthood and use it to seek the image of their new family . The absence of a good image negatively influences their search for love , intimacy , and commitment . " <p> The event that had been an impetus for grit can become the very force that withers grit . <p> Once " its easy for married couples to fall out of love " becomes tattooed in peoples mental make-up , they may not consciously think about it much , but its still there . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a force . Suddenly a person who swore that theyd never put their own kids through a divorce decides divorce is actually the best thing for their kids . But even people who demonstrate admirable grit and a " growth mindset " in other aspects of their lives may find it difficult to practice grit in their marriages . <p> In the absence of a loving , intact family , who nurtures trust and grit ? Conservatives advocate marriage , noting everything from its economic advantages to the benefits for children . What they say is true , but that message will fall on deaf ears among people with good reason to distrust marriage . Because you typically do n't  join an institution that you do n't  trust . Why would you ? And even when you do take the leap , there 's still the thought in the back of your mind : this could easily fail . <p> Not that people from fragmented families are the helpless victim of their parents choices and destined to eventually fail in their own marriages . I 've met couples in which both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One woman cheated on her husband before they achieved a difficult but successful reconciliation . Another couple were only high-school seniors when they found out she was pregnant . The next several years , they endured 70-hour work weeks trying to make ends meet and pay for his college education , all the while being newlyweds and trying to give their child the intact family they did n't  have growing up . Today , they 've been happily married for over ten years and enjoy financial security . I could go on with similar stories . But the legacy of family fragmentation does present specific challenges for many adult children of divorce , and it would be folly to pretend otherwise . <p> To take one example of the toll that family fragmentation takes on trust and grit , consider what 's happening in the workforce today , even in relatively prosperous areas . In the Cincinnati region , where I live , there are 25,000 jobs left unfilled on any given day . Manufacturers searching for skilled workers ( but not necessarily four-year college-educated ) and offering decent wages are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headline " Why regional employers cant find the workers they need " noted that 98 percent of the regions 100 largest privately held companies said that finding qualified workers was a challenge . <p> I believe deeper reasons are at play beyond the usual suspects , like lack of access to affordable child care and reliable transportation ( important as they are ) . I 've seen how the same ethic that now governs many marriages also governs some peoples relationship with work : as a friend once told me , if you 're not happy at work , you 're just going to make everyone else around you miserable . Better to just quit . Another friend told me that he lost a job because of his " anger issues , " which he believes stem at least in part from the years of physical abuse he suffered as a child . <p> Obviously , ones commitment to work shouldnt hold the same moral weight as ones commitment to a spouse ; we would n't advise a person to promise to work at the same company for better or worse , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic ( at least when we apply it to ourselves ! ) to the idea that you should work at a job that you love . But that ethic becomes a problem when it means that a person quits after their first experience of boredom or frustration , and is n't willing to invest the time and hard work necessary to move up in a company , or pad their resume with experience in order to get a better job . <p> When trust breaks down , meaning breaks down . <p> The legacy of family fragmentation is surely not the only saboteur to the formation of trust and grit , but its an important one . And " sabotage " is an apt description , because it conveys how ones deep desires for family stability must contend with persistent distrust : just as a woman meets a good man , she wonders how she deserves this . Just as a man finds a good job , he blows up at the supervisor because of deep-seated anger issues . <p> Trust is everything . Without trust , its difficult to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forge meaningand without meaning , grit is scarce : you can not persevere if you do n't  find meaning in your relationships , religion , work , or community . As Viktor Frankl was fond of quoting Friedrich Nietzsche , " He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how. " That 's why the crisis of trust metastasizes into a crisis of meaning . When trust breaks down , meaning breaks down . And I suspect that the crisis of trust is one of the deep roots of the rising mortality rates among working-class middle-aged white men and women . <p> But the loss of trust did n't  come out of nowhere ; it happened because people have good reasons to distrust . And in the coming weeks , I 'd like to explore the links between four big trends in American life today : family fragmentation , the economic hollowing out of the middle class , class segregation , and how all these trends collectively undermine civil society and the capacity to trust . These are four realities that conservatives and liberals are increasingly recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly they are affecting ordinary people and communities . <p> I 'd also like to explore how these realities might especially inform the idea of conservatism . If there is truth to the statement that " realities are more important than ideas " ( as Pope Francis is fond of saying ) , then conservatives will want to take a fresh look at these realities in order to craft an agenda fit for our times . 
@@89589076 @5089076/ <p> Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton added an important detail to her family agenda this week , outlining a plan to double the child tax credit for families with children 4 and under from $1,000 to $2,000 .

In contrast , her childcare plan leaves a substantial share of American families and children out in the cold .

What 's more : a majority of American parents believe having an at-home parent is ideal for kids . <p> 36 Percent of Families with Children 4 and Under Have a Stay-at-Home Parent <p> As the figure below indicates , 36 percent of families with children 4 and under have a parent who is at home or not working .

But as Figure 2 indicates , the basic story remains much the same . Twenty-nine percent of families with children 18 and under have a stay-at-home parent , typically the mother .

And only 36 percent of children 4 and under live in a family where both parents work 35 hours a week or more outside the home .

So I 'm probably like the worst person to interview about making a decision on the future of my marriage . I 'm not the type of person who says Oh yeah , right away , I 'm going to divorce him I do n't  know . <p> Harris : Do you want to know what I 'm finding out in these interviews ? It feels like most people we 've been talking to are in the same type of situation as you . <p> Participant : Really ? <p> Harris : I think that a lot of people would really identify with the snow globe . I think its going to be really helpful for us to use it as a metaphor for how people think about where they 're at in this divorce decision-making process . <p> Participant : Well good , because I feel like I 'm all alone . You know ? <p> Harris:Yeah , you 're the snowman trying to figure everything out . <p> Participant : Yeah , you get itSo , all I have is my mixed up snow globe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all falling around me . But I do n't  have the worst marriage . I may not have the best , but I do n't  have the worst . And I 'm still trying to figure it all out 26 years later . <p> A Turbulent and Confusing Process <p> Indeed , many of the people we interviewed seemed to have stories similar to this womans . They did n't  think they had the best marriages around , but they werent the worst marriages either . There seemed to be enough good in their marriages to have kept them from pursuing divorce up to this point . But every now and then , the struggles and trials of their marriages would really tempt them to think that something better might be out there . Its also worth noting that during other parts of the interview , this particular woman talked about good times she had recently enjoyed with her husband , and said she wished they could do more things together to get their marriage back on track . <p> Others we interviewed used different ways to describe what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about their desire for more clarity in how they were thinking about the future of their marriage . They suggested that getting clarity was often elusive or even fleeting . And many participantswell over half of those we interviewedwere worried about making the " wrong " decision , and the impact this would have on them and others , especially their children . This womans particular metaphor seemed to capture the turbulent and confusing nature of the divorce decision-making process , where so much is on the line . <p> What can we learn from the womans story above ? Perhaps we can learn that it is normal for individuals to struggle to find clarity and confidence when thinking about the future of their marriage , and especially when deciding whether or not to divorce . Accurately judging between an unknown future and a current reality is impossible , so the idea that most people head confidently into divorce is probably unrealistic . Based on our research , most people who are struggling to find clarity need to understand that there 's nothing wrong with their desire to be clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably worth taking the time to make a decision that reflects clarity of thought and confidence in the outcome . <p> Steven M.

@@89589093 @5089093/ <p> Stagnant wages among men without college degrees and rising unmarried parenthood among high school graduates with little or no college education represent two critical challenges facing the United States . Both trends increase income inequality and prevent people from entering into and remaining in the middle class . <p> One symptom of the problem is the declining labor force participation of men at middle levels of education and at prime working ages . Nearly half of 25- to 49-year-old men are high school graduates ( or GED completers ) without an associates or bachelors degree . Long-term trends as well as current economic weakness have been bad news for this group . For men with no more than a high school degree , joblessness doubled from 7.5% in 1979 to 15.5% in 2007 just before the Great Recession . As of early 2013 , 22% of these prime-age men were not employed . Over the same period , married fatherhood plummeted among high school graduate men , falling from 65% in 1979 to 38% in 2013 .

By the time former apprentices reach age 65 , benefits to taxpayers reach $23 for each dollar spent . <p> Apprenticeships train people by combining work-based learning with classroom instruction in a unified program that leads to a recognized and valued occupational credential .

@@89589097 @5089097/ <p> In spite of recent optimism , it seems the divorce crisis continues . A 2014 report in the journal Demography provides evidence that the divorce rate has doubled over the past two decades among people over 35 . The same report indicates that while divorce rates are declining among Millennials this is most likely because they are choosing cohabitation over ( or at least before ) marriage . These findings underscore the urgency of recent calls to explore new conceptual models of how and why divorce happensin particular , models that account for variability in process and outcomes , identify mediating and moderating variables , and focus on factors underlying divorce among low-conflict marriages . <p> A current debate within the Catholic Church might provide the framework for such a model . The debate concerns the question of whether the Church should relax its long-standing teaching that Catholics who civilly divorce and remarry without first receiving a declaration of nullity can not receive Communion . Much can be said about the merits of this proposal but one unanticipated outcome of the discussion has been greater awareness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchs teaching that marriage is permanent and exclusive . Some who have remarried without annulments choose to live as " brother and sister " in order to continue to receive Communion . Others , divorced against their will , choose a life of sacrifice in order to remain faithful to their first vows . <p> Our narrative about how and why divorce occurs seems incomplete to many who have experienced its effects . The desire to probe its deeper , underlying causes seems weak in a culture that generally views divorce as a doorway to new beginnings . We know a great deal from social science research about average differences in outcomes between family members who experience divorce and those who do n't  . We know that , on average , divorce harms children across a wide array of adjustment indices , that around two thirds of divorces occur in marriages that were not characterized by conflict , and that the most common reasons for divorce today revolve around normal problems that occur in most marriages ( e.g. , " growing apart " ) . We know that children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But we know very little about individual variation in the processof divorce and its generational transmission : who is doing what , and why , and how , at the level of the family . We know virtually nothing about the differential psychological , economic , moral , and spiritual impact of divorce on children with an abandoned but still committed parenta parent who rejected the divorce , sought to save a low-conflict marriage , and remained committed to the marriage even after a civil divorce . <p> In my experience as a psychologist , and as one who helped start a program to strengthen marriages and prevent divorce at a large , suburban church , I have become aware , over time , of many low-conflict marriages in which one spouse has an extramarital affair , employs " no-fault divorce " laws to abandon his or her still committed spouse , and then cohabits with or marries the affair partner . What these spouses leave behind is often devastating : adults and children trapped in anguish , confusion , disbelief , fear , and helplessness . <p> Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems reasonable and prudent to identify how many of these divorces fit this description . It would also be useful to learn how regular exposure to the affair partner over timea routine practice often replete with emotional and physical dangerimpacts a child whose other parent resisted the divorce and continued to teach that marriage is permanent and exclusive . <p> A collaborative effort to identify and describe factors that influence the divorce process through the perspectives of abandoned but still committed spouses might reveal behaviors and characteristics that mitigate some of the negative consequences of divorce among low-conflict marriages . <p> One might predict , for example , that men and women who resist moving on to a new partner in a culture that generally shows contempt for such restraint might also demonstrate a strong commitment to a religious faith ( although certainly this need not be the case ) an attribute associated with positive outcomes in adults and adolescents , a willingness to sacrifice in the face of hardship , and emotional and spiritual maturity . <p> These parentsreligious or notmay be uniquely disposed to provide regular , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral development , as well as clear , age-appropriate messages to the children about how and why families are hurt when one spouse abandons the other ( in contrast to the " we love you honey , we just do n't  love each other " approach , the effectiveness of which is highly questionable ) . <p> If some or all of these predictions hold , we might ask what distinct impact these parental attributes have on the children . Are they more likely than other children of divorce to demonstrate a willingness to sacrifice in marriage as adults ? Are they more likely to choose marriage over cohabitation , or to have successful , permanent marriages ? Are the children , having experienced the stark contrast between two pathways following an unwanted divorce , more likely to become advocates in the wider culture for faithful , lifelong marriage ? <p> Other mediating and moderating factors influencing the divorce process might be identified as well . For example : the frequency with which parents of abandoned spouses step in as surrogates for the spouse who left a low-conflict marriagesacrificing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial burden of parenthood . What are their observations about how and why the divorce happened ? <p> In what ways do family court judges support or undermine the efforts of an abandoned spouse to protect their children from destructive behaviors of the abandoning spouse ( e.g. , repeated exposure to pornography due to lack of monitoring ) ? More broadly , do modern family courts , in their emphasis on adult rights , routinely undermine the traditional belief systems families held prior to the abandonment ? <p> This research might also help to clarify who actually benefits from a spouses moving on to one or more sexual relationships . Divorcees are increasingly choosing to cohabit rather than remarrya distinctly precarious situation for children . Nonetheless , children of divorce whose parents do remarry have a significantly higher chance of getting divorced in adulthood compared to those whose parents never remarry . And yet , moving on to a new partner is frequently described in social science research as predictive of " well being " ( especially for those who initiated the divorce ) . Perhaps it is time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one that represents the perspective of the family left behind . <p> Finally , this line of investigation could inform not only our understanding of how to provide practical and meaningful help to abandoned spouses and their children , but also insight into the behaviors and attitudes that impact the likelihood of spousal abandonment among low-conflict marriages . For example , we know that family and friends support for marriages influences marriage satisfaction and risk of divorce , and that the risk of divorce is transmitted through social networks . <p> To what extent is the process of spousal abandonment influenced , positively or negatively , by family members , peers , marriage therapists , family court officials , and churches ? Do the parents and siblings of one who has an affair and threatens to leave his or her spouse condone and enable that decision , or do they try in concrete ways to prevent the divorce and defend the marriage bond ? What about marriage therapists ? Priests and ministers ? Answers to these questions would strengthen existing long-term strategies to increase the odds of success for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences that further the divorce cycle , and to educate and equip individuals at every level of society to help protect marriages . <p> We need new conceptual models of divorce . We also need role models for marriage . This is where social science and society could benefit from the seemingly narrow conversation taking place within the Catholic Church . The nation , and our young people in particular , need to see that fidelity to the marriage voweven under the most undesirable and difficult of circumstancesis possible . Not only is it possible , but it may prove to be the strong foundation we need to turn the marriage crisis around .

Being involved , supported , and engaged with othersas a couple , and not just individuallyappears to allow couples to strengthen their relationship and protect it against factors that they may be less able to influence , such as finances and where they live . <p> We should devote greater attention to how aspects of couples social environment can promote , rather than undermine , marital quality . <p> Thirdly and more broadly , books such as Robert Putnams Bowling Alone and Alone Together ( by Paul Amato and colleagues ) have highlighted the formidable declines in social integration among American individuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement are weakening across society , and the private sphere is , in a sense , becoming ever more private . In light of the benefits of social integration documented here and elsewhere , this decline suggests couples may be losing a resource that protects their marital happiness . Ensuring social integration among married couples , therefore , may require more explicit attention and effort . <p> Study 2 <p> In the second study , 2 we examined the effects of felt spousal gratitudespouses sense of feeling appreciated , acknowledged , and valued by their partner . Multiple recent studies have touted the benefits of being grateful for your partner ; such gratitude is linked to higher satisfaction , greater stability , and a more communal orientation in relationships . Yet we wanted to know : What are the results of feeling gratitude from your partner ? In particular , we investigated its direct effect on aspects of marital quality as well as its ability to interrupt the negative sequence of events linking financial distress , negative communication ( i.e. , demand/withdraw interaction patterns ) , and lower marital quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more gratitude from their partners reported higher marital happiness , more commitment , and ( among wives only ) fewer thoughts of divorce .

Those high in felt spousal gratitude did not report greater risk for marital instability , even with high levels of demand/withdraw interactions . <p> What do the findings from this second study mean ? Three additional observations : <p> First , even couples who are not great at handling conflict can find other practical ways to strengthen their marriage , like doing and saying things to make sure their partner feels appreciated . Not every couple is going to be stellar at communication during conflict , but making a habit of saying " thank you " regularly and demonstrating appreciation by other means may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any married person can attest , a lot of marriage is comprised of mundane matters : running errands , cleaning dishes , getting kids ready for school .

Thinking through the fundamental dynamics that positively or negatively shape peoples everyday experience of marriageand how to effectively intervene in themremains an important question for couples , therapists , and researchers . <p> Third , negative communication patterns appear to be less costly to marital stability when spousal gratitude is strong . In this way , gratitude may provide what some marital researchers have described as a " Teflon " effect.3 Gratitude , in essence , can envelop a couple and prevent negative behaviors and emotions from " sticking " to them and negatively altering their thoughts and behaviors toward their spouse . <p> Summary <p> Couple social integration and felt spousal gratitude : Two significant , yet potentially underemphasized ( or at least under-investigated ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .

Being involved , supported , and engaged with othersas a couple , and not just individuallyappears to allow couples to strengthen their relationship and protect it against factors that they may be less able to influence , such as finances and where they live . <p> We should devote greater attention to how aspects of couples social environment can promote , rather than undermine , marital quality . <p> Thirdly and more broadly , books such as Robert Putnams Bowling Alone and Alone Together ( by Paul Amato and colleagues ) have highlighted the formidable declines in social integration among American individuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement are weakening across society , and the private sphere is , in a sense , becoming ever more private . In light of the benefits of social integration documented here and elsewhere , this decline suggests couples may be losing a resource that protects their marital happiness . Ensuring social integration among married couples , therefore , may require more explicit attention and effort . <p> Study 2 <p> In the second study , 2 we examined the effects of felt spousal gratitudespouses sense of feeling appreciated , acknowledged , and valued by their partner . Multiple recent studies have touted the benefits of being grateful for your partner ; such gratitude is linked to higher satisfaction , greater stability , and a more communal orientation in relationships . Yet we wanted to know : What are the results of feeling gratitude from your partner ? In particular , we investigated its direct effect on aspects of marital quality as well as its ability to interrupt the negative sequence of events linking financial distress , negative communication ( i.e. , demand/withdraw interaction patterns ) , and lower marital quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more gratitude from their partners reported higher marital happiness , more commitment , and ( among wives only ) fewer thoughts of divorce . Moreover , spousal gratitude countered the negative effects of demand/withdraw interaction on indicators of marital stability ( see Figure 2 ) . In each instance , increasing levels of demand/withdraw were associated with greater instability ( i.e. , less commitment , more thoughts of divorce ) , but only among individuals who felt low levels of gratitude from their spouses . Those high in felt spousal gratitude did not report greater risk for marital instability , even with high levels of demand/withdraw interactions . <p> What do the findings from this second study mean ? Three additional observations : <p> First , even couples who are not great at handling conflict can find other practical ways to strengthen their marriage , like doing and saying things to make sure their partner feels appreciated . Not every couple is going to be stellar at communication during conflict , but making a habit of saying " thank you " regularly and demonstrating appreciation by other means may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any married person can attest , a lot of marriage is comprised of mundane matters : running errands , cleaning dishes , getting kids ready for school . Gratitude ( or lack thereof ) may play a key role in how the multitudes of simple events that comprise a marriage eventually come to shape the bigger picture of marital satisfaction and stability . Thinking through the fundamental dynamics that positively or negatively shape peoples everyday experience of marriageand how to effectively intervene in themremains an important question for couples , therapists , and researchers . <p> Third , negative communication patterns appear to be less costly to marital stability when spousal gratitude is strong . In this way , gratitude may provide what some marital researchers have described as a " Teflon " effect.3 Gratitude , in essence , can envelop a couple and prevent negative behaviors and emotions from " sticking " to them and negatively altering their thoughts and behaviors toward their spouse . <p> Summary <p> Couple social integration and felt spousal gratitude : Two significant , yet potentially underemphasized ( or at least under-investigated ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Importantly , both of these processes also seem malleable to intervention , and capable of being changed by couples themselves . The more we are able to help couples strengthen aspects of their relationship that they can controlsuch as connecting with their community and making sure each partner feels appreciatedthe more we can help them overcome the difficult circumstances that are beyond their control . <p> Allen W.

@@89589103 @5089103/ <p> The Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , which provides a tax credit of $2,982 on average to low-income working parents when they file their taxes each year , is among the nations most vital anti-poverty policies . In its current form , the credit becomes more generous to very low earners as they work more . At a certain level of household income , however , the benefits are phased outand this set-up comes with a number of drawbacks . <p> For example , a single mother with a modest annual income and one qualifying child could obtain as much as $3,305 from the federal EITC . If she marries an employed man , their credit would shrink as the EITC is phased out . This is one example of a means-tested program that can dissuade working mothers from marrying the father of their newly-born child and incentivize them to simply cohabit instead . <p> A second problem with the current EITC and the tax system more broadly is that they provide virtually no benefits to lower middle-class parents . Such families have too much income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income to avail themselves of several child-related programs benefiting those in the upper-half of the income distributionflexible spending accounts , childcare tax credits , and pretax college-savings plans . In a widely circulated 2000 paper , David Ellwood and Jeffrey Liebman labeled this the " middle-class parent penalty . " <p> To address both problems , I have put forward the New Mothers Tax Relief proposal , which constructs an alternative EITC schedule for families that have one qualifying child under the age of six . It provides a more generous EITC for these families by raising the income level at which the phasing-out of credits beginsto $42,000 for married couple and $19,000 for head-of-household familiesand lowering the phase-out rates to 6 percent for married couples and 12 percent for head-of-household families . <p> Table 1 indicates the additional income these changes would provide to families depending on their marital status and incomes : more than $2,000 to married couples with incomes between $40,000 and $60,000 and at least $600 to head-of-household families with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000 . ( These exact same benefits would be grafted onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . ) All of the benefits are targeted to families with young children , who are the families that most need the extra credits to pay for their added expenses . <p> My proposal also ensures that the tax system will not penalize couples for marrying . Many child advocates are concerned that more and more children are being raised by unmarried parents , and one factor behind the drop in marriage rates may be safety net programs that are more generous to single parents . Table 2 indicates the size of the current federal marriage penaltythe amount of money a couple stands to lose if they marryas we vary the incomes of the two partners . If a single mother with one child earns $15,000 , she would receive the maximum EITC , but if she marries a partner earning $25,000 the EITC they receive would drop to $630 , a reduction of $2,675 . While they will save a bit on other federal income tax liabilities , their disposable income will be lowered by $2,476 . In some cases the marriage penalty reaches $3,000 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs and other means-tested safety net programs . <p> By increasing the income level for married-couple families at which the phase-out of EITC benefits begins , we can eliminate the federal marriage penalty for a wide range of working partners , and in some cases actually provide marriage bonuses ( Table 3 ) . For example , the hypothetical couple I described above would gain a marriage bonus of $199 rather than pay a marriage penalty of $2,476 . These changes will allow many new parents to base a marriage decision on factors other than the federal marriage penalty they currently face . In addition , the additional funds for lower-earning married couples will reduce their financial stresses , which can exacerbate relationship tensions that sometimes lead to divorce . <p> The New Mothers Tax Relief proposal is well targeted . It only provides benefits to families with pre-school aged children . While all married couples with incomes up to $97,000 will gain some benefits , the vast majority of the benefits go to families with income less than $60,000 . As a result , it is likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children under age six , or less than $10 billion if limited to families with a child under three . <p> There are other proposals aimed at reducing the federal marriage penalty that working single mothers face , but they are much more expensive and often require a number of changes to the tax system . By contrast , this proposal does n't  increase the complexity of filing taxes . Families will simply choose which EITC schedule to use : the current one or the new one depending on whether they have a qualifying young child . It is about time that we target benefits to families with very young children , and by doing it through the EITC , we can largely eliminate the federal marriage penalty low-income mothers face at the same time . <p> Robert Cherry is Stern Professor in Economics at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York . 
@@89589105 @5089105/ <p> Most Americans are aware of the feelings of powerlessness that pervade the white working class in America . Well documented , also , are the policy proposals and community outreach initiatives being considered to correct the problems working-class America is facing . <p> In Hillbilly Elegy , J.D. Vanceopened up for discussion a third prong to these restoration efforts : personal agency and what working-class individuals can do for themselves to restore their lives and communities . Vance , who credits his grandmothers persistence in urging him to never believe " the deck is stacked against you , " explains : <p> " There is something powerful about realizing that you 've undersold yourselfthat somehow your mind confused lack of effort for inability . This is why whenever people ask me what I 'd most like to change about the white working class , I say , The feeling that our choices do n't  matter. " <p> Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck refers to this as cultivating a growth mindset . " In this mindset , " she explains , " the hand you 're dealt is just the starting point for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can cultivate through your efforts . " <p> For the past two years , my colleagues and I at the I Believe in Love ( iBiL ) project have found storytelling to be one way to unleash this personal agency or growth mindset in the lives of working-class young adults , particularly as it relates to their personal and romantic relationships . <p> " Our interpretations are rooted in the narratives we construct about ourselves and the social world , " writes Timothy Wilson , a University of Virginia psychologist , in his book , Redirect , " and sometimeswe interpret things in unhealthy ways that have negative consequences . We could solve a lot of problems if we could get people to redirect their interpretations in healthier directions . " <p> We stumbled onto Wilsons work after we had begun working with working-class writers at iBiL . His conclusions affirm our experiences of how sharing stories can become that springboard of redirection and personal empowerment for so many young adults in the working-class community . Namely , we discovered that inviting working-class young adults to write and publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of those in their communities in three powerful ways . <p> Storytelling Provides an Opportunity for Individual Reflection and Change <p> One of our long-standing writers came to her editor with a predicament . This young single mother has two children from two different fathers and was desperate to get out of subsidized housing . She had recently started dating someone , who at the time she thought possessed a lot of what she was looking for in a man . But when he started asking her , very early in the relationship , to move in with him , she found herself feeling unsure . <p> Shed cohabited before , but through writing for iBiL reached the conclusion that her tendency to have sex early in relationships has hurt her in a deeply psychological and spiritual way . She wanted to really get to know a person before making such a commitment . <p> Our editor suggested she write a blog post about her thoughts . Our writer began the post with a key question : " Am I moving too fast ? " As she described her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized a pattern of moving into the physical realm together too quickly , and then years spent in a relationship that she knew in her heart was n't quite right . <p> She concluded that yes , to move in at this juncture would be too soon . And not too long after that , she realized that guy was n't the man she was looking for in her future . To be sure , our program principles state that iBiL is unequivocally against cohabitation ( which our writer knew ) and that we try not to feed the " soul mate mentality " of love . <p> Instead of giving instruction , our goal is to equip our writers and editors with information , then give them space and the permission to listen to that inner voice we all have and decide for themselves whether a particular decision or behavior is good or bad . Shortly after she confided in us about her situation , this writer told us she was grateful we encouraged her to reflect on her own about her decision because everyone else in her lifeher mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a man who wanted to take care of her . " <p> There is a significant lack of healthy relationship models in the communities of many of our writers . These young adults know that the dysfunctional cycle of relationships on which they were raised needs to change for themselves and their children . Yet they feel utterly lost about where to turn for support and how to make a change . The writing process has given them the space to pause and consider how past patterns impacted their relationships , and how current and future choices can be fresh steps toward their ultimate goals . This process unleashes that personal agency J.D. Vance discusses . <p> Storytelling Allows Individuals to be of Service to Others <p> The false narrative of powerlessness within the working class has created negative stereotypes about working-class individuals . These stereotypes about drugs , laziness , and crassnessto name a fewcut deeply at their feelings of worth and ability , especially because the life circumstances of many were out of their control . Their reactionsthough not always correctare understandable in light of the immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Redirect , Wilson talks about the " do good , be good " approach as a way of helping vulnerable populations . " Peoples behavior shapes the personal narrative they develop , " Wilson explains . " If they act kindly toward others , they begin to see themselves as having kind dispositions , and the more they view themselves as kind , the more likely they are to help othersthereby strengthening the new narrative . " <p> Put another way : understanding our stories can help us to see how goodness can be found in each individual and how that goodness can flourish if given the space to do so . <p> For example , one young man wrote about how the love of his now wife , then girlfriend , helped him overcome meth addiction . Just the process of telling his story helped him to see that what he could easily have continued to process as a failure instead could be turned into a lesson of courage and strength for others . <p> A reader of his post commented : <p> " All I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you how much this has helped me with the situation I am dealing with right now . Maybe someday I 'll be able to write a similar story to help someone else . " <p> For our writer , that comment was an affirmation that his struggle had been used for goodto give hope to another person . This helped encourage him to desire to continue to do good with his life . <p> Writers at iBiL have found that the process of telling their stories has led them to be more intentional in all their relationships . Theyve begun to see how their behavior impacts the people around them and how their good choices can become a force for goodin their families , their communities , and the culture at large . <p> Storytelling Helps Individuals Remember They Are Not Alone <p> Its a phrase we hear often at iBiL : " I 'm so glad I 'm not alone . " The lack of social capitalfriendships and community supporthas been well documented by researchers such as Charles Murray and Robert Putnam . This social isolation can be especially devastating when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Thanks for sharing your experience .

Thanks so much for sharing with the world what you have been through and inspiring us . " <p> This article is one of many with similar comments , posted either on Facebook or the article itself , and sentiments we hope to grow as we interact more with our writers , editors , and readers . Feelings and experiences on the path to lasting love and marriage , while personal in nature , have a universal element that can be shared .

That is to say , it is wonderful for the sort of young person who has a drivers license , a credit card , and a W-4 . Sushi bars and bistros beckon from every corner . Receptions and social gatherings offer the tantalizing possibility of proximity to power . In a recent study by the job website " Career Bliss , " DC was found to be the nations third happiest city for young professionals . For the ambitious and upwardly mobile , Washington is the land of milk , honey , and glittering opportunity . <p> For the diapered , lunch-box-toting or pig-tailed young , the story is quite different . More than half of babies in D.C. are born out of wedlock . Nearly a third of children live at or below the poverty line . The public schools consistently rank among the nations worst . All in all , Washington is a miserable city in which to be a child . <p> The capital is not unique .

Joel Kotkin and Ali Modarres have recently described this phenomenon in " The Childless City , " explaining that rising rents and rising crime emptied American cities of middle-class families in the decades following the Second World War . Literally and figuratively , parents went in search of greener pastures . Affordable housing , low crime , better schools , and open space could be found in small towns and suburbs . <p> Urban " kiddie deserts " have become a haven for the childless rich , a trap for the poor , and a no-mans land for middle-income families . <p> Today urban America is a story of two classes . The childless elite and the struggling poor live side by side but are not on speaking terms . Meanwhile a functional family culture is all but extinct , and increasingly , Alan Kotlowitzs declaration that " there are no children here " is becoming a literal reality . <p> Kotkin and Modarres worry about the sustainability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional citizens , it is difficult for a city to maintain its economic and cultural vitality , as can already be seen in failing cities like Detroit . But the phenomenon of the childless city should also be disquieting to anyone who is interested in marriage and family formation . <p> Todays educated young singles lead an unnaturally child-free existence . It begins in college , and continues in urban kiddie deserts where they are surrounded by fellow singles , developing a dynamic social life that is completely free of car seats and parent-teacher conferences . Young people have always enjoyed their liberty , and these child-free environments are tailor-made to gratify their desires for entertainment , social interaction , professional advancement and , of course , sex . But there is nothing in this world to tell them when it is time to move on . Perhaps unsurprisingly , some of them never do . <p> It is well known by now that birth rates are falling across the developed world as the voluntarily " child-free " life becomes a respected and even celebrated alternative to parenthood . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . A 2009 Pew study found that Washington , D.C. , has the lowest marriage rates in the country : an incredible 77% of Washingtons women were unmarried at the time of the study . Those who do tie the knot tend to do so later in life , and then ( especially if they 're college graduates ) they may wait a few more years to have a child . Thus the average college-educated woman gets married at around age 27 and has her first baby around age 30 , after roughly 12 years of living child-free . Just forty years ago , she would have been closer to 23 and 26 years old as she completed those milestones . <p> Historically , young adulthoodthat is , the late teens and early twentiesis the phase of life in which people begin having children .

Harrowingaccounts of new parenthood appear regularly in publications like the Huffington Post , confirming what any observer of youth culture would naturally expect . After years of projecting competence in competitive environments , young women feel lonely and overwhelmed by the challenges of dealing with a needy infant and adapting to a completely new social situation . Postpartum depression has become a major problem in America both for moms and for dads . <p> Raising kids is much harder for young people who have few domestic skills and no idea what to expect . <p> What can we do at this juncture ?

Build parks . Improve schools . Keep crime under control . Welcome middle-class families back to U.S. cities . Young Americans need to see family life as the fulfillment , not as an interruption , of the life that they want to have . When they do , our nation can recover the human resources that it needs to thrive .

Then just after 7 p.m. he texted me again saying that he had gotten caught up in research , but that he was on his way home . When he arrived home about 8:15 p.m. , the kids who were not used to an 8 p.m. bedtime were still awake : our three-year-old threw her arms around my husbands neck and called him her wonderful Daddy . He called her his wonderful daughter , and they played a little tickling game . I smiled at the joy their reunion brought . <p> I could spin this story to emphasize gender inequality .

He texted me because he was concerned they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , leaving me to execute the new rule after hours of solo childcare . <p> According to a paper recently presented at the American Sociological Association that has received much media attention , egalitarian childcare like we practiced the other day contributes to a great sex life . Wait : did we practice egalitarian childcare ? The study assigns couples into one of three categories for childcare patternsthe woman does the majority of childcare , the childcare is shared equally , and the man does the majority of childcarebased not on the time they spent caring for children , but rather on who was responsible for 1 ) rule-making , 2 ) praising the child , 3 ) playing with the child , and 4 ) rule enforcement . My husband took responsibility in everything besides rule enforcement through a few texts and a brief joyful reunion with his three-year-old . Then later when he was sharing his ice cream with that still-awake girl , he told her that in our family we do n't  put our hands in each others food ( she should eat off the spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My point is simply that shared responsibility in these four domains does not mean egalitarian childcare . CNN covered this research with the headline : " Couples who share the burdens of childcare are happier together . " How many of us actually find praising our children burdensome ? And when we assume responsibility for it , does it actually cost us much time ? Other parenting responsibilities are time-consuming , like packing lunches and supervising homework , but rule-making , praising , and playing can be light burdens . The authors of the study are quick to acknowledge that they have not measured everything about childcare : the lead author , Daniel Carlson , told CNN that it was not clear whether men were doing their share of cooking or cleaning for the children , and the paper itself also emphasizes that they have n't measured other childcare tasks like cuddling , transportation , and communication with teachers . <p> Nonetheless , Carlson and his colleagues claim to have shown that couples who share the responsibility for childcare have better sex lives . Previous peer-reviewed research had shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more and better sex , but that data reflected married couples experiences from the last quarter of the twentieth century . The new study used more recent data and avoided a bias toward conservatism among couples by including cohabiters . In the conclusion , the researchers state , " Unlike the past , egalitarianism today is associated with better , more intimate relationships than gender traditional arrangements . " <p> I remain unconvinced that they have supported the idea that egalitarianism is a greater turn-on than behavior that emphasizes gender differences . I have already started to explain the first reason I 'm unconvinced : they did n't  measure egalitarianism in childcare . I 'm not just pouting about having to put the kids to bed alone last night and still qualifying as egalitarian according to their measure . I 'd also invite you to consider how even a patriarchal husband would score as egalitarian : if he did all the rule-making unilaterally and shared equally in the rule enforcement ( she stopped bad behavior during the day and he doled out punishment spankings at night ) , he and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale Carlson and his colleagues used . All the patriarch has to do to pick up that one point is praise his kids a bit ( but less then his wife ; equal responsibility for praising would get him two points ) . <p> Take a far less extreme example . Previous research has shown that men interact with children through play even more than women do . That means a guy that plays with his kidsparticularly roughhousingis following a traditionally male script . The same holds true for setting rules , which is a traditionally male domain . If a man takes more responsibility than his partner in these two domains , less responsibility in praising , and none in rule enforcement , he is egalitarian . <p> Finally , please also consider what kind of guy does n't  make the all-too-low egalitarian threshold . How uninvolved do you have to be to not take responsibility for setting rules for your kids ? How cold do you have to be to not take responsibility for praising them ? Im married to a guy who loves our kids . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed . If instead he were uninterested in the children we brought into the world together , I would n't care what time he came to bed . <p> Given that " egalitarian " men in this widely publicized study might not be , and that couples characterized as having traditional gender roles might be better characterized as having uninvolved fathers , I do n't  think this study tells us anything about egalitarianism and fun in bed .

In a fifth-of-a-second glance at a potential mate , the brain feels a thrill . A neurological cocktail of adrenaline , dopamine , and oxytocin floods the head and lights up the eyes .

If you liked me it would be my first ever victory . Love Jake . <p> During Valentines season , we celebrate the passion of love by spending approximately 19.7 billion dollars on chocolate , pedicures , and little message-stamped hearts that look and taste like sidewalk chalk . The holiday is named for St. Valentine who , as legend reports , was a priest in third century Rome . At that time , the emperor made a decree that young men should remain single to focus on their military pursuits . Valentine defied the emperor by marrying young lovers in secret . Eventually , he was found out and put to death . We revere his legacy now by grabbing and gifting plastic-wrapped flowers . But flowers , like passion , can wilt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passion . Love in its complete form has two parts : passion and friendship . Love often begins with excitement , but it is maintained by being planted in a stable bond . In the brain , these two states light up in different but overlapping areas . Early excitement activates in the brain as desire , ecstasy , and goal-directed pursuit . But the brains response to a cherished long-term spouse looks like contentment , caring , and nurturing . <p> Many relationships go cold because one or both of these sides of love are neglected . This happened with married clients I will call Victor and Vicky . They were in a rut . Victor had been downsized and was working a low-paying temp job , and they were behind on their mortgage . Vicky was working part-time at a call center , but her shift was early , while Victors was until 9:00 each night . Their sons grade school was calling them regularly because of his disruptive behavior .

When I asked what types of fun they used to have , they described going to social gaming groups and playing as a couple . " We loved board games , " Victor said , " but now we are just bored . " <p> Part of their challenge was to schedule a time to talk , have fun , and cuddle . They worked on using supportive words rather than grunts or nods . Research has found that couples who remain close over years are those who support each others interests , growth , and feelings . Spouses who respond to each others words positively are also more physically attracted to each other . Just being nice is connected to being passionate . Another study found that for both husbands and wives , the biggest factor in how satisfied they felt about the sex , romance , and passion in their relationship was the quality of their friendship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revive their relationship , they just needed to act like good friends and respond to each other with kindness and attention . <p> Passion and friendship are related , and both can be strengthened . Victor and Vicky recommitted to a once-a-week date , pulled out their Monopoly board , and got their work schedules in sync . This increased the quality and quantity of their time together , and they once again felt close . <p> How is your relationship doing ? Is it rooted in a rich friendship ? Are you feeling passion ? It may need some tender loving care . A relationship that is nourished with love will stay fresh and alive for a lifetime . 
@@89589116 @5089116/ <p> When I began my research , Paul was already an established expert on the consequences of growing up with divorced parents . He started writing about the intergenerational transmission of divorce around the same time I did and published numerous articles about it in peer-reviewed journals . His two most important papers ( here and here ) greatly deepened our understanding of why growing up in a divorced family has such a profound effect on offspring marital behavior . Both were discussed at length in my book . <p> Given our shared research interest , I was pleased to see that Paul has resumed his study of the intergenerational transmission of divorce ( not to mention surprised , as Paul has been officially retired for several years now ) in an article recently published in Journal of Marriage and Family . Paul and his coauthor Sarah E. Patterson , a graduate student at Penn State , replicate and update work on the divorce cycle that I originally published in a 2000 article published in Journal of Family Issues . Pauls new work combines one well-established insight from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the adult offspring of divorced parents typically behave in their own romantic relationships . <p> The established insight is that every family structure transition a child experiences in his or her family of origin cumulatively increases the likelihood of negative outcomes for that child . Parental divorce is one transition , while remarriage is another . If that remarriage does n't  work out , a child will have experienced three family structure transitions . My work has shown this , though the best-known demonstration of this principle is probably a 1993 article by NYU sociologist Lawrence Wu . Both Wus work and my own establish that simply counting the number of family structure transitions that a child experiences is the best empirical means of assessing how family structure of origin will ultimately affect offspring behavior . <p> At this juncture , I have a quibble with how Paul designed his new study . He chose to count bereavement as a family structure transition , while my work ignored parental death . Why did I exclude it ? There are numerous studies showing that compared to divorce , death has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-author cite a single study in support of this decision , but a preponderance of studiesall reviewed in my 2005 booksupport my decision . And my own analyses of two different national data sets showed that bereavement does n't  really make a difference when the affected children become marriageable adults themselves . Ultimately this is n't a big deal , given that relatively few modern marriage-age adults experience the death of a parent while growing up . <p> With all of that in mind , what 's the important but understudied dimension of relationship behavior that Paul and his co-author measure ? Aside from my 2000 Journal of Family Issues paper , their new research is the only study on the divorce cycle that I know of that looks at relationship trajectories , not just first marriages . In other words , this new study is concerned with whether the adult children of divorce have distinctive patterns of behavior in romantic relationships . To this end , they count the number of unions , marital or live-in , that end in disruption ( they share my regret of not being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure accurately ) . <p> Their findings are consistent with mine . I said it best in a 2009 interview with NPR : " If you experience relationships as transitory while growing up , that 's what you 'll do as an adult . " Using fairly recent data , Paul finds that each parental breakup experienced while growing up increases the odds of dissolving a relationship by 16 percent . This finding is adjusted for numerous potentially confounding factors such as age at marriage , religiosity , education , and various parental attributes . As the table below shows , any experience with changes in childhood family structure increases both the overall chances of dissolving a relationship and the number of relationships one is likely to terminate . <p> Note : Sample size is 6,784 . Data are from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and are weighted to be nationally representative . Source : Amato , Paul R. &amp; Sarah E. Patterson , " The Intergenerational Transmission of Union Instability in Early Adulthood , " Journal of Marriage and Family , Forthcoming . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages and cohabiting unions alike . The lions share of studies on the divorce cycle have only looked at marriage , even though this new study shows that 79 percent of dissolved offspring relationships were live-in partnerships , not marriages . This proves my point : its important to look at all relationships , not just marriages . Earlier studies were often constrained by data limitations , but that 's no longer a valid excuse . <p> All the same , its important to recognize the differences between marriage and cohabiting relationships . As Brad Wilcox and I make clear in our recent book , Soul Mates : Religion , Sex , Love , and Marriage Among African Americans and Latinos , the differences are vast . Most cohabiting unions do n't  last . A couple either ties the knot or calls it quits , and fairly quickly most of the time . Cohabiting couples also tend to be less happy in their relationships . Obviously , this is n't true of all cohabiting unionssome cohabiters are just as happy as their married peers , and will stay together for decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as our study and many others have shown . The demographics of cohabitation are also different . Younger adults , less religious adults , and people with less education are more likely to be cohabiting rather than married . Finally , cohabitation is especially common among people from divorced families , and adults whove already been married themselves . <p> Paul and his co-author are right to observe that the same factors predict cohabitation and divorce . However , that is an apples-and-oranges comparison : cohabitation is a state , while divorce is a transition out of a state . The better comparison is divorce and cohabitation dissolution , and here the evidence is more mixed . Its much easier to predict divorce than whether a cohabiting union breaks up . As I suggest in Understanding the Divorce Cycle , most of the strongest predictors of divorce are n't  helpful in predicting cohabitation dissolution . <p> All of these facts suggest that Paul should have examined divorce and cohabitation dissolution both together and separately to answer the question : do family structure transitions affect marital and cohabiting stability equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but minimal consequences for cohabitation dissolution . <p> Another result from Pauls recent research seems at odds with his earlier work . The recent work shows that growing up in a stable but unhappy family increased the odds of family structure transitions by 22 percent . However , Pauls 2001 article with Danelle DeBoer showed that disputatious intact families yielded markedly lower rates of offspring divorce . In essence , children were being taught to withstand an acrimonious marriageand that 's a big reason why the children of divorce are disproportionately likely to end their own marriages ( they have n't fully learned to stick with a spouse when the going gets tough . ) Its hard to know why Pauls recent findings differ from what he concluded 15 years ago , so this may be a fruitful avenue of analysis for future scholarship . <p> Paul Amato has now produced quality research about the consequences of nonintact parenting for three decades . His most recent article is fresh evidence for an age-old proposition : many of us will end up just like our parents . At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny . According to Pauls data , almost half ( 43 percent ) of adults from two-parent homes will themselves dissolve a marriage or cohabiting relationship , while over a third ( 37 percent ) of people who experienced multiple family structure transitions while growing up will not report any break-ups themselves . Family structure of origin is just one of many factors that determine how we fare in our relationships .

What do they think about paid parental leave ? Raising the minimum wage ? Lowering childcare costs ? Promoting childbearing within marriage ? What are their priorities ? <p> During two hours of frank and freewheeling conversation , participants1 first discussed the many challenges they face in their work and family life , and then they offered feedback on select policy proposals that might address those challenges .

But then we looked at the income guidelines for public housing and realized that we would n't qualify . I was making too much , so I had to cut back my hours . I can only work one day a week . Which seems so backwards to me ! <p> " Public housing is completely wrong to me , " agreed one participant , whose girlfriend receives housing assistance .

Like I literally cry myself to sleep sometimes when I get home at 11:30 or midnight because I have n't seen my daughter . <p> The stay-at-home mom studying medical billing and coding explained , <p> As a mom , I feel very torn because his income making $12 an hour is not enough to make any kind of a living , and so I 'm trying to get this job .

' And yet I feel like I have not been able to make that promise applicable , which makes me feel really bad . <p> Many participants described feeling distant from the American Dream . <p> " I really , really , really , really want to see more compromise in the world of government , " emphasized the warehouse team leader who supported Trump .

He liked what he heard from Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary , before supporting Trump in the general election . <p> Participants echoed a common theme : they expect help and fairness from their employers and government in return for hard work , but their goal is economic independence . <p> So , we wondered , if these working-class Millennials want their leaders to address the challenges they face , what , specifically , do they want the incoming Trump administration and Congress to do about them ? To find out , we asked for their feedback on several proposals that aim to help working-class families . In this post , we highlight their reactions to policies related to work and family , specifically : paid parental leave , tax relief ( including childcare help ) and fair scheduling . <p> Paid Parental Leave <p> We presented a few paid parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide 12 weeks of paid leave for both working parents and Donald Trumps plan to provide 6 weeks of maternity leave . <p> A father who received only one week of unpaid leave after the birth of his child was the first to speak up . " I want to get what gives the most benefit right away , which on the surface seems like plan one , " he said , referring to Clintons plan . <p> How much is that gon na cost us in taxes later ? How much is that gon na cost America in production in order to keep up with other countries ? That 's how we got ourselves into this mess . Were all complaining about high taxes . Well , there you go . . . <p> But then people began telling their stories . <p> " I had no paid maternity leave with any of my four kids , " said one mother . She said she once returned to work only three weeks after a C-section , " because I needed the money . " <p> " Thats dangerous ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do , " she replied . " I got four kids to feed . " <p> If paid parental leave had been an option for her , we asked , would she have taken it ? <p> " Most definitely , " she said . <p> " There have been many times I 've been told not to work , " said another mother , " and I 've withheld that information from my employers because I have to work . " She also did n't  have paid leave after the births of her four children , and only once did she take unpaid leave ( and that was only because she could n't get her infant into daycare until she was six weeks old ) . <p> " When I had my second daughter , I went back to work when she was three days old , " she said . " When she was two weeks old , I found out I had cancer . I still worked through treatment and everything . Because I had to work . " <p> She preferred the six-week maternity leave plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway : " Not until they 're one or two years old , that 's his preference . Which is fine with me , " she added . She liked the idea of her husband working full-time while she received the equivalent of six weeks pay in unemployment benefits . <p> But not everyone agreed . <p> " Fathers get lost , " said the wife of a factory worker . " They do n't  have the option of getting leave to spend time with their new children . " She liked Clintons plan because it " seems the most beneficial to the family as a whole because it allows the father time off to bond with a new child . " But she said both parents having even six weeks of paid leave would be " amazing . " <p> At this point , the " angry factory worker " who suggested that people advocating for paid parental leave were " greedy , " remembered his own experience after the birth of his first child . He remembered waking up in the middle of the night a lot and " freaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still breathing . " With the first kid , there 's a lot of craziness , " he acknowledged . He said he liked the idea of at least a couple weeks of paid leave for both parents . <p> Several recipients agreed that while 12 weeks of paid leave would be nice , it would n't be necessary . Compared with what they had nowno one had ever received any paid parental leavesix weeks of paid leave seemed like a luxury . <p> By the end of the conversation , everyone in the group wanted to see Congress consider some form of paid parental leave legislationeven the self-described " angry factory worker " ideologically committed to " Reaganomics " and deep tax cuts . <p> Taxes <p> " The number one issue for me is the taxes , " said the factory worker . " You look at my paycheck and it says , You made $1,000. And then you look at the bottom and it says , You only get $600. " At this , there was laughter and general agreement from the group . <p> He continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would be good . My wife would never have to be like , Well maybe I should go work at McDonalds just to help out. " <p> " Our social programs are killings us , " he added . And when we presented Trumps childcare plan , his first question was , " How much is my taxes going to go up every week to pay for that ? " <p> " We 'd get more out if all the fraud was taken care of , " said a mother studying advanced manufacturing , adding : <p> Were having women pop out babies like Pez dispensers with different baby daddies , and they get welfare every month . They get their housing paid for , their food . They drive these brand new cars , their nails are done , their hair is done , theyve got these name brand clothes and purses . But yet I 'm struggling to put food on the table for my four kids . <p> " Right ! " came a response from the other end of the room . <p> At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more difficult it was to receive help and climb out of the " hole . " A couple of participants brought up what one person called " the million dollar question " : when it comes to eligibility for public assistance , is it based on ones pre-tax income or post-tax income ? As they saw it , it made a big difference . <p> " When we need the assistance like Medicaid , food stampsthat kind of stuffwe are just over the income limit , " said the part-time McDonalds worker . " They do n't  base it on what you bring home ; they base it on what you make before you pay your taxes . Tell me how that makes sense ? " <p> At this , several people nodded their heads and murmured in agreement . <p> " They take out $300 of each of my checks , " said the sous-chef , referring to the taxes taken out of his checks every two weeks . His gross income was over $1,000 , but he resented the $300 that came out of each paycheck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " They take out $400 in mine ! " said his wife , the hospital registrar . <p> When discussing Trumps proposals to increase tax deductions for childcare expensesincluding for stay-at-home mothersand to offer spending rebates at tax time for low-income families to help cover the cost of childcare , some said that they preferred to see relief throughout the year , rather than in tax relief at the end of the year . <p> " I 'd rather make it month-to-month , " said the mother of four , who works at a daycare . " If I stayed home with my kids , and I knew that I 'd make it from month-to-month , I would n't care if I got taxes back " at the end of the year . <p> " I would rather have more on each of my paychecks than in a tax return at the end of the year , " a substitute school bus driver who is trying to get out of public housing told us after the focus group , " because otherwise you get behind during the year and then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the moment , she was $420 behind on rent and said she could get an eviction notice any day . Since she began working as a school bus driver , the public housing authority raised her rent by $300 a month . But , she pointed out , that 's not taking into consideration that she ca n't work during the holidays and would not receive pay for a couple of weeks in December . <p> We also asked participants if they received an expanded $1,200 tax credit at tax time to help pay for childcareas Trumps plan suggests a full-time employee making $15 an hour might be able to dowould they actually use it to pay for childcare , or would they use it to pay for other expenses ? <p> The hospital registrar said , <p> Most normal people would probably end up using it for something else . Oh , I have this electric bill , I have this bill , I have that bill . That 's what I do with my taxes .... I catch up on stuff I owe . <p> " It seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing student about a larger tax return . <p> The warehouse team leader put it this way : <p> It seems like if you are getting a larger tax return but you are n't  getting a larger paycheck , they kind of cancel each other out . Everyone feels great when that tax return of a couple grand arrives from the government , but in the end , if your paycheck has n't  gone up enough over the long term , you 're probably going to lose . <p> " I think its disgusting we live in a society that 's so highly taxed that were even talking about this , " added the factory worker . <p> " Right ! " chimed in the part-time McDonalds worker , who asked indignantly , " This $2,000 , where is it going to come from ? " She was referring to Trumps proposal to allow families to deposit up to $2,000 for each child , free of income tax , into a child care savings account program . " Is that coming straight from the government ? Are they going to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this latter suggestion : a government handout of $2,000 to help parents cover childcare expenses ? To most people in this group , it seemed far too generous . <p> " If we just cut down on what the government is taxing us and what they 're helping us with , just let us run our own lives with less taxes , " said the stay-at-home mom . <p> We clarified that , under Trumps plan , the government would not give a $2,000 cash handout to each family to put into a childcare savings account program , though low-income families would receive a $500 match from the government . But the groups reaction was telling : while they are grateful for public assistance for which they 're eligiblelike Medicaid and housing assistancethey were cool to the idea of big cash handouts from the government . They want to earn their own money , and they want more of what they earn to go directly into their regular paychecks through reduced taxes so that they can receive immediate help paying their monthly bills . They have an earning ethic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earning ethic . <p> Interestingly , the conversation about reducing payroll taxes was not on our radar entering the focus group . As the warehouse team leader said , " Its unfortunate that taxes was n't one of the topics on the list . " <p> " We kind of added it in on our own , " the hospital registrar pointed out . <p> Their enthusiasm for payroll tax relief provides an opening for lawmakers interested in targeting relief to working- and middle-class families but worried about creating more dependence on government programs . Their responses also suggest that lawmakers would do well to focus more on providing relief that families see throughout the year , rather than directing more lump-sum relief at tax time . <p> Childcare Assistance <p> The conversation about payroll taxes erupted when we elicited feedback about Trumps proposals to help families cover childcare costs . Specifically , we discussed the following : <p> Allow families to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes , including stay-at-home parents and care provided by family members and friends . <p> A child care savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2,000 for each child , free of income tax , and where low-income families receive up to a $500 match from the government . <p> To our surprise , most in the group were unenthusiastic about these proposalseven though most people cited childcare costs as a big challenge . <p> " See , childcare , " the part-time McDonalds worker began with a heavy sigh , <p> this is one of those to where I do n't  feel like it really applies to me becauseI do n't  trust childcare centers . I do n't  . I 've heard too many horror stories of people who have done horrible things to children , inside a daycare . People that put their trust in other people and have been screwed . I do n't  trust just anybody with my kids . Unless you are somebody I know really well or a family member , you are not taking my kids . <p> " You 're not alone , " added the hospital registrar . <p> " And what are you learning there ? " asked the factory worker . " Are you learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mother who worked part-time at McDonalds did n't  understand why the government wanted to compensate stay-at-home mothers . <p> I 'm glad that it includes stay-at-home parents , but I do n't  see why it does . And that 's coming from a mom who stays home most of the time . Any money that I need to take care of my child is coming from my husbands job . So I mean , I 'll take the money if they 're willing to give it to me , but I do n't  see why . <p> However , one of the working mothers suggested that the government might be able to save money by enabling mothers who want to stay at home to do so , instead of subsidizing their childcare costs . <p> Because I did the math , and for my kids to go to the daycare they go to , if I did n't  get help for four children to go every week , its almost five grand a month to go.If I could stay home and they did n't  have to help me pay for childcare , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least one persons concern about the proposals seemed to stem from a misunderstanding of the proposal : she appeared to believe that the increased childcare cost tax deduction would be used to take away any tax return she might get , instead of decreasing the overall amount in taxes that she would have to pay . <p> But one thing was crystal clear : childcare costs were a problem for many people . When we asked the participants if childcare was an issue for them , they generally agreed . <p> The stay-at-home mom studying medical billing and coding put it this way : <p> Were kind of in a different situation in that we do n't  put our child in childcare , but then were kind of stuck either way . If I go to work to make more money , its all gon na go to childcare . If I stay home with him , then we have no money . So its like , what are we gon na do ? <p> The part-time McDonalds worker added , " And then the little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really worth the amount of red tape . " <p> " And we do n't  want to live off the state , either , " added the stay-at-home mom . " We want to do it honestly . " <p> The two daycare workers explained that they became daycare workers so that they could afford to send their children to daycare . ( Employees at the daycare received a discount . ) <p> When we asked the preferences of the women in the group , most said that they would prefer to either be a stay-at-home mom or combine that with part-time workor at least be able to work from home with their kids . <p> However , one mother of four children spoke up to say she preferred working full-time , even though she felt that " it sounds really horrible . " <p> " No , it does n't  ! " several people said . <p> " Personal preference , " said the warehouse team leader . " There is nothing wrong with that . " <p> Despite strong personal preferences , participants were supportive of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of the working-class individuals in the focus group , having a greater measure of predictability in their work schedules was an important issue . They noted that the lack of it made scheduling their lives , including family-related events , extremely difficult . " The Schedules That Work Act , " sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren , would , among other things , give many workers in service industries the right to request changes to their schedules without fear of retaliation , as well as receive their schedules two weeks in advance . <p> " Thatd be nice , " said the hospital registrar . <p> " Instead of the day before ! " agreed her husband , a sous-chef at a retirement community . He said he receives his two-week schedule one day before the schedule begins . <p> " You want to talk about trying to schedule family time , " noted his wife . She said they did n't  even know if he would have off for his own wedding until the Saturday before the wedding date . Fortunately , he was n't scheduled to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have to lose his job in the process . <p> Another time , they had a family vacation planned months in advance : the itinerary set , hotels booked , everything . But the week before their planned vacation , his supervisor told him that he could n't take the time off . He was afraid that if he still took off , hed lose his job . So he did n't  go on vacation with his family . <p> Another person who had formerly worked at a supermarket chain store reported that the same thing happened to him : he was scheduled to go on a family vacation with his then-fiancTes family , but he learned the day before that he was scheduled to work . " All of a sudden I had to call her and say , I hate to tell you this but I cant go now , ' " he told us . <p> Several participants expressed concern about the bills language allowing employers to refuse schedule changes if there was " a legitimate business reason .

He said there have been times he was scheduled to clock in at 10:00 a.m. , only to be told after clocking in that he was supposed to be there an hour earlier .

Many participants felt that if they could pay less in taxes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to pay for their monthly expenses , instead of having to turn to government programs for help . <p> Second , they expect basic courtesy from their employers . Participants told stories of being unable to plan their family lives because of their employers haphazard and last-minute scheduling practices . Mothers told stories of having to go back to work only days after giving birth , and alleging that they got fired or laid off just because they were pregnant . These situations made participants feel disrespected and punished for having families . <p> Third , they do n't  want to take advantage of public assistance . Participants did not want to appear " greedy , " as one participant put it . Instead of demanding more government assistance , they were interested in finding ways to minimize their need for aid .

But , as well explore more tomorrow , they also value public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for earning more or getting married . <p> Finally , they vote with their heads , not just their pocketbooks . Participants clearly want lawmakers to address their challenges , but they also want them to think about any long-term unintended consequences of policies intended to help Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck . However , because of their experiences , they believe that bosses can come up with " legitimate business reasons " for doing many things that make their family lives unpredictable , so they support legislation that would ensure better working conditions and greater stability for many working parents . <p> In tomorrows post , well explore participants reactions to proposals to eliminate marriage penalties in public assistance programs , as well as their thoughts about " the success sequence .

@@89589120 @5089120/ <p> " Love means never having to say you 're sorry " a much-quoted line from the 1970 film Love Storymust be one of the silliest silver-screen claims about love ( and that 's saying something ) . As anyone in a happy long-term relationship could attest , love means saying you 're sorry at least occasionally . A recent review of some academic literature on this topic sheds a bit more light on how , when , and why we apologize or accept others ' apologies . I 'll share some of the highlights here . <p> Jarrett T. Lewis , Gilbert R. Parra , and Robert Cohen summarized the findings of 15 studies on apologies in close romantic , familial , and platonic relationships for their piece in the Journal of Family Theory &amp; Review . Most of the studies were cross-sectional surveys that asked participants about past experiences or theoretical situations , and most were set on college campuses . Since " research on apologies in close relationships is at a relatively early stage of development , " there is no universal scholarly definition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . An apology in a close relationship may entail " ( a ) acknowledgment of wrongdoing , ( b ) acceptance of responsibility , ( c ) expression of remorse , ( d ) offer of compensation , and ( e ) communication not to commit the transgression again in the future . " <p> Unsurprisingly , the closeness of a relationship affects how people handle committing and suffering offenses : Transgressors are more likely to apologize when in a close relationship with the victim , and " victims involved in relationships with high levels of closeness were more likely to receive an apology and empathize with their wrongdoers than were victims involved in relationships lacking high levels of closeness . " Personality traits matter , too : in correlational studies , " levels of compassion , well-being , and acceptance were positively related to proclivity to apologize , and more self-interested attributes such as narcissism were negatively correlated with proclivity to apologize . " <p> Gender also shapes people 's likelihood of apologizing : Women are more likely to apologize than men . In one study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day in which they ' apologized to someone or did something that might have deserved an apology ' and to report all daily transgressions in an online diary for 12 days , " whatever their role in the transgression and whatever their relationship to the other people involved . As the makers of last year 's viral ad telling women to stop apologizing might have predicted , " Women reported not only committing more transgressions but also offering more apologies than men . " But they received more apologies , as well , because they reported being victimized more often . <p> Survey questions about both real and hypothetical scenarios suggested that this gender gap arises from different standards of offensiveness : " men were less likely to apologize because of a higher threshold of what was considered a wrongdoing , or offensive behavior . " However , " there were no gender differences in whether transgressors apologized once they perceived their behavior as offensive . " <p> Other studies have examined what makes an apology effective in earning victims ' forgiveness and restoring the relationship . Summing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there appear to be four fundamental characteristics of apologies that are associated with victim forgiveness in close relationships : expression of remorse , acknowledgment of wrongdoing , offer of compensation , and acceptance of responsibility . " But here , too , context and individual characteristics can make a difference . For instance , one study found that the relative importance people assign to an offer of compensation , an expression of empathy , and " an acknowledgment of a violation of rules or norms " in an apology depends on how they see themselves : <p> Those with higher levels of an independent self-construal ( i.e. , viewing oneself as a unique and autonomous entity ) were more likely to consider a good apology as one with an offer of compensation . Individuals with high levels of a relational self-construal ( i.e. , viewing oneself as fundamentally connected to other people ) were more likely to consider a good apology as one including an expression of empathy . Last , individuals with high levels of a collective self-construal ( i.e. , viewing oneself as associated with groups or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violated norm or rule of the relationship as a component of a good apology . <p> Applying the findings of such research to daily life is somewhat tricky : When you 've offended someone , you should hardly try to investigate their self-construal prior to apologizing , or compose a formulaic speech incorporating the four components linked with victim forgiveness . But surely we could all stand to think more deeply about the process of restoring relationships with those we 've hurt , and to learn what " sorry " means to different people . 
@@89589130 @5089130/ <p> Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I 'd earn the ire of a character named Turd Flinging Monkey , the nom de plume of a popular online mens rights activist . A leader in the MGTOW ( Men Going Their Own Way ) movement , which encourages men to avoid romantic relationships with women , Monkey did not take kindly to my new Prager University video talking up the benefits of marriage for men . In the video , I noted , among other things , that married men work harder ( about 400 more hours ) , smarter ( they 're less likely to quit without having found another job ) , and more successfully ( they make about $16,000 more per year ) than their single peers . I described these as features , not bugs , of married life for men . <p> In response , in a video of his own , Monkey unloaded on marriage , arguing that the things I had described as features of marriage were in fact bugs . <p> For men , marriage equals slavery : " Marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> For men , marriage equals unrequited sacrifice : " So married men work 400 hours more per year than single men ; that 's not a good thing . They 're not hanging out with their friends Theyre sacrificing their life for other people . Now , you may think that 's noble , but that 's not a benefit for the man . " <p> For men , marriage equals emasculation : it means " giving a woman power over your life , power over your income . " <p> And above all , for men , marriage equals a soul-destroying divorce : " talk to the men in MGTOW who have had their wallets ripped out their a** in family court . Go to the graves of men who killed themselves after they were unemployed and could n't afford child support and faced jail . Talk to those men about how wonderful marriage was Ask them about the hundreds of hours they work extra each year to avoid going to prison because they owe so much child support or alimony that they got ta move in with their parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And judging by the thousands of internet comments and emails my video making the case for marriage to men has garnered , I 'd say his perspective resonates with a substantial minority of men . There are lots of men out there who harbor a deeply misogynistic view of the opposite sex , an unremittingly negative view of love and commitment , and a complete lack of faith in marriage to deliver on their deepest dreams and desires . <p> Some of this , it seems , is about a kind of Peter Pan syndrome , where guys do n't  want to grow up and settle down . Some of it is about a kind of individualistic hedonism , where guys do n't  want to forego the opportunity to set their own work hours , hang out with their friends on their own terms , and score as much with the ladies as they can .

The stories and the invective I 've heard in response to my video make clear that a lot of the MGTOWers think marriage is a bad bet for men . Its a bet that often ends with the man losing primary custody of his kids , a substantial share of his assets , and control of a large fraction of his income . Social scientists estimate that about 42 percent of first marriages end in divorce and about 66 percent of divorces are initiated by women . This means that a lot of men are divorced unwillingly , sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for not-so-good reasons . <p> Its the experience of divorce , or the expectation of divorce , that leaves many men reluctant to tie the knot . <p> Its this experience of divorce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to tie the knot . In Craigs words , " I 'm currently dating an attractive girl who treats me very well compared to my friends girlfriends but I would never get married nor will I ever have kids with any woman unless guaranteed 50-50 custody with no child support was made into family law as it should be . " Needless to say , given the character of family law today , Craig is unlikely to be heading to the altar anytime soon . <p> The outpouring of rage , pain , and despair my video triggered suggests that one unintended fruit of no-fault divorce , and the larger divorce revolution of which it was part , is that a large minority of men are increasingly ambivalent towards or openly hostile towards virtues like sacrifice , commitment , and lovenot to mention women and the institution of matrimony . And judging by the emails , comments , and videos my Prager University video engendered , many of these men think the best they can do is score with lots of women rather than settle down with one woman ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one correspondent , " I 'd rather just pump and dump women then be the sucker left with the tab . " These mens orientation to marriage is the inverse parallel of the ambivalence and hostility that a large minority of women now have towards men and marriage ( cf.

Another tragic consequence is that more men will end up uncared for , unhappy , and unhealthy in later lifethat is , if they make it into late life : unmarried men live almost 10 years less than stably married men .

And they do n't  make the claim that marriage is bad for communities . But the basic finding concerning volunteering agrees with previous studies . In their study Marriage : The Good , the Bad , and the Greedy , Naomi Gerstel and Natalia Sarkisian found that married people tend to withdraw from the community , declining to ask for practical and emotional support from extended family , friends , and neighbors . " Marriage and community are often at odds with one another , " they write in the study .

That does n't  make sense . " <p> What makes my town different ? How does its strong volunteer network seamlessly flow into a community of friends ? I suspect it has something to do with the understanding that children are part of the community .

Here are six research-based warning signs that indicate a relationship is heading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is natural for the initial headiness of love to wear off . However , it is possible to revive emotional sparks that have gone dormant .

It is fun to laugh , and humor bonds couples together and keeps things fresh.4 However , if jokes turn sarcastic or cutting , they will damage the relationship . All forms of contempt and cruelty harm both partners , and often lead to divorce.5 If he acts disgusted with her choice in clothes , or she mocks his parenting , it is time for a gut check . Both partners need to show self-control and be respectful in words and tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know each other often stretch the truth , especially when trying to impress . They might be falsely enthusiastic ( " That is so cool ! " ) or claim to love the same things ( " That movie was my favorite also ! " ) . One study found that strangers lied several times in the first 10 minutes of talking.6 Chris Rock accurately observed : " When you meet somebody for the first time you are not meeting them . You 're meeting their representative . " <p> As relationships progress , however , people need to be authentic to develop true intimacy . When partners are deceptive , even for " good " reasons like keeping the peace or flattering , it will create distance.7 Although some fudging may occur in relationships ( " I am fine with your mother coming over for two weeks " ) , all lies damage trust , and a willingness to deceive is a red flag . When trust has been lost , it takes time and energy to regain . <p> Unwillingness to Compromise . If you are a vegetarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas Roadkill restaurant because they love the steak , it indicates an unwillingness to compromise . Healthy couples take turns accommodating and negotiating . Different opinions do not cause divorces , but the way these differences are handled might . If partners are n't  willing to be open and accept the others ideas , they are in a competition.8 This winner-versus-loser pattern shows up in abusive relationships , where one partner feels entitled to force their preferences on the other . In contrast , healthy relationships feature a balanced give and take.9 <p> Different opinions do not cause divorces , but the way these differences are handled might . <p> Lack of Intimacy . An intimate relationship is one where people share themselves emotionally , intellectually , and physically . Some individuals close themselves off when feeling negative or unsafe . This can contribute to a vicious cycle , as putting up barriers leads to further distance and resentment . The cycle can be reversed through sharing meaningful words , emotions , and touches , which generates a sense of closeness and safety . <p> As an illustration of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask each other questions about specific thoughts and feelings . After 45 minutes of deep conversation , the couples looked into each others eyes for four minutes .

If you are feeling like roommates , share feelings , touch , forgive , and your bond will tighten . <p> Control and Manipulation .

@@89589139 @5089139/ <p> Parenting does n't  matter much when it comes to shaping a childs personality , abilities , and behavior over the long run . That was the startling conclusion embraced by Judith Rich Harris nearly 20 years ago in The Nurture Assumption . And it was one I reflected on frequently while reading two new works , Jonah Lehrers A Book About Love and Alison Gopniks The Gardener and the Carpenter . <p> Harris relied largely on findings from the field of behavioral genetics . The traditional studies in this field compare various types of siblingsidentical and fraternal twins , adoptive and biological brothers and sistersto sort the causes of childrens traits into three bins : genes , the shared environment , and the non-shared environment . If identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins , for example , that 's assumed to be genes at work ; if adoptive siblings are more similar than random strangers , that 's the shared environment . And if siblings are different even though they 're identical twins reared together , that 's the non-shared environment . <p> The conscious decisions we make as parentshow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to daycareshould show up as the effect of the shared environment . But Harris reported there was little there . Not much has changed : A massive 2015 research review analyzed " 7,804 traits from 2,748 publications , " including millions of twin pairs . For about 70 percent of traits , shared environment did n't  seem to do much at all . By contrast , genes were consistently powerful , typically explaining about half the variation in the traits . <p> Certainly , there are some nuances here . Parents do affect some important things , including social values and religion , which are , respectively , 27 percent and 35 percent explained by the shared environment . ( Educational attainment also has an influence from the shared environment , but its not clear whether parenting , parents money , or something else is what 's making the difference . ) No one denies that severe deprivation hurts kids . And genes and the environment work together in various ways , making the classic three-discrete-bins approach somewhat reductive . <p> But as a general matter , if parents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each child , because merely sharing the same house does n't  seem to make kids much more similar to each other than strangers are . Of those two new books , only one seriously addresses this fact . <p> A Book About Love <p> Jonah Lehrers A Book About Love is , well , a book about lovemainly in the sense of sacrifice and hard work , not so much the warm cuddly feelings . It is n't exclusively about parents and childrenit also covers marriage and religionbut it argues at length that it matters how well children bond with their caretakers . <p> Lehrer is right , up to a point . These relationships are important , and the effects are especially clear when they involve separation , neglect , or abuse . He cites one study of Finnish children who were evacuated to foster homes during World War II ; they avoided the bombing campaigns witnessed by the kids who stayed , but they were separated from their parents , and they ended up nearly twice as likely to die of cardiovascular disease decades later . Animal research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow up cognitively impaired when denied the attention of their mothers while young . And of course , this website has explored in depth the consequences of father absence ; there is good evidence that its correlations with bad outcomes are partly causal . <p> Merely sharing the same house does n't  seem to make kids much more similar to each other than strangers . <p> But Lehrers discussion of " attachment styles " takes this line of thinking much further . To summarize the idea bluntly : bad parenting causes kids to be " insecurely attached " to their caregivers , which in turn leads them to be much less well-adjusted and successfulin an astonishing variety of wayswhen they grow up . Since something like 40 percent of American children are n't  securely attached , this is a very big claim ; it covers even modestly below-average parents , not just the extremes . <p> For young children , attachment styles are measured through the " Strange Situation Test , " where researchers look to see how a child behaves in a room with a parent and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first , " securely attached " kids explore the room but return to the parent as a " safe base " ; they become distressed when the parent leaves , but they are happy again when the parent returns . " Insecure " attachments come in various forms , but they include , as Lehrer writes , " the kids who do n't  cry when abandoned or cant stop crying when the experiment is over . " <p> These styles correlate with both ( A ) how sensitive parents are to their kids needs at home and ( B ) childrens outcomes , from social popularity at age 5 to standardized-test scores in the teen years to health at age 32 . The attachment theorists key inference , which Lehrer hoovers up hook , line , and sinker , is that ( A ) causes ( B ) . <p> But that inference does not necessarily followand it is also difficult to square with the findings of behavioral genetics . If attachment is merely a function of the parents behavior , you would expect it to be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good parent should be a good parent to all his or her children . But shared environment is exactly what behavioral genetics says is n't generally important . <p> Behavioral genetics also forces us to consider alternative explanations for the seeming power of attachment . Maybe parental sensitivity and/or childhood attachment behaviors are genetic , and those same genes contribute to difficulty later in life for the child . <p> Unfortunately , A Book About Love ignores this possibilityexcept for one footnote that touches on behavioral-genetics research . In that footnote , Lehrer cites a 2003 twin study finding that a childs attachment style is , as speculated above , mostly a part of the shared environment . He does n't  seem to realize the problem , which ( again ) is that the shared environment in its entirety does n't  matter much . <p> But a 2009 literature review blurs the picture . Studies consistently find that childrens attachment behavior is n't highly genetic ( the highest estimate cited is 25 percent ; several studies find it to be negligible ) , but the balance between shared and non-shared environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellmeaning that some kids might be genetically more sensitive to the effects of bad parenting . <p> Perhaps attachment largely goes into the non-shared-environment bin , not the shared-environment one , because parents bond with different kids in different ways . In that case , attachment could powerfully affect kids outcomes without contradicting the core findings of behavioral genetics . In one study , nearly one-third of identical twins had different attachment styles , which would seem to buttress this possibility . Its worth more research , especially considering that therapy can change attachment styles . <p> What I would like to see is a long-term follow-up to twin studies of attachment . When one identical twin is securely attached and the other is not , does the former twin usually do better in life ? I cant find any research along these lines , and it would not be too surprising if none existed : Few have probed the nexus between attachment styles and genes . <p> So if that 's a blind spot for A Book About Love , its one the book shares with many professional researchers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About Love , psychology professor Alison Gopniks The Gardener and the Carpenter is a breath of fresh air . By page 23 , there can be no doubt that Gopnik knows the score and wont try to explain it away : <p> It is very difficult to find any reliable , empirical relation between the small variations in what parents dothe variations that are the focus of parentingand the resulting adult traits of their children ... From an empirical perspective , parenting is a mugs game . <p> Indeed , the central argument of Gopniks book is that we should reject the concept of " parenting " entirely . She notes that even the word is a recent invention , having become popular only in the 1970s ( though I would add that the concept of " rearing " children , and anxiety about how best to do so , goes back much further ) . Her title refers to the idea that parents should see themselves not as " carpenters " aiming to craft something specific , but rather as " gardeners , " aiming to help those under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the finer details . <p> Much of Gopniks book focuses on her own research into how kids learn . Kids really are information sponges , and in some ways , they learn better than adults do . Their brains are actually wired to make fresh connections more easily ; unlike the rest of us , they are not stuck in their ways and adamant about their hard-won ideas of how the world works . <p> But they 're not just sponges . They are surprisingly adept at extracting information from their environment and interpreting it properly . When they imitate adults , they do n't  do so thoughtlessly ; they think through what the adults were trying to accomplish and try to figure out whether the adults actually knew what they were doing . Through this process , kids learn the traditions of those who came before , but they also challenge those traditions , develop them , and adapt them to new circumstances . <p> Kids really are information sponges , and in some ways , they learn better than adults do . <p> If we cant deliberately mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , what we can do is provide an environment ripe for learning and experimentation . Gopnik notes , for instance , that we can provide " scaffolding " for kids activitiessetting the conditions for " guided play , " such as asking them to sort shapes according to certain rulesand let them explore . <p> The Gardener and the Carpenter is less impressive when it strays from Gopniks areas of expertise , though . Here she is , for example , discussing how public policy could help parents and children : <p> There is no mystery about the moral advantages or the good practical consequences of policies such as universal prenatal care , home visitors and nurses , paid parental leave for men and women , universal and free preschool , and direct subsidies to parents . These policies really do lead to better outcomes for children as a wholein fact , this is one of the clearest results in all of social science . <p> " Multiple studies , " she continues , show that they work . <p> When I chased down the reference for Gopniks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all of social science , " I ended up with Heckman 2006 and Kirp 2009 . Both of these are basically arguments for the value of preschoolthe science of which is not , I know from years of following the issue , settled . A big part of the debate is whether universal programs confer ( or even plausibly could confer ) benefits anything like those seen in small , intense , well-run interventions like Perry Preschool . See Grover Whitehurst of the Brookings Institution for a sober analysis of the evidence on this topic . <p> That 's not to say these policies are bad , and at any rate , I 'm not going to resolve debates about several huge proposals in one article ( a double book review at that ! ) . For whatever its worth , I 'm personally sympathetic to direct subsidies to parents and leery of mandatory paid parental leave . But it was disappointingafter Gopniks detailed and thoughtful discussions of her own research , and amid her heroic project to convince parents they 're not going to break their kidsto see her assert so blithely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was no surprise that The Nurture Assumption was in the back of my mind as I read these titles ; to this day , its the lens through which I view all claims about parenting . I would also like it to be the foundation of my households parenting ( or at least child-gardening ) philosophy , but for the life of me , I can not get my wife to read it . Shes already decided our son is going to Northwestern . <p> I do n't  think I 'll be recommending A Book About Love to her . I have a feeling it would make her want to feed our son into some sort of homemade Strange Situation Test so we could see firsthand whether were horrible parents . But maybe The Gardener and the Carpenter is a good middle ground for couples like usrealistic about the limits of " parenting , " but respectful of what parents really can bring to the table . 
@@89589142 @5089142/ <p> The white , working-class young adults my wife and I have interviewed in Ohio do n't  want to divorce , and they want to spare their children the pain that they endured in their own childhoods . So you might expect them to place a priority on having children within marriage , and connect marriage with family togethernessbut that 's not always the case . <p> Ricky hated watching his dad come home from the factory drunk and beat his mom . They fought so much that he wishes that his mom would have divorced his dad sooner than she did . He hated the man that his mom remarried . Her second husband made her happy , he said , but " it was all about her . " Because while his mom was happy , the new stepdad verbally abused Ricky and his brother . " All I heard was how much pieces of shit we are , " Ricky remembers . Again , when his mom divorced him , Ricky was relieved . <p> " Some people say that marriage is the ideal environment for kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people say , No , there 's no ideal setting . Kids are resilient ; they can thrive in many different family forms. What would you say ? " <p> " Well , its not really about marriage , " Ricky said . " Of course a child needs a father figure , and of course a child needs a mother figure . It really has nothing to do with the marriage . I mean , boyfriend , girlfriendif they do it right , the child will have their father and mother figure . " <p> " Should the mom and dad be together in a relationship ? " I asked him . <p> " They do n't  have to be in a relationship , " he said . " I mean , even joint custody . As long as you 're in that childs life , and you 're in it as much as possible , the child will realize , Yeah , my daddy wants to see me. Or , My mommy wants to see me. As long as they feel wanted . " <p> But there is a gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality that Ricky is a distant figure in his sons life ( he gets to see him a few times a year ) , and totally absent from the lives of the children for whom he was a father figure at one point . After leaving his sons mother , Ricky moved in with a woman and helped raised her child , until she was two . Ricky has n't  seen that little girl since he broke up with her mother . The same is true of the daughter of his next fiancTe . <p> Can parents be separated but involved ? There 's sometimes a gap between theory and reality . <p> Its not that Ricky does n't  care about the girls . In fact , with his last relationship , he misses Amy , his ex-fiancTes daughter , more than he misses Hailey , his ex-fiancTe . And he feels sorry for Amy . <p> " Her little girl , I mean , she 's innocent , " he noted . " She did n't  deserve to be put through what she did . I mean , hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> After he and Hailey broke up , Ricky went to jail and then rehab for drug abuse , and Hailey had children by another man . For understandable reasons , Haileys family does n't  want Ricky involved in Amys life . Once , though , Ricky sneaked a phone call to Amy . He told her his name was Stevethat way she would n't know who he was and run and tell Haileys family . <p> Despite Rickys best intentions , then , his own son and the children of his ex-fiancTes are enduring the same instability that Ricky resents about his childhood . <p> But here is the rub . Ricky is in no position to trust marriage , either . After he saw his parents abusive marriage ? After watching his mom cycle through two more marriages ? No way . <p> " I mean , because what I went through , you know , my dad beating my mom , " he said , " I should n't have had to grow up seeing that shit .

Although we know from national statistics that marriage is in general a better bet for children , Rickys experiences growing up did little to convince him of that . <p> In Rickys mind , marriage is not associated with stability for children ; its associated with violence . <p> And that is one of the cruel legacies of Rickys parents high-conflict marriage and subsequent divorce : it left him looking for stability , but distrustful of marriage , the institution specifically designed to attach mothers and fathers to their children .

@@89589145 @5089145/ <p> November marks National Caregiving Month . Having served for many years as a hospice chaplain and COO , I have seen first hand the power of home-based , family-centered caregiving . However , for all its strengths , providing care to a seriously i 'll adult as an informal , uncompensated , family caregiver can incur high costs that are often invisible to society at large . National Caregiving Month provides a perfect opportunity to increase our awareness of those costs . <p> Caregiving for an aging or i 'll adult can be costly on a number of levels . Financially , nearly half of all caregivers spend more than $5000 annually on care costs . These monies can cover a wide range of assistance from yard work and home maintenance , transportation , medication management , and grocery shopping to more intimate and time-intensive tasks such as bathing , dressing , toileting , and walking , all of which tend to require the purchase or rental of medical equipment or even covering the costs of custodial care . <p> In addition to making monetary sacrifices , caregivers can incur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scholars note that family caregiving is considered a " chronic stress " situation affecting physical health and well being and causing a secondary impact on the professional life of the caregiver . On average , caregivers serve 20.4 hours per week , thus many must stop working or shift to part-time work , producing long-term effects on their Social Security payments and lifetime wage earnings , personal savings , professional advancement and earning potential . Employers also pay a price when an employee takes on elder care responsibilities . However , we all benefit from family-provided care because replacing it with compensated care would cost society approximately $450 billion . <p> In addition to making monetary sacrifices , caregivers can incur physical , emotional , and professional costs as well . <p> As a part of our research* on family caregiving , we met Kyle , a quintessential face of the " sandwich generation , " who provided a poignant example of the creative ways family caregivers manage the multi-faceted costs of providing elder care . Forty-two years old , married , and the father of three elementary schoolaged children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time commercial pilot . His wife also worked full-time , and they relied on her parents and his father for childcare when Kyle traveled . Compounding this already full schedule , Kyle chose to serve as the primary caregiver for his divorced and single mother in the final year of her life . <p> He described how his caregiving responsibilities snuck up on him . In the early stages of her cancer diagnosis , his mom , who lived about an hour away from his home , would call with an emergency and he , or his uncle if Kyle was out of town on a trip , would drive to the hospital to help her navigate the relevant care decisions . Between these crisis moments , she was able to live on her own . Kyle would mow her lawn and check up on her every few days by phone , but that care did n't  intrude too heavily into his day-to-day life . <p> But then his moms cancer treatments became less effective , the emergency calls came more frequently , and the doctor sat down with Kyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her own any longer . She was referred to hospice , and she could either be admitted to a long-term care facility , which would require her to " spend down " her personal savings in order to qualify , eventually , for the Medicaid Room and Board benefit , or move in with Kyle and his family . <p> As both mother and son contemplated their next steps , Kyle talked with his wife about what they could afford to do . The couple decided that home care would be best , if she would agree to it , and that they " were prepared to ride it out knowing how difficult it might be . " The next day they invited Kyles mom to live with them , but they had one stipulation : that she not smoke cigarettes inside the house , a choice he knew would be hard for her to make as a life-long smoker . However , she agreed , but new tense and vulnerable conversations soon followed as they faced moving her out of her home , closing out her financial accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childrens rooms for her . Meanwhile , his mom set up a payment plan with Kyle so that she could contribute small amounts to their food and utility costs . <p> In time , Kyle became her agent designated by his mothers power of attorney , which helped him manage her finances per her wishes . Much to Kyles surprise , his father , divorced from his mother for more than thirty years , offered to help him by staying with his mom a few days a week as her condition declined . Kyles mom lived with them for almost a year , and Kyle was at her side when she died . <p> For many grown children , the impulse to care for an aging parent is there , but the financial ability do so is not . <p> Recent coverage by Forbes of the out-of-pocket costs of family caregivers highlights that most caregivers admitted that they had not talked with their family members in advance about how to cover expenses . Kyle spoke with candor about how nervous he was to broach the private subject of finances with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reassure her that he would honor her wishes , while recognizing how much her health and her personal privacy were now out of her control . Making her wishes known about the costs of her care helped return power and some independence to her . A year after his moms death , Kyle admitted while that balancing all the cumulative , unexpected costs of caring for his mom was challenging , he would make the choice all over again . <p> For many grown children , the impulse to care for an aging parent is there , but inability to pay the direct costs or to sacrifice the financial income from steady work makes living the impulse nearly impossible . Kyle had a supportive spouse , father , and employer who all made it possible for him to care for his mother in her final year of life . But many more sons and daughters will be our future Kyles , and they will not have that support . For example , Linda Waite writes evocatively of how family trees are turning into bean stalks , a phenomena of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will add further complexity to the balancing act that is family care . <p> Conversely , Suzanne Bianchi and Judith Seltzer note that contemporary family trees are also changing shape as divorce , single parenthood , cohabitation , and remarriage become the norm . These configurations graft in new family tree branches whose role in the caregiving transfer of money , time , and housing remains ambiguous . Law Professor Allison Hoffman suggests that to compensate for a reduction in kinship care , " next friend " care will increase , with financial , physical , and emotional costs incurred by our friends and neighbors . And ultimately , when informal family care does n't  exist or fails , the public sector must pick up the slack . However , as Paul Taylor has already noted , a gap in public sector funding also looms as the financial needs of an aging Baby Boomer population soon outweigh the contributions of younger generations . <p> Caregiving costs , especially at the end of life , are expensive . Reducing costs system-wide as well as supporting an increase in informal care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an expansion of current programs that are working well . The recent IOM report Dying in America recommended that several caregiving support efforts be continued and expanded , such as " Medicaids Cash and Counseling program , available in about 15 states , that permits beneficiaries to pay family members modest sums for home care services in some cases . " <p> In addition to societal efforts to support family caregiving , individual family caregivers and elders can increase their efforts to think outside of the box in covering caregiving and end-of-life expenses . For example , Kyles mother bartered flight lessons with a local mortuary owner for her cremation costs , which reduced the eventual financial burden that Kyle faced after her death . And as always , talking with family members about our wishes remains a crucial step in being prepared . <p> Family caregivers are an invisible force for good in our society , and they need our collective and individual attention and support .

Even for me , the term conjures up some poor schlub in a V-neck covered with Cheerios who can not get his act together . " <p> Such comments from stay-at-home dads , which appeared in a recent Redbook magazine spread on stay-at-home moms , vividly confirm that men whose primary role is caring for their children still face negative stereotypes and hostile attitudes . That some feel isolated is not surprising : at-home dads remain far less common than at-home moms . <p> Still , according to a new study in the Journal of Marriage and Family , their numbers have risen and may continue doing so for reasons related to the economy , education , and gender ideology . Four percent of two-parent families had at-home fathers in 2010 , up from 2 percent in the 1970s . Whether this upward trend will affect the historical link between reverse-traditional divisions of laborin which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes remains to be seen . <p> To investigate the factors driving the increase in stay-at-home fathers , Karen Z. Kramer and Amit Kramer used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ( 1979 cohort ) and the Current Population Survey ( 1972-2012 ) , in tandem with state-level data on unemployment and General Social Survey information on Americans gender ideology . <p> Notably , the researchers definition of an at-home dad was a strict one : In addition to being married and having at least one child 18 or younger in the household , a man was only an at-home dad if he " was out of the labor force and had not received any income in the previous year while his wife was working full time for pay ( at least 35 weekly hours ) and earned the entire household income . " That means unemployed men actively looking for work , and men who were primary caregivers but worked a few hours a week were excluded . <p> Men who fit this definition were divided into two groups based on why they were not working . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to find work " were categorized as unable to work ; those who said they stay home to take care of family were termed " caregiving " at-home fathers.1 In the CPS sample , caregiving fathers accounted for only 19 percent of all at-home fathers in 2000-2012 , which represents a rise from less than 1 percent in the 1970s and 1980s . Unable-to-work fathers dropped from 59 percent of all dads at home in the 1970s to 32 percent in 2000-2012 . <p> Its important to draw these distinctions because one would expect different factors to cause growth or contraction in the number of men in each category . Economic conditions , for instance , should be most relevant for unable-to-work at-home dadsand that is indeed what Kramer and Kramers analysis of CPS data shows . Overall , a 1 percent increase in the male unemployment rate at the state level " was associated with an 8.0% increase in the likelihood that a household became a stay-at-home father family , " and the effects were stronger for unable-to-work fathers than for caregiving ones . <p> Spouses relative educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise affected families odds of having the father stay home . In both samples , " families where mothers held a college degree and a father has less than a college degree were more likely to be a stay-at-home father family . " In the CPS data , this effect exerted more impact on caregiving stay-at-home father families than unable-to-work ones . This finding implies that young womens ongoing educational advantage over young men could cause continuing growth in the number of caregiving stay-at-home fathers . <p> That a womans superior earning potential may make a couple more likely to choose a stay-at-home father arrangement voluntarily is underlined by the difference in household income between families with caregiving at-home fathers , and families with unable-to-work at-home fathers . In 2000-2012 , mothers with husbands who stayed home to care for kids earned an average annual income of $76,320 , whereas mothers whose husbands stayed home because they could n't work earned $38,960 . <p> After examining the relevance of the unemployment rate and spouses relative education levels , Kramer and Kramer turned to a third element : gender ideology . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology2 predicted greater odds of having a caregiving stay-at-home father but not an unable-to-work stay-at-home father . <p> How the gradual , halting rise of stay-at-home fatherhood may affect families is hard to predict . In recent decades , at least , marriages in which a wife worked and/or earned more than her husband have tended to exhibit poorer outcomes . For instance , IFS senior fellow W. Bradford Wilcox coauthored a study3 finding that no single work-family arrangement predicted the marital satisfaction of men with children , except for working less than their wives ( whether they themselves worked part-time or not at all ) . These fathers were 61 percent less likely to report being very happy in their marriage than men whose wives stayed home . There was a satisfaction gap even for the husbands whose wives preferred that arrangement . <p> Three economists who authored a separate study , which drew wide media attention when it was published as a working paper in 2013 , revealed that couples in which the wifes income exceeds the husbands were six percentage points less likely to describe their marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher likelihood of divorce . In fact , couples desire to avoid having a female breadwinner may cause them to divide paid and household labor differently : " In couples where the wifes potential income is likely to exceed the husbands , " the researchers noted , " the wife is less likely to be in the labor force and earns less than her potential if she does work . " <p> However , both of these studies drew on survey data that 's now roughly 15 to 20 years old , and couples who get married today may hold different expectations or anticipate more flexibility in their roles as workers and parents . Divorce used to be more common among couples in which the wife was more educated than the husband , but these days it is not . And breadwinning women are no longer rare : more than one in four wives in dual-income marriages earn more money their husbands .

Modern Romance is not for everyone ( neither the book nor the reality it reflects ) . The book is written from the perspective of people who are smack in the middle of this new , unhooked , unscripted maelstrom of love , sex , and disillusionment . It captures how things are for a great number of people , not what many would say is ideal . It is insightful and irreverent . Ansari is , after all , a comedian with the bluntness of those who work the clubs . <p> Questions around how people search for , and find , partners are part of an entire field of study about matching problems . There is a need to match people to jobs , schools , and mates . From a societal level , there is benefit in maximizing the number of people who match with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the best matches they can in order to increase their odds of personal happiness , fulfillment , and meaning . <p> You are likely familiar with a myriad of services that solve matching problems of less importance than the search for a mate . Uber , for example , matches drivers and riders . The algorithm to do this is , of course , simpler than whatever it would take to increase peoples odds of lifetime love and commitment in marriage . A 15-minute lift is different from 60 years of driving together through life . <p> Ansari and Klinenberg describe massive changes since decades past in how people search for mates ( or dates , or just sex ) . In mate selection , people have gone from choosing among two or three options in their neighborhood or apartment building to trying to search through and cope with the awareness of a myriad of options , thanks to advances in the digital realm . <p> Searches are likely to fall short of leading to good matches when people search too little or too much . What strategy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sam , for short ) is searching . She wants to find her soul-mate . I do n't  merely mean that she wants a mate who shares the deeper beliefs of her soul ; 1 she believes there is this one perfect partner out there for hersomeone who would complete her in ways far beyond being merely good , reliable , and committed . This is not an unusual goal in modern-day mate searching , 2 and it complicates things quite a bit . <p> Eli Finkel and colleagues have described the changing standards that guide our search for mates : " Throughout American history , the fundamental purpose of marriage has shifted from ( a ) helping spouses meet their basic economic and political needs to ( b ) helping them meet their intimacy and passion needs to ( c ) helping them meet their autonomy and personal-growth needs . " 3 Finkel and his coauthors argue that this expectation leads to average marriages being less happy , while a small number of marriages that can satisfy the expectations for personal fulfillment may be happier than the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finding a soul-mate is not an unusual goal in modern-day mate searching , and it complicates things quite a bit . <p> Samantha is acutely aware of her dilemma . She has no foolproof way of knowing where to find " the one " or how to know for sure who is " the one " when she meets him . Metaphorically , Sam is in a train station trying to figure out which train to get on and stay on for the ride of her life . <p> Sam has checked out five trains . Those " checks " ranged from having a brief coffee meet-up with one guy she met online to being deeply involved with the last guy , whom she dated for 16 months before eventually deciding he was not the one . That 's a long train ride , and it left Sam further down the tracks at another station . Now she 's worried that she might have missed the best option during those 16 months . Serious involvement often has opportunity costs , you know . Still , she is a believing person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not allow her to miss the right train . Still , her belief in destiny is balanced by her belief that the odds are decreasing as time marches on . <p> Sam wonders if the perfect train has yet to appear at her station or if she 's missed it already . Her fear of missing the best train is palpable and even paralyzing . " What if I make the wrong choice ? " " Am I even on the right rail line ? " " How long do I stay on one train before I get off if I am not sure its the one ? " " What if I leave one train and then , later , realize it was the best train for me ? " A lot of the time Sam feels like curling up on a bench and just letting all the trains roll through the station without her even looking up . <p> Heuristics for Matching <p> Psychologists Peter Todd and Geoffrey Miller wrote about mate searching in a respected volume on simple heuristics for making the best decisions under various conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision-making in order to achieve what is often a good-enough solution where the costs of further effort and time are unlikely to be worth the gain . <p> Todd and Miller describe some of the history of attempts to come up with the best heuristic to solve searching and matching problems in mate selection . They get to the heart of Samanthas anxiety , described above , which is the " uncertainty that the next prospect that one encounters might be far superior to the best seen so far . " 5 That is , she fears that once she makes a choice , the next train into the station would be the one . <p> Todd and Miller note that if you could know in advance the number of options youd get to consider in choosing a mate , you could use a guideline that a number of studies suggest yields the highest likelihood of the best outcome . The rule is to select the best option that appears after you have considered 37 percent of the options . You can see why knowing the total number is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even guess when you 'll hit that 37 percent point . Todd and Miller explain some of the arcane history of this decision rule , and they do a particularly nice job of describing the necessary assumptions for such heuristics to work . <p> Todd and Miller make a mathematical case for " satisficing , " or accepting an option that meets a reasonable level of expectation . <p> Suppose Sam is going to have 10 trains to consider in her life . By this rule , she should check out the first four but not choose any of them . Those poor guys do n't  even know that they have no chance . Sam is tough and shes working the rule . But starting with number five , Sam is ready to pick the first one that is better than any of the four she 's seen so far . If the best option of all was in that first four , that 's pretty sad . This may be , by the way , why people intuitively favor monitoring past partners through social media ; its become easy to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recalling a train ( if its available ) back to the station . <p> Let 's suppose for a moment that the 37 percent rule is pretty good for selecting a mate . ( I personally prefer a strategy that 's a bit broader . ) As Ansari and Klinenberg argue , part of the problem for todays young adults is that they are trying to cope with an awareness of a truly countless number of potential partners . While not actually true , a young adult today might think that the 37 percent rule means checking out hundreds or thousands of potential mates . That 's going to take some time , even in Grand Central Station . <p> Let 's bring sex into the equation . If a person believes that he or she needs to check out a lot of partners , including testing for sexual compatibility , that 's going to add up to a lot of sexual partners before settling down in marriage . That strategy has numerous risks which I will not enumerate here . Galena Rhoades and I find that the median number of sexual partners emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six , and that having sex with others in addition to the person one marries is associated ( although , modestly ) with lower marital quality.6 In a prior post , we attempted to explain why there could be something causal in that , net of all the risks a person already may have in their demographic background and life history . <p> Todd and Miller do n't  leave us at the 37 percent rule . They note that , even where all the assumptions are met , it only leads to the best solution 37 percent of the time . Their main focus is to make a mathematical case for " satisficing , " or accepting an option that meets a reasonable level of expectation.7 For example , they argue that a 14 percent search rule ( instead of 37 percent ) gets 83 percent of people in the top 10 percent of their options . Contrast that with the people seeking absolute perfection , who may end up searching so long that they leave behind better options before finally settling on the last train to Clarksville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As Todd and Miller describe , Frey and Eichenberger ( 1996 ) argued that people do not search adequately for a mate.8 The distinguished sociologist Norval Glenn also made this point in a chapter published in 2002.9 There are many causes of poor searches . One of Glenns growing concerns was about how " premature entanglement " was common and could foreclose adequate search for good matches . Norval and I had a wonderful talk about these ideas over dinner in 2000 . This was just after I had started thinking a lot about the inertia problem with cohabitation . We both thought that a lot of people were increasing their odds of taking the wrong train when they did not have to do so . Thus , while there is increased freedom of choice and a growing availability of tools for searching , these factors may be offset by the growing trend toward sliding through relationship transitions in ways that lead to giving up options before making a choice.10 <p> The increasing availability of tools for searching might merely increase fears of failing to find perfection . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles and miles to get a good sense for it . Many do , however , owing to the ease of entry into cohabitation . People slide into cohabiting , 11 which rapidly escalates inertia in the form of constraints ; constraints make it more likely one will stay in a relationship regardless of dedication to it.12 Of course , many others are foregoing serious romantic involvement altogether , being somewhat paralyzed by the fear of making the wrong choice . Why would that be ? Although there are more tools than ever before that could be employed to search for and sort into good matches , the expectations for marriage are also higher than ever . The increasing availability of tools for searching might merely increase fears of failing to find perfection ; the quest may now appear both more possible and impossible at the same time . <p> Despite concerns in the late 1990s about inadequate search , I believe the changes Ansari and Klinenberg document are real , and that in just the past 15 years , people may have started to err in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an endless search for the perfect mate is also , in a very real way , inadequate . Ansari and Klinenberg call attention to the work of psychologist Barry Schwartz ( The Paradox of Choice ) , who has written lucidly about the dilemmas of having too many options . This argument by Schwartz that they recount is brilliant . <p> By Schwartzs logic , we are probably looking for " the best " and , in fact , we are looking for our soul mates too . Is this possible to find ? " How many people do you need to see before you know you 've found the best ? " Schwartz asked . " The answer is every damn person there is . How else do you know its the best ? If you 're looking for the best , this is a recipe for complete misery . " <p> That 's a whole lot of train tickets . Schwartz points out that the very belief that you can find the perfect match at the end of a search sets you up to think there must always be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes people less happy with what they eventually choose . <p> Commitment is making a choice to give up other choices . That 's the deal . Believing that you could have found perfectionif youd only searched a little morewill make it harder to commit to , invest in , and be happy with the person you married . <p> 2 .

@@89589148 @5089148/ <p> Work-life balance is vital , but if it were a storyline on a favorite TV show , we 'd say it had jumped the shark . We discuss the importance of implementing family-friendly policies and promoting work-life balance for working mothers ad nauseam . In some ways , the more interesting question , because it remains relatively unexplored , may be : What about the working fathers ? <p> Parenting challenges are often compartmentalized as womens issues because of biological realities ; only women experience pregnancy , childbirth , and the physical recovery that necessarily follows . However , the physical and emotional bonding that parents everywhere do with their newborns is something that can , and should , also involve fathers . But what are we doing to help working men who want to be actively involved in their childrens lives ? <p> The results of a recent study by Erin Reid , an assistant professor at Boston University School of Management , suggest that the answer is too often " not much . " She examined the ( work ) lives of employees at a hard-charging consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their work . The firms workforce was three-quarters male , and the leadership was even more lopsidedly male . So this pseudonymously named firm offers insight into a work environment largely created by , and for , ambitious men . <p> While Professor Reids focus was the impact of workplace intensity on all employees , regardless of age , sex , or parental status , her study has clear implications for parents . She kindly agreed to answer my questions about her study via email , including how her findings may impact American families . <p> Our interview focused in particular on how fathers were treated by the firm , because of the firms demographics and Reids findings . Her study , which she published in Organization Science and described in Harvard Business Review , offered several troubling examples of men suffering professionally for expressing interest in being around their families , particularly their newborns . <p> For example , an employee named Michael told Reid , " When my daughter was born , one of the first things I wanted to do was take off three months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a stay-at-home dad ... I felt like this was the only time in my career I would be able to do this But the original reaction I actually got inside of the firm was , Oh no , you cant take three months off. As Reid recounts , " he settled for six weeks of unpaid leave and worked 80-hour weeks , traveling weekly , for the rest of the year . Yet he found that people still talked like I was out three months. In a subsequent conversation , he reflected , No one questioned my commitment until I had a family. " <p> Men can be subject to a not man enough penalty when they show significant engagement in family life . <p> A second man told Reid : <p> I took a two-week paternity leave . And the idea of a guy taking paternity leave was just makes face for my managers . Guys just do n't  do that They teased me Then one of the partners said to me , " You have a choice to make : Are you going to be a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your field ? If you are going to be a professional then that meansnothing can be as important to you as your work . " <p> Given the mans identification only as " Firm alumnus , " it seems that he decided his family was more important than singular devotion to his work . <p> One roadblock facing these men was the firms lack of a legally required paternal leave policy ( they apparently had maternal leave guidelines , but not paternal ) . Asked how the firm managed to skirt the law in this case , Reid emailed , " Not sure . I do n't think that is that unusual . " <p> Reids study notes that " Formal accommodations are treated as most available to mothers but are not perceived as an option for other people , " like fathers . That left each fathers situation to be treated on a case-by-case basis , with universally poor results . In Reids academic parlance , those men who requested " more formal accommodations such as parental leave , thereby revealed their deviance from the firms norm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Reid emailed : <p> The firm really prioritized total devotion to work . Both women and men who signaled that they were not wholly devoted to work were penalized . Certainly other research ( e.g. , Jennifer Berdahls work on the flexibility stigma ) shows that men can be subject to a " not man enough " penalty when they show significant engagement in family life . <p> The men who were able to spend more time with their families without calling attention to it or asking for accommodations tended to be more professionally successful . Each man found ways to " pass " spending time with family while maintaining the appearance of 24/7 availabilitywhether by using technology to his advantage , building a local client base , or confiding his deviance from expectations to a few trusted people on his team . The important thing was impressing clients , or those higher up in the hierarchy , to shield himself from criticism of being insufficiently committed . <p> Reid believes that her studys main take-away is for organizations : <p> Requiring this level of work devotion leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moreover , the ability of many men to pass suggests that long work hours are not necessary to produce work that is high-quality . Therefore , organizations need to change their expectations of men , as well as women . <p> The larger question is whether professional services firms are capable of , and willing to make , such a change . Can we make the American workplace more humane , urging everyone to work smarter , rather than harder ? <p> There is good reason to think this shift , which would clearly benefit working parents , is also in companies best interest . Last year , Harvard Business Reviewreported on the positive results of a six-month work-life study at a Fortune 500 company that involved 700 employees in the IT division . Some employees made up a control group , while others were offered more flexibility " over when and where they worked , and more supervisor support for their family and personal lives . " At the end of the study , <p> The people in the treatment group experienced a significant reduction in work-family conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents and people with less supportive supervisors initially benefitted most from the intervention . Parents reported working one hour less per week than non-parents , but others did not have to increase their workloads to accommodate parents . People in the treatment group also reported that they felt they now had adequate time to spend with their families while managing their workloads . Overall , they felt more in-control and less overwhelmed . <p> As the Harvard Business Review went on to note , <p> This is the first study to offer evidence based on a randomized trial that workplace interventions , such as increased schedule control and supervisor support , can reduce employee work-life conflict The research shows that there is a way to move away fromindividual accommodations that a person negotiates with his or her boss and toward systemic change in an organization that benefits all . <p> Whether they 're parents or not , happy employees are productive employees , an outcome that should please managers , clients , and investors alike . If corporate leaders can think more creatively about how , when , and where employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit the bottom line while also earning workers loyalty and helping to strengthen families .

Time . <p> There was considerable distanceand bushlandbetween our houses . But the loud screaming still carried from their living room to ours on most days . It was shrill . It was angry . It seemed to me that it was constant . But I cant believe for a moment that it was ever really deserved . <p> Why do we yell ? <p> Yelling is a habit . Our " shouty " neighbor had probably developed the habit of yelling because it got her a quick result . While I will never know the reason this mother yelled at her children , she seemed to flare up at the slightest provocation . She was my model " puffer-fish " parent , using her size and power to intimidate her children for every infraction , or whenever she felt challenged or threatened . <p> Research tells us that parents dislike yelling . Surveyed parents indicate that they see yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary techniques , but those same parents also acknowledge that they yell as much as they use time-out ( which is used at a surprisingly high rateespecially for something that is generally ineffective ) . Despite the fact that we do n't  like yelling , we do itand we do it a lot . <p> The question is " why " ? Why are we so quick to yell at our children at home ? We seem capable of controlling our volume ( and aggression ) in public ; it is rare that we see a parent start shouting at his children in public , and it is rarer still to see an adult shout at another adult . <p> If you worked in an office where the boss summoned you to her office by shouting out your name , youd probably look for ways to avoid her , even if you werent in trouble . And if you were shouted at when you were in trouble , youd probably start looking for a new employer . <p> Why wont they listen ? <p> Many parents tell me , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and ask them and they either ignore me , or its like they 're deafthey only listen when I yell . " Of course , most typically developing children are in no way hard of hearingwatch what happens when your children are in earshot and you ask them quietly whether they would like a bowl of ice-cream or 20 dollars or just whisper the word " chocolate . " Rest assured , they will hear you . Unless a child has a genuine physical hearing problem , he or she is choosing not to listenperhaps for very good reasons . <p> I do not believe that children are being disobedient when they do n't  listen . So are they being rebellious ? Troublemakers ? Ratbags ? Why are they ignoring us ? <p> Well , perhaps our children choose not to respond to us because we have trained them to wait until we yell before they actwe ask them to do something in a nice , respectful way , but they choose not to act immediately , and notice that nothing happens . So we ask again , nicely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , we yell . <p> Perhaps our children choose not to respond because we have trained them to wait until we yell before they act . <p> There may also be a second reason our children are not respondingbecause of the way we speak to them . Think about it . When you 're in the middle of doing something that matters to you , and someone asks you to stop doing it and pay attention to them , how do you feel ? Are you inclined to respond immediately and willingly ? <p> Furthermore , what is the main reason we usually speak to our children ? Most children will say when we call their name it means one of two things : I 'm in trouble , or I 'm going to be asked to do chores . So our children stop responding to us because our communication with them is typically only to correct or direct . <p> So the issue is n't really about getting our children to listen . They can hear us just finethey just do n't  want to hear what we are constantly nagging them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite our children to comply with basic requests in a timely mannerand keeping the volume down while we do it . <p> The effects of yelling <p> You may be surprised at the damage that can be done to your children when you yell . <p> Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan in the US conducted a two-year study and found that " severe verbal discipline " may have a profoundly negative impact on childrens wellbeing . They found that tweens and teens whose parents yelled for discipline experienced increased behavioral issues ( including being violent or being vandals ) , and that the impact of being yelled at regularly was as serious as if the children were being hit . <p> Watching a parent get in her childs face and scream at her while nose to nose is severe , especially when it is accompanied by name calling and other insults or threats . <p> Other research has shown that yelling at least 25 times in a 12-month period can have a negative impact on childrens self-esteem , increasing the likelihood of depression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not sure you yell at your children that much ? Its a good idea to track how often you raise your voice at your children , and what the reasons for yelling are . Perhaps create a spreadsheet to record the date , the issue , your response , the outcome , and what you could have done differently . <p> There is power in creating a spreadsheet like this , regardless of the behavior you wish to eliminate . Firstly , it helps to identify how often you act in a certain way , as well as the circumstances surrounding that behavior . But the power comes in the fourth and fifth columns , as you consider the impact of your behavior and look for alternative strategies to employ in the future . This cognitive rehearsal strengthens the foundations of your new habit and helps to literally rewire your brain and establish new , more positive behavior or thinking patterns . <p> Practical anti-yelling strategies <p> So let 's get really practical for a moment . If you rely on yelling , screaming , shouting or " speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following strategies might help . <p> Go to your children : When you want your childrens attention , walk to them . You would do it in an office with other adults or in nearly any context other than at home . This is respectful , mindful , and a much better way to get a relationship right than by yelling . <p> Speak to your children softly , calmly , and kindly , and your children will be more likely to respond positively because you have shown them respect . They will also respond because they cant pretend not to have heard youyoure standing right in front of them . <p> Timing is important <p> As a natural extension of being in our childrens presence and seeing what they are doing , there may be times our requests might receive better responses if we give the children some advanced notice . <p> If what they are doing matters to them ( and you 're not late for the airport ) you could suggest : " In the next few minutes I 'll ask you to stop what you 're doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might say , " In 10 minutes time , dinner will be ready . When I call you , I 'd like you to come straight away so we can eat while the food is hot . " <p> As my children have grown , I have found that asking them when I can expect to have their input and contribution can be helpful . We might put a deadline on our request , such as , " In the next 15 minutes I 'll need your help in the kitchen , " but we give the children the freedom to choose when they will help . When we recognize our childrens preferences , and allow them some autonomy in what is to occur in their lives , we are calmer , our children are happier , and there is less yelling . <p> Get softer <p> This is probably my favorite non-yelling strategy . From time to time , even when we are with our children and trying to see the world through their eyes , they can be unresponsive . Their eyes wont leave the screen . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The typical response is to make ourselves heard by getting bigger , louder and angrier ; puffer-fish parenting . However , since we 've discovered that our typical responses are usually the most unhelpful ways to respond , doing the opposite is often helpful . <p> Speak to your children softly , calmly , and kindly , and they will be more likely to respond positively . <p> If your children do not respond to your calm , kind and respectful requests for their attention , do n't  yell . Instead , speak more softly . If they still do n't  respond , quietly whisper their name and with peace in your heart and voice soft , hold their hand , look into their eyes and gently say , " I 've asked you to do something three times now . Have you got any idea what it was ? " <p> If they respond that they have no idea what you previously said , you can softly repeat it . If you 're looking into their eyes at the time , you 'll know whether they 've understood . And if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , or when they 've finished what they 're presently doing . <p> The irony is that when we shout , people switch off because its offensive and we have just demonstrated that we have lost control of the situation . We are now fighting for powerin the position of underdog . But when we speak softly they strain to take in every word we say . <p> Your message will get across with focused soft speaking . <p> Call out to your children for other reasons <p> Parents spend a good deal of time communicating with children about things we do n't  like , or things that we do n't  like about them . We call out because bags have been left at the door , or clothes and shoes are still on the floor . We shout for our childrens attention so we can delegate and dictate . <p> Our relationships swing too far towards endless correction and direction . Instead , try engaging in relationship-building and making things go right a little more . In so doing , you may find your children become much more open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I love yelling out my childrens names and then saying , " I love you ! " It means that its okay to be loud sometimes , and even to yell . But the yelling is for good , rather than for my own convenience or frustration .

" <p> The choice to stay calmor at least to speak quietlyrequires discipline and effort . <p> Dr. John Gottman , one of the worlds most celebrated relationship experts , has suggested that when our interactions start with harshness ( such as when we yell at someone ) , the likelihood of a positive outcome from the interaction is very low .

That was the startling conclusion embraced by Judith Rich Harris nearly 20 years ago in The Nurture Assumption . And it was one I reflected on frequently while reading two new works , Jonah Lehrers A Book About Love and Alison Gopniks The Gardener and the Carpenter . <p> Harris relied largely on findings from the field of behavioral genetics . The traditional studies in this field compare various types of siblingsidentical and fraternal twins , adoptive and biological brothers and sistersto sort the causes of childrens traits into three bins : genes , the shared environment , and the non-shared environment . If identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins , for example , that 's assumed to be genes at work ; if adoptive siblings are more similar than random strangers , that 's the shared environment .

For about 70 percent of traits , shared environment did n't  seem to do much at all . By contrast , genes were consistently powerful , typically explaining about half the variation in the traits . <p> Certainly , there are some nuances here . Parents do affect some important things , including social values and religion , which are , respectively , 27 percent and 35 percent explained by the shared environment . ( Educational attainment also has an influence from the shared environment , but its not clear whether parenting , parents money , or something else is what 's making the difference . ) No one denies that severe deprivation hurts kids . And genes and the environment work together in various ways , making the classic three-discrete-bins approach somewhat reductive . <p> But as a general matter , if parents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each child , because merely sharing the same house does n't  seem to make kids much more similar to each other than strangers are . Of those two new books , only one seriously addresses this fact . <p> A Book About Love <p> Jonah Lehrers A Book About Love is , well , a book about lovemainly in the sense of sacrifice and hard work , not so much the warm cuddly feelings . It is n't exclusively about parents and childrenit also covers marriage and religionbut it argues at length that it matters how well children bond with their caretakers . <p> Lehrer is right , up to a point . These relationships are important , and the effects are especially clear when they involve separation , neglect , or abuse . He cites one study of Finnish children who were evacuated to foster homes during World War II ; they avoided the bombing campaigns witnessed by the kids who stayed , but they were separated from their parents , and they ended up nearly twice as likely to die of cardiovascular disease decades later . Animal research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow up cognitively impaired when denied the attention of their mothers while young . And of course , this website has explored in depth the consequences of father absence ; there is good evidence that its correlations with bad outcomes are partly causal . <p> Merely sharing the same house does n't  seem to make kids much more similar to each other than strangers . <p> But Lehrers discussion of " attachment styles " takes this line of thinking much further . To summarize the idea bluntly : bad parenting causes kids to be " insecurely attached " to their caregivers , which in turn leads them to be much less well-adjusted and successfulin an astonishing variety of wayswhen they grow up . Since something like 40 percent of American children are n't  securely attached , this is a very big claim ; it covers even modestly below-average parents , not just the extremes . <p> For young children , attachment styles are measured through the " Strange Situation Test , " where researchers look to see how a child behaves in a room with a parent and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first , " securely attached " kids explore the room but return to the parent as a " safe base " ; they become distressed when the parent leaves , but they are happy again when the parent returns . " Insecure " attachments come in various forms , but they include , as Lehrer writes , " the kids who do n't  cry when abandoned or cant stop crying when the experiment is over . " <p> These styles correlate with both ( A ) how sensitive parents are to their kids needs at home and ( B ) childrens outcomes , from social popularity at age 5 to standardized-test scores in the teen years to health at age 32 . The attachment theorists key inference , which Lehrer hoovers up hook , line , and sinker , is that ( A ) causes ( B ) . <p> But that inference does not necessarily followand it is also difficult to square with the findings of behavioral genetics . If attachment is merely a function of the parents behavior , you would expect it to be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good parent should be a good parent to all his or her children . But shared environment is exactly what behavioral genetics says is n't generally important . <p> Behavioral genetics also forces us to consider alternative explanations for the seeming power of attachment . Maybe parental sensitivity and/or childhood attachment behaviors are genetic , and those same genes contribute to difficulty later in life for the child . <p> Unfortunately , A Book About Love ignores this possibilityexcept for one footnote that touches on behavioral-genetics research . In that footnote , Lehrer cites a 2003 twin study finding that a childs attachment style is , as speculated above , mostly a part of the shared environment . He does n't  seem to realize the problem , which ( again ) is that the shared environment in its entirety does n't  matter much . <p> But a 2009 literature review blurs the picture . Studies consistently find that childrens attachment behavior is n't highly genetic ( the highest estimate cited is 25 percent ; several studies find it to be negligible ) , but the balance between shared and non-shared environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellmeaning that some kids might be genetically more sensitive to the effects of bad parenting . <p> Perhaps attachment largely goes into the non-shared-environment bin , not the shared-environment one , because parents bond with different kids in different ways . In that case , attachment could powerfully affect kids outcomes without contradicting the core findings of behavioral genetics . In one study , nearly one-third of identical twins had different attachment styles , which would seem to buttress this possibility . Its worth more research , especially considering that therapy can change attachment styles . <p> What I would like to see is a long-term follow-up to twin studies of attachment . When one identical twin is securely attached and the other is not , does the former twin usually do better in life ? I cant find any research along these lines , and it would not be too surprising if none existed : Few have probed the nexus between attachment styles and genes . <p> So if that 's a blind spot for A Book About Love , its one the book shares with many professional researchers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About Love , psychology professor Alison Gopniks The Gardener and the Carpenter is a breath of fresh air . By page 23 , there can be no doubt that Gopnik knows the score and wont try to explain it away : <p> It is very difficult to find any reliable , empirical relation between the small variations in what parents dothe variations that are the focus of parentingand the resulting adult traits of their children ... From an empirical perspective , parenting is a mugs game . <p> Indeed , the central argument of Gopniks book is that we should reject the concept of " parenting " entirely . She notes that even the word is a recent invention , having become popular only in the 1970s ( though I would add that the concept of " rearing " children , and anxiety about how best to do so , goes back much further ) . Her title refers to the idea that parents should see themselves not as " carpenters " aiming to craft something specific , but rather as " gardeners , " aiming to help those under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the finer details . <p> Much of Gopniks book focuses on her own research into how kids learn . Kids really are information sponges , and in some ways , they learn better than adults do . Their brains are actually wired to make fresh connections more easily ; unlike the rest of us , they are not stuck in their ways and adamant about their hard-won ideas of how the world works . <p> But they 're not just sponges . They are surprisingly adept at extracting information from their environment and interpreting it properly . When they imitate adults , they do n't  do so thoughtlessly ; they think through what the adults were trying to accomplish and try to figure out whether the adults actually knew what they were doing . Through this process , kids learn the traditions of those who came before , but they also challenge those traditions , develop them , and adapt them to new circumstances . <p> Kids really are information sponges , and in some ways , they learn better than adults do . <p> If we cant deliberately mold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , what we can do is provide an environment ripe for learning and experimentation . Gopnik notes , for instance , that we can provide " scaffolding " for kids activitiessetting the conditions for " guided play , " such as asking them to sort shapes according to certain rulesand let them explore . <p> The Gardener and the Carpenter is less impressive when it strays from Gopniks areas of expertise , though . Here she is , for example , discussing how public policy could help parents and children : <p> There is no mystery about the moral advantages or the good practical consequences of policies such as universal prenatal care , home visitors and nurses , paid parental leave for men and women , universal and free preschool , and direct subsidies to parents . These policies really do lead to better outcomes for children as a wholein fact , this is one of the clearest results in all of social science . <p> " Multiple studies , " she continues , show that they work . <p> When I chased down the reference for Gopniks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all of social science , " I ended up with Heckman 2006 and Kirp 2009 . Both of these are basically arguments for the value of preschoolthe science of which is not , I know from years of following the issue , settled . A big part of the debate is whether universal programs confer ( or even plausibly could confer ) benefits anything like those seen in small , intense , well-run interventions like Perry Preschool . See Grover Whitehurst of the Brookings Institution for a sober analysis of the evidence on this topic . <p> That 's not to say these policies are bad , and at any rate , I 'm not going to resolve debates about several huge proposals in one article ( a double book review at that ! ) . For whatever its worth , I 'm personally sympathetic to direct subsidies to parents and leery of mandatory paid parental leave . But it was disappointingafter Gopniks detailed and thoughtful discussions of her own research , and amid her heroic project to convince parents they 're not going to break their kidsto see her assert so blithely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was no surprise that The Nurture Assumption was in the back of my mind as I read these titles ; to this day , its the lens through which I view all claims about parenting . I would also like it to be the foundation of my households parenting ( or at least child-gardening ) philosophy , but for the life of me , I can not get my wife to read it . Shes already decided our son is going to Northwestern . <p> I do n't  think I 'll be recommending A Book About Love to her . I have a feeling it would make her want to feed our son into some sort of homemade Strange Situation Test so we could see firsthand whether were horrible parents . But maybe The Gardener and the Carpenter is a good middle ground for couples like usrealistic about the limits of " parenting , " but respectful of what parents really can bring to the table . 
@@89589157 @5089157/ <p> As a university professor for more than 25 years , I enjoy browsing the pages of The Chronicle of Higher Education . I was delighted when I saw this fine publication give attention to an issue that I have made the focus of my scholarship over the past 15 years : public policy initiatives designed to help couples form and sustain healthy romantic relationships and marriages . I 've tried to keep readers of this blog informed about these government efforts , looking at such things as who is being served by these programs and results of some important evaluation studies . <p> The author of the Chronicle article " The Mom and Dad Experiment , " Tom Bartlett , did a nice job , overall . The piece was informative , mostly accurate , and balanced . Bartlett certainly did a better job than journalist Eduardo Porter did last week on this same subject in a much more prominent outlet , the New York Times . For one thing , he did n't  use the term " marriage promotion , " like so many other journalists have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples , married and unmarried , with knowledge , skills , and supports that might help them deal better with the stresses that tear at their relationships . <p> In other words , directly promoting marriage is not the goal . A few program administrators used funds to run local media campaigns as a tool to recruit program participants , and some of these campaigns understandably had messages promoting the value of strong marriages . But such campaigns used a tiny fraction of the overall funds allocated to initiative as a whole . Also , though some think that government funds were used to pay poor couples to marry , this has never happened . More than a decade ago , a few policy advocateson both the right and leftnoted that some poor couples faced economic penalties from reduced welfare benefits if they chose to formalize their unions . So they reasoned that incentives to offset that " marriage tax " would be a good idea . For both political and pragmatic reasons , this policy idea never got traction . " Marriage promotion " thus does not accurately describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do now : reduce family instability and improve childrens lives across a range of family circumstances . <p> But back to Bartletts article . I chuckled when I read Bartletts line about some points I made in an interview with him several months before the article was published . He referred to me and a few other scholars , such as Kathryn Edin , Scott Stanley , and Ron Haskins , who also were interviewed for the article , as members of the " silver-linings club . " Indeed , some of us are not overly discouraged about some early results from a large government study of relationship education programs for lower-income unmarried couples that did n't  find much of an effect . <p> Bartlett appropriately gave extended space in his article to scholarly critics of what the healthy marriages and relationships initiative has been able to achieve . New social policies receiving large federal expenditures $1 billion in this casedeserve scrutiny . Respected scholars such as Dr. Matthew Johnson and Dr. Ben Karney , quoted at length in the article , have voiced concerns about the programs poor evaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on to something more effective . <p> In the article , Karney said " the verdict is in " and Johnson said that we should " call it a day . " That is , as good scientists , we know enough now to conclude that we need to pull the plug on these programs and move on . No more good money after bad policy . To his credit , Johnson admits that the same thing could be said about other popular social policy programs that are much more expensive and have a longer history of tepid results than does the healthy marriages and relationships initiative . <p> But the big point I want to make in response to their critique is this : no , we do n't  know enough yet , and we need to give the initiative a little more time . Ill be even more specific : let 's give it three to four more years ( costing $225-$300 million ) . And indeed , that is the federal governments plan , given the current round of nearly 50 service-delivery and evaluation grants now operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a reauthorization of the TANF program by Congress ) . In a few years , we will have a lot more hard evidence than we do now to make a fair , scientifically informed decision about how effective these kinds of programs can be in the fight against family instability . <p> here 's why I think we need to be a little more patient . <p> First , the critics call to cut these programs is based on too narrow a reading of the full body of evidence now available . The critics cite the first large-scale , multi-site , rigorous evaluation study out of the chute , the Building Strong Families study , 1 which struggled to find long-term positive outcomes for **26;806;TOOLONG programs for unmarried parents . This was an important study , but it was a first study . In essence , it was a pilot studyalbeit an excellent , high-quality , and high-cost one . But it had weaknesses and limitations , like in all studies . It takes a larger body of work than one study to answer a complex , challenging question such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse situations . Since the publication of this first study , a growing body of research is emerging that sheds greater light on the effectiveness of these kinds of programs . <p> This ongoing work ( much of it reviewed here2 ) paints a more nuanced and somewhat more optimistic picture now . One recent study , 3 for instance , reanalyzed the aforementioned Building Strong Families data and found small but positive effects for the most disadvantaged couples in the study . This studyand an emerging body of work from other scholarspoints at the possibility that the most stressed participants in **26;862;TOOLONG programs are gaining the most from them . Similarly , a large-scale , rigorous evaluation study of **26;890;TOOLONG programs for lower-income married parents , the Supporting Healthy Marriage study , &lt;4 found small but significant positive effects for these couples . Another rigorous study found that these programs can reduce divorce rates over two years.5 Still another has found not only positive effects for lower-income couples but positive effects on their children , 6 as well , which is the ultimate aim of this policy initiative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of scholarly teams to reanalyze these large-scale data sets to create a deeper and more fine-grained portrait of what these programs were or were not able to do . For instance , right now I 'm working with a group of scholars analyzing the Building Strong Families study to see if participating in the program caused any " positive break-ups . " That is , we know that some relationships among disadvantaged couples are formed quickly , are low in commitment , involve some relationship violence and infidelity , and have other serious problems.7 One of the major learning points of these educational programs is what a healthy relationship looks like . We think it is possible that participating in these programs could precipitate earlier break-ups among those in unhealthy relationships that are not good candidates for long-term , healthy marriages . Its asking a lot of a short-term educational intervention to fix a relationship that may be fundamentally flawed rather than under a lot of stress . So a quicker ( and safer ) break-up might be a positive outcome . Yet a break-up registers in the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Moreover , more scholarship is emerging on relationship education almost every month now , much of it based on evaluation studies of the kinds of programs that the federal government has been funding over the past decade . And the studies are looking not just at whether the programs work but how and why they may work , and for whom they are working . So we are still learning things that should help improve the government-funded programs in the future . <p> Researchers will continue producing even more work over the next three to five years because all funded programs are now required to conduct evaluation studies . Until last year , program administrators were told by the federal government not to invest funds in evaluations ; the funds were designed for demonstration grants to see what was possible . ( A handful of grant holders were active researchers , however , and used their own resources to publish evaluation studies on their programs . ) But that has all changed . Like so many social policy initiatives , the healthy marriages and relationships programs receiving federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluated as part of President Obamas broad push to shape social policy and programs in light of rigorous evaluation research.8 <p> In short , now is not the time to toss in the towel . We are learning a lot more these days . In the next few years , a treasure-trove of evaluation findings will put us in a much better position to judge the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of educational programs to help disadvantaged individuals and couples strengthen their relationships and achieve their dreams of a stable , healthy family in which to raise their children . <p> Karney claims that " we look like bad scientists " if we continue to support this policy initiative in the face of some early data showing these programs have little effect . I think he is viewing the research through too narrow a lens . But just as important , if we pull the plug now , we will forfeit the chance to learn from a much broader and deeper research base than we have now . And good science calls for establishing a solid base of research before drawing strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course for a few more years . <p> One final comment . I want to acknowledge a point that critics such as Johnson and Karney regularly make : that poverty and economic stress make it hard for relationships to thrive , even when couples have upgraded their knowledge , skills , and supports for maintaining a healthy relationship . They are right . That is why I am a cheerleader for integrated , effective policies to improve the economic and social ecology in which these relationships are embedded . A better economy , more work opportunities for the less educated , access to better education , more sensible incarceration laws , better workplace policies to help couples balance work and family needs , and programs that reduce unplanned pregnancies are needed , too . <p> But it should n't be either-or . Helping the disadvantaged in our increasingly unequal society requires all hands on deck . It is false to think that human relationships are only a product of their environments , that relationship choices are fully determined by their external contexts . Like many other prominent scholars across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices also play a role in poverty and disadvantage , even as those choices are shaped and constrained by external forces . We should n't dehumanize the disadvantaged any more than we should ignore the difficult circumstances they encounter day-to-day . Attending to the human behavioral parts of relationships can help couples form and sustain healthy marriages and relationships . If we combine these efforts with attempts to create a more fertile economic and social soil in which all relationships can flourish , we are more likely to make a dent in the challenging social problem of family instability . 
@@89589160 @5089160/ <p> November marks National Caregiving Month . Having served for many years as a hospice chaplain and COO , I have seen first hand the power of home-based , family-centered caregiving . However , for all its strengths , providing care to a seriously i 'll adult as an informal , uncompensated , family caregiver can incur high costs that are often invisible to society at large . National Caregiving Month provides a perfect opportunity to increase our awareness of those costs . <p> Caregiving for an aging or i 'll adult can be costly on a number of levels . Financially , nearly half of all caregivers spend more than $5000 annually on care costs . These monies can cover a wide range of assistance from yard work and home maintenance , transportation , medication management , and grocery shopping to more intimate and time-intensive tasks such as bathing , dressing , toileting , and walking , all of which tend to require the purchase or rental of medical equipment or even covering the costs of custodial care . <p> In addition to making monetary sacrifices , caregivers can incur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scholars note that family caregiving is considered a " chronic stress " situation affecting physical health and well being and causing a secondary impact on the professional life of the caregiver . On average , caregivers serve 20.4 hours per week , thus many must stop working or shift to part-time work , producing long-term effects on their Social Security payments and lifetime wage earnings , personal savings , professional advancement and earning potential . Employers also pay a price when an employee takes on elder care responsibilities . However , we all benefit from family-provided care because replacing it with compensated care would cost society approximately $450 billion . <p> In addition to making monetary sacrifices , caregivers can incur physical , emotional , and professional costs as well . <p> As a part of our research* on family caregiving , we met Kyle , a quintessential face of the " sandwich generation , " who provided a poignant example of the creative ways family caregivers manage the multi-faceted costs of providing elder care . Forty-two years old , married , and the father of three elementary schoolaged children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time commercial pilot . His wife also worked full-time , and they relied on her parents and his father for childcare when Kyle traveled . Compounding this already full schedule , Kyle chose to serve as the primary caregiver for his divorced and single mother in the final year of her life . <p> He described how his caregiving responsibilities snuck up on him . In the early stages of her cancer diagnosis , his mom , who lived about an hour away from his home , would call with an emergency and he , or his uncle if Kyle was out of town on a trip , would drive to the hospital to help her navigate the relevant care decisions . Between these crisis moments , she was able to live on her own . Kyle would mow her lawn and check up on her every few days by phone , but that care did n't  intrude too heavily into his day-to-day life . <p> But then his moms cancer treatments became less effective , the emergency calls came more frequently , and the doctor sat down with Kyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her own any longer . She was referred to hospice , and she could either be admitted to a long-term care facility , which would require her to " spend down " her personal savings in order to qualify , eventually , for the Medicaid Room and Board benefit , or move in with Kyle and his family . <p> As both mother and son contemplated their next steps , Kyle talked with his wife about what they could afford to do . The couple decided that home care would be best , if she would agree to it , and that they " were prepared to ride it out knowing how difficult it might be . " The next day they invited Kyles mom to live with them , but they had one stipulation : that she not smoke cigarettes inside the house , a choice he knew would be hard for her to make as a life-long smoker . However , she agreed , but new tense and vulnerable conversations soon followed as they faced moving her out of her home , closing out her financial accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childrens rooms for her . Meanwhile , his mom set up a payment plan with Kyle so that she could contribute small amounts to their food and utility costs . <p> In time , Kyle became her agent designated by his mothers power of attorney , which helped him manage her finances per her wishes . Much to Kyles surprise , his father , divorced from his mother for more than thirty years , offered to help him by staying with his mom a few days a week as her condition declined . Kyles mom lived with them for almost a year , and Kyle was at her side when she died . <p> For many grown children , the impulse to care for an aging parent is there , but the financial ability do so is not . <p> Recent coverage by Forbes of the out-of-pocket costs of family caregivers highlights that most caregivers admitted that they had not talked with their family members in advance about how to cover expenses . Kyle spoke with candor about how nervous he was to broach the private subject of finances with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reassure her that he would honor her wishes , while recognizing how much her health and her personal privacy were now out of her control . Making her wishes known about the costs of her care helped return power and some independence to her . A year after his moms death , Kyle admitted while that balancing all the cumulative , unexpected costs of caring for his mom was challenging , he would make the choice all over again . <p> For many grown children , the impulse to care for an aging parent is there , but inability to pay the direct costs or to sacrifice the financial income from steady work makes living the impulse nearly impossible . Kyle had a supportive spouse , father , and employer who all made it possible for him to care for his mother in her final year of life . But many more sons and daughters will be our future Kyles , and they will not have that support . For example , Linda Waite writes evocatively of how family trees are turning into bean stalks , a phenomena of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will add further complexity to the balancing act that is family care . <p> Conversely , Suzanne Bianchi and Judith Seltzer note that contemporary family trees are also changing shape as divorce , single parenthood , cohabitation , and remarriage become the norm . These configurations graft in new family tree branches whose role in the caregiving transfer of money , time , and housing remains ambiguous . Law Professor Allison Hoffman suggests that to compensate for a reduction in kinship care , " next friend " care will increase , with financial , physical , and emotional costs incurred by our friends and neighbors . And ultimately , when informal family care does n't  exist or fails , the public sector must pick up the slack . However , as Paul Taylor has already noted , a gap in public sector funding also looms as the financial needs of an aging Baby Boomer population soon outweigh the contributions of younger generations . <p> Caregiving costs , especially at the end of life , are expensive . Reducing costs system-wide as well as supporting an increase in informal care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an expansion of current programs that are working well . The recent IOM report Dying in America recommended that several caregiving support efforts be continued and expanded , such as " Medicaids Cash and Counseling program , available in about 15 states , that permits beneficiaries to pay family members modest sums for home care services in some cases . " <p> In addition to societal efforts to support family caregiving , individual family caregivers and elders can increase their efforts to think outside of the box in covering caregiving and end-of-life expenses . For example , Kyles mother bartered flight lessons with a local mortuary owner for her cremation costs , which reduced the eventual financial burden that Kyle faced after her death . And as always , talking with family members about our wishes remains a crucial step in being prepared . <p> Family caregivers are an invisible force for good in our society , and they need our collective and individual attention and support . As many of us gather around Thanksgiving tables , we face a perfect opportunity to remember and give thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an adult with health or mobility challenges . <p> *All names have been changed to protect the identities of our interview cohort .
