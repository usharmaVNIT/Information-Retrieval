Consumption duality expresses this problem as two sides of the same coin : keeping our budget fixed and maximising utility ( primal demand , which leads us to Marshallian demand curves ) or setting a target level of utility and minimising the cost associated with it ( dual demand , which gives us Hicksian demand curves ) . We must also look at the Lagrangian functions where we obtain the first derivatives . <p> This leads us to the main difference between the two types of demand : Marshallian demand curves simply show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity demanded of it . Hicksian demand curves show the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded of it assuming that the prices of other goods and our level of utility remain constant. - This makes sense when we look at consumption duality : for dual ( Hicksian ) demand , we maintain a fixed level of utility , and so our level of wealth , or income , must remain constant . We simply can not be as satisfied if we do not maintain equal purchasing power . <p> Marshallian and Hicksian demand curves meet where the quantity demanded is equal for both sides of the consumer choice problem ( maximising utility or minimising cost ) . For prices above this equilibrium point , consumer wealth is higher with Hicksian demand curves than Marshallian demand curves , because to maintain utility constant , Hicksian demand curves assume real wealth remains unchanged . Marshallian demand assumes only nominal wealth remains equal . The opposite is true for prices below this point : Marshallian demand assumes that as nominal wealth remains the same but price levels drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hicksian demand assumes real wealth is constant , so the individual is worse off . This is why Marshallian demand curves are more stable ' : they reflect both rent effect and substitution effect . Hicksian demand curves only show substitution effects ( utility is constant , therefore rent must remain constant ) , which means that demand varies with price only because other options become more attractive . <p> Formally , <p> Marshallian demand ( dX1 ) is a function of the price of X1 , the price of X2- ( assuming two goods ) and the level of income or wealth ( m ) : <p> X*=dX1 ( PX1 , PX2 , m ) <p> Hicksian demand ( hX1 ) is a function of the price of X1 , the price of X2- ( assuming two goods ) and the level of utility we opt for ( U ) : <p> X*=hX1 ( PX1 , PX2 , U ) <p> For an individual problem , these are obtained from the first order conditions ( maximising the first derivatives ) of the Lagrangian for either a primal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we look at goods or services that make up a large part of our expenses .

@@35829198 @4829198/ <h> Elasticity <p> Elasticity is a concept introduced by British economist Alfred Marshall , and is used in order to measure the variation that a variable suffers when another variable is changed . We can distinguish between different types of elasticity depending on the variables we are using . <p> Probably the most common example is price elasticity of demand , which measures changes in the demand of a good or service when its price is increased or decreased . It 's important to note that only price should be modified ; this is , ceteris paribus , as in the contrary our measurement would be affected by changes in other variables . Depending on the type of good we analyse , we will see different relations between price changes and demand variation . For example , in the case of ordinary goods , an increase ( decrease ) of price will result in a decrease ( increase ) of demand , and thus will follow a negative relation . However , with Giffen goods the contrary will be true , an increase ( decrease ) of price will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this time implies a positive relation between both variables . Regarding elasticity , apart from the direction or the sign of the relation we also look at the degree of responsiveness . This way , we distinguish between inelastic goods ( or relative inelasticity ) and elastic goods ( or relative elasticity ) . When , in absolute terms , the value of price elasticity of demand is lower than one , we 'll have inelasticity and , if it is higher than one , we 'll have elasticity . <p> Another example of elasticity that is frequently found in Economics textbooks is income elasticity of demand . It measures variation in demand due to changes in the consumers ' income . Normal goods are those whose demand increases due to a rise in income levels , having therefore a positive correlation , which implies that the elasticity of this kind of goods is always higher than 0 . On the other hand , inferior goods are those whose demand moves in opposite direction to the income variation of consumers . <p> Similarly to price elasticity of demand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case as a result of changes in other goods ' prices . In the case of normal goods , an increase in the price of substitutive goods will imply a higher demand for the other substitutive goods . <p> Concerning firms , the Lerner indexcan capture the relationship between price elasticity of demand and market power . It does this by measuring the firm 's level of market power by relating the selling price to marginal cost . Therefore , the extent to which a firm can take advantage of its monopolistic power will highly depend on the elasticity of its demand curve . If it is more rigid ( steeper ) , it will only have to reduce its production in order to achieve a higher price . However the more flexible ( flatter ) the demand curve is , the less market power the firm has to increase prices .

At this competitive equilibrium , firms ' profits will necessarily have to be zero , because otherwise there will be new firms that , attracted by the profits , would enter the market increasing supply and pushing prices down . Following the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics , this equilibrium must be Pareto efficient . Both will have a fundamental relation as a mechanism for determining optimal production , consumption and exchange . <p> The economic problem that is faced needs to find the most adequate allocation of factors of production in order to produce goods X and Y and how these goods will be distributed amongst consumers A and B. This configuration will be such that there will be no other feasible configuration that will allow an increase in any individual 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to achieve Pareto optimality , a certain set of assumptions need to be held . <p> -The production function needs to be continuous , differentiable , and strictly concave . This will result in a convex set of production possibilities , also known as production possibility frontier Its shape shows an increasing opportunity cost as we need to use a higher number of resources in order to produce a larger amount of a certain good . <p> -Consumers- preferences need to be monotonic , convex and continuous , showing how individuals welfare increases with a greater amount of goods , but with a decreasing marginal utility . <p> We can start by looking at the production of goods X and Y as two different optimisation problems . The firm will have to decide what quantity of capital and labour allocate to the production of good X , as shown on the left side of the diagram below , but also what quantity of capital and labour assign to the production of good Y , as shown on the right . These curves are the isoquants corresponding to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together using what is known as the Edgeworth box , which makes it easier to compare quantities of capital and labour used , while also comparing quantities of goods X and Y being produced . Indeed , it 's not only easier to analyse , but also makes more sense , since the total available quantities of capital and labour are given. - <p> The solution to this problem is related to the marginal rate of technical substitution ( MRTS ) . A higher efficiency will be achieved if the reallocation of a unit of labour or capital from one good to another leads to a higher production of the former . When the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal for both goods , it means that all available inputs are being used , which translates into a purely efficient production process. - <p> Graphically , if we plot all these points we construct what is known as the contract curve ( blue curve in the Edgeworth box ) . These represent all Pareto efficient distributions , such as F , G or H. I is not Pareto efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would result in an increase in the production of one of the goods without giving up the production of the other . - From this curve we can derive the production possibility frontier , which shows the quantities of goods X and Y being produced , as shown in the following diagram . It must be noted that both the contract curve and its derivative , the production possibility frontier , show all the solutions that are Pareto efficient from the firm 's point of view . Only when considering input and output prices will we be able to determine a unique solution ( because of the concavity of the production possibility frontier ) . <p> Consumption optimisation <p> Bundles of goods can not be ranked in a reliable way without knowledge of the distribution of the products , especially if a bundle has different amounts of each good . There may be some bundles that have more products of a good but less of another . The optimisation problem will be to maximise the utility of individuals A and B subject to a limited total amount of goods X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve the optimal distribution of two , already produced goods ( X and Y ) between two individuals ( A and B ) . We can follow the same step by step method used before . Here , we 'll plot indifference curves corresponding to the amounts of goods X and Y consumed by A ( on the left ) , and the amounts of goods consumed by B ( on the right ) . <p> Again , we use the Edgeworth box to graph the different distributions that can be given between two individuals , A and B , and two goods , X and Y. The further the indifference curve is from the origin , the higher the level of utility enjoyed by the consumer. - <p> Although all the points in the graphic are feasible , not all are efficient , given the utilities and preferences of consumers . The indifference curves join all the points that give consumers the same level of utility . By connecting all points of tangency between the indifference curves of both individuals , the contract curve is constructed and represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the point where both consumers have an equal marginal rate of substitution for goods X and Y , and are therefore not willing to trade between them , as it would result in a lower utility . <p> Global optimum <p> Until now we have only considered different parts of the economy , and not the economy as a whole . The optimisation problem faced this time is similar to the previous one , although this time an additional restriction is added , since we are here considering both production and consumption : the production level also needs to be efficient. - <p> As this optimisation problem is based on the previous one , we have the same marginal rate of substitution equalisation , but also these two must be equal to the marginal rate of transformation , the PPF 's slope , - <p> These solutions are multiple , since there are various points where the condition holds . However , if we consider output prices ( given by the consideration of input prices mentioned before ) , we are able to consider a unique solution . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PX and PY , the equilibrium would be point E. However , if output prices were instead P'X and P'Y , the equilibrium would be point E ' . <p> Let 's say that prices are set at PX and PY , and that the equilibrium point is E , as seen in the diagram below . Consumers A and B will consume both goods X and Y in different amounts . These amounts are given by the equilibrium in consumption , point E on the contract curve . We have also equilibrium in the production process , given by point E on the production possibility frontier . We know this is a general equilibrium because the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the marginal rate of transformation ; or , in other words , the slopes of the indifference curves are equal to the slopes of the production possibility frontier . <p> Competitive markets result in an equilibrium position such that it is not possible to make a change in the allocation without making someone else worse-off . In reality there are many Pareto optimums and we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if one consumer got all of the production and the other one none , we can not say it is an inefficient distribution if all resources are being used efficiently . This is the reason why some economists believe it is an incomplete criterion .

@@35829202 @4829202/ <h> Market structure <p> A market is a set of buyers and sellers , commonly referred to as agents , who through their interaction , both real and potential , determine the price of a good , or a set of goods . The concept of a market structure is therefore understood as those characteristics of a market that influence the behaviour and results of the firms working in that market . <p> The main aspects that determine market structures are : the number of agents in the market , both sellers and buyers ; their relative negotiation strength , in terms of ability to set prices ; the degree of concentration among them ; the degree of differentiation and uniqueness of products ; and the ease , or not , of entering and exiting the market .

@@35829205 @4829205/ <h> Perfect competition I : Supply and demand <h> Summary <p> Even though perfect competition is hard to come by , it 's a good starting point to understand market structures . A deep understanding of how competitive markets work and are formed is the cornerstone to understand why it 's so hard to reach them . In this first Learning Path on perfect competition , we start by analysing firms ' cost structure , before analysing their interaction in the market . <h> The firm : <h> Industry and market : <p> Demand and supply are possibly the two most fundamental concepts used in economics . The concept of market is usually defined as a number of buyers and sellers of a given good or service that are willing to negotiate in order to exchange those goods . We will first explain them separately and then jointly to show their interaction . <p> Demand : <p> Demand is the global market value that expresses the purchasing intentions of consumers . The demand curve shows the quantity of a specific product that individuals or society are willing to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded giving it a downward slope . The reason why this happens is known as the law of demand : ceteris paribus , and considering ordinary goods , the higher the price the lower the quantity demanded , and vice versa . <p> We can start by analysing demand from a purely microeconomic point of view : a single individual , let 's say her name is Joan . Joan 's demand for , let 's say , books , is such as shown in the adjacent graph . If the price of a book is $35 or more , Joan wo n't demand any ( point a ) , given her preferences ( basically , she would rather spend her money on something else ) . However , if the price of books goes down to $30 , she will want to buy one ( point b ) . If it decreases to $20 , Joan will buy two books ( point c ) , and so on . By joining all the points ( a-h ) , we 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for simplicity 's sake ( though violating monotonicity ) , we consider that the demand curve ends at the axes . <p> From a macroeconomic point of view , the demand curve is just the aggregation of all demand curves from all buyers in a particular market . Let 's say the market for books has only two buyers : Joan and her classmate Edward . The horizontal sum of Joan and Edward 's demand curves will give us the market demand : - <p> Supply : <p> On the other side , supply is the set of offers made in the market for the sale of goods and services . The supply curve records the location of the points corresponding to the amount offered for a particular good or service at the different prices . This curve shows a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied , giving it an upward slope . The reason why this happens is known as the law of supply : ceteris paribus , and considering ordinary goods , the higher the price the higher the quantity supplied , and vice versa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built , starting with an individual 's offer , let 's say his name is Robert . Robert is willing to supply books for $10 or more , this is , Robert wo n't supply any books for $5 ( point a ) . However , if the price of books goes up to $10 , he will be willing to sell one book ( point b ) . If it increases to $15 , Robert will sell two books ( point c ) , and so on . By joining all the points ( a-g ) , we 'll get Robert 's supply curve . Notice that the supply curve goes up and seems not to have limits , an assumption made for simplicitys sake . Of course Robert will have troubles to supply more than a certain amount of books , but let 's keep it simple and not think about the upper end of the supply curve . <p> Again , the market 's supply curve is just the aggregation of all supply curves from all sellers in a particular market . Let 's say the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door , Gregory . The horizontal sum of Robert and Gregory 's supply curves will give us the market supply : <p> Equilibrium and market clearing : <p> The demand and supply curves define the market clearing , that is , where the demand of the products meets its supply . At this point we have what is known as , an equilibrium point , with its corresponding price and quantity of equilibrium . <p> It is possible for disequilibrium to occur when the amount demanded does not equal the amount supplied . There are a series of scenarios in which this can happen . In situations in which the quantity demanded is higher than the quantity supplied , the market is suffering from an excess demand . When the opposite occurs we will be talking about an excess supply . Prices will have to gradually adjust through different market mechanisms until the equilibrium price is met . <p> Movements vs. shifts : <p> When analysing demand and supply and their respective curves , it is important to distinguish between two aspects : movements along curves and shifts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the demand or supply curve , which occurs when a change in the quantity is caused by a change in price and vice versa . An increase in the price of a good or service would cause a movement along its demand curve , decreasing the amount demanded . In the case of supply curves , as we previously saw , an increase in price would also increase quantity . It 's important to understand that movement along the curves does never actually change the equilibrium point , as movements along the curves do not affect it . In the adjacent figure we can see a price increase ( let 's say , because an increase of VAT ) , which causes a movement along the demand curve . <p> Sometimes the market suffers from changes due to a displacement ( shift ) of the demand and/or the supply curve . This shift in curves will always result in a new market equilibrium . When a shift occurs , the curve moves , meaning that for each price there will be a new different quantity being demanded or offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards and downwards , or if preferred , rightwards and leftwards . Depending in what curve we are considering one is equal to another one . <p> Demand curves may shift for multiple reasons , for example , an increase in the consumers ' level of income would increase the aggregate demand of a normal good for each price , and hence shift the demand curve to the right ( left figure ) . Other examples would include changes in the price of competitors ( substitute goods ) , changes in complementary goods , tastes , expectations , number of buyers , seasonality , etc. - Supply curve shifts may be also motivated by a variety of different reasons , such as input prices : an increase on the price of paper would shift the supply curve to the left , since the same quantity would be sold at a higher price ( right figure ) . Other variables that can shift the supply curve include technological progress , expectations , number of sellers , etc . <p> Next , let 's use what we 've learned about supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shifts in the supply or demand curves .

This allowed Economics to develop at a much faster pace , and provided the basis for how Economics is studied and investigated today . <h> Marginalism : <h> Neoclassical economists : <p> Jevons was a British economist ( 1835-1882 ) , who is- considered , along with Carl Menger and M.-E. -L . Walras , a co-founder of marginalism and theory of utility . Jevons is the author of the book " The Theory of Political Economy " , 1871 , in which he devised the concept of marginal utility , from an additive and separable utility function , although it was not measurable on cardinal terms . These studies were possible thanks to- Johann H. von Th++nens works , who was the first economist to use the word " marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term " final " . He- is also considered as a precursor of Econometrics for his work on business cycle , index numbers and moving averages , topics on which he used his extensive knowledge of mathematics . <p> Although his works on marginal utility are considered pioneer during the marginal revolution , and important for the development of neoclassical economics , Jevons considered there would be only one possible solution when considering barter exchange . However , there are infinite solutions , as was demonstrated later on by Francis Y. Edgeworth , whose indifference curves are based on Jevons earlier work . <p> As we will see next , Carl Menger is considered the founder of the Austrian School of Economics , which would later take the foundations of marginalism and develop them to their extreme . He also gave a coherent solution to the problem that Ricardo obsessed over all his life : what determines the value of something ?

The way they deal with problems will determine whether they can stay in the market . In this Learning Path we learn about these problems , how firms ' cost structures change , and how an equilibrium is reached in the market . <h> Comparative analysis : <h> Market clearing : <p> Governments will choose to implement taxes to either individuals or firms in order to increase its revenue . When considering takes to firms , it must be noted that these taxes will increase the price of goods being produced and sold , which translates into a welfare loss . However , a distinction between the loss in consumer and producer surplus must be made . The impact on both surpluses depends on the period analysed . <p> Short and long run analysis : <p> In the short run , both consumers and producers will suffer from the tax imposed . A new tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax is imposed to firms , which increase their prices in order to cover their losses . In this case , as shown in the adjacent figure , supply will shift to the left , decreasing the quantity being produced , which increases its prices since demand remains unchanged : the new equilibrium price will be pD ( if the tax was to be imposed to consumers , there would be a shift in demand instead ) . A corresponds to the amount of the tax paid by consumers , while B is the amount paid by producers . Only consumers actually pay more , but producers are getting less out of the sale . The loss in consumer and producer surplus will depend on the elasticity of the demand curve , as shown in the figures below . The lower the elasticity in absolute terms ( left figure ) , the higher the loss in consumer surplus , and the lower in producer surplus . Higher elasticity ( right figure ) will have the opposite effect . <p> In the long run , since the supply curve is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Producer surplus will remain equal to zero , since there are no profits to be made . <p> Welfare analysis and government 's revenue : <p> Governments usually increase taxes to increase their revenue , which they use to relocate wealth and increase social welfare . The adjacent figure shows the effects of imposing a new tax on a good . P0 was the price before the tax was imposed , pD is the price consumers pay and pS the price producers receive . Consumer surplus is reduced by B and E , producer surplus decreases by C and F , while government increases its revenue from zero to B and C. Consumers and producers lose B+E+C+F and the tax revenue is B+C , which determines the deadweight loss , the reduction in total surplus : E+F . The deadweight loss depends on the elasticity of both the supply and demand curves : the higher the elasticity in absolute terms , the larger the deadweight loss . <p> Also , depending on the size of a tax , the tax revenue may be bigger or smaller . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadweight loss ( grey ) increases too. - <p> However , the tax revenue ( green ) will first increase , and then will start to shrink . This relationship is known as the Laffer curve , shown in the figure below ( being t the tax size and T the tax revenue ) . The Laffer curve might seem as an incredibly useful tool for government intervention . However , it has been widely criticized , mainly because empirical evidence to support it is rarely found , and because even if the relationship was accurate , it 's quite hard to know at which point of the curve a country actually is . <p> Taxing firms : <p> There are three main possible ways the government can impose taxes on firms : lump-sum tax , tax on profits and tax on output . <p> Lump-Sum Tax : <p> A certain amount of money has to be paid by the firm over a period of time . This kind of tax represents an increase in fixed costs and they consequently treat it as one . It holds the entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry barrier , and will force some inefficient firms out of the market . <p> Tax on Profits : <p> Firms have to pay the government a percentage of their profits . This kind of tax is also considered a fixed cost . Sometimes the application this tax will cause profits to be negative , thus forcing some firms to exit the market . <p> The effects on total quantity sold and the quantity produced by a given firm of both lump-sum taxes and taxes on profits can be analysed with the following figure : <p> Tax on Output ( or output tax ) : <p> In this case , firms pay a certain amount for each unit of output produced . As it has a direct relationship with the output level it is considered an increase in variable costs .

In such cases , government intervention will be praised both by consumers and those firms that seek for lower prices and a profitable share of the market . Regulations such as price setting , taxation or subsidies may be used in order to restore and maximise the initial efficiency of natural monopolies . <p> Nevertheless , the government must be cautious when setting and applying regulations , as an incorrect comprehension of the market structure may bring a higher cost to social welfare instead of the expected benefits .

The first one will show the marginal rate of transformation between good Y and good X. In other words , it shows the amount of X that the economy has to give up to obtain an additional unit of Y ( and vice versa ) .

Since the transformation curve is derived from an optimizing procedure ( as when analysing production optimization in a general equilibrium model ) , the amount of X ( or of Y ) given up is the minimum possible under the given technical knowledge . <p> It 's worth mentioning that , under competitive conditions , the economy will always be on the transformation curve , at a point where the marginal rate of transformation equals the relative price of the two commodities , pX/pY .

In the figure below , we can see the transformation curves of country A ( TCA , red ) and country B ( TCB , green ) . Note that we consider only one factor of production , and that the technology is fixed , which makes the transformation curves linear . The slope of these transformation curves correspond to the marginal rate of transformation , which in turn represent the comparative cost : tan + corresponds to the comparative cost of country A , while tan + corresponds to the comparative cost of country B. The terms of trade , which in this case have been arbitrarily determined , are given by tan + . <p> It 's worth mentioning that this graphical representation is the most common way to represent the Ricardian trade model .

This development did nothing if not speed up towards the end of the century , when different theories not only succeeded each other , but often coexisted , feeding off the breakthroughs that were being made by the different schools . In this way , the end of the century was curiously reminiscent of the first half , with a return to the two main schools and a whole new focus on maths . <p> We start by looking at New Classical Macroeconomics .

Welfare economics analyses these surpluses in order to determine whether a market structure is socially optimal . From a microeconomic point of view , we can differentiate between consumer and producer surplus , which jointly form what is known as total or economic surplus , also known as total welfare . Let 's analyse them separately . <p> Consumer surplus : <p> Consumer surplus is quite easy to understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to pay for a given quantity of goods , an how much they actually pay . In this case , the demand curve is given by the willingness to pay of consumers , how much they will pay for a good . <p> Let 's consider the market for books , and that we have three potential customers : Arthur , Bertil and Carl . Arthur is willing to pay less than $25 for a book , Bertil would pay less than $20 and Carl would pay less than $15 . If price is set at $25 , no one buys books . When the price drops to $20 , Arthur buys a book , and Arthur 's consumer surplus corresponds to area A. Note that this area equals $5 , being this the difference between how much he was willing to pay ( $25 ) and how much he actually pays ( $20 ) .

It must be noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arthur 's consumer surplus increased by A ' . Both B and A ' equal $5 . The same happens when Carl buys a book when price drops to $10 .

On the one hand , there is an increase on the consumer surplus of initial consumers , being this equal to area CS ' .

If the price is lower than $2 , no one will supply books since they 'll incur in losses . Now , if the price increases to $4 , David sells a book , since he 'll be able to make a profit from the sale . This profit corresponds to D , his producer surplus . If the price increases to $8 , Edward will also sell a book , having a producer surplus of E. In this case , David 's producer surplus will increase by $4 ( area D ' ) .

@@35829287 @4829287/ <h> Inflation <p> Inflation is the economic term that refers to a continuous general rise in the level of prices over a period of time . This will consequently be translated into a fall in the value of money and a loss in purchasing power . The main measures to calculate inflation are Consumer Price Indexesand the Gross National Product deflator . Oil prices can be an alternative inflation indicator as this product is used throughout the world for many different purposes and it virtually affects all of the elements of an economy 's price formation . It is important to understand that when inflation rates remain constant in a positive figure , e.g. 1% , over a period of time e.g. 10 years , and even if inflation didn-t change , purchasing power would ultimately be lost . <p> As an economic phenomenon , inflation can be the result of a different set of causes . The conventional distinctions made between these causes are : <p> Demand-pull inflation <p> Demand-pull inflation occurs as a result of an increase in aggregate demand and the inability of an economy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is formed by consumer spending , government spending , investment and net exports , and any increase in one of these components without its correlative effective response will create inflation . Demand-pull inflation is more likely to occur when employment of resources is closer to its full usage and the short run aggregate supply is most inelastic. - Therefore , inflation is mainly caused by the inability of the economy of attending an increase in demand . Increases in aggregate demand might be caused by : <p> -Expansive monetary policies : when monetary authorities conduct an expansion of money supply , there is more money available , consumption is incentivized and thus there is an increase in aggregate demand that creates inflation . If economic growth is below money growth there will be inflation. - Monetarists defend monetary policies as a way to efficiently control inflation rates counteracting economic growth . <p> -Increase in exports : exports may rise for two main reasons . The first one is the result of a country 's currency depreciation ; there will be an increase in exports , as these products will seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second one is caused by an increase of wealth in the foreign countries , which will allow them to import more of other countries products. - Both of these will result in an increase in the aggregate demand and consequently cause inflation . <p> -Consumers ' confidence increase : whenever consumers feel confident on the economic situation they will tend to decrease their level of savings and consume more and hence increase aggregate demand . <p> Cost-push inflation <p> Cost-push inflation occurs as a response of agents raising prices to maintain their profit margins if there are higher production costs . Production costs may increase because of : <p> -Rising labour costs : new government measures can imply an increase in the costs of hiring ( adjustment costs , see Cahuc 's adjustment costs model ) or increases in the payroll taxes . Trade unions can also force firms to increase workers ' wages by using negotiation powers , as explained by the Layard-Nichell NAIRU model . <p> -Rising raw materials costs : raw material costs rise can result from different causes .

Government regulations once more play an important part as subsides , policies and taxes can affect both raw material prices and the overall prices . Raw materials costs can also increase as a result of natural catastrophes . It is also important to remember the part that the price of oil plays in price formation , as the current world economy is highly dependent on it . <p> Built-in inflation <p> Built-in inflation , sometimes referred as wage price spiral or expectations-induced inflation ( explained by the expectations-augmented Phillips curve ) , is the consequence of agents previous years ' experience and their ability to build rational expectations .

This is why monetary policies should be held by an independent authority , which in most countries translates into a central bank .

The game is defined by exhibiting on each side of the matrix the different players ( here players 1 and 2 ) , each strategy or choice they can make ( here strategies A and B ) and sets of payoffs they will each receive for a given strategy ( p1A , p2A ; p1A , p2B ; p1B , p2A ; p1B , p2B ) . <p> The strategic form allows us to quickly analyse each possible outcome of a game .

If player 1 chooses strategy B and player 2 chooses strategy A , the set of payoffs would be p1B , p2A . <p> A well-known example of a simultaneous game described using the strategic form is the prisoner 's dilemma , where two prisoners need to decide whether they are willing to confess a crime or to lie about it . In this game , payoffs are negative values since they represent years of prison . If both prisoners confess , they will get 8 years each , if they both cooperate with each other and lie about the crime , they will get 1 year each . However , if one of them confesses while the other does n't , they will get very different sentences : the one who confessed will walk , while the other will make time ( 10 years ) . The elimination of dominated strategies shows us that confess-confess is a Nash equilibrium . <p> Although is not very common , sequential games can also be described using the strategic form . Considering the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or down ( U/D ) , while player 2 has to decide between going left or right ( L/R ) .

Since this is a sequential game , we must describe all possible outcomes depending on player 2 decisions , as seen in the game matrix . There is an perfect subgame Nash equilibrium ( green ) and a subgame imperfect Nash equilibrium ( red ) . <p> Our next and last definition is about the extensive form , another way of describing a game , mainly used for sequential games .

As opposed to one-shot games , repeated games introduce a new series of incentives : the possibility of cooperating means that we may decide to compromise in order to carry on receiving a payoff over time , knowing that if we do not uphold our end of the deal , our opponent may decide not to either . Our offer of cooperation or our threat to cease cooperation has to be credible in order for our opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether credibility is merited simply involves working out what weighs more : the payoff we stand to gain if we break our pact at any given moment and gain an exceptional , one off payoff , or continued cooperation with lower payoffs which may or may not add up to more over a given time . Therefore , each player must consider their opponent 's possible punishment strategies . <p> This means that the strategy space is greater than in any regular simultaneous or sequential game . Each player will determine their strategies or moves taking into account all previous moves up until that moment . Also , since each player will take into account this information , they will play the game based on the behaviour of the opponent , and therefore must consider also possible changes in the behaviour of the latter when making choices . <p> Repeated games provide different payoffs at each repetition , depending on each player 's moves . Since these payoffs are given at different points in time , in order to analyse repeated games , we must compare each player 's discounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetitions are calculated using the following formulae : - <p> Where : - -P : the discounted sum of payoffs ; <p> -t : the number of the repetition being considered ; <p> -n : the total number of repetitions for finite repeated games ; <p> -pt : the payoff at the repetition being considered ; <p> -r : the discount rate . <p> Repeated Prisoner 's dilemma : <p> In the game known as the Prisoner 's dilemma , the Nash equilibrium is Confess-Confess ( defect-defect ) .

Therefore , confess-confess is the Nash equilibrium for all rounds . <p> The situation with an infinite number of repetitions is different , since there will be no last round , a backwards induction reasoning does not work here .

For our threats or offers to be credible , this left hand side must be greater than the right hand side , which represents the one off payoff to be gained from deviating and breaking our cartel .

This move will allow that firm to sell more products than the other firms , which directly contradicts Cournot 's premise that each duopolist will produce the same quantity . Therefore , considering a Stackelberg duopoly might seem more realistic . This would obviously change the analysis and outcome of the game . <p> In this LP on game theory , we 've explored sequential games with successive nodes , looking again at discrete and continuous strategies by revisiting Cournot 's duopoly and then in the case of a market leader and follower , called Stackelberg duopolies . Finally , we looked at repeated games where we valued the option of collusion over a single payoff.

And also in general , results for the firms will be to be better off , while it will be just the opposite for consumers . However , the gain for the firm will not sum up the total loss for the consumers . This is known as the deadweight loss of monopoly that comes as a result of the Pareto inefficiency of monopolies. - From the equilibrium output of a monopoly to that of a perfectly competitive market , the consumers will be willing to pay more than marginal cost .

We must consider that the optimum production level of a firm is that in which marginal revenue ( price ) equals marginal cost , as long as it also covers its average variable costs .

It must be noted that the aggregate supply curve starts at X , and not before , because a lower quantity would get producers to incur in losses .

The new profits of each firm , C , is determined by both the new quantity produced and the drop in marginal and average costs .

Henderson , founder of the Boston Consulting Group . It refers to the effect that firms learn from doing , which means that the higher the cumulative volume of production ( X ) , the lower the direct cost per new unit produced ( C ) . Therefore , the experience curve will be convex and have a downward slope , as shown in the adjacent diagram . <p> There is a simple rationalisation behind all this : there is a reduction in the average cost of production of a particular product , as a consequence of an increase in the firm 's experience. - The time and cost of producing a unit of output will be reduced , as learning economies , economies of scale , economies of scope , etc. appear due to the cumulative output increase and other process related growth .

In other words , the rate at which direct costs decrease ( in percentage points ) when output increases ( also in percentage points ) . <p> Some important implications arise from this curve . If direct costs decrease as the cumulative output increases , this will mean that firms that have been producing more and for a longer period , will have lower direct costs per unit and thus dominate the market . <p> We must consider what happens when two firms compete with the same product and the same experience curve ( blue curve , EC ) .

Therefore , the longer A stays in the market , the lower the profits for B , as it is drawn in the diagram on the right , where the difference between direct costs ( from C'A to C'B ) is smaller .

Under these circumstances , even if firm A enters the market with higher direct costs than B ( CA &gt; CB ) , it will ultimately catch up with firm B. Actually , after a certain volume , firm A would get more experience and will have lower direct costs than firm- B ( C'A &lt; C'B ) , even with lower cumulative volume . <p> In the second scenario , shown in the next diagram , firm C enters firm Bs market with an exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's assume for the sake of simplicity that this innovative technology can not be copied or transferred ) .

After this point of inflection , firm C will produce each unit with lower direct costs than firm B ( C'C &lt; C'B ) . <p> These two scenarios are usually considered as good examples of the infant industry argument , since trade protectionismin these situations is welcomed .

The equilibrium price will be influenced by the number of firms in the market , decreasing as the number of firms increases . Let 's say we start at E1 , where the firm we consider has profits equal to area A. It is able to supply products from point X onwards , due to its minimum efficiency requirements . Since there are profits , other firms will be attracted and will enter the market .

First , this will shift market demand to D ' , increasing prices because supply ( for the moment ) is given . This increase in prices allows for profits to be made , at point 1 .

The supply curve in the long run will be totally elastic as a result of the flexibility derived from the factors of production and the free entry and exit of firms ( imagine the firm-entry process portrayed before a few more times ) . In the long run , market demand will only affect the number of firms but not to the quantity produced by each of these firms . Therefore we can assume that the equilibrium in the long run is the point where profits are maximised ( although each firm achieves zero economic profit ) , there are no firms entries nor exits and there is market clearance . <p> In this Learning Path we 've learned about perfect competition , specially how firms ' cost structures are determined by market supply and demand .

What differentiates natural monopolies is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are infinitely small . In these cases , if there is only one company in the market , prices for consumers may actually be lower than if there are rivals , because of the way average costs drop with additional users . <p> So what exactly is the difference between subadditivity and economies of scale ? Subadditivity is a more generic concept which encompasses economies of scale . We say subadditivity exists when : <p> - <p> That is , when the costs function ( including initial investment ) for the sum of all units at a given level of production is actually smaller than the sum of the various cost functions ( given multiple companies ) at the same given level . If we look at the diagram , we can see the traditional long run costs functions for two companies . We only consider economies of scale when additional units provide a lower average cost , but costs per unit begin to rise after a certain level . Subadditivity simply means that it is cheaper to produce the same production level when only company one is producing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company two joins the market . <p> - <p> This is why subadditivity is considered a necessary but insufficient conditionfor a natural monopoly to be considered optimal , whereas if economies of scale exist , this is a sufficient but not necessary condition for a natural monopoly to be sustainable . The cyan demand curve , within the economy of scale region , indicates a viable natural monopoly . The red line would indicate a non sustainable natural monopoly . The black line indicates the frontier of a profit generating monopoly ( which would attract competitors ) and the green line indicates a viable duopoly . <p> To sum up , in this LP on costs we have looked at analysing production levels and cost . We started off by looking back at how costs behave in the short run .

As we can see in the diagrams below , this gives us unlimited options . Depending on the scale we choose to implement , each level of production will be associated to new , short run cost curves . When we exhaust the infrastructure these provide us , we can upgrade to a new production level and so forth .

It is generally assumed that higher levels of production help drive down cost ( by reducing fixed costs per unit , by lowering the price of raw materials and intermediate goods through increased bargaining power ) .

If it is too rigid ( steeper ) , in order for the monopolist to achieve a higher price , it has only to reduce some of its production .

Therefore , Down-Right is the perfect subgame equilibrium ( green ) . <p> Now , let 's see what the Folk theorem used in game theory tells us .

In game theory , the analysis of sequential games is of great interest because they usually model reality better than simultaneous games : producers will usually observe demand before deciding how much output to produce , duopolists will observe each other 's decisions before dumping more goods in the market , etc. - For example , let 's examine the decision a company faces when trying to break a market which is currently a monopoly . Sequential games are represented through decision trees , with successive nodes at each decision point : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 choosing whether to compete in a monopolistic market or not . As there are no existing competitors in the market , should they choose not to enter , its payoff will be zero and the existing monopoly will have a payoff of two . However , if firm 1 chooses to enter we reach node two , where the second decision must be made by the challenged player ( the monopoly ) , whether to accommodate the new competitor or fight back to try and block its entry . In this particular example , if they choose to fight , both players will have a payoff of -1 , whereas if the monopoly decides to accommodate the new player , our monopoly becomes a duopoly and the resulting drop in prices creates larger market demand , meaning that the existing company will still receive a payoff of one and the new player a payoff of two . <p> So , what can we assume will happen ? We assume that both players dispose of complete and perfect information . They have both carried out a thorough market study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what they can do is work backwards to know what the competition will do . If firm 1 enters the market , player 2 has no reason to fight back , as its payoff will suffer by two points . This means that player 2 knows what the outcome will be if they choose to enter , so all they have to do is choose between a payoff of two if the new firm enters the market or zero if it does n't . In this case , it is pretty clear what the outcome will be . The game would change again , of course , if successive nodes were introduced , where fighting could again flip the tables . <p> Next , we 'll learn how to break sequential into subgames , which will help us analyse them and solve them using a backwards induction .

Rationality implies that people will act in ways that best suit their particular set of circumstances , including , but not limited to , the choices they face . In order to choose , you must necessarily have a set of preferences over the options you are presented with . Although utility theory was born in the 18th century , this approach , which simply implied consumers being able to rank preferences ( and not assign a numerical utility factor ' to each choice ) really took off at the beginning of the 20th century because it offered an empirical , logical structure to microeconomics . Frisch was a pioneer in this in the early 1920s , but the definite birth of consumer behaviour as an economic science is probably attributable to Samuelson in the 1940s . <p> These preferences must fulfil a set of criteria in order to fulfil the necessary requirement of being classed as rational ' ( in a purely economic sense of the word ) . <p> The first axiom is completeness . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one set of options over another , they must always be able to make that choice . That is , a consumer can always rank a set of possibilities as either better , worse , equal or at least as good/bad as another . <p> - or - or both at the same time <p> Transitivity . This simply means that consumers are able to order their preferences in a logical way- that is , if you prefer A to B and B to C , you must prefer A to C. It is useful to express this in binary logical form , with a set of symbols that represent : <p> A is preferred to B , <p> or B offers less utility than A , - <p> or A and B are indifferent , - <p> or A is at least as good as B , - <p> and therefore , to be transitive , if - and , then . <p> Continuity : in order for preference theory to be useful mathematically , we need to assume continuity . Continuity simply means that there are no jumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we prefer point A along a preference curve to point B , points very close to A will also be preferred to B. This allows- indifference curves- to be differentiated . <p> Sometimes , and for purely formal purposes , a fourth axiom , reflexiveness , is mentioned : <p> Which simply implies that A is at least as good as itself . <p> - <p> This is the basic set of premises , or axioms that Economics requires of individuals in order to be rational economic agents . It also enable us to represent preferences graphically . However , a later set of axioms was studied and added by Samuelson as preferable ' , because their functions will also behave preferably ' , i.e. , will be easier and more useful to work with : <p> Because people are inherently insatiable , and we always want more of what we like , we derive the premise of monotonicity : weak monotonicity implies that if A contains more than B , A is at least as good as B. On the other hand , strong monotonicity implies that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains more of at least one good , then A is- strictly- preferred to B. <p> Convexity : Further developing our taste for variety , we inherently prefer baskets of goods , or choices , which contain a wider range . This can be represented with an- indifference curve , which shows the rate at which we are willing to substitute units of A for B.- - - <p> As tends to happen with any axiom , there are plenty of examples of people violating them . A good example is when deciding what shade of blue to paint your living room . If presented with two shades , where one is very slightly lighter than the other , you will probably be indifferent to either if you can not tell the difference . However , when presented with a thousand shades , each progressively lighter , and asked to choose between the original shade ( midnight blue ) and the last shade ( azure ) , you will probably find you have a definite preference .

In this way , labour need not increase proportionally with production output , as it is the case for economies of scale . What we can also see here are skills being transferred from one production range to another , resulting in synergies that are unique to economies of scope instead of economies of scale . <p> In the adjacent figure we see the case of two multi-product firms .

However , for complementary goods the loss of demand will be amplified in the other market . To understand this second effect let 's think of petrol and cars . When price of petrol increases , demand for cars will be negatively affected as their overall cost will be increased . <p> Multiproduct monopolies can set prices to each of its products either jointly , or by division , each division setting the price for the product it sells . If the goods are substitutes , and each division sets the price , prices will be low , since each firm has an incentive to lower the price and steal some sales from other divisions , thus behaving as oligopolists .

Therefore , for both complementary and substitute goods the multiproduct monopoly should set its prices jointly . <p> To end this Learning Path , let 's learn about multiplant monopolies , and how different cost structures may define different behaviours .
