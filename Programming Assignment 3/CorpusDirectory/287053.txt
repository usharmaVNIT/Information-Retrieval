They chose Yale blue and , out of deference to the Harvard student , chose red for the other color . " <p> Both colors were employed almost equally until the 1970s , when , in absence of a mascot , school teams began to be referred to as Big Red . <h> Why a Rhino ? <p> How the rhino became Tafts mascot is a story of a popular movement , and it never would have happened were it not for two unusual circumstances . In the late 1980s , there was a Taft student who ended up with the nickname " Rhino " because of the way he ran while playing soccer . Headmaster Willy MacMullen 78 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student was funny , spirited and well loved . <p> Around the same time , student monitors did a poll to come up with a new mascot . Other private schools were choosing mascots then , and Tafties wanted one of their own . They were , as Willy says , " looking for the Big Red what ? " And though no one saw the poll as particularly serious , students took interest . <p> One of the many ideas , some almost too gruesome to name ( the Big Red Bloodworms , for instance ) , was the Big Red Rhino . After the student poll , the results were announced in an assembly and the winning mascot name would be chosen by applause . When the " Big Red Rhinos " was named the audience went wild with cheering , chanting and clapping . In fact , the students came up with the mascot name as somewhat of a joke . <p> " It was n't an instant hit , " Assistant Headmaster Rusty Davis points out . Some time after the student poll , rhinos began appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason it caught on , " says Davis , " was that no team is known as the Rhinos .

" It became the Taft Rhino not by some conscious design , " Willy added , " but by stories and rituals passed down . It became part of the cultural fabric of the school and took on a life of its own . " The rhino choice actually spoke of strength , power and humor , although its likely none of that was factored in when the students adopted it . <p> By 1990 , at the Centennial symposium in January , the rhino suit made its debut , a sign that it had been officially adopted .

I have spent a good amount of time drawing at Natural History museums around the world . Most recently , I have been thinking about motion , migration and the inherent patterns that animals follow ; also , predatory behaviors and how these parallel the human condition . The struggle for survival in our ever-changing environment is the foundation for these animal pieces . Ambiguity through blur and the use of multiple panels should evoke a feeling of fleeting motion and sound . <p> 3 . Data gatherers/topographies : Weather satellites , buoys , ocean surface analysis charts.I spent several years living aboard a wooden sailboat . My time at sea put me out into sometimes the harshest elements where I had only the sound of bell buoys and charts to navigate unknown waters . The more industrial paintings and drawings in this show relate to this period of time . They also connect to how data itself can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on abstractions of the smaller ink pieces . These could be seen as escape routes or somehow data referring to changes in weather patterns . These weather patterns effecting both land and animal alike . <p> Where forms are beginning to dissolve and be set into motion , the paintings approach a more visceral connection with time , atmosphere , environmental extremes in temperature and sound . I have always been consumed by the connections between science and art . Lately , I have adopted the character of chronicler or scientific recorder in the studio as I make the work . I am documenting the degradation of the planet , recording futuristic topographical data and the last fleeting glimpses of the beasts that inhabit the earth . <h> Gail Wynne <p> Born in New York City , Gail and her family moved to India when she was 11 , where she lived until she was 18 .

@@37597327 @6597327/ <h> History <p> Horace Dutton Taft got his start in 1890 as a schoolmaster when he was invited by a family friend , Mrs. Robert Black , to head a brand new college preparatory school for boys in Pelham Manor , New York . Until then Tafts experience as an educator had been limited to tutoring Latin at Yale , his alma mater . Here , presented with 17 students of " extraordinary variety for how few they were , " Horace Taft plunged headlong into the complete education of the boy , and indeed his own as a headmaster . Mrs. Black named the small institution " Mr. Tafts School . " <h> Pelham Manor <p> Often noted for his warmth , humanity , and sense of humor , Horace Taft described the first years at Pelham Manor : " It was a most comical beginning of a school . The furniture arrived at the same time the boys and their parents did , and I put both to work on the front porch opening boxes . Carpenters were at work upstairs , putting up the beds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entertaining parents and boys . Considering how few they were ( seventeen ) , there was an extraordinary variety among the boys . An undue proportion of them had been in other boarding schools and knew more about the inside of one than I did . " As he would for the rest of his career as a headmaster , Horace embraced the education of the whole boy , and in true boarding school fashion , got a dose of the same experience himself . In addition to managing the school , Mr. Taft taught Latin and mathematics , and lived the 24-hour job of dormitory master . <p> " Discipline was primitive and direct . I had a room in the middle of the house on the second floor , and I could reach almost any boy . I waked the boys up in the morning , pulling the blankets off when necessary . There ought to have been a Mark Twain there to describe that school .

In my stay at Pelham Manor I learned a great deal about a headmasters work , even if a large part of it consisted of learning how not to do it . " <p> At the end of his second year at Pelham Manor , Horace married Winifred Thompson , a teacher at New Haven High School . By then he had decided to find a location for his school farther from New York City . In 1893 the young couple moved the fledgling school to Watertown , Connecticut . <h> Why Watertown ? <p> The Tafts had been introduced to western Connecticut during visits to a friend in Litchfield . For a while they were determined to locate there , and seriously considered three possible sites . In the meantime , word of their search for a ready-made facility had gotten out . It ended in March 1893 when an acquaintance from Yale offered his familys hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wasting no time , Horace and " Winnie " spent a frigid day inspecting the 30-year-old Victorian ark called The Warren House . It was , in Tafts words , " a forsaken place , " cold and dirty . Despite " the chill of the visit " the young couple decided to lease the building and its six acres with an option to purchase the property in five years . The Tafts quickly realized that Watertown was more accessible to New Haven and Waterbury than Litchfield , and felt immediately welcomed by the community . Thus , with a $10,000 loan , they set about refurbishing the great old building . With the exception of the tremendous disparity between the room sizes , oft-mentioned parental fears about the " Firetrap , " and well water of dubious quality for drinking , the property seemed to the Tafts like " Paradise " after Pelham Manor , and served the fledgling school adequately for the next two decades . <p> The Warren House <h> The Taft School , Watertown <p> Mr. Tafts School opened in the fall of 1893 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen better days as a hotel .

Early on , Mr. Taft instituted the monitorial system as a way of teaching responsibility and introducing student self-governance . In 1898 he changed the name of the five-year-old enterprise to The Taft School . <p> In his early school catalogs , Taft touted Watertowns " clear , dry , and bracing air " and made clear his expectation that the boys would " take vigorous part in athletics . " The Warren House property included some very wet fields for the first football and baseball games played against the Gunnery , Hopkins Grammar and other area schools .

Taft with students <h> The Taft Family <p> Horace Tafts older brother , William Howard Taft , had been politically prominent as secretary of war under Theodore Roosevelt , but his career reached its pinnacle in his election as president in 1908 . Horace and Will enjoyed a close relationship , and the presidents two sons graduated from Taft . Thus the year 1909 opened with great excitement for the Taft family . Wills second son , Charles Phelps , was among the younger boys in the school when his father was elected president . Horace felt it only right that Charles should be allowed to attend his fathers inauguration . But how to how to justify to the rest of the school Charles absence ? Horaces solution was to rule that no boy could leave campus except to attend his fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that same euphoric year that his brother became President , Horace Taft suffered a tremendous personal blow : the death of his wife from cancer .

She had also developed close friendships and associations in Watertown , and become a literary and intellectual leader in her circle . Horace Taft described her death as " the kind of blow that divides a mans life in two . " <p> For years Horace and Winifred Taft together had envisioned a proper boarding school campus for their prospering enterprise , and planned to build it on their land on Nova Scotia Hill , some two miles distant .

" <p> The masters were almost all Ivy League graduates who pushed their students relentlessly in their quest for excellence and high College Board scores . Most graduates in Mr. Tafts time went on to Yale , and there many became class leaders and Phi Beta Kappa students . Although Taft academics were demanding , they were only part of the whole picture . According to a student at the time , while the classroom atmosphere was " rigorous and unyielding , there existed quite a close and warm relationship out of class between us boys and our masters . Perhaps that was due to the amazingly high ratio of one master for every ten boys .

Early on he began the long tradition of hosting small groups of boys for Sunday suppers in his living quarters . These evenings provided an informal setting for discussions of " any subject from European politics to the last unpopular rule adopted by the faculty . " <p> In 1936 , after 46 years as headmaster , Horace Dutton Taft retired . Since his inauspicious start at Pelham Manor he had come to be regarded as one of the most revered headmasters in New England .

Surely Mr. Taft appreciated the close parallels to his own career and was pleased with the appointment . In the summer of 1936 Paul and Edith Fitch Cruikshank and their four children moved in to the Headmasters quarters in Horace Dutton Taft Hall . <p> For his first year of retirement Horace Taft gracefully " exiled himself " to California . On his return to Watertown , Cruikshank invited Taft to take an active role in the life of the school . In addition to teaching his class in civil government , the former headmaster spoke weekly at Vespers and hosted Sunday suppers for seniors at his home . Cruikshank later wrote of Horace Taft : " Close as he was to the school and active as he was in its life , he never once offered me gratuitous advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headmaster known for his unrelenting emphasis on moral standards , respect for authority , and his famous insistence on gray flannels and wingtips over khakis and loafers , Cruikshank believed deeply in the ability of the upperclassman to " regulate " himself so as to find his own balance between work and play . New privileges were extended to seniors and upper middlers ( juniors ) even as life was highly regimented , with compulsory meals ( including breakfast , ) daily Vespers , and church on Sundays . <h> The War Years <p> The War years had a profound effect upon campus life . The departure of much of the schools staff for wartime work required that the boys take over responsibility for much of the daily care of the school .

In fact , so much work was done by the students in World War II that the schools tuition dropped from $1,450 to $1,250 . <p> Another wartime change was the accelerated graduation program , instituted in 1943 , in which rising seniors took a summer semester so that they could graduate from Taft in February . Cruikshank felt strongly that the boys finish their secondary education before entering the military . Many faculty members also left Taft temporarily to join the war effort . At Vespers the headmaster would read the names of alumni killed in the line of service ; in all there were 59 . <p> Cruikshanks great legacy was the expansion of the curriculum and the increase in academic standards at Taft . While student enrollment stayed fairly steady at 345 boys between 1930 and 1960 , the faculty grew by 50% , the course selection by 200% , and many AP courses were introduced .

After traveling the country on a fund-raising trip that summer , he returned to Watertown and mobilized over 3,000 hours of help from students and faculty to construct the first such facility in the independent-school world . After the structure was given a roof , the resulting quantum leap in practice time helped to ensure Tafts dominance in the prep school ice hockey league for more than a decade . <p> There were many other additions and improvements to the campus during the Cruikshank years , including the purchase of faculty houses , construction of an up-to-the-minute science center in 1960 , a language lab , the " New Gym " , and the interior rehabilitation of several of the main buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Lance Odden , fresh out of Princeton , who began offering a course in Far Eastern History .

She was appreciated particularly for her special efforts to study the photo and file of each new boy before he arrived on campus in the fall , so she would know every students name and something about their background . Her kindliness may have been most appreciated by the youngest members of the community , the eighth graders , who formed the junior class until the level was phased out in 1958 .

The early IS projects ranged from literary criticism and playwriting to an analysis of American foreign policy in Latin America and the construction of a harpsichord . The program brought a host of distinguished visiting speakers , professors and artists to campus , such as Robert Penn Warren and Archibald MacLeish . <p> Estys experiment in education included changes in daily school life for all students . <p> The Sunday schedule was loosened considerably , allowing boys to sleep in , and to attend the church of their choice in the afternoon .

In the classroom , smartphones and laptops can be a real distraction . Also , with the rise of the flipped classroom " parts of the instruction available online " it can mean students discount the face to face , community aspect of education . Social media has also been disruptive . Ideally , college is a time for reflection and experimentation . But in a few seconds an email , video , or tweet can go viral , pulling students and professors into the news cycle and politicizing the campus .

Photo credit : Robert Falcetti <p> The flame is mesmerizing . It is so bright that Claudia Black 's art students wear protective goggles . They gather around the table in the large , light-filled studio on the top floor of the Arts and Humanities Wing watching visiting glass artist Sally Prasch . Two industrial tanks stand at the corner , connected to the torch . Many of the students have worked with glass already , but only through fusing in the kiln . This is their first exposure to torch work . <p> Prasch holds a glass tube at the point of the flame , demonstrating where the flame is hotter or cooler . The glass turns red hot . She takes a rod of colored glass in her other hand and shows the students how color is applied , the greens and blues turning red in turn . With the color applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her mouth and they watch it expand . The trick , she tells them , is to keep it rotating so it inflates evenly . <p> She describes relieving strain in glass by firing it in a kiln . She talks about temperature , about the annealing point of the glass , and molecules needing to relax . At one point she asks for two volunteers . She heats a rod of glass and asks the two of them to hold it and walk away from each other quickly . As the rod becomes a thin strand in the middle , she explains how it can carry light , creating fiber-optic cables . The students make it wobble . <p> Prasch is unique in that her work is both artistic and technical . Trained as a scientific glassblower as well as an artist , she combines both in her work at Syracuse University , where she alters and repairs scientific glass equipment of all kinds according to a project 's unique demands , returning to her Massachusetts studio each weekend to work on her own creations . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because you really need to have both , " Prasch says . " They are very similar in mind-set . " <p> " Students get to see people who live with art every day . They can think about a life where they could walk into a studio and ask themselves , ' What am I going to do today ? ' instead of someone else telling them . " " art teacher Loueta Chickadaunce <p> A knowledge of chemistry and physics is essential when creating and sculpting glasswork , Prasch says . When creating glass from scratch , she adds a variety of minerals to alter the composition and color . <p> In her Morning Meeting presentation she gives students a virtual walk-through of the Corning Museum of Glass , covering its 3,500-year history of utilitarian and artistic uses before showing some of her own work . <p> " What I hope they take away from this , " says Black , who had previously studied with Prasch at Snow Farm ( a residential program for art instruction ) , " is the merging of disciplines , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It was amazing , " says Clyde Ramos ' 18 .

She 's probably the most competent artist I 've seen in a while . She was really good at helping us all with technique . Her open flame work was incredible . I loved the fact that it was so hands-on and that you could just totally change the shape by blowing in it . I was pretty nervous , but she was just totally in control the whole time .

" They 're enthusiastic about the places these artists have been around the world , where they 've studied . When they talk in the gallery , the artists have been very generous about how and why they make certain decisions when working on a piece , and that 's exactly what I 'm looking for when I invite an artist " those who can make great art , but also those who can talk about the process .

" He 's a teacher , and he responded so well to them . In a discussion where the ideas were just whirling around the room , he would take this idea and that one and tie them up in a neat bow , and you 'd ask yourself , ' How 'd he do that ? ' " <p> " From the artists and their work , I was inspired to try new techniques in both my artwork and in my daily life . " " Nicole Jarck ' 15 <p> For Nicole Jarck ' 15 , the visiting artists allowed her to experience a variety of artwork without leaving campus . " I really loved Mark Lewis 's work . I remember his Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , which led to the unique nature of each of his pieces , " she says . Each gallery show offered a new perspective and enriched my education in the visual arts . I was able to broaden my understanding of much more than the aesthetic qualities of artwork . From the artists and their work , I was inspired to try new techniques in both my artwork and in my daily life . In the serene setting of the Potter Gallery , I was afforded space and time to think more deeply , pause , and reflect on and organize my thoughts . " <p> Artist Dawn Clements spent part of her residency sketching an enormous mural of a girls ' dorm room while living there temporarily , and exhibited the drawings in the Potter Gallery . <p> " It was interesting to see how someone from outside of the school interprets the unique Taft life in a creative way , " says Jasmine Oh ' 11 , who was studying with Chickadaunce at the time .

In 2008 , Leuthold closed the gallery for four days in preparation for his display , covering the floor in thick watercolor paper and drawing on it in black and brown ink . He then filled the gallery with his wheel sculptures , made of a variety of materials , including bronze , porcelain , and glass . <p> " The Rockwell visit was great , " says Leuthold . " Papering the whole gallery floor was a lot of work . Dawn Clements , who later came as a visiting artist herself , helped , and it took us three long days .

It was the size of a single twin mattress . I still have it and have never had a chance to display it as a folded paper sculpture . It would be amazing . " <p> During that week , he also ran workshops in sculpture , ceramics , and studio art classes . " Some of the younger students were really shy and self-conscious , " says Leuthold , " and that brought me right back to my days as a student . Others were very confident and really enjoyed interacting with me . I was struck by how friendly and charming they were . <p> " It was also cathartic to come and give back in a positive and well-received way . As a professor , I was somewhat embarrassed because a group of my SUNY students visited the exhibition . Seeing Taft through their eyes made me all the more grateful for the privileges that my family and Taft gave me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , " says Arts Department Head Bruce Fifer . " They give students the opportunity to see what professionals are doing in so many various forms , from glass to photography to painting , and more than just hearing them and seeing them in assembly , they get to do workshops with them and see how it 's done . The program is a wonderful addition to our life here at Taft .

" " Witt Fetter ' 13 <p> The Rockwell Visiting Artists Program was an important component of my education at Taft , " writes Witt Fetter ' 13 . " It helped me further develop the skills of artistic observation and critique outside of the art studio .

" <p> " The students hear exactly what they 've been hearing in class all along , " says Chickadaunce , " but from a new mouth " a sort of confirmation . The most important thing is that they get to know that there really are people who make art and do n't have to starve in a garret somewhere to do it , and that it 's OK to let art be a guide . You ca n't have a good life without art . They get to see people who live with art every day . They can think about a life where they could walk into a studio and ask themselves , ' What am I going to do today ?

@@37597390 @6597390/ <p> Starting out as a sportswriter for the Vanderbilt University student newspaper , Neil Vigdor ' 95 did n't quite foresee his interviewing a presidential candidate for a newspaper franchise , or running around national and state political conventions and rallies in his post-college professional life as a political reporter . <p> Now , having hit his stride , Vigdor says he " enjoys the chase " of a controversial or quirky story . <p> The Bulletin asked him in September about his daily work during a heated political year from his front-row seat as the statewide political writer at Hearst Connecticut Media Group .

I tend not to harbor strong political views , so that definitely helps in my job . I call it as I see it , and I realize there are going to be things that I write that people are going to have a problem with , but I generally try to be straightforward with people in terms of what the angle of my story is and not blindside them .

Frequently we have comment threads on our Hearst Connecticut websites , and people will vent about stories on there .

There 's rarely a day when I say , ' What am I going to write about ? ' " <p> A : Ninety percent of the stories that I do are self-generated " the tips that come in to me , the things I think of . I try not to follow the pack . I try to think of things that are more quirky or offbeat . A couple of stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lake " Quassy " in Middlebury , there was a magician there doing a comedy routine , and he made an offhanded kind of quip about Donald Trump in front of children and their parents . One of Trump 's supporters actually went up to the stage and cursed the guy out when he was in the middle of the performance , and the amusement park people had to escort the guy off the property and ask him to leave . That 's something that somebody tipped me off on , and I said , that 's a great story , so I wrote about it . <p> Another one was before the Democratic primary in Connecticut in April . Someone tipped me off that John Podesta , the chairman of Hillary Clinton 's campaign , had to come here to meet with Connecticut union folks to try to placate them because they 're angry at Governor Malloy over layoffs of state employees , and union people did n't want to go out and knock on doors for Hillary . The Hillary people were really worried that was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that 's another kind of example of something that the Associated Press or other publications might not necessarily be chasing . <p> Q : What was it like to cover both the Democratic and Republican national conventions this summer and the New Hampshire primary earlier on ? <p> A : Speaking of the conventions , the anticipation was a much bigger deal than actually being there . You worry about worst-case scenarios " riots and tear gas , that sort of thing . Before going to Cleveland , I was debating whether to bring an escape-hood gas mask with me , actually . There were stories about reporters from major news outlets signing up for actual courses that cost $1,200 , $1,500 , from former Israeli commandos on what to do if you were kidnapped or involved in a terrorist attack . <p> I think that both cities and the state and federal law enforcement did a phenomenal job protecting not just the media , but the delegates and moving people along . <p> They were very memorable conventions , and very different . In Cleveland , Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lot of unorthodox choices for convention speakers . You also had the dynamic of Republicans sitting on their hands " a lot of the A-list Republicans were not in the speaking lineup in Cleveland . <p> For the Democrats , clearly Hollywood and the whole glitz and star power is a big part of the narrative , and the convention in Philadelphia had no shortage of the firepower in terms of the celebrities and all . Actually , I found the convention in Philadelphia to be much more topsyturvy , in terms of the protests by Bernie Sanders ' supporters leaving in the middle of some of the convention speeches and having sit-ins outside the arena . I think some of the things they predicted for Cleveland manifested in Philadelphia . <p> Both were huge logistical undertakings , with security and getting around and being able to stay at the hotels with the delegates from Connecticut . Same with New Hampshire " getting around in the snow and the black ice . New Hampshire is a really remarkable and unique place to get the kind of intimate interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them do their " retail politics . " The people up there take it very seriously in terms of vetting candidates in the first primary in the nation . <p> When I was up in New Hampshire , the hotel that I stayed at was the same hotel where Marco Rubio was staying . The first night that we got there , when it was snowing , his campaign bus was in a dark corner of the parking lot , and those campaign buses do n't strike me as having the best traction in snow , so I figured that he would be marooned at the hotel . The next day he was camped out in the lobby with his family and security and handlers , so that was kind of neat to see him in downtime . These people are constantly on , and to be able to see them with their families and not going through the talking points was refreshing . <p> Q : It sounds like it was also , especially at the national level with two conventions back to back , exhausting . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conventions . I did probably a dozen videos and 300-plus Tweets . I had to go through nine , ten different security checkpoints , Secret Service . You get to be really efficient in terms of getting your wallet and iPhone out of your pockets and going through that and turning on your laptop . <p> Actually , for the undertaking and the crowds and all that , it was much more efficient than the airport . They moved people through quickly . <p> Q : I know that you majored in communication studies and English at Vanderbilt University , but how did you get into political reporting versus other kinds of journalism after college ? <p> A : I worked on the student newspaper at Vanderbilt , which is one of the oldest student newspapers in the country and has a very storied history " a lot of great sportswriters went to Vanderbilt . I started out doing sports on the student newspaper , and was really lucky the summer between my junior and senior years to get an internship at Roll Call in Washington , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes at Georgetown , and my internship turned me on to politics on the Hill and the personalities . Certainly you have to understand policy to write about politics , but my interest has always been more on the personalities and profiling and the game of politics . But again , you have to know about the policies to understand that . <p> Q : What do you love about being a political reporter ? <p> A : I like the ability to influence people with your stories , and to have the most influential people in the state of Connecticut reading your stories , following you on Twitter . There 's really something to be said for that . <p> I enjoy the chase , and , sometimes , some of these quirky stories may cause a little bit of controversy . I like that . <p> Q : How has this election cycle been different locally ? <p> A : There was always this conventional wisdom that Connecticut would be an afterthought this year , as it was in 2012 , when Mitt Romney won the Republican nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls around , nobody really cares about Connecticut . <p> But this year , given the dynamics of 16 to 17 Republican candidates , an extended nominating race , Clinton and Sanders going for as long as they did , Connecticut suddenly became pretty strategic for the campaigns , so you had all of the candidates " with the exception of Ted Cruz " making appearances here , some of the them multiple appearances , for the primary . <p> You had Bernie Sanders on the Green in New Haven that drew 15,000 people the Sunday night before the primary ; you had Hillary Clinton go to Bridgeport , go to Hartford ; John Kasich was here , did multiple events in the state ; Donald Trump , three stops in the state " Waterbury , Bridgeport , and Hartford " so that was just an incredible opportunity for the people of Connecticut to get to experience this race in a way that they would n't ordinarily be able to . <p> It 's almost like they got a taste of New Hampshire or Iowa , and all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the toughest challenges in your work , not just this year ? <p> A : Challenges are sometimes about time management . You want to , of course , have consistent daily breaking-news stories , but some of the best journalism is done on some of these enterprise investigative pieces that typically run in our Sunday papers , so setting aside time to work on those things and balancing that out with the daily grind of getting breaking news , that 's one of the big challenges . <p> Also you have go to be able to focus in sometimes grueling working conditions , particularly when you go to these conventions , and you 've got a band playing , there 's music , it 's loud , you 've got balloons dropping , you 've got difficult deadlines . A big emphasis for our papers is to localize content , so for the Connecticut Post we want to have Bridgeport voices and stories , and Greenwich people for Greenwich Time , so chasing people around at these massive conventions and rallies and spotting them in the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his rally in August in Fairfield . It was a Saturday afternoon at Sacred Heart University , temperatures well over 100 degrees , no air conditioning inside the arena where they 're having this rally . The media have a kind of dedicated corral , some people like to call it the " petting zoo , " and we have our own dedicated Secret Service agent there for crowd-control purposes . It 's hot , you 're sweating , and you 're under intense pressure to get your story out for print . I have to think both in terms of print deadlines ; I can always make revisions for the online versions , so that 's a challenge . <p> You 've got people yelling and screaming " you 're not working in a library , let 's put it that way . <p> Q : When the presidential election is over , first of all you can breathe a little , but will you be doing more national coverage then , or does it just depend what hits the state ? <p> " I enjoy the chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cause a little bit of controversy . I like that . " <p> A : Certainly if Clinton wins the election , as the polls would seem to suggest , that could mean that you 'd have a lot of people from Connecticut , whether it 's Governor Malloy or Congressman Himes or Senator Blumenthal , who 's a Yale Law School classmate of Hillary Clinton 's , that could put them in position for a job in a Clinton administration , so there could be major stories to come out of that . And then it 's a whole kind of domino effect in terms of if they move on to greener pastures , although Vigdor laughs maybe that 's not the right characterization , but if they move on , that opens up other jobs , and you 've got people already waiting in the wings and eyeing things . So I do n't think that everything just ends after the election . Certainly there 's going to be a lot of musical chairs , I think .

Almost every day I walked past a black and white photograph of my grandfather taken in 1953 as he walked across the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on crutches after his last day on the floor of the U.S. Senate , where he had just transferred his duties as Senate Majority Leader .

" <p> Equally nuanced is Taft 's assessment of the signature piece of Wall Street reform legislation , the Dodd-Frank Act , which was named for then Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd , who was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee . <p> " Government intervention is a last resort , but it is a resort that should be used in extreme cases and was appropriately done so . " <p> " There is no question financial regulation was hopelessly out of date and ineffective . But the problem with Dodd-Frank is that there were a lot of unnecessary provisions and harmful provisions put in the bill because of the intense political environment in which it was drafted , " Taft says . " We 're now well into the punitive phase of regulatory overreach . The policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of swinging too far . " <p> In 2013 , Investment Advisor magazine recognized Taft as one of the 25 most influential people in the financial industry . He has also been a mainstay in recent years in the top 100 Thought Leaders in Trustworthy Business by Trust Across America , a business ethics group . <p> " I had always heard of his leadership in the corporate world , and he is one of the most principled , ethical , thoughtful leaders I know , " Headmaster Willy MacMullen ' 78 says .

U.S. Senator Al Franken , hardly a conservative . Not that Republicans have held up their end of the bargain , says Taft , who wrote a 2013 New York Times op-ed titled " Cry of the True Republican . " <p> If his great-grandfather and father were alive today , Taft says they would n't recognize what the GOP has become . His principles , he says , are closer to bedrocks of conservatism . <p> " Republicans used to be the responsible adults in the room , " Taft says . " We 're a long way from that today .

Taft says he already has a platform , whether it 's the books or opinion pieces he 's written or issue ads . <p> " Being civically engaged " that 's the kind of thing I seem to be able to do effectively and want to do , as opposed to running for office , " Taft says . <p> Taft does n't need an " R " after his name to show what he stands for .

Throw in a little a River Runs Through It , and that 's the vibe Juanita Vero ' 91 says her guests feel when they visit her family 's E Bar L Ranch , situated on 8,000 acres on the Blackfoot River , an hour east of Missoula , Montana . It 's a location that 's famed for its beauty , and it 's land that Vero is actively engaged in protecting for the future . <p> Vero grew up on the ranch , which was founded by her great-grandfather , O.W. Potter . Potter was an engineer and a surveyor who 'd been brought up in Chicago , where his family was in the steel business . After graduating from M.I.T. , he " wanted to figure out where he wanted to be . " So , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , he headed West , " Vero says . <p> " I was very lucky to be born into this , therefore I feel a great responsibility to foster , steward , and share all that we have here . " <p> Potter explored Montana as an engineer on the Northern Pacific Railroad before falling in love with the land along the Blackfoot River ( the " river " of the famed book and movie A River Runs Through It ) . <p> Potter began buying land in 1906 and , after marrying Gertrude Landsburg ( who married O.W. on a bet ) , decided to make the land a ranch and their permanent home . " It was a business marriage , " Vero says of her great-grandparents . " She could be a difficult person . " <p> When World War I broke out , the ranch lost all its farmhands , who joined up to fight the Kaiser . After the war ended , Potter 's old college buddies from M.I.T. would visit , seeking an experience that would help ease their transition home . Tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and O.W. decided to open the ranch to paying customers in the mid-1920s . These guests were usually New Englanders fascinated by the Wild West , which was becoming more accessible thanks to the construction of the railroads . The ranch 's first name " El Dor El " was derived from Vero 's great-grandfather 's three sisters , Eleanor , Dorothy , and Elizabeth , who helped fund the land purchases . The name was later changed to E Bar L. <p> Being kind to the land has always been a priority at E Bar L , Vero says . " For many years the logging that happened on the ranch was for building structures and getting firewood . We did n't get electricity here until the late 1950s , and did n't stop using ice from our ice pond and ice house until the mid-1960s . <p> " In the 1970s there was a pine beetle infestation , and my grandfather ( O.W.

" Our guests ride through this landscape , so he was also very particular about ' clean ' logging operations . He was much lighter on the land than traditional logging operations because most of the logging activity happened in the fall and winter , when the ground was frozen . Our guest season is from May until October , so there was n't time to log during those months . " <p> " My grandfather also had family members working for him " you do n't have to pay family members to do this more tedious , time-consuming form of logging the way you would proper employees , " Vero adds .

" It 's ponderosa pines , mountains , prairies " just a fantastic landscape . It 's great riding terrain . " <p> Riding through the sagebrush and the ponderosa pines , the mountains and the prairie , hearing nothing but the creak of the saddle and the cries of birds , is heaven for Vero . <p> The only livestock that the ranch supports are the horses that guests spend their days riding through the gorgeous countryside " the ranch has 97 horses .

The scandal lingered , as interracial marriages were still uncommon at that time . But along came Juanita and her brother , and now she runs the business with other members of her extended ranch family welcoming visitors for weeks or months each season . <p> Growing up in the remote area as she did was wonderful , Vero says , but because the ranch is so far from other communities , she " did n't get the social references " her peers learned from watching television and movies , she says . She graduated from Taft in 1991 and after graduating from Lewis and Clark College returned to the ranch . <p> " Taft should be , and no doubt is , very proud of Juanita .

Guests stay in rustic log cabins and take meals together in the large lodge with a huge stone fireplace . <p> " We 're open from the beginning of June to the end of September , " Vero says . " For a guest , it 's get up , eat breakfast at 7 , be at the corral by 8 , go out riding until noon , come back , and eat lunch . Then there 's skeet shooting or rifle shooting or float down the river in an inner tube for a couple of hours , followed by cocktails and dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we sit around the campfire . It 's like summer camp for the entire family . " <p> Apart from a Facebook page for the ranch , there 's very little in the way of advertising . Vero gets her business through word of mouth and from repeat clients , many of whom have come since they were children . <p> The challenges facing a family-owned and operated business that 's been passed through several generations can be tricky to navigate , Vero says . Her mother and father recently retired from the business , and a trust was set up to ensure that her grandfather 's wishes for the ranch would be honored . The ranch brings in young college students each summer to help with the day-to-day operations . <p> " It 's long days , " she says . " It 's fun , but you 're on all the time .

" <p> In 1975 , the earthen Mike Horse tailings dam failed , and 100,000 tons of toxic sludge went into the Blackfoot River .

An open-pit cyanide heap leach gold mine was also being considered for the headwaters on the Blackfoot near Lincoln , Montana .
