During the surgical procedure , hairs are placed individually and precisely by a skilled technician team along with your WESTMED physician . <p> What is Micro-Hair Transplant Surgery Like ? <p> Most hair transplant procedures are performed on an out-patient basis , using local or twilight anesthesia . Patients comfortably relax , watch DVDs , listen to music or nap during their procedure , which takes several hours to complete.Follicular-unit micrografting is a procedure during which literally thousands of follicles are redistributed into the thinning or balding areas . Each micrograft contains a single " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four ) hair follicles . Follicular-unit grafts are then carefully implanted into the bald of thinning " recipient " areas . Meticulous artistic and technical skill is required to design an appropriate hairline , as well as ensure the appropriate angle , orientation and position of each transplanted hair . Follicular-unit micrografting creates a result that defies detection and is never , ever " pluggy . " <p> Will a Hair Transplant Work for You ? <p> While patients with early thinning hair certainly see tremendous results , treating larger areas of hair loss also can provide worthwhile improvements . Our ideal patient will have dense hair in the back of the head can provide hairs for transplantation to the front of the scalp . Patients must also have a very realistic sense of what kind of results we can achieve . The results are typically a tremendous improvement that meet our patients ' expectations ; however , restoration of all hair is never possible . <p> After your WESTMED NeoGraft Hair Restoration Procedure <p> Most people do not have any significant discomfort after the NeoGraft procedure . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's take a few days to rest and recover . With NeoGraft follicular-unit hair extraction you can resume normal activities in just a few days , unlike the strip excision method which could take weeks . Crusting and scabbing of the transplanted areas last about a week . A portion of the back of the scalp is shaved , and he can take a few weeks to grow in . Patients with longer hair can usually hide this donor area nicely . Patients with a very short haircut usually have the donor area grow in by 2 weeks . <p> The transplanted hair falls out in about two weeks and generally begins to grow again in about three months . This means that the hair restoration occurs naturally and gradually . Many patients require more than one session of hair transplantation and most will require some replacement again in the future as they continue to age . For patients with more significant balding , they may require a procedure every 6-12 months for 2-3 procedures . Others may just require small touch-up treatments in the years to come if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The transplanted hair lives and grows indefinitely . The hair can be styled any way the person desires . Although hair transplantation is a substantial investment , the results are considered permanent and may be less expensive than other hair loss treatments when factored over a lifetime . The improvement in self-image and confidence is well worth the cost for most people . <p> To find out if you could be a candidate for the NeoGraft procedure or to learn more information about these procedures , please contact our office today by filling out the for on this page . <p> Reasons to Go with WESTMED for Your Hair Restoration Surgery <p> The hair loss surgeons at WESTMED are proud to offer NeoGraft , a minimally invasive hair restoration treatment that has been approved by the FDA .
