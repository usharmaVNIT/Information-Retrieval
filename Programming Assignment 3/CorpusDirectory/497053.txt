@@87887674 @3387674/ <h> With Alabama 's base defense featuring three linemen and four linebackers , we wanted to revisit what exactly the 3-4 is and what the primary responsibilities are among the front seven . <p> Nick Saban has long been recognized as one of the premier defensive minds in college football . Seemingly every season , he has had a defense that features mauling nose tackles , dominant outside linebackers , and elite defensive backs in coverage . His base defense is what is known as the 3-4 , with three down linemen and four linebackers . Traditionally , teams run a 4-3 scheme ( run through the logic here - that means four linemen and three ' backers ) . Ole Miss under Dave Wommack runs a 4-2-5 . <p> So what does that mean ? What should Ole Miss fans look for this weekend as their offense , which is currently second in the SEC West with 490 yards per game , takes on the Alabama Crimson Tide in Tuscaloosa ? <p> To restate the obvious , the 3-4 defense puts one fewer defensive lineman on the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the lineman removed from the equation is theoretically a defensive tackle , there could be a significant decrease in the size of the front seven . To combat this , and for other reasons which will be explained , the 3-4 defensive ends are very different than 4-3 ends . In the 3-4 , defensive ends are big , typically in the 280-300 range , or roughly the size of most 4-3 defensive tackles . They flank what is typically a gargantuan , space-eating nose tackle . The defensive ends are n't asked to pile up sacks and generally wo n't generate big stats . They eat up linemen to help the other players in the box make plays . The linebackers are also generally bigger with two being traditional middle ( or " mike " ) linebackers and the outside linebackers being rush linebackers . What you get is a system that can , ideally , move around a lot . As we 'll see from Saban 's defense , it is n't uncommon for a linebacker to move down to the line occasionally and give a 4-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . Because of the positioning of linebackers , it makes outside runs more difficult . With two linebackers on each side of the field in the base , there are more defensive players in position to pursue and tackle when the ball carrier tries to bounce outside . Also , the lack of an extra defensive lineman does n't really hurt in that situation since the runner is only affected by the defensive end having gotten too far away from where the extra 4-3 DT would be located anyway . <p> The defense can , however , be very susceptible to inside runs . With only three linemen to block , it 's theoretically possible for two linemen to get to the second level an help spring large gains up the middle . This is where the personnel become pivotal . The defense pretty much revolves around the nose tackle ( NT ) . He 's the biggest player on the field and lines up directly over the center . Assuming he is n't terrible , he will always be double-teamed . If he can manage to not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eats up at least two blockers . This allows for the two linebackers behind him to have only one blocker to deal with . Among the two of them , one generally takes the offensive lineman ( usually a guard ) while the other has a chance to make a play on the ball . Each linebacker has gap responsibility and must be disciplined enough to stop plays coming through their assigned gap . <p> Nick Saban has consistently recruited perfectly for this system . It all starts up front with NT Brandon Ivory , who is 6 ' 4 " 320 and able to eat up blockers without getting pushed back too much . Alabama 's defensive end play is strong as well , but the real strenght among the frong seven is the linebacking corps which features consensus All-American " will " CJ Mosley and " sam " Adroam Hubbard . The linebackers can move all over the place and blitz from anywhere . You 'll see plenty of 4-3 , traditional nickel , and traditional dime looks , but many of them all stem from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the line some . <p> They do n't do anything too drastically unique , but that 's because many 3-4 teams have begun doing things Nick Saban threw at the league when he entered . He 's a 3-4 technician and is known for devising incredible third down strategy to really throw off opposing offenses . The solution to combat this has been to play up-tempo , particularly between second and third down , making it difficult for Saban to get any new playcalls in . It works , but what happens when you face third and 15 and try to get the ball away quickly just to eliminate the edge Saban has on third downs ? Turnovers or just incompletions . Getting positive yardage on first and second downs is absolutely critical . <p> The 3-4 Versus the Read-Option <p> Via Ghost 's terrible MS Paint " skills " <p> Against a 4-3 defense , the read-option is pretty basic . Read the unblocked play-side end or outside linebacker . If he commits to the back , have the quarterback keep the ball and run directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end or ' backer commits to the quarterback , have the running back take the ball away from him and run with an additional blocker ( since you did n't block the play-side end ) . There are certainly ways to stop it , but it 's a simple read-and-react . <p> Running the read-option against the 3-4 is also simple in many ways . There are still reads that cause the offense to choose between two runs . The difference is in which player to read . You 're almost certainly not going to have your primary read be of the defensive end ( since you have fewer linemen to block anyway and there are two other players on that side to worry about ) . Instead , many offenses read one of the linebackers . Certainly , you would n't want to run straight at an outside linebacker who is positioned perfectly to stop outside runs . It 's common to read that linebacker and make your decision based on his read . <p> The problem with this is that the other linebacker has a chance to really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really know if he will " scrape , " a term used for when a player moves into the same space that had been occupied by the player making a read - shown above with a MLB " scraping " over to fill the gap left by the OLB who has committed to stopping the run . If he does , and if he recognizes the read-option he will , then you 're running directly where he 's moving . 4-3 defenses can do this as well , but it 's not quite as easy due to positioning and the opportunity the tackle ( who does n't block the end ) has to get to the second level and block the linebacker who would be capable of scraping . <p> Ole Miss and the 3-4 <p> The Rebels sometimes give 3-4 looks , but they could have made it their base defense had recruiting gone differently . Chris Jones and Robert Nkemdiche could both be exceptional 3-4 ends ( as would Isaac Gross actually ) . They 're big , strong , and quick . With those three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the ability to rotate in a third player . Actually , Ole Miss has the ends to do that now . The problem is that they do n't really have a nose tackle who fits the 3-4 mold . All the Rebels defensive tackles are smaller and not as capable of being double-teamed and still giving up no ground . <p> CJ Johnson could move back to OLB in the 3-4 , something he occasionally kind of does right now . As a 3-4 linebacker , it would n't be as big a certainty that he was rushing the passer , resulting in him going unblocked , or poorly blocked , more often . In fact , if Johnson makes it to the NFL , a rush backer in the 3-4 may be a better fit for him . <p> Conclusion <p> Ole Miss could struggle to find rushing yards against Alabama because of their size and system .

Will he make the bland , familiar hires that he used to stock his staff in 2012 ? Will he be aggressive in pursing a big money , proven commodity ?

He then moved to Nevada , where he orchestrated a jump from 78th in total defense to 48th in just two years . He then took Air Force from 78th to 10th in scoring defense and from 78th to 11th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 104th in scoring defense to 21st in one year . <p> Would Freeze roll the dice and try and bring him back to the SEC to revamp the Landsharks ? <h> Tony Gibson <h> West Virginia defensive coordinator <p> Speaking of rolling the dice , Gibson is another under-the-radar candidate . He 's been Dana Holgersen 's DC since 2013 and also coaches linebackers , which we all know is desperately needed in Oxford . He 's particularly intriguing because he comes from the pass-happy Big 12 . The SEC offensive landscape appears to be heading gradually in that direction . <p> In 2015 , Gibson 's 3-3-5 defense was second nationally in interceptions , fifth in turnovers gained , eighth in opponent three and outs , 11th in opponent third down defense and 15th in turnover margin . He had four defensive players drafted in the 2016 NFL Draft and helped guide middle linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski to a First Team All-American selection . <p> It would probably take a lucrative deal to pry Gibson out of Morgantown . <h> Mike Elko <h> Wake Forest defensive coordinator <p> Elko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ACC . He 's spent time as an assistant at Fordham , Richmond , Hofstra , Bowling Green and now Wake Forest . He is similar to Gibson in that he 's enjoyed success in a conference that runs a lot of spread concepts on offense . <p> Elko spent five seasons at Bowling Green and had some impressive units , including a 2012 bunch that finished sixth in the country in total defense and 10th in scoring . He showed up at Wake in 2014 and coached a group that finished 12th in pass defense and was a top 40 unit in total defense . And did I mention he coaches safeties ? Yeah , that unit that struggled mightily this season In Oxford . <h> Wesley McGriff <h> Auburn co-defensive coordinator and secondary coach <p> McGriff is another former Freeze staffer who is in the running for the gig . He coached defensive backs for Ole Miss in 2012 , helping Trae Elston become an SEC All-Freshman selection . He was even more impressive on the recruiting trail , playing an instrumental role in the signings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After leaving Ole Miss , McGriff spent time as an NFL defensive backs coach with the Saints . In 2009 with Miami , he coached All-America defensive back Brandon Harris and future NFL players Kenny Phillips and Sam Shields . He coached current San Diego Charger Casey Hayward at Vanderbilt in 2011 , a year the Commodores ' secondary snagged 12 interceptions . <p> The obvious drawback is that McGriff has never served as a defensive coordinator . Would Freeze roll the dice in order to bring in an ace recruiter ? <h> Charlie Strong <h> Former head coach at Texas <p> The recently fired Strong is a long shot , but Freeze has to at least make the call . It would be an absolute homerun of a hire . The man knows defense and everyone knows he knows defense . He 's an absolute monster on the recruiting trail and kids want to play for him . It might serve Charlie well to take a break from head coaching and coordinate again for a few years in order to build his rep back up . <p> Question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Before he was struggling to win games in the Big 12 , Strong was destroying the SEC with his defenses at Florida . In 2006 , the Gators were sixth in both total defense and scoring defense and won the national title . His ninth-ranked defense in 2008 led the Gators to another national title . <p> After leaving Florida , Strong became the head coach at Louisville , where he immediately jumped the Cardinals from 65th to 14th in total defense . His 2013 team went 12-1 record and led the nation in total defense and " this should be intriguing for Rebel fans " rush defense . <h> Gene Chizik <h> North Carolina defensive coordinator <p> Chizik is a household name with a hell of resume and has been at the controls for several top flight defenses throughout his career , including Auburn , Central Florida , North Carolina and Texas . <p> His rise started in Orlando as a defensive coordinator at UCF , where he was often a visitor at Tampa Bay Bucs practices and learned a ton from Tony Dungy , Monte Kiffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knights from 81st to 16th in total defense in 2001 and eventually make the move to Texas , where he oversaw a defense that helped win the 2005 national title . After taking the head job at Auburn , his 2010 championship defense was first in scoring defense and fifth in total defense . <p> After tasting the success as a head coach and spending the last year as second in command at UNC , however , its doubtful that Chizik would be interested in a lateral move back to the SEC . Head coach Larry Fedora 's name has been floating around during this year 's coaching carousel and many think that Chizik could be the heir apparent in Chapel Hill . <h> Tosh Lupoi <h> Alabama co-defensive coordinator and outside linebackers coach <p> It 's no secret that Alabama 's linebackers are very good , so bringing in someone who has been hands on with that position is not the worst idea . Last year 's team recorded more sacks than any other Crimson Tide team in the Nick Saban era , and Lupoi 's outside linebackers notched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim Williams . <p> The main reason Lupoi 's name has popped up on the list , however , is his recruiting chops .

He also coached NFL first-round picks Cameron Jordan and Tyson Alualu . <p> The biggest hurdle for Freeze and Ole Miss to overcome is Saban and Bama .

@@87887790 @3387790/ <h> A sweep at the hands of Mississippi State underscored the disparity between the Rebels ' arms and bats . <p> The third day of an SEC baseball series usually comes with decreased pitching depth and increased run totals . On Saturday against Mississippi State , though , Ole Miss leaned on two of the country 's top freshman arms to hold one of the best offenses in the conference to just two runs . <p> And they lost . <p> That 's because Ole Miss ' moribund lineup mustered just four hits and one run in the third game against a depth-starved State pitching staff that 's missing seven arms due to injury and holds the second to last ERA in the conference . The Rebels put just three men on base through the first eight innings and wasted a bases-loaded , one-out opportunity in the bottom of the ninth , handing the Bulldogs their first sweep in the series since 2003 . <p> Saturday 's loss underscores the theme of the Rebels ' 2017 season : they can pitch the hell out of the ball , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored two or fewer runs in 12 of their last 20 games , but have limited opponents to two or fewer runs nine times during that same stretch .

And after some shuffling in the Sunday spot , freshman Ryan Rolison 's impressive outing in Game 3 against the Bulldogs suggests Mike Bianco has found a dependable third starter . <p> The bullpen has n't been dominant , but it 's as deep as any in the conference . The decline of closer Will Stokes , who 's disappointing season hit a new low during State 's three-run , eighth-inning rally last Thursday , has been offset by the rise of Dallas Woolfolk , who totes a 0.92 ERA and has the second-most saves in the conference .

Do midweek games really matter when it comes to NCAA seeding ? <p> For those that follow college baseball , you know that midweek games can get a little weird . The Rebels have had their fair share of odd moments on weekdays , but does it really matter in the grand scheme of things ? After conducting some brief research , wins and losses do n't seem to have much of an effect on the resume . <p> Starting in 2010 , the Rebels were 12-2 in the midweek , 39-24 overall and were ultimately a No. 2 seed in the Virginia regional . The next year , they were 7-5 and 30-25 and missed the postseason . In 2012 , Ole Miss was 11-4 , 37-26 and a three-seed in the Texas A&amp;M regional . The next season , the Rebels went just 9-5 on weekdays and made it in as a No. 2 again in the N.C. State regional . To most people 's surprise , the Rebs ' 2014 record in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional on their way to Omaha . In the last two seasons , Ole Miss went 8-6 and 12-3 respectively and was a two and a one in their regional . <p> So after seeing these numbers , the first thing you think of is that the record is n't exactly a perfect metric to measure NCAA Tournament seeding success . I think it has more to do with the non-conference RPI numbers and how big a bomb it is when you lose in the midweek to the likes of Memphis , UALR and Tulane . The 2014 squad lost a few goofy match ups on Tuesdays , but ended taking care of business elsewhere and hosting a regional . And then there 's the curious case of the 2010 team who only lost two games , yet struggled in conference and was a two . Alas , the debate rages on . <h> 2 . Can the veteran bats turn it around in time for a run ? <p> Rebel Grove 's Chase Parham wrote a piece earlier this week about how the experienced bats are going through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golsan and Ryan Olenek have had their ups and ( mostly ) downs in 2017 and the Rebs are really struggling because of it . The freshmen have had their bright spots , but you really need the upperclassmen to set the table and clear it most of the time . <p> After sweeping the two opening series , the Rebel bats fell into a black hole and where nowhere to be found for some time . Blackman had an all-conference type year in 2016 ( .322 , 13 2B , 38 RBI ) but has been hit or miss this season . Bortles hit .269 last season and smashed 8 HR and drove in 50 runs . Golsan was extremely consistent in his first two seasons but seems to be struggling this season due to pressing and trying to get the big hit to spark the offense . And finally , Olenek hit .265 as a freshman and was a pleasant surprise that was a nuisance for opposing pitchers . <p> Turn the page to 2017 and the upperclassmen have combined for a .274 average through 29 games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The four Rebels have seemed to really adjust their approach and are being much more selective in plus counts and putting together much more quality at-bats . The key for Mike Clement 's lineup moving forward is for this trend to continue and for the underclassmen to chip in here and there when they can in advantageous situations . If this happens , paired with the elite arms Carl Lafferty has at his disposal , Ole Miss could improve its offense and potentially get in position to win meaningful games down the stretch .

Cam Akers ' decision to spurn his home-state team and commit to Florida State is a huge blow to an Ole Miss program desperate for positive momentum . Akers is a generational talent , one who just polished off a senior season in which he accumulated 3,128 yards passing , 2,105 yards on the ground , and 65 total touchdowns in just 15 games . Couple that with Ole Miss ' longstanding lack of a game-breaking back , as well as a disappointing recruiting class that currently ranks 48th in the nation , and missing on Akers seems downright tragic . And yet , despairing Ole Miss fans should perhaps take a step back from the ledge . Even without Cam Akers , the 2017 Ole Miss offense is brimming with young talent and potential . <p> Shea Patterson committed early ( in February of 2015 ) and remained steadfast in his commitment all the way to signing day , so his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cam Akers ' . However , Patterson 's signing was perhaps the greatest recruiting feat in Ole Miss football history . Despite unexpectedly being thrust into the starting role after Chad Kelly 's injury , the former No. 1 quarterback recruit flashed his potential in several admirable late-season performances . Remember this ? <p> Patterson struggled in losses against Vandy and State , too often bailing on plays to lean on his mobility . But he continued to showcase his physical ability throughout , and an offseason spent watching tape and taking No. 1 snaps should lead to major progress in 2017 . <p> And let 's not forget that Patterson will have a whole damn arsenal of targets to throw to next season in Phil Longo 's Air Raid offense . Sure , Longo 's system may be a bit more run-heavy than the typical Air Raid attack , but let 's be honest , the Rebels are going to air it out next year . Wide receivers like Van Jefferson , A.J. Brown , D.K. Metcalf , and Demarkus Lodge " all former four-stars " provide a ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even more enticingly , each fulfills a different role in the passing attack . Whether it be Jefferson 's route-running , Brown 's physicality , or Metcalf 's jump-ball ability , the Rebels will employ a whole host of talents that should give opposing secondaries nightmares . <p> It does n't hurt matters that the majority of the Ole Miss offensive line remains intact , anchored by returning starters Rod Taylor , Sean Rawlings , Javon Patterson , and Jordan Sims . And do n't forget Greg Little , the top offensive tackle prospect in the 2016 . If that group is able to take a step forward in 2017 , Patterson should have plenty of time to pick apart opposing defenses . <p> And while Akers would have played an immediate role in the backfield , the Rebels ' running back corps could be pleasantly productive even without him . An ACL tear and academic ineligibility robbed the Rebels of their running back depth in 2016 , but Jordan Wilkins and Eric Swinney are both set to return in 2017 . When given the opportunity , freshman D'Vaughn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing time . <p> Of course , it would be dishonest to pretend that Akers ' commitment to Florida State does n't hurt .

It 's another blow in what has been a painful end to 2016 , a year that began with a Sugar Bowl victory and a top-10 recruiting class . But do n't give up yet , Rebel fans .

Also included is the average Offensive S&amp;P+ rank for those teams , along with Ole Miss 's over the past two years . <p> Stat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly <p> Stat <p> 6th &amp; 7th Round QBs , 2013-17 <p> Chad Kelly <p> Completion % <p> 62% <p> 64% <p> Yds per game <p> 233.69 <p> 309.09 <p> Yds per throw <p> 7.55 <p> 8.65 <p> TD per game <p> 1.54 <p> 2.27 <p> Int rate <p> 2.64% <p> 2.67% <p> Passer rating <p> 136 <p> 152.32 <p> Offense Rank <p> 51 <p> 11 <p> To the surprise of few to none , Kelly led in every statistical category but interception rate , even demonstrating higher per-throw efficiency despite throwing over 100 times more than the rest of the group . Perhaps most remarkable is that with just spring and fall practice of preparation , he elevated an offense that had ranked 43rd in S&amp;P+ and was dysfunctional by season 's end to a top-10 unit in 2015 and the second-best offense in Passing S&amp;P+ . <p> In a vacuum , the concerns surrounding Kelly 's prospects as an NFL quarterback were fair , but given the already uninspiring class of passers this draft cycle , it 's surprising no one jumped on him earlier . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other prospects did n't capture a complete picture , especially given his workload in comparison to the rest of the group . Josh Dobbs , for example , had a higher interception rate and the second most fumbles ( 10 ) in the nation last season , yet that shaky side of his game was hardly mentioned leading up to the draft by pundits . <p> While Kelly 's personal past certainly matters when considering making an investment in him , enough evidence exists to conclude that teams care about players ' character when it 's convenient . Seemingly nothing had changed in between the NFL inviting and uninviting him to the combine , so it became even more difficult than usual to take the league 's contrived moral high ground seriously . <p> What resulted after teams scanned the uncertainties involved in selecting Kelly was a shifted preference for quarterbacks that were perceived as safer picks . That makes sense , but even the process of assessing risk in players seemed off . Most indicative of that flawed exercise in thought was when the 49ers selected C.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice guy , ranked three spots behind Kelly on PFF 's QB rankings and was the football equivalent of unflavored oatmeal in college , stats-wise . <p> Valuing abstract traits like character over a substantive body of work brings on its own set of risks , and we saw that limited scope in action when looking at the final quarterback draft order . Kelly 's streaks of brilliance at Ole Miss did n't mean that scouts ' reservations were n't valid , and his past production should by no means be blindly interpreted as a guarantee of success at the next level . Given the history of busts at his position , the odds are stacked pretty high against him .

A fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Chad Kelly provided temporary optimism , but FSU walked away with a 45-34 victory . <h> A dream first half <p> For about 29 minutes , just about everything went right for the Rebels .

@@87887919 @3387919/ <h> Did the Ole Miss Football Recruiting Class Fill Needs ? <h> Ole Miss entered the offseason with some major needs . Were those needs filled ? <p> Yesterday , Ole Miss signed a pretty good class ranking between 15 and 19 nationally depending on your ' crootin website of choice . There were some strong victories and misses this recruiting cycle , but in determining whether the class was a real success , I think it 's important to look at how the group will fit with what 's on campus . <p> Obviously , things will change before August . Some players will change positions . Others will likely leave the program . Some recruits will be better than expected , and others will be worse . This is simply a glimpse of what to expect based on evaluations made by those who are paid to do so . I will not attempt to discuss every signee here . I will simply talk about particular needs the Rebels had and how they filled them or missed in filling them . <p> OFFENSIVE LINE <p> Ole Miss ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . The Rebels lost six scholarship linemen to graduation , with three of those being starters and one more being a major , major contributor ( Emmanuel McCray ) . What was already a weakness for the Rebels could have become a dire situation without an influx of talent at the situation . Luckily , the Rebels got that . <p> In December , the Rebels signed a likely starter at their right tackle spot in Fahn Cooper , the junior college tackle . Cooper spent his first year of college as a starting left tackle for Bowling Green . After starting twelve games for the 8-4 team , he decided to transfer to a junior college in order to increase his chances at ending up with a higher profile team . It worked , as he was pursued by a number of BCS schools before ultimately choosing the Rebels . Cooper is likely to heavily compete to start as soon as he arrives on campus in May . <p> Ole Miss also needed to find a guard who could compete for a starting job or at least contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , Rod Taylor , in an effort to get that done . Taylor is big and strong and may find the field very early . He will likely compete with both Aaron Morris and Justin Bell for a starting job , though I do n't ultimately expect him to win one ( unless Bell ends up sliding over to center ) . There are other guards vying for those jobs as well , particularly Daronte Bouldin , who the coaches are excited about , and Austin Golson , who I 'd like to see move out to tackle . <p> The Rebels signed a couple of other offensive line prospects as well , but those two were the most important signees . <p> DEFENSIVE LINE <p> The defensive line last season simply could n't get much pressure , with or without CJ Johnson . After eventually moving Robert Nkemdiche to defensive tackle , things started to take shape , but there still was an absence of size and pass rushers . The Rebels had a lot of work to do to overhaul a unit that had plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added two highly pursued tweener players who appear destined for defensive tackle . Breeland Speaks and Garrald McDowell are both four star players who had offers from many of SEC schools . Either can play defensive end , but both look like they 'll be solid defensive tackle options once they gain a little bit of weight . The Rebels were obviously hoping to improve athleticism inside , and they likely did with these two . <p> The defensive tackle need they did n't fill was that of a big guy who eats up blockers . The Rebels simply do n't have someone on roster who fits the more traditional defensive tackle role . They were in on Michael Sawyers late but ultimately lost the four-star tackle to Tennessee on signing day . It was n't essential that the Rebels find someone who fits this mold , but it would have helped a great deal moving forward . <p> As for pass rushing defensive ends , Ole Miss found two who should excite Rebel fans . Victor Evans and Marquis Haynes turned down Texas and Clemson respectively to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenal " by Hugh Freeze yesterday . Evans is still finishing high school classes in Texas but should also bring some speed and athleticism that was lacking outside . Both players probably need to gain weight before being anything more than role players , but that 's not a very hard thing to do for many people transitioning from high school to college . <p> BIG BACK <p> It became obvious last year that the Rebels could n't reliably pick up tough yards on the ground when they really needed them . They had good backs in Jaylen Walton and IItavius Mathers , but neither player was a bruiser who excelled in short yardage . Some of that was , of course , the fault of the interior offensive line . The biggest back on roster , Jordan Wilkins , was redshirted and looks to play a contributory role next season . The coaching staff obviously thought finding a big back with experience was necessary . <p> They got an early commitment from Akeem Judd , the number one running back in junior college . Judd did n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auburn signee Javon Robinson dominate . Ole Miss fans started doubting his ability , but the coaching staff held firm . They signed him , and juco players are n't regularly signed to sit on the bench . I ca n't say either way whether Judd is good . His film looks pretty good , but there 's just no way to know . <p> The Rebels also pursued Alabama commit Bo Scarbrough all year , but that ultimately was n't fruitful . Scarbrough was a top 50 player in the class and would have potentially changed the dynamic of the offense , but the Rebels could n't get the Tuscaloose native away from Alabama . It just was n't happening . <p> WIDE RECEIVER <p> With Donte Moncrief , Ja-Mes Logan , and Jordan Holder all leaving the team for various reasons , Hugh Freeze had to find some replacements at the receiver position . The results were mixed . <p> The Rebels did manage to sign Markell Pack , the best receiver in the state of Mississippi . Pack had been committed to Florida State but changed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something Freeze pursues , and could step into a helpful role early . The Rebels are n't in a terrible sitaution at the position , so they likely do n't need an immediate starter . Pack will grow into the position and should flourish later in his career . <p> Dayall Harris is also a big receiver , but he was more lightly recruited than Pack . Harris simply did n't have the same type of high school career , playing for a team that was mostly based on the running game . It will likely take him some time to adjust to the college game . <p> The Rebels missed on the other big-time receiver prospect they pursued in Isaiah McKenzie . McKenzie was a consensus four-star player . The smaller receiver likely would have immediately contributed in the return game and played a role at receiver the Rebels do n't currently have : the shifty player who gets yardage underneath . The Rebels had McKenzie until he got an offer from UGA two days before signing day , having never been to Athens , and signed with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't quite as pressing as the other four major needs , in that the position is pretty settled for next year . However , it would have been nice to sign several linebackers since Ole Miss will be losing a lot of players at the position soon . <p> The sole linebacker signee in the class is Demarquis Gates , a Georgia product who is rated either a three or four star , again depending on your website of choice . Gates is a good signee who will likely succeed at Ole Miss . The problem is that he 's the only one . <p> The Rebels missed on both Nyles Morgan and Clifton Garrett , four and five-star linebackers who each named the Rebels their leaders at one point . Long-time commitment Alfred Dickens also did n't ultimately sign with the Rebels since the coaching staff was n't sure the Olive Branch prospect would ever be able to play football again after a very severe neck injury . The position grouping essentially fell apart this year . This is n't a disaster , since the Rebels can remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes that imperative . <p> OVERALL <p> The coaching staff filled most of their needs with this class and certainly accomplished their most pressing goals . The class is a strong one , albeit not what many fans had hoped . If the Rebels are able to retain their more talented signees though , unlike Houston Nutt 's staffs did , classes like this could help them get to teams that are consistently big , strong , and fast . You can win with players like that .

@@87887935 @3387935/ <h> The Mississippi IHL Wo n't Renew Dan Jones as the Ole Miss Chancellor . What does this Mean ? <h> If you 're worried about the future of Ole Miss , you 're not alone . <p> Last Friday afternoon , the Board of Trustees of the Mississippi Institutes of Higher Learning - better known as the much-maligned " IHL " - announced that the contract of Dr. Dan Jones , MD , Chancellor of the University of Mississippi , would not be renewed . Yesterday , the IHL explained their decision as one having almost exclusively to do with the financial situation of the University of Mississippi Medical Center , a situation that is n't generally agreed upon as being a bad one . <p> This decision is particularly tough to accept when considering the inarguable facts that Ole Miss , on the whole , is bigger , richer , and smarter than it has ever been , and that Dr. Jones is just over one week removed from his first day back on the job after finishing up chemotherapy treatments . When looking at his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really is difficult to craft a cogent argument as to why Dan Jones deserved this , especially if the argument you wish to make is that Dan Jones ' leadership was overall bad for Ole Miss and , by extension , bad for the state of Mississippi . <p> Surely , none of this is news to you by now , but perhaps you have some questions . Let me see if I can answer them . <h> So why is this so bothersome ? <p> The unclear ( and , frankly , non-urgent ) reasoning and timing of the whole thing aside , Chancellor Jones ' firing reeks of a pretty blatant power grab by the IHL . A common criticism of the IHL 's decision is that it makes clear that they are more interested in having a " yes man/woman " in the Lyceum than someone like Dan Jones . It 's important to remember that the budget for UMMC represents roughly 40% of higher education expenditures in Mississippi ; it 's not inconceivable to think that the IHL was not comfortable with the Chancellor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office in Oxford , even if if that is something that was both within the purview of Dan Jones ' job description and something for which he , of all people , is uniquely qualified . <p> It is also bothersome that Ole Miss or a body made up of primarily " Ole Miss people " does not have this much say over the leadership of the University of Mississippi . The IHL , unlike other Boards of Trustees or Regents in public higher education , governs all of the public universities in Mississippi , and not just individual campuses or systems . This one board oversees Ole Miss , Mississippi State , Southern Miss , Jackson State , Alcorn State , Mississippi Valley State , Delta State , and the Mississippi University for Women . The IHL has been fairly commonly criticized by Ole Miss administrators and alumni as being a hindrance to the development of the university , a criticism that 's pretty difficult to refute given the events of the past few days . <h> So does this mean they 're going to get that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing out any other way . The IHL has made it pretty clear that they 're willing to can the Chancellor of Ole Miss - and conceivably any leader in higher ed in Mississippi - if they 're not willing to play by whatever rules the IHL sets forth . You could argue that that 's their job ( because it is ) , but it 's common practice to give university leaders a good deal of autonomy . This decision makes it clear that Dan Jones ' brand of autonomy was too much for the IHL to accept , and anyone who would consider the job has to be smart enough to know that . <h> Well what can we do about it ? <p> The short answer is " nothing . " <p> The long answer is a bit more interesting . Outside of Governor Phil Bryant intervening in the IHL 's decision ( he wo n't ) , the decision the board has made is binding . Simply put , Dr. Dan Jones will no longer be an employee of the State of Mississippi come September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on board ? I guess it 's conceivable , but I would n't bet on it . Could Ole Miss raise capital to go fully private , as has been proposed by leaders at the University of Oregon . Again , it 's conceivable , but not likely . <p> And , if Ole Miss were to thumb its nose at the IHL and just continue to operate as if no decision had been made altogether , that would create a bit of a legal crisis - a Mexican standoff , even - where we 'd probably find ourselves with the answer as to whether or not Ole Miss is too big to fail . <p> So , again , nothing . <h> What does this mean for athletics ? <p> Just as with the university at large , the Ole Miss athletics programs are in remarkably good shape , with postseason appearances , top-25 rankings , all-Americans and facility upgrades having become the norm in Oxford over the past few seasons . A lot of this can be attributed to Dan Jones and Robert Khayat 's successes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more-than-exemplary leadership since he arrived in Oxford in 2012 . <p> Bjork has been a vocal supporter of Dan Jones , and we have to think that this transition has him fairly worried .

I think we can all be very confident that no new chancellor is going to can or attempt to shake things up with Ross Bjork , but will he or she be able to lead the athletic side of the house when it is necessary to do so and get the hell out of Bjork 's way when it is n't ? <p> From all accounts , Jones does n't feel the need to micromanage the goings on in the Manning Center , which Ross Bjork and the Ole Miss coaches all greatly appreciate . If that changes , will Ole Miss hold on to Ross Bjork much longer ? Then would that replacement be able to sustain the success that Bjork has put into motion ?

And yet , Ole Miss is 19th best in the nation in converting short-yardage situations ( 83.3 percent ) . That 's directly attributable to Liggins , who simply does n't need his O-line to clear lanes for him -- he clears his own . <p> As successful -- and entertaining -- as Liggins has been running behind center , he 's been able to make an impact without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an example from the Vanderbilt game . Liggins lines up at fullback offset in front of backup quarterback DeVante Kincade , a known running threat . Two receivers are split out to either side , one stacked on top of the other . <p> A defense typically responds to a spread formation like this by inserting additional defensive backs and moving them outside . But the Commodores are so concerned with the running threat posed by Kincade and Liggins that they stay in their base 3-4 and keep one of their safeties on the inner-third of the field . This leaves the cornerback on the strong side on the perimeter by himself against a pair of receivers . <p> Seeing this , Kincade takes a step back and flings the ball out to Quincy Adeboyejo , who gets a good block from Vince Sanders and is nine yards upfield before the safety can get over to help his outnumbered teammate . <p> ( You may have to press play twice . ) <p> Hugh Freeze lines up in the same formation the very next play , and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realizing they 're outmanned on the perimeter , Vandy has traded a defensive lineman for a defensive back and moved he and one of the safeties out to help the cornerbacks . This leaves two linemen , four linebackers and a lone safety in the middle of the field . <p> What Freeze has done is engineered a favorable matchup . The defense has only six players in the box , and the offense has six blockers to match them . This time , Kincade fakes the outside pass , then follows Liggins to where the third defensive lineman used to be . Liggins clears the way with a block on the inside linebacker and Ole Miss picks up the first down . <p> ( You may have to press play twice . ) <p> Freeze is just getting started exploring the creative ways to create mismatches with his gargantuan weapon .

Playing against a Bama three-man front that can average 311 pounds apiece and anchors the third-best run defense in the country ( 62 yards allowed per game ) , Liggins could be critical in extending drives . <p> It 's unlikely the Rebel offensive line can do it on their own . According to Bill Connelly of Football Study Hall , the Ole Miss front has allowed the ball carrier to be tackled at or behind the line of scrimmage on 24.7 percent of run plays -- a rate worse than all but 12 of the 128 FBS teams . And yet , Ole Miss is 19th best in the nation in converting short-yardage situations ( 83.3 percent ) . That 's directly attributable to Liggins , who simply does n't need his O-line to clear lanes for him -- he clears his own . <p> As successful -- and entertaining -- as Liggins has been running behind center , he 's been able to make an impact without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an example from the Vanderbilt game . Liggins lines up at fullback offset in front of backup quarterback DeVante Kincade , a known running threat . Two receivers are split out to either side , one stacked on top of the other . <p> A defense typically responds to a spread formation like this by inserting additional defensive backs and moving them outside . But the Commodores are so concerned with the running threat posed by Kincade and Liggins that they stay in their base 3-4 and keep one of their safeties on the inner-third of the field . This leaves the cornerback on the strong side on the perimeter by himself against a pair of receivers . <p> Seeing this , Kincade takes a step back and flings the ball out to Quincy Adeboyejo , who gets a good block from Vince Sanders and is nine yards upfield before the safety can get over to help his outnumbered teammate . <p> ( You may have to press play twice . ) <p> Hugh Freeze lines up in the same formation the very next play , and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realizing they 're outmanned on the perimeter , Vandy has traded a defensive lineman for a defensive back and moved he and one of the safeties out to help the cornerbacks . This leaves two linemen , four linebackers and a lone safety in the middle of the field . <p> What Freeze has done is engineered a favorable matchup . The defense has only six players in the box , and the offense has six blockers to match them . This time , Kincade fakes the outside pass , then follows Liggins to where the third defensive lineman used to be . Liggins clears the way with a block on the inside linebacker and Ole Miss picks up the first down . <p> ( You may have to press play twice . ) <p> Freeze is just getting started exploring the creative ways to create mismatches with his gargantuan weapon . Just last week against Memphis , we saw Liggins hand the ball off on a jet sweep , yet another way to punish teams for stacking the middle of the field . And you can bet that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to LSU as a quarterback and played the position as recently as last season in the juco ranks , is going to throw the ball -- whether it be a Tim Tebow jump toss or a Malzahn-esque read-option pop pass .

He saw some time in the 2013 season at right tackle , but transferred this past offseason to Auburn where is is now sitting out a season per NCAA transfer rules . It would make sense , then , that Golson has a solid enough understanding of what Ole Miss does on offense , at least in a very basic sense . <p> After last season 's Tyler Siskey controversy , in which a former Ole Miss assistant was seen using binoculars to , presumably , peek at the Rebel sideline in Tuscaloosa , Ole Miss fans are naturally skeptical of anyone who leaves the Rebel program for another SEC West school in any capacity .

@@87888004 @3388004/ <h> Discussing ' Ghosts of Ole Miss ' with Wright Thompson <h> Tonight at 7:00 PM Central , " Ghosts of Ole Miss " will debut on ESPN . Part of the network 's 30 for 30 series of documentaries , " Ghosts of Ole Miss " will juxtapose the stories of the 1962 undefeated Ole Miss football team with that of the university 's integration . Native Mississippian and Oxonian Wright Thompson wrote and narrated the film , and happily offered to discuss it with me . My questions for Wright are in bold . <p> What was the impetus for the documentary ? Were you primarily interested in the integration or the football team , or both ? <p> It began when I wrote " Ghosts of Mississippi " a couple of years ago for ESPN . That was when I began to collect much of the information that is used in the 30 for 30 film . <p> There are two reasons why I began to research the 1962 Ole Miss football team . First , that team was my dad 's favorite Ole Miss football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was from the same hometown as my father , and dad loved the guy . Dad even wore number 15 when he was the quarterback of his high school because of Glynn . <p> There is this idea of the " glory days " of Ole Miss . For someone like me who is younger , we 're always told that the Archie Manning days were the glory days . But they were n't . They were this sort of unexpected last gasp of something that was already gone . The real glory days of Ole Miss were from 1957 to 1963 , with ' 63 being the last SEC championship the program would win . Those teams , including that undefeated 1962 team , were great teams that are not as widely well known or talked about . <p> And then there is the integration of the university . I 've always known about the integration , but only to an extent . When describing what happened , the word commonly used is " riots " which invokes images of maybe some burning couches and some thrown bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were moments where I literally dropped the book because I was so stunned . What happened was n't a riot - they had to call the US Marshalls and the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions in . What happened then did not take place how we were told it did . <p> In Mississippi , people always ask questions like " why do you have to bring up the past ? " I think we 've said that for so long because we do n't even know the past . We 're so defensive that we almost close ourselves off from our history . <p> Anyone that thinks that Mississippi has buried the ghosts its history is wrong , and only need to introduce themselves as a Mississippian to someone outside of the South and watch their reaction . Now , that 's certainly not fair to us , because it 's not 1962 anymore down here . But we can only understand and demonstrate that by exploring the events of 1962 . <p> The central theme of the last half of the film is , as Myrlie Evers-Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and we are proud of what we have become . " No , Mississippi is n't perfect , but it is a vastly different world from what it once was and has managed to change things that were broken while still maintaining a sense of place that preserves an identity . <p> There is a certain difficulty we Mississippians have when approaching our history . Did that make this project difficult ? Did it make it something more worthwhile ? <p> The original story was very difficult . It was difficult because I was writing about my home and my family . I received all sorts of angry emails and I even received an email from a family member saying that my late father would be ashamed of me . <p> When the idea for the 30 for 30 came around , at first I did n't want to do it . I wanted this to be a new project . The reason I ultimately decided to participate and help create " Ghosts of Ole Miss " is because I believe that telling our story about ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is , is the way to make sure Mississippi is the best Mississippi it can be . <p> After completing the project and watching it as many times as I have , I 'm really pleased with it . The director , Fritz Mitchell , did an unbelievable job . It 's a beautiful looking film . <p> So it became a labor of love . It became something I was able to do on top of my usual work because I felt so strongly about it . <p> You interview several people . How did you determine who to interview and how did that process go ? <p> Director Fritz Mitchell conducted the interviews for the film , while I did them for the original piece , so it 's important to note that I 'm responsible for the film , but do n't have final authority over it all . So I do n't have complete knowledge of the interview processes , but I do know that everyone was eager to show their best side , but wary to see how people will understand and portray them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those not from Mississippi , to understand them and get their story right . There 's an amount of wariness there that we have ; I get it . <p> Regarding the guys from the 1962 team , they are truly great people and very gracious . There is a scene in the film during a reunion of the team where you will see that I got a chance to meet with so many of them , and I interviewed most of them for the original " Ghosts of Mississippi " piece . In meeting with them , I was able to see the bonds formed in 1962 and how well they remain . It 's a real testament to what happened that year and to these guys . They 're class acts , confident , successful guys who had no problem telling their story . <p> I found the competing historical narratives and perspectives interesting and a very important way to examine history . Did your research challenge any preconceived notions ? Do you think that 's the purpose of examining history ? <p> Regarding the history of 1962 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that it was something that we all learned about . But in doing the work I did on " Ghosts of Mississippi " taught me so much more and raised the questions I ask in the film . <p> One portion of the film that I thought was particularly revealing was the detail about the rioters lowering the American flag at the Lyceum to raise the Confederate flag in its place . That to me changed or even emboldened some of my own perspectives on these issues . <p> The Confederate Flag debate is an interesting one . To me , the re-emergence of the Confederate flag was directly related to Jim Crow , the Solid South , the Dixiecrats - it 's all inexorably linked . But everybody has their own line about all of these symbols and we all have different ways of viewing them . <p> And that itself can cause some conflict , like in the film how you mentioned the feelings you have for " Dixie " juxtaposed against its history ? <p> I like Dixie . I like slow Dixie , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it incredibly moving . I think people will too when they watch the film . Note : The film opens with " Dixie " being slowly played on violin . In my opinion , it 's beautiful . <p> There 's a moment in the film of Meredith talking about Gettysburg and the University Greys and he does so as a Mississippian . He 's not talking as a white Mississippian or a black Mississippian or any of that , but in a poignant and spot-on way about this state and how it would perceive a tragic wartime loss . We all have these ideas competing with each other , and that leads us to ask questions but not necessarily reach a conclusion . And when we do find answers , we all have our own way of doing that - and that 's okay . That complexity is okay . With " Ghosts of Ole Miss , " I want to show this greater understanding of what happened in 1962 , and I hope that those who watch it , Mississippians included , begin to ask questions too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's future ? Is there one right answer ? <p> I think the answer can be found in examining ourselves , but everyone has a different answer to that . I feel that what you think the prescription is says a lot about you , and I 'm not sure anybody knows who is right . <p> Should we impale ourselves on our history over and over and forget it ? Is " mea culpa " the right answer ? I do n't know . <p> The question I 've asked in the film is " what is the cost of knowing versus the cost of not knowing . " I think that requires a rigorous and fair examination of ourselves and our past as something which is critical to moving forward . <p> Right now , you hear the natural minimization of the significance of these events by people who did n't see them , and then you have people like me who hear the word " riot " and do n't hear an " insurrection involving Molotov cocktails , coordinated assaults , and Springfield .30-06 deer rifles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a question of how much of our history do we actually know . <p> I think looking at history and understanding it is critical , but everyone is going to have a different way of looking at it and will have a different perspective on what happened . <p> Willie Morris once wrote about the insecurity of Mississippians and how we always feel a need to apologize for or atone for our past . In that sense , a lot of people I have spoken with are nervous that this film could portray Mississippi and Ole Miss in a negative light . What would you say to those who think that this could only hurt our state ? <p> If you come away feeling away feeling that about this film , then you probably felt that already . Some people are going to see what they wanted to see before the film even starts . In some ways , the film is a mirror , reflecting back onto the view the feelings that he or she may have already had . <p> I personally do n't see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly shows how different Mississippi of 2012 is from the Mississippi of 1962 , and I think the questions asked in the film show a level of honesty and introspection . <p> I was concerned what the reactions would be when the initial " Ghosts of Mississippi " story ran . I was nervous about that and what the reaction to it would be . I do n't feel the same way about the film . It never even occurred to me that people would even think that way about this film . <p> With " Ghosts of Ole Miss , " I 'm not looking to change the answers people come away with or alter what their view of what the future of Mississippi should be . I just want people to ask questions . <p> You want to know how Mississippi becomes the best Mississippi ? It is by everyone asking the questions that they feel are appropriate for themselves , pursuing an honest intellectual engagement with our history and our identity , and moving on as they see fit . <p> I am proud to be from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of my dad 's cufflinks with the seal of the state of Mississippi on them . I love wearing those outside of the state , even if people ca n't see them . My identity is inexorably tied to that of Mississippi , and that is something I hope I portrayed with the film . <p> The real tragedy of people 's view of Mississippi outside of the state is that very few places have their entire identity built on this bedrock of a sense of place like Mississippi does . One of the best moments in the film is when former governor of Mississippi , William Winter , explains that " some of our past is glorious , and some of it is infamous . " I think that he demonstrates this need to reconcile what we can be proud of with our more difficult moments , and I think we 've done a remarkable job of changing what needs to be changed while holding onto the things that serve to pass on identity from generation to generation . <p> So the film premiers tonight . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm really not . I was much more nervous about the original story and what the reaction would be to that . I 've thought through it and I 'm very confident in the work .

That 's a pretty big deal , considering Bo Wallace is on his way out the door after the Peach Bowl and considering Kelly is a former four-star recruit and Under Armour All-American . <p> There 's a decent chance that Kelly , who brings with him a checkered past , tantalizing athleticism , his own theme song and enough #swag to fill Vaught-Hemingway , will end up being the Rebels ' starter in 2015 . <p> So here are nine things you need to know about Chad Kelly : <h> 1 . Chad Kelly was baller in JUCO ( but not as baller as Dr. Bo ) . <p> Kelly 's commitment to Ole Miss came just three days after he threw five touchdowns to lead East Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he completed 67 percent of his passes for 3,905 yards and 47 touchdowns .

But while I 'm at it , I might as well point out that Kelly threw six fewer picks than Bo. <h> 2 . Chad Kelly got kicked out of Clemson . <p> So why exactly is this guy playing at a JUCO to begin with , you ask ? Kelly entered this past spring as a favorite to replace Tajh Boyd as the starter at Clemson , but ole Chad apparently had some maturity issues , and after a string of emotional outbursts ( including yelling at a former Miss South Carolina after a fender bender in the stadium parking lot ) , he was booted off the team in April . The final straw was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he got into a shouting match with coaches for not going for it on fourth down . In a practice game . <h> 3 . Chad Kelly raps ... about Chad Kelly . <p> Chad has boatloads of swag . And when you have boatloads of swag , you make a theme song that you rap yourself just so everybody knows exactly how swagged out you are . <h> 4 . Chad Kelly has two years of eligibility left . <p> This ai n't no Jeremiah Masoli , one-and-done deal . Kelly redshirted as a freshman at Clemson in 2012 , tore his ACL in the 2013 spring game ( he miraculously returned later that same season , playing sparingly as a backup ) , then had the one year at East Mississippi . That means he rolls into 2015 classified as a redshirt junior with a couple of seasons to play in Oxford . <h> 5 . Chad Kelly is the white Michael Vick . <p> " A lot of people say I 'm like a Mike Vick , only white ... People like watching me make something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some wheels , though . He 's listed by recruiting services as a dual-threat quarterback and averaged 37 rushing yards per game at East Mississippi , running for four scores as well . <p> Remember , Freeze 's offense is ideally suited for an athletic quarterback that can run the read-option . Watch this clip ( his lone touchdown as a Clemson Tiger ) and tell me you 're not excited : <h> 6 . Chad Kelly has good bloodlines . <p> As in , his uncle is former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly . Ya know , the Hall of Famer. <h> 7 . Chad Kelly is n't a shoo-in as the 2015 starter . <p> Lest we forget , Hugh Freeze has a pair of former four-star quarterback prospects -- Ryan Buchanan and DeVante Kincade -- stashed away for 2015 .

Remember that time Jake Coker showed up as the hot-shot transfer in Tuscaloosa and Blake Sims beat him out and led Alabama to the Playoff ? <p> The only problem with that is ... <h> 8 . Chad Kelly has n't done well with quarterback competitions . <p> Kelly was causing problems with teammates before he even showed up at Clemson . Still in high school back in 2012 , he sent this Twitter jab at Cole Stoudt , the guy he would eventually compete with as the starter : <p> Your on the bench for a reason ! And i come soon ! Just letting you know <p> That was two years ago , but it was just seven months ago that Kelly threw a tantrum and had to be escorted out of Dabo Swinney 's office when he was told Stoudt would enter fall practice as the starter . <p> So what happens if Kelly loses out to Buchanan or Kincade ? Will he revert to his childish ways and start causing problems ? <p> With that said ... <h> 9 . Chad Kelly could make Ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Quarterback is one of the few question marks for the Rebels heading into 2015 . If -- and it 's a pretty damn big if -- Kelly can win the job and be at least an above-average SEC passer , Ole Miss should have the tools to make another run at the Playoff . Kelly will have a veteran offensive line , one of the country 's best wideouts and a freakishly athletic tight end at his disposal , which should help smooth his transition . <p> Or he could be the next Brent Schaeffer .

@@87888015 @3388015/ <h> Less than two weeks after the departure of Dalton Dulin , news comes that the veteran outfielder and promising freshman slugger are leaving Oxford . Throw in the MLB signing deadline of last week and we finally have a clear picture of who will and wo n't be back in 2015 . <p> We interrupt your regularly scheduled college football countdown for a bit of quick Ole Miss baseball news . Junior outfielder Will Jamison and freshman infielder Brantley Bell are leaving the Rebel program , according to a report by Chase Parham of Rivals . This news comes roughly one week after it was announced that freshman second baseman Dalton Dulin was departing . <p> In related news , last Friday was the deadline for MLB teams to sign their draft picks , meaning we now have a finalized list of which current players and recruits are leaving for the pros . I 'll jump into the Jamison/Bell/Dulin news then come back to the draft signings . <h> Why are they leaving ? <p> According to Parham , Jamison is leaving the sport of baseball altogether and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a nurse anesthetist . Parham specifically mentioned that there were " no hard feelings " and this was a decision based solely on Jamison 's longterm goals . <p> Bell and Dulin appear as though they 're looking for more playing time . Though Preston Overbey 's graduation opens up second base , Dulin would have had to beat out incoming recruit Tate Blackman , once rated as the top middle infielder prospect in the country by Perfect Game . <p> Bell 's decision is the most perplexing . He would have competed with Colby Bortles at third and could have been in the mix at second after Dulin left . Parham suggested that Bell wants to be an everyday shortstop , something that he could n't do with Errol Robinson in Oxford . <p> There 's been no word on where Bell and Dulin are transferring . <h> How does this affect the 2015 team ? <p> The biggest loss , in my opinion , is Bell , who showed some real promise at the plate with a .304 freshman batting average . His brief foray in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have hopefully been ironed out moving forward . I thought he had a real chance to replace Anderson at third , and at the very least could have been a dangerous designated or pinch hitter . <p> Jamison leaves Ole Miss with 98 career starts over three seasons . He split time in right field during that span , never developing into a reliable full time starter thanks to struggles at the plate ( his .248 average was the lowest among the 2014 starters ) , but he was a strong defender and provided quality depth . Both Braxton Lee and Auston Bousfield have signed pro contracts , which leaves J.B. Woodman as the only experienced outfielder on the roster . Jamison would have certainly seen heavy rotation in the outfield in 2015 . <p> Dulin hit .264 and fielded at a .978 clip as a freshman . He started only 11 games and is definitely the most expendable of the three departures . Still , it would have been nice to have him around to compete with Blackman and provide depth . The biggest blow is the recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best travel teams in the Mid-South . <p> In the end , you should n't be freaking out too much about these losses . This knocks the Rebs ' depth a bit , but none of these guys were sure starters next season . <h> Who signed MLB contracts ? <p> The Rebels had nine players taken in the MLB draft , more than any other school in the nation . In the end , eight of them ended up signing by Friday 's deadline . The good news is that the one who did n't was Christian Trent , who should be one of the top Friday night aces in the SEC next year ( and who hashtagged ' Tits Out for the Rebs ' in his official Twitter announcement ) . <p> Here 's the complete list of draft picks .

" If you remember the last Cotton Bowl held at the Texas State Fair , then you should remember Texas Tech receiver Michael Crabtree 's postgame quote , " I guess we just were n't feeling it .

None of the big names " Thomas Dillard , Grae Kessinger , Cooper Johnson , Ryan Rolison and Will Etheridge " heard their names called earlier than the 26th round , which might be because they 've already told pro teams they 're heading to Oxford . Rolison , an elite lefty pitcher who throws in the 90s , Cooper Johnson , who some think is the best defensive catcher in the draft , and the Oxford High duo of Dillard and Kessinger have already confirmed they 're Oxford-bound . <p> Ca n't wait to get to work at Ole Miss in July .

@@87888032 @3388032/ <h> The guy has his own theme song and calls himself " the white Michael Vick " ... and he may just make Ole Miss a national title contender next season . <p> You may have heard that on Wednesday afternoon , Ole Miss got a commitment from No. 1 JUCO quarterback prospect and former Clemson player Chad Kelly . That 's a pretty big deal , considering Bo Wallace is on his way out the door after the Peach Bowl and considering Kelly is a former four-star recruit and Under Armour All-American . <p> There 's a decent chance that Kelly , who brings with him a checkered past , tantalizing athleticism , his own theme song and enough #swag to fill Vaught-Hemingway , will end up being the Rebels ' starter in 2015 . <p> So here are nine things you need to know about Chad Kelly : <h> 1 . Chad Kelly was baller in JUCO ( but not as baller as Dr. Bo ) . <p> Kelly 's commitment to Ole Miss came just three days after he threw five touchdowns to lead East Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he completed 67 percent of his passes for 3,905 yards and 47 touchdowns . As impressive as those numbers are , that 's 700 yards and six touchdowns fewer than Bo Wallace , who also played at East Mississippi and also led them to a title . <p> No , JUCO stats do n't really mean much , especially when trying to compare one set of absurd numbers to another . But while I 'm at it , I might as well point out that Kelly threw six fewer picks than Bo. <h> 2 . Chad Kelly got kicked out of Clemson . <p> So why exactly is this guy playing at a JUCO to begin with , you ask ? Kelly entered this past spring as a favorite to replace Tajh Boyd as the starter at Clemson , but ole Chad apparently had some maturity issues , and after a string of emotional outbursts ( including yelling at a former Miss South Carolina after a fender bender in the stadium parking lot ) , he was booted off the team in April . The final straw was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he got into a shouting match with coaches for not going for it on fourth down . In a practice game . <h> 3 . Chad Kelly raps ... about Chad Kelly . <p> Chad has boatloads of swag . And when you have boatloads of swag , you make a theme song that you rap yourself just so everybody knows exactly how swagged out you are . <h> 4 . Chad Kelly has two years of eligibility left . <p> This ai n't no Jeremiah Masoli , one-and-done deal . Kelly redshirted as a freshman at Clemson in 2012 , tore his ACL in the 2013 spring game ( he miraculously returned later that same season , playing sparingly as a backup ) , then had the one year at East Mississippi . That means he rolls into 2015 classified as a redshirt junior with a couple of seasons to play in Oxford . <h> 5 . Chad Kelly is the white Michael Vick . <p> " A lot of people say I 'm like a Mike Vick , only white ... People like watching me make something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some wheels , though . He 's listed by recruiting services as a dual-threat quarterback and averaged 37 rushing yards per game at East Mississippi , running for four scores as well . <p> Remember , Freeze 's offense is ideally suited for an athletic quarterback that can run the read-option . Watch this clip ( his lone touchdown as a Clemson Tiger ) and tell me you 're not excited : <h> 6 . Chad Kelly has good bloodlines . <p> As in , his uncle is former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly . Ya know , the Hall of Famer. <h> 7 . Chad Kelly is n't a shoo-in as the 2015 starter . <p> Lest we forget , Hugh Freeze has a pair of former four-star quarterback prospects -- Ryan Buchanan and DeVante Kincade -- stashed away for 2015 . The mere fact that Freeze felt he needed to go out and grab Kelly does n't exactly speak highly of his confidence in the other two , but that does n't mean Kelly 's automatically going to win the job . <p> If nothing else , Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember that time Jake Coker showed up as the hot-shot transfer in Tuscaloosa and Blake Sims beat him out and led Alabama to the Playoff ? <p> The only problem with that is ... <h> 8 . Chad Kelly has n't done well with quarterback competitions . <p> Kelly was causing problems with teammates before he even showed up at Clemson . Still in high school back in 2012 , he sent this Twitter jab at Cole Stoudt , the guy he would eventually compete with as the starter : <p> Your on the bench for a reason ! And i come soon ! Just letting you know <p> That was two years ago , but it was just seven months ago that Kelly threw a tantrum and had to be escorted out of Dabo Swinney 's office when he was told Stoudt would enter fall practice as the starter . <p> So what happens if Kelly loses out to Buchanan or Kincade ? Will he revert to his childish ways and start causing problems ? <p> With that said ... <h> 9 . Chad Kelly could make Ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Quarterback is one of the few question marks for the Rebels heading into 2015 . If -- and it 's a pretty damn big if -- Kelly can win the job and be at least an above-average SEC passer , Ole Miss should have the tools to make another run at the Playoff . Kelly will have a veteran offensive line , one of the country 's best wideouts and a freakishly athletic tight end at his disposal , which should help smooth his transition . <p> Or he could be the next Brent Schaeffer . Who the hell knows . <h> *Bonus : A mere eight months separate Chad Kelly and Marshall Henderson from being in Oxford together . 
@@87888033 @3388033/ <h> Less than two weeks after the departure of Dalton Dulin , news comes that the veteran outfielder and promising freshman slugger are leaving Oxford . Throw in the MLB signing deadline of last week and we finally have a clear picture of who will and wo n't be back in 2015 . <p> We interrupt your regularly scheduled college football countdown for a bit of quick Ole Miss baseball news . Junior outfielder Will Jamison and freshman infielder Brantley Bell are leaving the Rebel program , according to a report by Chase Parham of Rivals . This news comes roughly one week after it was announced that freshman second baseman Dalton Dulin was departing . <p> In related news , last Friday was the deadline for MLB teams to sign their draft picks , meaning we now have a finalized list of which current players and recruits are leaving for the pros . I 'll jump into the Jamison/Bell/Dulin news then come back to the draft signings . <h> Why are they leaving ? <p> According to Parham , Jamison is leaving the sport of baseball altogether and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a nurse anesthetist . Parham specifically mentioned that there were " no hard feelings " and this was a decision based solely on Jamison 's longterm goals . <p> Bell and Dulin appear as though they 're looking for more playing time . Though Preston Overbey 's graduation opens up second base , Dulin would have had to beat out incoming recruit Tate Blackman , once rated as the top middle infielder prospect in the country by Perfect Game . <p> Bell 's decision is the most perplexing . He would have competed with Colby Bortles at third and could have been in the mix at second after Dulin left . Parham suggested that Bell wants to be an everyday shortstop , something that he could n't do with Errol Robinson in Oxford . <p> There 's been no word on where Bell and Dulin are transferring . <h> How does this affect the 2015 team ? <p> The biggest loss , in my opinion , is Bell , who showed some real promise at the plate with a .304 freshman batting average . His brief foray in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have hopefully been ironed out moving forward . I thought he had a real chance to replace Anderson at third , and at the very least could have been a dangerous designated or pinch hitter . <p> Jamison leaves Ole Miss with 98 career starts over three seasons . He split time in right field during that span , never developing into a reliable full time starter thanks to struggles at the plate ( his .248 average was the lowest among the 2014 starters ) , but he was a strong defender and provided quality depth . Both Braxton Lee and Auston Bousfield have signed pro contracts , which leaves J.B. Woodman as the only experienced outfielder on the roster . Jamison would have certainly seen heavy rotation in the outfield in 2015 . <p> Dulin hit .264 and fielded at a .978 clip as a freshman . He started only 11 games and is definitely the most expendable of the three departures . Still , it would have been nice to have him around to compete with Blackman and provide depth . The biggest blow is the recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best travel teams in the Mid-South . <p> In the end , you should n't be freaking out too much about these losses . This knocks the Rebs ' depth a bit , but none of these guys were sure starters next season . <h> Who signed MLB contracts ? <p> The Rebels had nine players taken in the MLB draft , more than any other school in the nation . In the end , eight of them ended up signing by Friday 's deadline . The good news is that the one who did n't was Christian Trent , who should be one of the top Friday night aces in the SEC next year ( and who hashtagged ' Tits Out for the Rebs ' in his official Twitter announcement ) . <p> Here 's the complete list of draft picks . Keep in mind that Anderson , Will Allen and Aaron Greenwood were graduating seniors who the Rebs were going to lose anyway . <p> Chris Ellis ( 3rd round , Los Angeles Angels ) - SIGNED <p> Auston Bousfield ( 5th round , San Diego Padres ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orioles ) - SIGNED <p> Josh Laxer ( 9th round , Detroit Tigers ) - SIGNED <p> Braxton Lee ( 12th round , Tampa Bay Rays ) - SIGNED <p> Will Allen ( 13th round , Detroit Tigers ) - SIGNED <p> Hawtin Buchanan ( 20th round , Seattle Mariners ) - SIGNED <p> Christian Trent ( 20th round , Los Angeles Dodgers ) - RETURNING <p> Aaron Greenwood ( 28th round , Houston Astros ) - SIGNED <p> The Rebs also lost some recruits to the draft . Foster Griffin -- a left-handed pitcher rated by MLB.com as the No. 28 prospect of the draft -- and Ti'Quan Forbes -- a shortstop considered the top prospect in Mississippi -- both went on day one and signed contracts back in June . <p> Blackman , who went in the 20th round , turned down the Milwaukee Brewers and will be on campus to hopefully take over at second . <p> It 's unclear at this point whether Clay Casey , a power hitter out of Desoto who could help fill the void in the outfield , ever signed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parham tweeted after the deadline that there had been " no indication " that Casey had signed , but that he had n't been able to confirm it .

Is n't it the best of all seasons ? Rampant speculation . Wild rumors . Utter heartbreak over people you 've never met choosing to go to a school other than the one you attended . <p> As easy as it is to poke fun at people ( like myself ) who care way too much about recruiting , it 's tough to argue about its importance . The teams who finish with top recruiting classes typically finish atop the polls . It 's not a random coincidence . Recruiting may be the most important aspect of a college coach 's job . If you do n't have good players , it does n't matter how good your scheming is . You will lose to teams that are much more talented than yours . <p> The Ole Miss coaches have set their annual huge recruiting weekend to begin this Friday and the visit list is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ole Miss Spirit has 18 guys showing up on campus , including CeCe Jefferson , Drew Richmond , Van Jefferson , Leo Lewis and Damarkus Lodge . I can not vouch for the validity of the list .

He named Ole Miss his leader in late December , but Auburn appears to have made a late push after bringing on Will Muschamp as their defensive coordinator . He was on The Plains last weekend and told First Coast News that he will be a package deal with five-star Byron Cowart and four-star Jeff Holland . Holland will be accompanying him to Oxford this weekend . <h> Drew Richmond ( committed ) <p> I 've talked about Richmond several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country would sign if they could . He was fantastic in the Under Armour All-Star game and was recently ranked by Rivals as the No. 1 offensive tackle nationally . He 's still considering other options , but Richmond is very likely coming to Ole Miss . <h> The 4-stars <h> Van Jefferson <p> The country 's No. 11 wide receiver broke his longstanding commitment with Georgia earlier this week , which on the surface is great news for Ole Miss . But after a visit to Oklahoma , Jefferson was rumored to be on the verge of committing to the Sooners . The good news is that has n't happened yet and the fact that he 's showing up in Oxford would suggest the Rebels have a good chance to lock him down this weekend . <h> Damarkus Lodge <p> The Rebels appear to be the frontrunners for the No. 6 wideout in country , but things are n't as firm as they once were . Lodge was at Texas A&amp;M ( where he was once committed ) last weekend , then took a surprise visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll see if Freeze and his staff can lock him down this weekend . <h> Leo Lewis ( committed ) <p> Lewis is also known by almost anyone who follows Ole Miss recruiting in any capacity . The Brookhaven product is the star linebacker of the class . Lewis is still considering Mississippi State and I do n't have tons of insider information on his recruitment , but I think it has to be a good sign that he left his visit to Starkville last weekend and was still committed to Ole Miss . <h> Kendrick Norton <p> The top offensive guard out of the state of Florida , Norton is also considering Auburn , Miami and Michigan . Ben Garrett of the Ole Miss Spirit reports Ole Miss is fighting an " uphill battle " for his services , but does claim that Norton 's mom wants him in Oxford . <h> Jeff Holland <p> Holland , a linebacker/running back in the top 150 prospects nationally , is significant because he 's a good friend of CeCe Jefferson and has been rumored to be part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's accompanying this five-star buddy to Oxford . <h> Rasool Clemons <p> A 6 ' 6 , 212-pound defensive end prospect out of South Carolina , Clemons is reportedly down to Ole Miss , Florida and West Virginia . <h> Eric Swinney ( committed ) <p> Swinney is a consensus four-star running back who is being billed as a player who can compete for playing time immediately . With the number of running backs who have announced plans to transfer , there should be a little room for him to carve a niche . As best I can tell , he 's firmly committed . <h> Armani Linton ( committed ) <p> Linton is a 6 ' 3 " safety ranked No. 14 at his position nationally . His height alone is pretty exciting to see in a safety prospect , but there 's more to his game than just measurables . Linton is also firm with Ole Miss . <h> Jason Pellerin ( committed ) <p> Pellerin is the No. 15 dual threat quarterback in the country , but I think that 's mostly a result of him being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option-oriented offense and rarely passes more than 10 times in a game . It 's tough to know much about how he will transition to college . Obviously , because of Pellerin 's background , he ca n't be expected to compete for a starting job immediately , but he has vast potential . <h> The 3-stars <h> Montrell Custis <p> The defensive back is currently committed to Alabama , but his recruitment is still very much open . Kentucky probably has the best chance to flip him , but Ole Miss is obviously still in the game . <h> Jalen Julius <p> Louisville and Notre Dame are still in the game , but Ole Miss is reportedly the leader for the cornerback . <h> Austrian Robinson <p> The No. 1 offensive tackle out of New York ( for whatever that 's worth ) is listing Maryland as his top choice , so the Rebels need a stellar weekend to flip him . <h> Alex Givens ( committed ) <p> The offensive guards been committed since September . That should n't change . <h> Willie Hibbler ( committed ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Rebels since August , along with his teammate , 2016 four-star running back prospect Justin Connor . Hibbler is a bit of an unknown at the moment , so it will be interesting to see if any clarity comes out of his official visit . <h> Cameron Ordway ( committed ) <p> Ordway is an impressive cornerback prospect with the height the coaches love at the position . The 6 ' 2 Pulaski , Tenn. native had offers from most of the good programs in the South and chose the Rebels over the likes of Alabama , Auburn , LSU , Clemson , Florida State and others . People are n't talking about him much now , but his commitment is a big deal . <h> Zedrick Woods ( committed ) <p> Woods , who could end up at either safety or linebacker , has been committed to Ole Miss since the summer and there 's no indication that he 's wavering .

For me that craving is usually bourbon or Valpolicella , but Tuesday July 8 , 2014 I woke up craving hot tamales . Not those cinnamon hot candy tamales , but real tamales , the way the ancient Aztecs made them . Cornmeal and meat with some spice added , and wrapped in a corn husk . <p> So we set out to get some . I went with my two friend Taylor and Joe . I do n't know if I have permission to put their last names in here , so you 'll have to do with what I give you . We decided that we would start on Jackson Avenue at the beginning and work our way to the square . We started about 2:00 PM at Papito 's and ended around 9:00 PM at Lamar Lounge . There were several tamales that stood out above the rest but there were several that were very subpar . My worst fear is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as kind as possible . <p> Here are the nine tamales we had that day in Oxford , Mississippi , ranked from worst to first . <p> 9 ) Lamar Lounge <p> One of the best presentation by far and the pickled vegetable medley was exceptional when added to the tamale ! This is where it gets complicated , because we judged the tamales on their own accord . These just had no flavor . These were the blandest tamales by far . It tasted like they had been steamed in dish water . They were over priced at around $9 dollars for -+ dozen , and they were very disappointing especially when we found out that they were made in the Delta from a well-known tamale place . <p> 8 ) . Papitos <p> These tamales were sub-par . They were overloaded with sauce and cheese and had more masa ( cornmeal dough ) than meat inside . I did drink a couple dos equis so that added to the experience . The masa was also kind of rubbery and they brought it to us too quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no one wants old-ass tamales from Mexican restaurant in a shopping mall . They tasted like they were probably under the heating lamp all afternoon . The flavor was pretty good though that is they at least had flavor and spice . This was the first spot we hit and ordered 3 when we should have probably only ordered 1 . The option is nice you can spend 2 bucks for one or 3 for 5 dollars . Did I mention how good the dos Equis was ? <p> 7 ) Casa Mexicana <p> These tamales were very similar to Papito 's tamales except they seemed a bit fresher . The masa had a good consistency but there was just too much of it , relative to the amount of meat inside . The beer was fresh - Tamales and beer on an afternoon is always pleasurable . I like that you can buy a tamale here for around 2 dollars and it is large . You really feel like you get your money 's worth . To add to the ambiance there was a gaggle of Latinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were all drinking pitchers of beer and shouting what I assume was derogatory Spanish ... I absolutely loved that . <p> 6 ) Sno Biz <p> If you want cold ass tamales to microwave later at your home , here is your spot . The girl gave me some tamales out of the freezer that were colder than penguin nuts . I loved the outdoor decorations though and the goofy signs and such . I even bought a lemonade snow cone , which was wonderful . They claim they get their tamales from the Delta and I believe them , partly because they were frozen and partly because they had a sign that said so . " They ca n't put it on the interweb ' if it is n't true . " If you flirt with the young girl working there , she will even heat these cold tamales up in the microwave . She will then place said tamales in a plastic Sunday ice cream boat !

My only concern with them was they were a bit too salty and garlicky , and they did n't have any heat . The presentation was pretty awful , but that does n't matter if they would have been delicious . They did , however , have a good meat to masa ratio and the consistency was excellent . I 'd go back and get them again , well that is to say if they served beer . They do n't serve beer . Rivals is doing some great things with BBQ and their sausage/cheese plate is one of the best in Oxford . However , their tamales do need some work . Rivals has the potential to be at the top of the oxford underground tamale syndicate that I just invented , but for now they are just ok .

It is delicious , however , it 's kind of pricey if you just want a tamale . The entree is a good 13 bucks , but it 's served as a dinner with sides so it will fill you right the hell up . The green chilies are spread on top and are deliciously composed with fresh tomatoes . It is really fucking good . This tamale tastes very southern and traditional even though it 's considered a renegade of the tamale syndicate world . I would rate this tamale as being number one , but it is not a tamale . It is just corn/masa/meat/chili pie , but it is fantastic ! ED : We call it " tamale pie " in my neck of the woods .

We sat down , got the option of pork or chicken and we got one of each . Shredded pork and chopped up chicken made this tamale seem authentic . Add the green homeade sauce or valentino sauce to them and you 've hit another level of love . It took them forever to bring them out so I can assume they were made to order . With sports in the background and another cold dos Equis this was an excellent tamale . ( If you have n't noticed , the major theme to this tamale ballad is drinking and eating . ) Great masa/meat ratio - felt like I was in Mexico ! Best tamale for the money by far . Around $1.50 per giant tamale . If all I wanted was a tamale and a beer I 'd come here <p> 2 ) Delta Steak Company <p> I 've had these before and they were great . We even met the guy who makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making mad man . Did I mention you can get them fried - oh yeah , fried tamales . The regular Delta tamales are some of the best around , and although these were pretty flat I 've had some there before that are absolutely perfect . The fried tamale was the best and one of the reasons Delta Steak Co comes in at number two . Ingenuity alone granted these guys a spot ! I feel like if you stuffed the fried tamale with cheese , you 'd get something so spectacular it would blow the minds of mortal men . It would be as if the ghost of John Vaught reincarnated Hugh Freeze at the Sugar Bowl and Treadwell catches a last second 75-yard touchdown pass to win the game , but all in your mouth . Great mixed drinks as well . <p> 1 ) Soulshine <p> Yes the pizza joint <p> If I was judging the Tamale by itself and I am , I would put these at number 2 but this is my damn write up and I 'm putting them at number one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tamale and a variety of shit you can douse it with .

Now I know what you 're thinking , " this is BS you ca n't have crawfish sauce on a tamale . " Well Soulshine and I are here with a rebuttal : " Yes the fuck you can . " I should probably state that Soulshine has nothing to do with this and they probably do n't even know I 'm writing this or that I even exist . <p> In all , I had a wonderful experience driving all over Oxford to different restaurants trying tamales .

When they corner you between the appetizer and booze station , there 's no better thoroughfare for your lackadaisical non-ESPN watching family to bring up something they know you are passionate about . I ca n't really blame them -- the hype train for this game is reaching Snowpiercer ( check it out on Netflix ) speeds and it feels great to have bandwagon-esque family and friends reaffirm that when they ask me the following basic line-up of questioning while I sip brandy milk punch : <p> 1 . Are you going to the game ? Yes , my wife and I skipped all away games this year for a potential college football playoff berth , but a New Year 's Six bowl will suffice . <p> 2 . What do you think about the matchup ? I think it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hopefully Ole Miss wins so we can win the party even harder on New Year 's Eve . <p> 3 . TCU ... hmm , is n't that a Mormon college ? No , it 's Texas Christian University . You 're thinking of BYU who you recently saw get in a brawl with Memphis after their bowl game . Someone must 've spiked the Gatorade with caffeine . : : cue light chuckle : : <p> 4 . Ah ok , TCU ... do n't they have the nation 's best offense or close to it ? Well yes ... but we are n't sure . The Big XII is as good at defense as Uncle Rick is at making fruit cake . Sure we tell him it 's good , but deep down , everyone grabs a bite just to appease him , then when he 's not looking , we feed it to the dog . <p> 5 .

Ok you have now reached the acme of main stream media cliches , this conversation is over ... <p> It 's question No. 4 that really got me thinking ... just how good is this TCU offense and is the BIG XII sucky-ass defense narrative really true ?

TCU just has n't played any defenses worth a damn and their gaudy numbers are the result . Of the 11 FCS teams they have played , the average total defense rank is 76th while their average scoring defense rank is 74th . Ole Miss ranks 12th and 1st in those categories , respectively . <p> Now sure , the stats of TCU 's competition is a bit skewed considering TCU ran up a bunch of yardage and points against those teams , but that is still one game out of 12 . Remember the Arkansas game ? ( I would n't blame you if you did n't . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents OF opponents , but let 's consider Texas Tech , who played both TCU and Arkansas . Ole Miss had six turnovers against Arkansas and gave up 300-plus yards . Texas Tech , on the other hand , had three turnovers and gave up just shy of 500 yards . ( Take this data with a grain of salt because our game and Texas Tech 's game against Arkansas were at opposite ends of the season , but it 's the only game I could fit in this comparison . ) If Arkansas , a dominantly run-based offense can put up 500 yards on Texas Tech , it should come as no surprise that an offense that can do both , thanks to Trevone Boykin and Aaron Green , could put up almost 800 yards on one of the worst defense 's in all of college football . <p> On top of the numbers , this game reeks of another narrative : the whole " we 've got a chip on our shoulder because we were left out of the championship game so we are gon na play lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed because yea , we really did n't . " If you remember the last Cotton Bowl held at the Texas State Fair , then you should remember Texas Tech receiver Michael Crabtree 's postgame quote , " I guess we just were n't feeling it .

Mississippi State is suddenly ranked as well , making a strong debut this week at No. 14 after upsetting then-No. 8 LSU in Baton Rouge this past Saturday .

It has n't happened often , nor has it happened in recent history , but it has indeed happened , most recently in the September 29 , 1958 poll .

Ole Miss came in second in the SEC , going 9-1-1 overall and 5-0-1 in conference . Ole Miss did n't play Auburn that season ( they did n't really play very much at all until the 1990 's ) , lost to Arkansas , and tied Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl . State finished that season as the SEC 's third best team , going 6-2-1 overall and 4-2-1 against conference competition . <p> So there 's the answer to your question , Dustin . There have been Associated Press polls that have ranked both Ole Miss and Mississippi State in the top-15 , but this week 's poll is the first in almost 56 years to do so .

Eisworth high-points the ball well in the air on defense and , like Hilton , is not afraid of contact . As a receiver , he could definitely cause fits for linebackers over the middle and could be Shea Patterson 's best friend on third down when trying to move the sticks for the Rebels in the future .

And so BYU learned the hard way that Andy Kennedy 's locker-room oratory can inspire his men to ball , ball , ball with 20 minutes to scrap . The Rebels rallied from a 17-point deficit in Tuesday 's NCAA Tournament play-in game , roaring back for a 94-90 win and a date with 6-seed Xavier in the second round . <p> The story of the night was second-half adjustments -- the Basketbears implemented a style of ball wholly different from what we 've seen prior to Tuesday night .

Ole Miss increasingly offered man defense in the second half , which allowed Rebel defenders to stick harder on their marks and force either hasty shots or sloppy passes that went intercepted . The Rebs logged eight damn steals in Dayton , four of which in a three-minute second-half span that saw them go from down 7 to up 2 for their first lead of the game . <p> The second half also saw Ole Miss deploy an inside game that , if we 're being honest , has n't shown up in months . BYU runs a hybrid sort of line-up , which lists four guards and a lone center/forward/wrecking ball as their on-floor personnel . In this way , they stretch the perimeter and locate a hot hand everywhere around the dogleg . This airy approach paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot 57 percent from the field , but on a long enough timeline , that basket gets smaller and smaller in turns .

Ole Miss ' big three were virtually silent in the opening period , seemingly crushed under the weight of BYU 's outside defense . So , LONG ... AK changed the game-plan . Let Stefan or Jarvis take the dribble inside -- as is expected -- but then , with defenders converging , zing , drop the dime to M.J. Rhett or Dwight Coleby or Sebastian Saiz . The Rebels dished 24 assists against BYU and monster-man Rhett threw down a season-high 20 points . <p> The Rebels ' size advantage also served them well in the rebounding column .

It 's " rebuilding in the Sun Belt " bad . It 's why a team that has good skill players - hello Jalen Hurd ! - can still struggle to establish any offensive identity .

Speaking of recruiting , Tennessee did n't sign a single offensive lineman in 2012 per Rivals , which most certainly has a lot to do with the Vols ' lack of depth and experience up front . <p> All of this suggests that the Ole Miss defense should do an excellent job of stopping the run and forcing Tennessee to make bad plays .

Ole Miss increasingly offered man defense in the second half , which allowed Rebel defenders to stick harder on their marks and force either hasty shots or sloppy passes that went intercepted .

Ole Miss ' big three were virtually silent in the opening period , seemingly crushed under the weight of BYU 's outside defense . So , LONG ... AK changed the game-plan . Let Stefan or Jarvis take the dribble inside -- as is expected -- but then , with defenders converging , zing , drop the dime to M.J. Rhett or Dwight Coleby or Sebastian Saiz . The Rebels dished 24 assists against BYU and monster-man Rhett threw down a season-high 20 points . <p> The Rebels ' size advantage also served them well in the rebounding column .

Before this season , Kerbyson had taken some snaps on the offensive line , but did n't break into the top of the depth chart until this season . All of Tennessee 's offensive linemen have legitmate SEC size , but few were legitimate SEC recruits ( Marcus Jackson was a four star guy in his class ) . Speaking of recruiting , Tennessee did n't sign a single offensive lineman in 2012 per Rivals , which most certainly has a lot to do with the Vols ' lack of depth and experience up front . <p> All of this suggests that the Ole Miss defense should do an excellent job of stopping the run and forcing Tennessee to make bad plays . At the season 's halfway point , the Rebel D is tops in the SEC in scoring defense and yards per play allowed ; second in fewest 10+ yard plays allowed ; third in rushing defense ; and fourth in tackles for a loss . In watching the Vols ' highlights against UT Chattanooga and Florida , I saw offensive linemen who were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And , of course , every time he left the yard at Swayze ( 18 of his career 34 homers have come in the friendly confines ) , this happened : <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss lists the total attendance of every home game on its box scores , but figuring the student section crowd was a bit trickier . The school does track per-game attendance in Right Field ( at least this year ) , but the baseball media relations dude would n't get back to us . But you know who did get back to us ? Ole Miss Athletic Director Ross Bjork , because he 's the man . <p> @RedCupRebellion 3,000 is the maximum capacity . A normal crowd in RF is around 2,000 ..... <p> From that , we 're able to calculate an answer to the question " Of any given home crowd , what percentage is in Right Field ? " It 's safe to assume that on the day that Swayze set its all-time attendance record -- 11,729 in 2013 against Bama -- the student section was at capacity . So take 3,000 from 11,729 and we 're left with a baseline percentage of 25.6 , which we rounded down to 25 percent . <p> So for each weekend game that Sikes slapped a dinger , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the RF crowd . We used 15 percent for midweek games , since those are n't as crowded as the recorded attendance numbers suggest ( they 're based on tickets sold , not actual attendance -- was n't no damn 6,000 people at a cold Tuesday game against Arkansas State ) . <p> The average student attendance per game comes out to 1,970 , which is right in line with the 2,000 that Ross told us was a normal crowd . <h> 2 . Calculate how many students actually toss their beer . <p> Of course , not everybody in RF participates in the shower ( I 'm looking at you , sorority sisters scampering down the hill like the damn Red Sea is crashing in ) . <p> Fortunately for us , resident athletic department photog Josh McCoy ( who you probably know as @OleMissPix ) , happened to have an epic mid-shower shot from a Sikes homer during last year 's regionals .

Everyone else is in full party mode and you 're bent over like some old woman looking for her keys . This is the point in the Miller High Life ad where the delivery dude comes in and confiscates your beer . <p> Anyway , 71 of those 100 students are beer tossing , which will be our assumed rate on any given dinger . Take 71 percent of the total 31,525 student attendance and we get 25,558 participating students . <h> 3 . Determine the amount of beer each student is throwing . <p> You know what sucks ? When you 've just finished pouring a fresh brew and Sikes goes and slaps a dinger on you . You do n't want to wast a full beer -- you probably just blew $100 bucks at the Square last night and you 're already on the verge of asking your folks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't . Screw it , you got ta throw . <p> Some folks might have a freshly-poured Solo Cup 's worth of booze , while other folks might be down to their last few sips . So we 'll just take the midpoint mark and say that on average , each cup in RF had 6 ounces in it ( remember , its half of a 12-ounce can , not a 14-ounce Solo Cup ) . But when we think about it , nobody is showering with an empty cup , so let 's instead set our anchor points at 1 ounce and 12 ounces . Pull the median of that and we get 6.5 ounces . <h> The amount of beer Sikes has wasted equals ... <p> 576 cases ( 24 pack ) . According to a local beer distributor , that 's roughly the amount that a bar in Oxford goes through during a football weekend . <p> If you bought that many cases from the gas station at $20 a case , you 'd spend $11,537 . <p> The weight in pounds of 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oz cans . If you stacked all of those on top of each other , they would reach over a mile into the sky -- double the height of the world 's tallest building , the Burj Khalifa . <p> At 4.2 percent abv ( we 're talking about Natty , Keystone and Coors here ) , that 's enough beer to get every frat bro on campus legally drunk . ( Technically its four beers per male in an hour sitting , but I went with five beers because this is Ole Miss . ) " Nah dude , I 'm good to drive .

@@87888081 @3388081/ <h> A lawyer explains the Laremy Tunsil assault case <h> Hugh Freeze claims that his star lineman was simply defending his mother when he punched his stepdad last week . To find out how the legal system typically handles this kind of incident , we got on the phone with an Ole Miss law professor . <p> Ever since Laremy Tunsil was arrested last Friday for assaulting his stepdad , there 's been a lot of moral discourse over what he should or should n't be able to do in defense of his mother . What 's been largely absent from the conversation is what the law does or does n't allow him to do in defense of his mother . So to get a sense of how the legal system usually handles this type of case , we spoke with Ronald Rychlak , an Ole Miss law professor and the Faculty Athletics Representative . <p> We 're still waiting on the official police report to provide more details , but here 's a quick refresher on what we know about the incident : <p> 1 . Tunsil turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence misdemeanor after allegedly assaulting his stepdad , Lindsey Miller . <p> 2 . Hugh Freeze claimed in a statement that Tunsil was acting in defense of his mother . An unnamed source told ESPN that Miller pushed Tunsil 's mother and that Tunsil responded by punching him . <p> 3 . Miller has denied that account , telling The Clarion-Ledger that he did not push his wife , but that Tunsil instigated an argument and then assaulted him . Miller has pressed charges against Tunsil . <p> To be clear , Professor Rychlak is not privy to any inside information on this case , and is speaking generally about how the law deals with this sort of incident . <h> Tunsil is allowed by law to defend his mother <p> Just as any person has the right to use self-defense to fend off an aggressor , any third party can defend another person from being attacked . <p> " In most circumstances , " Rychlak explained , " a third party can step in and come to your defense . " <p> There is a stipulation , though : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the person who steps in and the original person who was being attacked . Fortunately for Tunsil , he 's covered . <p> " Certainly a son-mother would satisfy any requirement there , " Rychlak said . <h> ... but only to an extent <p> That does n't mean you can go beat the hell out of somebody just because they pushed your mom . <p> " You 're allowed to use the amount of force that 's being used against you , " explained Rychlak . " Whether it 's self-defense or defense of another , once the original person who was being attacked ( or the person that stepped in to defend them ) gains the upper hand and stops the attack , they 're supposed to stop too . The original victim can not proceed to pummel the original attacker . " <p> That 's where Tunsil 's case gets tricky . The unnamed source in ESPN 's report simply said that " Laremy punched Miller , " but Miller told The Clarion-Ledger that Tunsil punched him six or seven times . So if it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that mean he used excessive force ? <p> " You ca n't at all assume that , " said Rychlak . " It 's highly possible that the stepdad was fighting back for the first five punches and then stopped after the sixth . " <h> It likely comes down to " he said , she said " <p> According to Rychlak , third-party defense cases are fairly common . For instance , two guys might get into a fight over a girl and then one or both may claim to be defending her . <p> " Sometimes that 's pretty clearly the case and sometimes it 's clear that it is n't the case , that it was made up later . It can be a long process to get the facts clear . ... The biggest problem here is figuring out who was truly the aggressor , who started it and why it happened . All of those things are kind of hard to get to the bottom of and they 're usually conflicting accounts . " <p> When cases like these go to trial -- which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down to who is the more credible party . <h> Witnesses are key <p> The only confirmed witness we have is Tunsil 's mother , who we assume will back up her son 's account . Two of Miller 's sons were listed on the restraining order requested by Miller against Tunsil , but there 's no clear indication that they were on hand for the incident . <p> While Rychlak says more witnesses are usually an advantage , " the courts always have to assess the credibility when it 's a family relationship between the party and the witness . " <p> People will assuredly lie to protect their family , which inherently throws doubt on any testimony from Tunsil 's mom or Miller 's sons , if they were present . <p> So when it comes to witnesses , " it 's not strictly a numbers game . " <h> So how does all of this turn out ? <p> That of course depends on the details of the police report and the perceived credibility of the parties involved . But as the defendant , Tunsil has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony and light on facts . <p> " The prosecution always has the burden of proof , " said Rychlak . " When accusations are made , they have to be proven by the party that made them . " <p> At the end of the day , it comes down to this : if the court believes that either Miller was posing no danger to his wife ( remember , he claims he never pushed her ) or that Tunsil used excessive force while defending her , the charges will stick . If not , they 'll be dropped . The third option , of course , is that Tunsil pleads to a lesser charge and all of this goes away quietly .

Ole Miss Athletic Director Ross Bjork , because he 's the man . <p> @RedCupRebellion 3,000 is the maximum capacity . A normal crowd in RF is around 2,000 ..... <p> From that , we 're able to calculate an answer to the question " Of any given home crowd , what percentage is in Right Field ?

Can anybody on this team run block as a offensive guard ? <h> Cornerbacks <p> Dave Wommack has always espoused a " best 11 guys " approach on defense , and nowhere is that more evident than in the secondary . The Rebels return three exceptional veteran starters ( Mike Hilton , Trae Elston , and Tony Conner ) , a versatile veteran backup ( Chief Brown ) four talented freshmen lettermen ( CJ Hampton , Kendarius Webster , AJ and CJ Moore ) , two JUCO superstars ( Tee Shepard and Tony Bridges ) , and some exciting depth guys ( Kailo Moore , Carlos Davis , Derrick Jonesmaybe ? ) . Out of that group of 13 , there are very few who are limited to one position . Mike Hilton 's versatility is unparalleled ... Tee Shepard and Chief Brown have both been mentioned as possible Huskies ... Tony Conner could move to Rover or Stinger LB ... Trae Elston or Tony Bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well shuffle around ... the possibilities are staggering . <p> In my wild-ass-guess of an opinion , the first domino in getting the secondary sorted out is the 4-way battle at the cornerback positions . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've heard that Tony Bridges and Tee Shepard are going to lock down the starting corner spots . I guess that 's possible , but Mike Hilton was arguably the best #2 cornerback in the country last year , and Kendarius Webster was the best freshman I can remember at his position since I 've been watching Ole Miss football . Those guys are going to be hard to unseat . Once the situation at cornerback is sorted out , it 's anyone 's guess as to how the rest of the positions might be affected . Just for a minute though , let 's sit back and appreciate the fact that four SEC-caliber athletes are going to compete for the starting cornerback positions at Ole Miss . It 's been a while since that happened . <p> **Late edit : Just as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press conference that Mike Hilton will start out Spring practice at safety . Well , fuck a duck. ** <p> Offensive Guards <p> So I just got done describing an exciting position battle involving perhaps the best , deepest unit on the team . This is different than that . <p> Offensive guard has been perhaps the most-maligned unit on the Ole Miss roster for the past two seasons ; running between the tackles has been mostly disastrous since midway through the 2013 season , and that deficiency has immeasurably affected offensive production as a whole . <p> The good news is that the talent level of the group as a whole should be much higher because of Javon Patterson alone . While he 's just a Freshman , the word is that he arrives in better shape , and with a more game-ready set of skills than Rod Taylor did last year . Being enrolled for Spring practice is a huge boon for Patterson as well . While it will be interesting to see what Sims and Frigo contribute this spring , you 've got to think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell , Taylor , and Patterson . <h> Linebacker <p> No bones about it : the linebacker position has been absolutely ravaged by graduation . The top 3 linebackers in terms of snaps and tackles are all gone , leaving a newly-recovered Denzel Nkemdiche as the only returner with a start under his belt . <p> That 's not to say that there is n't potential for a good linebacking unit this year-- just a lot of uncertainty . Ole Miss does return a fair amount of athleticism at the position , and also adds at least two new bodies for the Spring . In addition to adding Terry Caldwell , a rangy and active JUCO linebacker , Hugh Freeze announced that CJ Johnson would be moving to Mike linebacker for Spring drills . Though Freeze 's comments on the switch seemed tentative , it could be a terrific move . CJ has always stuck me as a player with alarming speed for his defensive end position , and a frame more suited for a linebacker ( his high school position ) than a lineman . <p> Johnson will add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an interesting battle at Mike linebacker between Christian Russell and Demarquis Gates . Russell has the most returning experience of anyone outside of Denzel Nkemdiche , and has good size and speed for an SEC run-stopper . Gates has perhaps the higher ceiling , but also has a longer , lighter frame at about 6 ' 2 , 215 ; maybe not ideal for facing power rushing teams . It will be interesting to see whether Gates is placed at one linebacker position to compete for a starting spot , or perhaps learns both spots as a valuable reserve . <p> Coaches have also indicated that Tayler Polk ( apparently that 's how his name is spelled ? ) could find his way into the rotation more regularly this year . As a redshirt Freshman walk-on , Polk was called on to fill in for Serderius Bryant after Bird 's ejection from the Boise State game . Polk appeared to do a lot of impressive things for a guy who probably did n't realistically plan on playing in that game . <h> Running Backs <p> Ole Miss lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two transfers were probably encouraged to some degree , both Mathers and Dodson were good runners with roles on the team ... just not the roles they wanted . And while Jaylen Walton will stand largely unchallenged atop the depth chart , Jordan Wilkins and Akeem Judd look to duke it out as the primary " big back , " while Eugene Brazley tries to carve out some niche for himself . <p> The battle between Judd and Wilkins is particularly interesting , because it 's so hard to know what either player can do at this point . Obviously , Akeem Judd was redshirted last year ; apparently , coaches wanted him totally healed from a foot injury that hampered his second season of Junior College . But I 'm not even sure we have a great idea of Wilkins ' abilities , given the weak play at Guard last season . Whomever emerges between Judd and Wilkins will certainly have an important role in getting the Rebels ' running game back on track , and will have a leg up on holding off contributions from incoming Freshman Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offensive Guard is anything but certain , the race to establish some depth at Tackle should be an absolute free-for-all . With superstar Laremy Tunsil out for the Spring , lots of guys will get lots of snaps at both Tackle positions . What 's unclear is if anyone is in position to make the coaches confident in their ability to spell Tunsil , or to push Fahn Cooper for his starting spot . <p> Cooper was far from consistent last year , contributing some real quality starts against good competition , only to be baffled and abused at other points during the season . While it 's possible that Cooper suffered from the same growing pains that many JUCO transfers experience , coaches will surely be keeping an eye on guys like Jeremy Liggins , Robert Conyers , Davion Johnson , Christian Morris , and Sean Rawlings . In my opinion it 's paramount to the success of the team moving forward that a couple of those five guys end up providing good depth this year , and end up as quality starters in the future . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead and say that I did ... ) , it 's that this looks like a talented , versatile SEC team , but one with a lot of variables in play . Analyzing position battles was n't so much " Player X competing with Player Y for the starting spot at Position Z " as it was " Players X and Y will compete at Position Z unless player X can move to Position W because Player Q is also great at Position Z ... " There are a lot of moving parts , but I think the coaches finally have access to the depth they need to really compete on a consistent basis . Of course , another exciting thing about Spring football is the surprises that invariably come out of left field , so stay tuned when we talk about Kailo Moore starting at running back , Kendrick Doss unseating Trae Elston at Rover , or whatever ... it 's gon na be awesome .

Which will Ole Miss see on Saturday ? <p> Georgia probably wo n't roll into Oxford on a bus made to look like a golf cart or a scooter that someone will eventually crash , but they will arrive with a 3-0 record and a number 12 ranking . Still , the Bulldogs have n't exactly overwhelmed their middling competition " the three-headed monster of North Carolina , Nicholls State , and Missouri " during the early portion of their season . <p> The 33-24 win over North Carolina game was a struggle deep into the fourth quarter , ditto for two-point win over Nicholls State , and Georgia needed five turnovers and a touchdown in the last two minutes to beat Mizzou by a single point . A generous assessment of their season so far is that they remain a work in progress ( ARE N'T WE ALL THOUGH ) . <p> What 's interesting about their wins* is that they relied almost exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of freshman quarterback Jacob Eason to get by Missouri . There was no blend of offense in either of these games . <p> *For the record that I know you 're keeping , I did n't look at the Nicholls State game because , despite evidence to the contrary , I make attempts to value my time . So either Georgia truly is terrible or they spent all week not preparing for the Colonels . <p> Against North Carolina , the Bulldogs leaned on the run , most likely due to a combination of 1 ) having some guy named Nick Chubb ( IS HE GOOD ? ) at running back , 2 ) Greyson Lambert playing quarterback ( it was Jacob Eason 's first game ) , and 3 ) facing a Tar Heel defense that surrendered 3,463 rushing yards in 14 games last season ( 247 yards/game ; Houston Nutt 's 2011 team gave up 225 rushing yards/game ) . Here 's how their play selection broke down in the first game : <p> The math tells us that Georgia ran the dang ball 72 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they piled up 289 rushing yards . But two weeks later against Missouri with a true freshman making his first SEC start , the Bulldogs flipped everything around . <p> They only ran it on 41 percent of their total plays ( 101 rushing yards ) , which had something to do with Missouri 's defense being much better than North Carolina 's and a quarterback with REAL ARM TALENT , TOM . The 55 pass plays netted 308 yards and a very blah 5.6 yards per attempt , but they made enough plays on short-ish throws that allowed them to move the ball on Missouri 's defense . <p> Two very different ways to offense , but Georgia had some effectiveness with both . So what do the versions of the Georgia offense look like ? A great question , dear reader ! <h> The RUN THE DANG BALL version of Georgia <p> Without getting into the weeds of blocking schemes and all the boring stuff that is vital to any team winning games against good teams , Nick Chubb is an outstanding running back . Had I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every carry he has ( note : I will when they play Tennessee ) . <p> In preparing for this post , I was expecting to watch multiple Chubb runs and provide several examples of what makes him so good . Mercifully for me ( and you to some degree ) , the first play of the game against North Carolina showed us everything we need to see . <p> The Tar Heels put eight men in the box , and 10 men within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage . <p> The play is designed to go left , specifically with Chubb following the center , who is pulling and charging through the area where the left guard was ( LG blocked down ) . But Chubb also has the option to bounce it outside if things inside do n't work out . <p> Within a flash , Chubb can tell he has room inside , picks his spot , and accelerates into the line . <p> Now that he 's through the line of scrimmage , he never stops looking down the field and sees his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This time , he sticks his right foot in the ground and cuts back to the left , which takes the safety out of contention for making a play . <p> Now he 's one-on-one against a cornerback and cuts back up the field into the cornerback , challenging him to make a tackle . <p> Let 's watch via the magic of moving pictures . <p> The play only gained six yards , but within those six yards you saw Chubb 's vision , acceleration , ability to change direction easily , and power . In fact , Georgia ran a version of that play on second down and Chubb picked up 13 of his 222 yards ( on 32 carries ) . <p> In short simplicity , the RUN THE DANG BALL version of the Georgia offense involves blocking for Chubb as best they can and letting him do the rest . And if the defense ca n't stop it , why try anything else . <h> The Sling It , Jacob Eason version of Georgia <p> If a defense proves it is capable of stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Mizzou ) , Kirby Smart is fine with letting Eason air it out . Of course , as long as said airing out is done in a conservative ( ALABAMA ) manner . <p> Take a look at this pass chart from Eason 's periodic appearances against North Carolina ( X 's and O 's mark where the pass was thrown ; additional yards could 've been gained after a completion ) . <p> Of his 12 throws , only four went beyond 10 yards and five were behind the line of scrimmage , most of which were the jet sweep pass to Isaiah McKenzie , who is a terror in the open field . <p> Against North Carolina and Missouri , Georgia wore this play out . It 's safe , easy , and gets the ball in the hands of dude who is very hard to tackle ( after review , that play to McKenzie was called a touchdown ) . <p> Of course , you do n't recruit and sign ( if this were a non-Ole Miss site writing about Ole Miss , we 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America and not let him show off the arm . <p> SURE . <p> Eason 's final stats looked something like this : <p> Behind the line of scrimmage : 5-5 , 65 yards , 1 TD <p> 0-10 yards : 2-3 , 15 yards <p> 11-20 yards : 0-1 <p> 31-40 yards : 1-3 , 51 yards <p> As mentioned earlier , Nick Chubb was unable to tear apart Missouri , which led to Eason cutting it loose 55 times . Even though he threw 55 times , take a look at where his throws went . <p> LET THE SHORT THROWS WASH OVER YOU . <p> Had Missouri not been so awful at challenging these short passes and making tackles after completions , Eason 's yardage numbers would 've been cut by at least a third . Observe these stats . <p> Behind the line of scrimmage : 5-7 , 27 yards <p> 0-10 yards : 19-32 , 178 yards , 1 TD , 1 INT <p> 11-20 yards : 5-8 , 103 yards , 2 TDs <p> 21-30 yards : 0-5 <p> 31-40 yards : 0-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 of his 55 passes were thrown either behind the line of scrimmage or within 10 yards of it , and he still threw for 308 yards . MAKE A GALL DARN TACKLE , TIGERS . <p> Even though Eason was confined to Smart 's conservative nature , here 's him letting you know he can make just about any throw . <p> Was that good ? <p> For Ole Miss on Saturday , it would be ideal if they could prevent Georgia from blending the two Georgias together . The idea of Jacob Eason throwing 55 times seems somewhat acceptable , but Ole Miss and soft coverage has ( AHEM ) been an issue at one point during the season . <p> If Georgia is able to blend away , Ole Miss would need Chad Kelly and friends to stay on the gas for four hours and see if the scoreboard at Vaught-Hemingway could explode from something other than daytime fireworks.

@@87888175 @3388175/ <h> Here 's what losing 12 scholarships over 3 years could mean for Ole Miss football <h> To gauge the impact of the Rebels ' proposed self-induced penalties , we looked back at the which players would have been left off of Hugh Freeze 's previous recruiting classes . Yep , that includes Cody Core . <p> When Ole Miss responded to the NCAA 's Notice of Allegations , it proposed several self-imposed sanctions . The most significant of these is the loss of four scholarships per year for three years . There 's more to it than that , as Ole Miss would like to count back some of the " self-imposed " roster room it kept last year and this year , but suffice it to say , four is the magic number Ole Miss administrators have proposed . <p> ( It should also be noted that this is just what Ole Miss is self-imposing -- the NCAA may well tack on additional scholarship reductions when it finally announces its punishment . ) <p> So what does 12 scholarships over three years really mean ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football program is only able to place twenty-five new players on scholarship every year . It does n't matter whether they come to Oxford from high school , junior college , or another NCAA institution . Secondly , they can only have 85 players on scholarship in any given year . <p> This reduction would lower the yearly total to 21 new players each year and lower the overall total to 81 . So does that really make a difference ? <h> To get a sense of the impact , I looked at the four lowest-rated players in each of Hugh Freeze 's signing classes . <p> Let 's imagine these guys were scholarship cuts and never ended up on campus . <p> This is a very inexact approach for several reasons . <p> It assumes the recruiting sites ( I used the 247Composite rankings ) have similar evaluations to the Ole Miss coaches . For instance , I know Ole Miss coaches liked defensive back Zedrick Woods from the beginning of the 2016 recruiting cycle , but he 's on this list because the recruiting sites did not rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account positional need or who got last-second offers when things went south with higher rated prospects . Some of these guys would have been offered over higher-rated prospects because they filled a position of need ( lookin at you , linebackers ) . <p> Ole Miss did n't sign 25 players every season ( though it 's tough to really know if other players ultimately ended up on scholarship who were n't picked up by the recruiting services ) , so there are potentially players at the end of this list who could have conceivably made the cut . <p> The purpose of this exercise is n't to provide an exact list of prospects . More generally , it seeks to provide an idea of the caliber of player that typically fills out the bottom of a given class and who could conceivably be left out if Ole Miss had four fewer scholarships to offer . <p> Players are listed from lowest to highest , with their national position rank in parentheses . <p> 2016 <p> Tariquious Tisdale ( 3-star , No. 52 WDE ) <p> Jack Defoor ( 3-star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No. 37 RB ) <p> Chandler Tuitt ( 3-star , No. 23 OG ) <p> 2015 <p> Shawn Curtis ( 3-star , No. 140 OLB ) <p> Zedrick Woods ( 3-star , No. 69 OLB ) <p> Terry Caldwell ( 3-star , No. 6 JUCO OLB ) <p> Montrell Custis ( 3-star , No. 74 CB ) <p> 2014 <p> Alex Weber ( 2-star , No. 330 WR ) <p> C.J.

He racked up 1,202 yards and 10 touchdowns over his junior and senior seasons and was often a receiver who made big plays when Ole Miss needed them . <p> Sean Rawlings was a stabilizing force as a freshman at right tackle during Laremy Tunsil 's seven-game suspension . <p> John Youngblood has provided solid depth over his three years as a reserve defensive end and recently won the Chucky Mullins Award . <p> Zedrick Woods carved out a role in the secondary late last season and figures to compete for a starting safety job as a sophomore . <p> Overall though , this reduction theoretically would n't make a huge difference .

@@87888177 @3388177/ <h> Hugh Freeze 's Ole Miss Offense Through Three Years <p> When Hugh Freeze was hired , after misguided initial shock and dismay ( myself included ) fans developed an expectation that he would be an offensive coach . He would n't have much success or innovation defensively ( particularly after such a " bush league " defensive coordinator hire LOL ) , but on the other side of the ball , the team would move quickly , spreading the ball around and making things difficult for defenses . The Rebels returned more offensive playmakers than many coaches and fans realized , and the signing of Bo Wallace would put a player under center who could generally get the ball to them . <p> Last year 's Ole Miss defense was , in terms of points allowed , the best in the SEC and in the top five in the entirety of Division I. So that was a recipe for success , right ? Great defense ? Offensive-minded coach who understands new concepts with a third-year starter at quarterback ? Well , yes and no . Which season would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest sheer offensive output ? Second largest ? Let 's take a look . <h> The Data <p> As you can see , that first season was actually alright , in terms of overall production . Then things got even better in year two , with offensive output jumping by over 600 yards . Rushing and passing totals were trending up , and the Rebels were n't believed to be losing anyone on offense who was irreplaceable . Their best player , Donte Moncrief , was at least a wide receiver , of which the Rebels had plenty . <p> But the next year , 2014 , production dropped considerably , yielding the lowest output of any season under Hugh Freeze . Why is that ? Well , one reason is the list of opponents the Rebels faced . Three of Ole Miss ' non-conference opponents won at least nine games . That was n't the case in past years , as the Rebels generally faced an easy non-conference schedule other than Texas . Another reason though , is a little more glaring . <p> Ole Miss has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The passing attempt increase in 2013 offset it , but in 2014 , passing attempts were back down , and rushing attempts were down over by 75 over the course of the year . To put that number in perspective , Jordan Wilkins had just 52 attempts last season as the team 's second leading rusher . His rushing attempts could have doubled , and the team total would have still been lower than it was in Freeze 's first year as head coach . <p> So the attempts were lower , yielding lower results . Several times during the season , Freeze talked about how the defense was so good that he was taking a more cautious approach in offensive playcalling , and the number bear that out . So maybe that 's not a good barometer by which to judge whether the offense has improved during Freeze 's tenure ( with the same quarterback starting all three years ) . <p> " Why is this chart black when the others are white , " you may ask . That 's because you 're a racist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty easy for Ole Miss fans to understand . In 2012 , the field was wide open . There was a decent offensive line ( which never suffered an injury ) , and the team was behind a lot . They were airing it out and trying to get in as many plays as possible . In 2013 , the passing game heavily relied on bubble screens to Laquon Treadwell and Donte Moncrief , lowering the yards per passing attempt . There were fewer designed runs for Bo Wallace , since Barry Brunetti would often come in to run those plays . The yards per rushing attempt increased , and everything seemed like it was going to continue clicking . Aside from Moncrief and receiver Ja-Mes Logan , the only thing the offense lost were " replaceable " offensive linemen . <p> Then things started moving in the other direction . Ole Miss had a slew of long runs against bad teams ( and Mississippi State ) that skewed the yards per rush , but even then the Rebels ' total was down . The passing game got away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the receivers to block well enough to mirror the success of 2013 . Essentially , the Rebels reached a point later in the year where they could n't run behind a bad offensive line and could n't throw screens to act like a running game . When Laquon Treadwell went down with an injury , there was very little the offense could do effectively , and it showed in the Rebels ' 30-0 loss to Arkansas and shellacking by TCU in the Peach Bowl . They were one-dimensional , and Bo Wallace ( who I like a lot ) is n't consistent enough on obvious passing downs to make up for that . <p> So what can Ole Miss fans expect this season ? Who knows ? I wish I had an answer . Freeze has seemingly operated with three different offensive approaches within the same overarching shotgun-option style each year . I for one hope that this year 's approach is n't the slow-paced offense we saw last season , as I think the key to the Ole Miss running game is speed and misdirection . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to spend too much time on the field early in the game when the offense goes three and out a lot . It 's a balancing game . <p> Hugh Freeze 's job is to figure it out . It 's one he 's paid more than four million dollars a year to do . He 'll probably spend a little time working on it .

Most of the Ole Miss fan base has never heard of Alex - he was never mentioned during National Signing Day coverage of the past couple of years , nor has he played a down of football in a Rebel uniform - yet he 's an important member of this program moving forward . <p> That 's because he 's left tackle Laremy Tunsil 's brother , and his securing a scholarship is reportedly a part of a " package deal " so to speak offered to Tunsil and Weber by coach Hugh Freeze two years ago .

This is a move , however , that is n't particularly unprecedented ( again , look at Denzel Nkemdiche 's recruitment ) , nor is it against any sort of NCAA rules . Some could argue that it 's unethical to give a scholarship to someone in lieu of someone else who is perhaps more deserving based on his high school production or athletic abilities , and I could perhaps see that argument if this were a case where Laremy Tunsil was n't a potential all-SEC offensive tackle .

@@87888190 @3388190/ <h> Hugh Freeze 's Ole Miss Offense Through Three Years <p> When Hugh Freeze was hired , after misguided initial shock and dismay ( myself included ) fans developed an expectation that he would be an offensive coach . He would n't have much success or innovation defensively ( particularly after such a " bush league " defensive coordinator hire LOL ) , but on the other side of the ball , the team would move quickly , spreading the ball around and making things difficult for defenses . The Rebels returned more offensive playmakers than many coaches and fans realized , and the signing of Bo Wallace would put a player under center who could generally get the ball to them . <p> Last year 's Ole Miss defense was , in terms of points allowed , the best in the SEC and in the top five in the entirety of Division I. So that was a recipe for success , right ? Great defense ? Offensive-minded coach who understands new concepts with a third-year starter at quarterback ? Well , yes and no . Which season would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest sheer offensive output ? Second largest ? Let 's take a look . <h> The Data <p> As you can see , that first season was actually alright , in terms of overall production . Then things got even better in year two , with offensive output jumping by over 600 yards . Rushing and passing totals were trending up , and the Rebels were n't believed to be losing anyone on offense who was irreplaceable . Their best player , Donte Moncrief , was at least a wide receiver , of which the Rebels had plenty . <p> But the next year , 2014 , production dropped considerably , yielding the lowest output of any season under Hugh Freeze . Why is that ? Well , one reason is the list of opponents the Rebels faced . Three of Ole Miss ' non-conference opponents won at least nine games . That was n't the case in past years , as the Rebels generally faced an easy non-conference schedule other than Texas . Another reason though , is a little more glaring . <p> Ole Miss has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The passing attempt increase in 2013 offset it , but in 2014 , passing attempts were back down , and rushing attempts were down over by 75 over the course of the year . To put that number in perspective , Jordan Wilkins had just 52 attempts last season as the team 's second leading rusher . His rushing attempts could have doubled , and the team total would have still been lower than it was in Freeze 's first year as head coach . <p> So the attempts were lower , yielding lower results . Several times during the season , Freeze talked about how the defense was so good that he was taking a more cautious approach in offensive playcalling , and the number bear that out . So maybe that 's not a good barometer by which to judge whether the offense has improved during Freeze 's tenure ( with the same quarterback starting all three years ) . <p> " Why is this chart black when the others are white , " you may ask . That 's because you 're a racist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty easy for Ole Miss fans to understand . In 2012 , the field was wide open . There was a decent offensive line ( which never suffered an injury ) , and the team was behind a lot . They were airing it out and trying to get in as many plays as possible . In 2013 , the passing game heavily relied on bubble screens to Laquon Treadwell and Donte Moncrief , lowering the yards per passing attempt . There were fewer designed runs for Bo Wallace , since Barry Brunetti would often come in to run those plays . The yards per rushing attempt increased , and everything seemed like it was going to continue clicking . Aside from Moncrief and receiver Ja-Mes Logan , the only thing the offense lost were " replaceable " offensive linemen . <p> Then things started moving in the other direction . Ole Miss had a slew of long runs against bad teams ( and Mississippi State ) that skewed the yards per rush , but even then the Rebels ' total was down . The passing game got away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the receivers to block well enough to mirror the success of 2013 . Essentially , the Rebels reached a point later in the year where they could n't run behind a bad offensive line and could n't throw screens to act like a running game . When Laquon Treadwell went down with an injury , there was very little the offense could do effectively , and it showed in the Rebels ' 30-0 loss to Arkansas and shellacking by TCU in the Peach Bowl . They were one-dimensional , and Bo Wallace ( who I like a lot ) is n't consistent enough on obvious passing downs to make up for that . <p> So what can Ole Miss fans expect this season ? Who knows ? I wish I had an answer . Freeze has seemingly operated with three different offensive approaches within the same overarching shotgun-option style each year . I for one hope that this year 's approach is n't the slow-paced offense we saw last season , as I think the key to the Ole Miss running game is speed and misdirection . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to spend too much time on the field early in the game when the offense goes three and out a lot .

@@87888193 @3388193/ <h> Quarterbacks of the Past and Future <p> This can not continue to be our avenue for acquiring quarterbacks . ( Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images ) Getty Images <p> There 's a common theory among college football pundits that a team should sign a quarterback every year . I personally hold that viewpoint as well . While I understand that there can be deviations from that blueprint in some circumstances , I think that ideally we should be signing a high school quarterback every season . Assuming redshirts , this would give us five quarterbacks on campus every year in an ideal world . Assuming a transfer or two , we would still have at least three or four high school quarterbacks on campus . <p> Unfortunately , this has n't been the case for the Rebels . Even when we have signed a high school quarterback , they have generally been underwhelming prospects or fizzled after arriving on campus . Two recent commitments could change all of that . <p> Since Rivals began rating players in 2002 , Ole Miss has signed nine high school quarterbacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed just one . <p> From 2002-2006 , the Rebels signed the following high school quarterbacks : <p> While none of those quarterbacks proved to be SEC starters , at least the sentiment was there .

All the others were physically limited or simply not talented . <p> Orgeron , apparently satisfied with Brent Schaeffer and Seth Adams at quarterback , chose not to sign a quarterback in 2007 . In their defense , they secured Jevan Snead 's transfer before signing day and probably figured they could n't find a freshman to challenge Adams and Schaeffer immediately . <p> Ed Orgeron was fired , having signed two high school quarterbacks .

All of them pursued by other programs ? Then the unthinkable happened . Mackey did n't qualify . Wilkes was drafted in the nineteenth round of the MLB draft and took the money . Only Stanley made it to campus . Three years later , he would transfer , having started just one game . <p> In 2009 , Nutt signed Raymond Cotton , a four-star prospect with several other offers . He was a raw passer who had a high ceiling . That 's not what Nutt needed . Cotton left the team after his redshirt season . In 2010 , we signed no quarterbacks despite having just two on campus . <p> In 2011 , in response to the issue of having two scholarship quarterbacks on campus ( a disgruntled Nathan Stanley , a raw Barry Brunetti , and an inaccurate passer in Randall Mackey ) , Nutt signed a raw junior college player in three-star Zack Stoudt and an even more raw high school quarterback in Maikhail Miller ( who did n't join the team until a year later ) . In Freeze 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace . <p> In the past three years , Ole Miss has signed one high school quarterback . One . Amazingly , we 're not in a good situation at the position .

Kincade attended the Elite 11 Finals and posted the highest score on the mental test and the third-fastest time in the forty-yard dash ( 4.6 seconds ) . Both are incredibly promising players . Obviously , there 's no way to know how successful they will be in college , but a lot of coaches seem to think they 'll play well . <p> It appears we have a coach who finally gets it .

This makes their game next weekend a pretty damn important one in this regard . If State wins , the SEC West is theirs presuming they beat Vanderbilt . If Alabama wins , the SEC West is as up for grabs as it 's ever been . <p> But if the latter happens there are real possibilities that one of four teams could win the SEC Western division , a notion that 's wildly exciting considering that there 's less than a month of regular season football left to be played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as are Texas A&amp;M and LSU who each have three conference losses . So what we are left with are the aforementioned Bulldogs and Tide as well as two-loss Ole Miss and Auburn teams . For Ole Miss to make it to Atlanta , they would need to finish in a situation where they can earn a tiebreaker by virtue of head-to-head wins . This would happen if the following take place : <p> Ole Miss wins out <p> Mississippi State loses to Alabama ( or Vanderbilt , but c'm on ) <p> Auburn loses to Georgia <p> Alabama loses to Auburn <p> If those four things happen , Ole Miss , Mississippi State , and Alabama would all finish with 6-2 SEC records , while Auburn would finish 5-3 and therefore out of the mix . Ole Miss would then win the division based on having beaten both State and Alabama . <p> Circumstances one and two must take place for Ole Miss to advance to the SEC Championship game . Circumstance three does n't have to happen , but if it does n't happen it could mean an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss ' favor . Circumstance four does n't have to happen either , but only if Western Carolina somehow manages to beat the Tide which , I mean , c'm on , why am I even writing this sentence at this point ? They 're not losing that game . Oh , wait , that game does n't matter . They could lose it by a billion and still be in the mix with regards to SEC standings . <p> So , to keep it really simple , what you need to hope happens is this : Alabama and Georgia win next weekend , Ole Miss beats Arkansas the weekend after that , and both Auburn and Ole Miss win the week after that . That would result in an SEC West that finishes thusly : <p> Ole Miss ( 6-2 ) <p> Alabama ( 6-2 ) <p> Mississippi State ( 6-2 ) <p> Auburn ( 5-3 ) <p> LSU , probably ( 5-3 ) <p> Texas A&amp;M , probably ( 4-4 ) <p> Arkansas ( 0-8 ) <p> LSU and Texas A&amp;M are interchangeable depending on how they play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before their season 's up ( please please please not against Ole Miss ) , but what you 're seeing is our dream scenario .

@@87888206 @3388206/ <h> As March bears down , let 's take a look at where the Rebels stand as far as making the Big Dance . <p> With the lion 's share of the SEC schedule under their belt , how is Ole Miss basketball sitting with respect to the Big Dance ? The simple answer is , " They 're in at probably an 8 or 9 seed , " if the season ended today . But , of course , these answers are never simple , and the Rebs ' remaining schedule holds some nasty traps that must be avoided come Selection Sunday . <p> As of the most recent bracket projections released Monday , ESPN pits Ole Miss as a favored 8-seed against Iowa , while CBSSports and USA Today slot the Rebels in a 9-seed against Temple . The recently snapped six-game win streak has certainly helped the Rebels concretize their place on most projected brackets , and their precarious 10-seed spot two weeks ago feels like ancient history at this point . And further , Ole Miss has clambered 18 spots up the NCAA RPI rankings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55th on January 24 to 37th Monday . Helluva run , boys . <h> Ole Miss in the RPI <p> There 's some existential " do numbers really mean anything at all " anxiety when rating teams ' quality down the stretch , and analytical metrics all mean squat on a long enough timeline . Still , RPI does factor into the selection committee 's decisions , so let 's look at Ole Miss ' current RPI and the four teams on either side of the Rebels ( I 've here included the most recent NCAA calculation and ESPN/Joe Lundardi 's ) : <p> Ole Miss in the RPI <p> NCAA RPI Rankings <p> ESPN/Joe Lunardi RPI Rankings <p> Texas <p> St. John 's <p> Ohio State <p> Ohio State <p> Cincinnati <p> Michigan State <p> Michigan State <p> UMass <p> ( 37 ) <p> Ole Miss <p> ( 38 ) <p> UCLA <p> Cincinnati <p> UMass <p> UCLA <p> Xavier <p> Xavier <p> St. John 's <p> Illinois <p> The teams clustering around Ole Miss -- and thus fighting for the same handful of spots on the bracket -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati sure seems helpful now . Looking over the Rebels ' other big non-conference wins , Oregon 's RPI is currently 60th ( NCAA ) and 61st ( ESPN ) , while Creighton has dive-bombed down to 130th and 125th . As far as Ole Miss ' current projected matchups in the tournament , Iowa is 56th in the NCAA RPI ( 55th at ESPN ) and Temple sits 31st NCAA/33rd ESPN . <p> National RPI is informative as far as it goes , but at this point in the season , it 's better to look at how the Rebs ' RPI stacks up against the six remaining teams on the schedule . <p> RPIs of Remaining Opponents <p> Team <p> NCAA RPI Rank <p> Lunardi/ESPN RPI Rank <p> at Mississippi State <p> 178 <p> 171 <p> Tennessee <p> 83 <p> 80 <p> Georgia <p> 32 <p> 30 <p> at LSU <p> 53 <p> 50 <p> at Alabama <p> 75 <p> 73 <p> Vanderbilt <p> 108 <p> 104 <p> A good rule of thumb at this point in the season is to play well against teams that will seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of distinguishing yourselves from your peers , at least hang tight with the group . Taking a look at Ole Miss ' upcoming RPI opponents , those Georgia and LSU match-ups start to feel mighty important , especially since CBS and ESPN are projecting the Bulldogs as an 8-seed ( USA Today has them at 11 ) and the Tigers are hovering around the 9-10-11 line . As with Arkansas , Georgia 's RPI has been lingering in the five-or-so spots above the Rebels since conference play began , and splitting the season series with both of those teams will hook Ole Miss into the top 40 RPIs on the year . On the other side , LSU has been hovering just below Ole Miss ' RPI for weeks now , and a split series with the Tigers ought to allay suspicions about this Rebel squad playing down to their competition . <p> Barring a collapse at State , and praying for wins against Georgia and LSU , the Rebels could buy themselves some insurance against a possible tanking in Tuscaloosa . <h> Ole Miss in the Sagarin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Ken Pomeroy 's most recent rankings , Ole Miss ' adjusted offense quotient ranks a remarkable 16th ( 114.1 pts. /100 poss. ) , while their adjusted defense quotient comes in at a middling 107th ( giving up 98.7 pts. /100 def. sets ) . Those marks match up inversely with Temple ( 101.0 AdjO , 184th ; 89.7 AdjD , 8th ) and more or less create a push with Iowa ( 111.8 AdjO , 31st ; 97.8 , 94th ) . Here are the KenPom , Sagarin , and ESPN BPI rankings for Ole Miss and the four teams on either side of the Rebels heading into this week : <p> Those Georgia and LSU games keep looming . On Joe Lunardi 's most recent projected bracket , Ole Miss will place into an 8-seed matchup against Iowa , whom KenPom ranks 38th , Sagarin ranks 33rd and BPI has 47th . Jerry Palm at CBSSports , however , likes the Rebels as a 9-seed against Temple ( 47th KenPom , 65th Sagarin , 61st BPI ) . For further comparison ( confusion ? ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the KenPom , Sagarin , and BPI rankings : <p> LSU especially tightens up with the Rebels here , with the result that the Clanga , LSU and Georgia scraps become must-win games . Alabama , too , at least on paper looks dangerous , while Vanderbilt 's inexplicable jump from low 100s in the RPI to either side of 50 in the fancy stats defies belief . Just win , baby . <h> What do the Rebs need to do down the stretch ? <p> Saturday 's barnburner in the Tad Pad does n't seem to have harmed the Rebs as they mosh through February and into the SEC Tournament . Arkansas is legit good this year -- a solid 5-seed at this point -- and their track-meet style of play gains high praise in the eyes of Sunday selectors . So what specifically should one demand from these Rebels down the stretch ? <p> First : Jarvis Summers needs to step up . He practically disappeared during the win streak . His points-per-game average fell from 14.2 to 13.2 -- over the span of just seven outings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over 38 percent of his two-point field goals , which is a long way from the Jarvis of last season who shot just over 50 percent from the floor . Andy Kennedy has described Summers ' trigger finger as " hesitant , " and Saturday night 's dish to Newby while down by one rings indicative of the larger issue . <p> While Summers finds more confidence off the dribble , other Rebel hoopsters must stay the course if this team should find the tournament . Anthony Perez , Dwight Coleby , and Saturday 's Man of the Match M.J. Rhett all need to come strong in Starkville and beyond . The seemingly unbreakable Stefan Moody will continue to do what he does , and trusty old Snoop White , who 's been on a wild tear lately , ought best keep hitting his field goals . <p> Martavious Newby has had some good showings the last couple weeks , and this pitbull of a guard loves to play physical ball . One hopes that his menace to opposing rebounders will thrive against the big , bad LSU 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rebels have only one player underperforming at the moment , and they 've cobbled together some impressive basketball despite Jarvis ' recent troubles . A guy like Summers -- the current active scoring leader in the SEC -- really just needs one night of solid hooping to turn his head around and devote himself to the task at hand , and what better place to do that than in Starkville ?

It obviously would have been nice to land him , and depth at the position could become an issue starting in 2018 , but there 's plenty of reason to expect immediate progression when it comes to running the football .

It might be maddening to see them rely on the charity stripe so heavily , like when they took more free throws than shots from the field the last time they faced Missouri , but they 've made an art form out of it . <p> This season , Ole Miss has made the second most total free throws out of all Division I basketball teams , converting just over 20 per game .

@@87888255 @3388255/ <h> Ole Miss does n't need Cam Akers in order to improve its running game next season <h> Recent history says you do n't need a five-star back to run the ball effectively . <p> The disappointment of in-state running back phenom Cam Akers signing with Florida State over Ole Miss was packaged in layers . It not only served as a decisive litmus test of the recruiting damage rendered by the NCAA investigation , but crushed the hopes of many that he could be the answer to years of inconsistency on the ground under Hugh Freeze . <p> While some may blame the Rebels ' running woes simply on a lack of high-end talent in the backfield , the numbers suggest that having a former five-star back as your primary option is n't a prerequisite for an effective run game .

And let 's not forget that you need more than running backs to build an effective ground game " the Rebels also have plenty of talent on the offensive line . <p> In fact , Ole Miss will have a better mix of talent at running back and offensive line in 2017 than it 's had since Freeze took over , at least according to the recruiting rankings . Here 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redshirted/injured players are not included here . <p> Swinney and Wilkins return from injury and administrative incompetence , respectively .

The back end of the 2015 season proved that a relatively steady line , mobile quarterback , and a decent stable of backs can yield a solid running game , as the Rebels finished 24th in rushing S&amp;P+ that season . <p> In other words , having Cam Akers was never a requirement for improvement on the ground next season . It obviously would have been nice to land him , and depth at the position could become an issue starting in 2018 , but there 's plenty of reason to expect immediate progression when it comes to running the football . Adequate depth , combined with schematic changes brought by new offensive coordinator Phil Longo , will make it hard to accept another dismal year in this regard .

There are some obvious tenets to follow , such as hoping that your guards have peak shooting performances and that theirs have the opposite . The last time Ole Miss pulled off the upset , they shot 47 percent from three and had a +7 turnover margin . <p> As desperate as holding out hope against a group so rich in talent may seem , the Wildcats are still putting things together , and the downside of relying heavily on freshmen has occasionally reared its ugly head . John Calipari has already voiced what he sees as a lack of discipline in his team . <p> Still , there are actionable weaknesses that the Rebels should at least try to exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Box plus/minus is a box score estimate of the points per 100 possessions that a player contributed above a league-average player . <p> Effective field goal percentage adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal . <h> Ole Miss should try to push the pace . <p> While the Rebels have been mostly solid in their halfcourt offense , they 're not likely to experience similar success against Kentucky when things are slowed down . The Wildcats have one of the best non-transition defenses in the nation , allowing an effective field goal percentage of just 42.7 percent in those situations . In transition , on the other hand , that figure has gone up to 55 percent " not terrible , but bad by Kentucky standards . <p> Ole Miss has yet to create much of an advantage when trying to run the floor , as their transition vs. non-transition shooting numbers are essentially the same .

The Rebels could benefit from leaning into this frantic new habit of the Wildcats . <p> For opportunities in transition to even occur , they 'll need to get some stops on the other end , of course . <p> Ole Miss has begun to improve on the initially glaring issue of defending the three , having held both Murray State and South Alabama to under 23 percent from downtown .

The rotation of Ole Miss bigs have actually held their own in this regard , blocking 19 percent of shots at the rim ( 21st ) , so there 's still hope of slowing them down in the paint . <p> Kentucky 's loss to Louisville came partly due to an inability to recognize a trend in poor outside shooting and look for inside options . Monk made just six of 17 , while the frontcourt duo of Wenyen Gabriel and Edrice Adebayo only saw eight shot attempts combined . <p> Perhaps the Wildcats ' current lack of a tight scoring hierarchy results in an off night offensively , and hyper-efficient bigs like Adebayo continue to not get their share of looks .

@@87888273 @3388273/ <h> The possibility of Freeze missing games is n't just a talk radio rumor " it 's a realistic option outlined in a three-year-old NCAA policy . <p> Last week , a CBS Sports writer named Dennis Dodd made waves by telling a radio show in Arkansas that a suspension is " definitely in play " for Hugh Freeze , whose Ole Miss program is awaiting the disciplinary results of an ongoing NCAA investigation . The quote quickly rippled across social media and made its rounds through the college football blogosphere . But Dodd was n't exactly breaking news . You do n't need inside sources to tell you that there is a very real chance that Freeze could miss games over the alleged violations " all you have to do is read the NCAA 's written policy . <p> In 2013 , the NCAA created a new penalty structure that allows it to suspend the head coach of any collegiate sports team for major NCAA violations committed within their program , regardless of whether the head coach was directly aware of the violations . Over the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspend basketball coaches " most notably a nine-game ban for Syracuse 's Jim Boeheim in 2015 " but it 's never been used for a head football coach . Freeze could become the first . <h> The new policy eliminates plausible deniability . <p> The specific rule we 're discussing here is Bylaw 11.1.1.1 , which states that " an institution 's head coach is presumed to be responsible for the actions of all assistant coaches and administrators who report , directly or indirectly , to the head coach . " <p> In a college athletics system in which dirty work is typically done by boosters or other periphery characters in order to insulate the head coach , the NCAA has essentially eliminated the plausible deniability excuse . " I did n't know it was going on " is no longer accepted . Not knowing , the NCAA insists , is itself a failure to monitor and therefore a punishable violation . <p> Under Bylaw 11.1.1.1 , a head coach can be suspended for up to an entire season for Level I violations and up to half a season for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " the severity of the violation(s) committed by his or her staff and/or the coach himself/herself . " <p> Of the nine alleged violations that occurred on Freeze 's watch , four are Level I and two are Level II ( four more Level I violations were attributed to Houston Nutt 's staff , but that obviously wo n't factor into Freeze 's situation ) . Two of those have been challenged by Ole Miss and could potentially be dropped , but that still leaves at least four major infractions . <h> The NCAA does provide a way out , though . <p> The rule also states that " a head coach is presumed responsible for major/Level I and Level II violations occurring within his or her program unless the coach can show that he or she promoted an atmosphere of compliance and monitored his or her staff . " <p> Indeed , we heard Freeze begin to lay the public groundwork for that " atmosphere of compliance " defense during SEC Media Days . <p> " If mistakes were made , we 're held accountable to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for compliance , which I believe we have , " Freeze said . " Again , I do n't get to judge that . We 'll see at the end of the day . I do n't think there 's any head coach at our level that can control everything that happens in this day in time . You can set the tone , but it 's almost impossible that you could control everything . " <p> So how does one go about setting that tone ? The answer to that question is , in typical NCAA fashion , ambiguous . The policy lays out a list of suggested guidelines " stuff like establishing clear lines of communication between athletics and university admins and aggressively investigating any situation that could lead to a violation " but admits that " there is no way to set forth a checklist of items that will in all circumstances prevent a finding . " Essentially , it 's up to the NCAA 's discretion to decide what constitutes an " atmosphere of compliance . " <h> Freeze might have a hard time using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue for Freeze is that he supposedly had direct knowledge of one of the Level I violations . The NOA claims that he knew about a Memphis booster who on multiple occasions transported and fed four recruits from a Memphis high school . Each individual violation is a minor Level III offense " a $12 ride here , $60 worth of food there " but the NCAA lumped all of them together as a single Level I. <p> Ole Miss ' NOA response retroactively acknowledges that the guy was " undoubtedly a booster " who had an impermissible relationship with recruits , but attempts to absolve Freeze by putting the blame on assistant coach Maurice Harris for not properly identifying the relationship as impermissible : " The other coaches ... asked the right questions and relied upon Harris ' understanding of the individual 's relationship with the prospects in determining that there was no violation of NCAA legislation , " the response claims . <p> Even if that is the case , the NCAA can claim that Harris ' mistake was ultimately Freeze 's responsibility . <h> At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell it wants . <p> The reality is that the policy is intentionally written with enough ambiguity to allow the NCAA to interpret a given situation however it wants ( which is , ya know , how the NCAA operates in just about all situations ) . <p> " Please note that the ultimate determination of whether a head coach has exercised proper control over his or her program rests with the Committee on Infractions , " the policy reads , " and a failure to promote an atmosphere of compliance and/or failure to monitor determination will consider the unique facts and circumstances of each case . " <p> It really boils down to this : if the NCAA wants to suspend Freeze , it can probably find a reason to justify it under Bylaw 11.1.1.1.

( Before you ask , yea , we have Chad Kelly on top at quarterback ) . <p> With spring football behind us , we 're busy trying to milk a few fleeting observations all the way into Fall camp . While we wo n't pretend to know much more than the casual observer , what 's abundantly clear is this : Hugh Freeze has done a tremendous job building this roster . Recruiting top-end talent is one thing ( Freeze has done this very well , with some notable misses ) , but building depth requires more vision and patience , especially at a mid-tier SEC school , where 4 star players have n't traditionally lined up to play a reserve role . In a few short years , we 've seen Freeze go from having many back-up quality starters trying to play over their heads for an entire season of SEC football , to having starter-quality backups , eager to get in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at what the depth chart might look like heading into fall camp . This list is compiled based on a combination of past in-season performance , deciphered coachspeak , and observations from the Grove Bowl . Take with as many grains of salt as you desire ... <h> Quarterback <p> Chad Kelly <p> Ryan Buchanan <p> Devante Kincade <p> If I 'm ranking based on Grove Bowl performances alone , I 'd honestly put Kincade ahead of Buchanan . As " in control " as Buchanan looks while standing over center , his passes were put in dangerous places all day ; he just had trouble throwing passes that gave the advantage to his receivers . Buchanan had the worse of the two offensive lines , so that 's not to be discounted . Hugh Freeze 's endorsement of the Frat Cannon can not be overlooked either . <p> Kelly looked great at times , and made some plays that did n't end up counting in the stat line . He certainly gives Ole Miss the most upside , and looks to be the only one with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worth noting , we did n't get to see Buchanan or Kelly run the read-option . We can assume that Kelly has the advantage there , but we do n't know how either compares to Bo Wallace , an extremely underrated runner when healthy . <p> Kincade is a mystery ; I ca n't remember a time where I 've seen him stand in the pocket and deliver a pass . He 's always scrambling , rolling out , or throwing screens . As such , it 's hard to judge him against the other two . I 'd bet that Kincade has a role in the Ole Miss offense as a change of pace guy , something that worked really well with Bo Wallace and Barry Brunetti . <h> Running back <p> Jaylen Walton <p> Akeem Judd <p> Jordan Wilkins <p> Eugene Brazley <p> The running back depth chart is going to be one of the most fluid on the team , along with the wide receivers . Walton will probably get the most snaps in every game , but there will likely be games where both Judd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both look like quality SEC backs , but neither looks good enough to totally displace the other . Brazley may have a hard time getting on the field this year , but may just be good enough to step right in for Walton next year . For the group as a whole , the emphasis on north-south runs this year looks to be paying off nicely . <h> Wide receiver <p> Making a guess here is borderline impossible based on what we 've seen . We can safely assume that Treadwell will get as many snaps as he can handle , then maybe Cody Core , Damore'ea Stringfellow , Quincy Adeboyejo , Markell Pack , and Derrick Jones fight it out from there . It looks like Quintavius Burdette and Dayall Harris might very well be involved , too . That 's a rotation of eight , not including Collins Moore ( who I did n't notice Saturday ) , and not including two incoming top-100 caliber freshmen in Damarkus Lodge and Van Jefferson .

It also looked like he was generally surrounded by three defenders when the ball came his way . Maybe Buchanan was zeroing in on Engram , or maybe he just commands that much attention ? Regardless , he 's far , far ahead of the other two tight ends on this list . <p> Zettergren has been mentioned by coaches several times as a player who could receive decent playing time behind Engram . His touchdown reception was more of a defensive breakdown than a big offensive play , but he certainly looked comfortable catching and running . <p> Epps ' talent has been praised by both players and coaches , though he struggled with some tough catches during the Spring game along with Engram . I 'm giving Zettergren the nod as the No. 2 guy for now , but that could easily change . <p> A final factor to consider is the ever-changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy Liggins play at times as a sixth offensive lineman ?

I do n't know if the coaches would feel comfortable doing that , much less a guy who watched the Grove Bowl on his laptop while making a grilled cheese sandwich . What I can tell you about the offensive line is that , split in half , and down to precisely zero backups , they were able to actually play a football game against one of the deepest defensive lines in the SEC . I do n't know if we can credit the faster tempo , or increased emphasis on **37;198;TOOLONG , but I was really shocked that the offensive line even allowed for a decent scrimmage .

The linebackers arguably have an edge in depth and athleticism compared to last year 's veteran group , but the sheer experience lost makes this position worrisome . <p> The linebackers did n't appear to make a bunch of plays in the Grove Bowl , so it 's hard to single out individuals who may have improved or hurt their stock . To be fair , the same could be said for Ole Miss ' linebackers in general for most of last season . As a group , they collected bunches of tackles , but aside from a Keith Lewis scoop-and-score vs . A&amp;M , it 's hard to think of many huge plays .

The biggest question is n't whether Johnson can make the transition physically -- we know he can run and tackle -- but whether he can adjust mentally to reading and diagnosing plays from an entirely different spot on the field .

A defense can only stand his battering for so long before it starts to give out . <p> But because the Ole Miss offense was piling on points and forcing Bama to play from a pair of 20-plus second-half deficits , Henry never really got the opportunity to get going late .

Remember when I said there were only four times when missed tackles let Henry extend runs ? All four happened in the second half . Check out how Henry 's rushing gains starting picking up down the stretch . <p> This data excludes Henry 's two-yard TD run in the fourth quarter , since the only thing that kept him to two yards was the end zone . <p> At the end of the day , Henry had plenty of success against Ole Miss , but the Rebel defense managed to prevent any gamebreakers and the offense was able to force the ball out of his hands at a point in the game when he typically takes over .

That will certainly take some getting used to , but Liggins should have the size and strength to handle it . <p> Pass blocking , however , is an entirely different animal , one that requires fancy footwork , advanced technique and an in-depth knowledge of pass protection concepts . This is easily the most challenging transition Liggins faces , and it is the main reason that Freeze will probably have to wait until 2017 before he can realistically think about making Big Lig a regular contributor on the O-line .

In terms of facts though , it 's not the most concrete of things , as most of what 's documented is a pretty one-sided version of events .

Normally it would have been Kasen Williams -- a former Parade high school player of the year -- having that kind of dominant game at wideout , but he was injured for the season two weeks before that game , so Stringfellow was seeing more action than usual . The injury to Keith Price and Cyler Miles coming into the game in the second half also helped , as they had worked with each other a ton in practices so there was a greater level of comfort there . <p> I realize it 's beginning to sound like Cassino wrote this article , and I hate to share more direct quotes lest you think I just got really lazy , but his info was too great to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably least well know about the sequence of events is why Stringfellow decided to transfer .

The real factor was that because the incidents were on campus and involving fellow UW students the University itself was going to take some punitive measures against him , in the form of suspending him for the fall quarter and perhaps longer . That would have meant that had Stringfellow wanted to remain a Husky he 'd have had to basically take a year off of football , which is an awful idea for a guy still growing into the college game . <p> So because of university policy effecting all Washington students , Stringfellow had no choice but to sit out a season ( when he would not even be a scholarship player ) .

@@87888340 @3388340/ <h> If you got two quarterbacks , you got none . So what does it mean when you have three ? <p> And you thought Ole Miss had quarterback questions after Dr. Bo 's interception-fest against Boise State . Last Thursday , Vanderbilt made as many quarterback changes as Bo Wallace had interceptions , churning through three signal callers -- then cycling back for a fourth -- during a shockingly bad 37-7 loss to Temple in which their only touchdown came on a botched special teams snap . <p> Vandy spent the offseason evaluating a three-way race for the starting quarterback position , but heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Rebels , they 're already back at square one . New head coach Derek Mason , who looked befuddled at the helm last Thursday , said he does n't plan on making his starter for Saturday public knowledge , which means we likely wo n't find who will be under center until just before game time . <p> Let 's take a look at what went wrong last week and what the Rebs can expect to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doom <p> Nothing looked good for Vandy against Temple , but the quarterback debacle was of particular concern . <p> Sophomore Patton Robinette , who made three starts in place of an injured Austyn Carta-Samuels last season , earned the starting gig out of camp and was the first under center . That lasted all of five drives . After starting 4-of-6 , Robinette was abruptly pulled five minutes into the second quarter . <p> In came Stephen Rivers , the LSU graduate transfer who bolted Baton Rouge after spending two years behind Zach Mettenberger ( he 's also the brother of Philip ) . Rivers looked like he was getting into gear on his third drive , completing three consecutive passes to move into the red zone , then promptly fumbled the ball away . After starting 6-of-9 but failing to lead a scoring drive , he was yanked early in the third quarter . <p> Next in the carousel was redshirt freshman Johnny McCrary , who managed to throw two picks in the span of three attempts and earn a swift exit . With his options exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who finished out the game . <p> Player <p> Snaps <p> Comp/Att <p> Yards <p> Turnovers <p> Patton Robinette <p> 17 <p> 4/6 <p> 38 <p> 0 <p> Stephen Rivers <p> 39 <p> 12/25 <p> 186 <p> 2 <p> Johnny McCrary <p> 6 <p> 0/3 <p> 0 <p> 2 <h> Who starts against the Rebels ? <p> The most likely option is Rivers , who despite his turnover problems , at least had the Commodores moving in the right direction on several drives against Temple ( yes , moving in the right direction counts as a measurement of success in this case ) . <p> " The bar for quarterback play right now would be tougher to limbo under than jump over . " <p> Though he did n't start against Temple , Rivers ended up with 63 percent of the snaps , and it was Rivers , not Robinette , that was reinserted after the McCrary combustion . <p> " Based on what we saw Thursday , Rivers should be the guy , " said Christian De'Andrea from over at Anchor of Gold , who was kind enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only QB to put together any semblance of a rhythm against Temple . " <p> But even if Rivers does earn the start , it 's likely we could end up seeing Robinette at some point in the game , especially if the offense struggles early . This is , after all , the guy that supposedly won the job over the summer and who only got six throws to prove himself in the opener . <h> These guys have to be head cases now , right ? <p> The short answer is I do n't know how they could n't be . Not only did the confounding QB rotation make Mason and his staff look unprepared and panicked , but it surely damaged the confidence of their players . What kind of message does it send to Robinette to take his job after less than a half ? How good can Rivers feel if he 's given the start knowing he 's already been benched once before ? <p> Christian thinks it 's a damaging practice . <p> I do n't know if the coaches are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea what to do with the quarterback carousel that was on display Thursday .

While I like the idea that players like McCrary are getting a shot , I do n't see how facing an ultra-short leash is going to build confidence in a group that had very limited starting experience heading into the season . <h> What it means for the Rebel D <p> Meanwhile , an Ole Miss defense that tallied three sacks and four interceptions against Boise State is probably giddy . Vandy 's quarterback problems were compounded by an offensive line that , according to Christian , " failed to keep Temple at bay and looked like a group of true freshmen rather than the veterans they are . " Robert Nkemdiche and C.J. Johnson are a whole different sort of problem , so whoever 's behind center may not get much time to throw . <p> The good news for Vandy is that there 's not much room to go anywhere but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a much tougher test for Vanderbilt 's quarterbacks , but I 'm not sure things are going to get much worse . If one of our quarterbacks leads a scoring drive then that will count as " improved .

This was disappointing considering that the ground attack , bolstered by a deep stable of capable backs and a promising pair of young offensive guards , was supposed to improve this season . <p> In Saturday 's 48-28 win over Memphis , the ground game finally realized its potential . Subtracting a lone sack , the Rebels gobbled up 268 rushing yards , averaging 6.2 yards per carry .

Akeem Judd romped for 108 on 15 totes ( 7.2 yards per carry ) , but the real surprise was Eugene Brazley , who averaged 9.2 yards per carry while racking up 124 yards and two touchdowns . Twelve of his 13 carries and every bit of his yardage came in the second half , which played a critical role in Ole Miss ' ability to salt away a lead that dwindled to as little as six at one point in the third quarter . <p> Who knew Brazley had moves like this ? <p> Check out how much more effective Brazley and Judd were against Memphis compared to the rest of the season : <h> So was this a sign of genuine progress or simply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three reasons to think it 's the former . <h> 1 . Memphis has been good against the run this season . <p> According to SB Nation 's Bill Connelly , the Tigers came into Saturday night as the No. 8 team in the country in defensive rushing success rate . Though susceptible to big plays ( 122nd in rushing isoPPP ) , they 'd still held their first three opponents to 3.7 yards per carry and had n't allowed any of them to go over 125 yards . Memphis also ranked in the top 11 in opportunity rate and stuff rate ( runs stopped at or behind the line of scrimmage ) . <p> Sure , those first three opponents were an FCS school and bad Kansas and Bowling Green teams . But ... <h> 2 . A nearly identical Memphis defense was also good against the run last season . <p> The Tigers returned four linebackers with at least 20 tackles ( though Jackson Dillon , who bragged about knocking Robert Nkemdiche unconscious last year , missed Saturday 's game with an injury ) and all but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's team rank a decent 48th in rushing S&amp;P+ . More significantly , they helped limit Ole Miss to just 1.7 yards per carry and make the Rebels one-dimensional during the Liberty Bowl upset . <h> 3 . Ole Miss was also a lot better on the ground against Georgia last week . <p> The offensive line made major strides against Georgia , demonstrating stability and breathing life into what had been an inconsistent running game before this week . Contrary to what many ( including myself ) had feared , Hugh Freeze did n't have to revert to a one-dimensional air raid after all . <p> While Ole Miss certainly benefited from facing a less formidable opponent up front , it 's not crazy to believe that their success running the ball can be sustained throughout the season . A line that is beginning to find its long-term rotation should continue to build cohesion and provide even more opportunities for a capable backfield . <p> Paired with the Georgia game , the Memphis game shows a pattern of improvement . ( I did n't bother including numbers for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> *We only used the first three quarters of the Georgia game . The rushing success rate dropped to 40 percent after the backups came in during garbage time . <h> No , you should n't expect the running game to be this good again . <p> Ole Miss does n't need it to be . All Freeze needs from his ground attack is enough baseline competence to keep his offense balanced . Chad Kelly will handle the rest through the air . <p> This probably was n't a watershed moment . The offensive line will probably still struggle at times against sturdier , more athletic SEC defensive fronts . But the Memphis game did suggest that the running game is making incremental improvement , which should scare the hell out of SEC defensive coordinators. 
@@87888358 @3388358/ <h> The mastermind behind the most prolific offense in the FCS is coming to Oxford to replace Dan Werner . <p> Ole Miss struggled with offensive consistency down the stretch of its disastrous 2016 season , a flailing run game and the loss of Chad Kelly dooming it to long stretches of incompetence . Hugh Freeze thinks he may have found the answer in Sam Houston State offensive coordinator Phil Longo , who has been officially announced as the replacement for recently-fired Dan Werner . Longo spent the last three seasons coordinating an up-tempo , air raid derivative that 's become the most prolific offense at the FCS level , though struggles against stiffer competition in the playoffs raises questions about his ability to transition to the SEC . <p> After ranking 23rd in yards per game and 22nd in points per game in Longo 's first season , Sam Houston has ranked first in yards per game and no worse than fifth in points per game over the last two years .

Consider that during Sam Houston State 's historically productive 2016 season , the Bearkats did n't play a team with a winning record until the final game of the regular season . Against James Madison in the quarterfinals of the FCS playoffs , Longo 's offense averaged 3.3 yards per play , went 2-of-19 on third downs mustered just 7 points during a humiliating 58-point beatdown .

We dive into the numbers . <p> The 2013 Ole Miss recruiting class was a hot topic of conversation the moment it stepped on campus . Robert Nkemdiche , the nation 's No. 1 player , chose Ole Miss over basically every other school . Laquon Treadwell , the No. 1 receiver , selected the Rebels over Michigan and many other programs . Everyone in the country wanted Laremy Tunsil . Tony Conner was a hot commodity as well . <p> Fast forward three years , and three of those four are projected to be selected in the first round in April 's NFL Draft . Ole Miss just signed a historic class , but how good is it in comparison to that 2013 class that wowed everyone so much ? Can it match the highs of the class ? Is there a big talent drop-off in 2016 like we saw in the 2013 class ? <p> The definitive answer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but let 's look at how the classes compare on paper . After all , that 's all we really have to go on at this point . <h> Among the top 15 prospects , the differences are pretty significant . <p> So , one way to evaluate a class is based around the top half or so . These players are the most likely to contribute , so a valid argument can be made that they 're the best indicator of class quality . Let 's take a look at how the top rated 15 players compare to one another . Before you look at this chart , let me make a note that it does not include junior college players . Since they are not nationally ranked in the same way high schoolers are , it would pretty much wreck the data .

Past that , the 2016 class separates a lot in national ranking . Consider the fifteenth best player of 2016 , Jacob Mathis , being ranked at 338 while 2013 's Daronte Bouldin is ranked 866 . That difference is quite vast . <h> And it gets more vast when you look at the entire class . <p> When you look at the entire signing classes , the difference is remarkable . The most recent signing class 's last ranked player , Tariquious Tisdale at 745 , would rank fourteenth in the 2013 class . That 's right .

Will they be better on the field ? Who knows . They 're better on paper though , and that 's all we have to go on . This recent class missed on some defensive players late , but all in all , it 's objectively better . That has to be encouraging for the program moving forward .

So what does it mean when you have three ? <p> And you thought Ole Miss had quarterback questions after Dr. Bo 's interception-fest against Boise State . Last Thursday , Vanderbilt made as many quarterback changes as Bo Wallace had interceptions , churning through three signal callers -- then cycling back for a fourth -- during a shockingly bad 37-7 loss to Temple in which their only touchdown came on a botched special teams snap . <p> Vandy spent the offseason evaluating a three-way race for the starting quarterback position , but heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Rebels , they 're already back at square one . New head coach Derek Mason , who looked befuddled at the helm last Thursday , said he does n't plan on making his starter for Saturday public knowledge , which means we likely wo n't find who will be under center until just before game time . <p> Let 's take a look at what went wrong last week and what the Rebs can expect to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doom <p> Nothing looked good for Vandy against Temple , but the quarterback debacle was of particular concern . <p> Sophomore Patton Robinette , who made three starts in place of an injured Austyn Carta-Samuels last season , earned the starting gig out of camp and was the first under center . That lasted all of five drives . After starting 4-of-6 , Robinette was abruptly pulled five minutes into the second quarter . <p> In came Stephen Rivers , the LSU graduate transfer who bolted Baton Rouge after spending two years behind Zach Mettenberger ( he 's also the brother of Philip ) . Rivers looked like he was getting into gear on his third drive , completing three consecutive passes to move into the red zone , then promptly fumbled the ball away . After starting 6-of-9 but failing to lead a scoring drive , he was yanked early in the third quarter . <p> Next in the carousel was redshirt freshman Johnny McCrary , who managed to throw two picks in the span of three attempts and earn a swift exit .

Not only did the confounding QB rotation make Mason and his staff look unprepared and panicked , but it surely damaged the confidence of their players . What kind of message does it send to Robinette to take his job after less than a half ?

Vandy 's quarterback problems were compounded by an offensive line that , according to Christian , " failed to keep Temple at bay and looked like a group of true freshmen rather than the veterans they are .

Laws which are intended for the benefit of public safety and a general ( and highly debatable ) sense of the societal good are oftentimes simply enacted by power-happy big fish swimming about their unassuming small ponds . The alcohol laws in place in Lafayette County , Mississippi are prime examples of this , as where one can drink , what one can drink , what one can drink and where , as well as how certain beverages must be sold to consumers have all been governed by laws that defy sensible explanation . <p> Let 's review , shall we ? <p> Beer is technically not legal on the Ole Miss campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swayze Field is technically not on the Ole Miss campus , the aforementioned rule does not apply there - but only there , as one can not expect to drink elsewhere in or around the stadium without reproach . <p> Alcohol can not be sold on Sundays . This law was partially amended a few years ago when Oxford 's aldermen decided to allow sales on certain Sundays during which there would be more people in town who , presumably , would spend more of their hard earned dollars at local restaurants if alcohol were available . These special Sundays are mostly those after home football games and big events such as festivals and concerts . This is because Sunday is the sabbath , and therefore a day to be kept holy , except when the local city government can make a little bit of money on it . <p> Beer can not be sold cold unless being sold by the individual drink or , get this , in a keg .

This means that everything from elaborate beer cooling schemes , to what was essentially an outdoor beer store using good ol ' mother nature* to regulate her product 's temperatures , to Sunday afternoon treks to Marshall or Panola Counties to procure legal brew have become a part of the Ole Miss student culture . <p> The former is somewhat more laughable when you realize that chilled wines and spirits are not against the law , so one could buy a quart of cold J+germeister from a liquor store , but not even the weakest , wateriest of beers . <p> Thankfully for sane people everywhere , two of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oxford city Aldermen voted last night to allow cold beer and the sale of alcohol on Sundays beginning on September 19 . It has taken literally decades , but our municipal governments are starting to wise up to two unassailable facts : people want to drink , and your rules are n't going to stop them from doing so ; and allowing people to purchase and consume alcohol in a certain manner or on a certain day of the week is not a legitimate threat to public safety ( or , at the very least , no one has convincingly demonstrated as much ) . <p> So it 's a small win , but we 'll most definitely take it . <p> Remember , Mississippi is one of the states that has allowed the sale of what is essentially pure grain alcohol for as long as I can remember , but just allowed the sale of high gravity beer a year-and-a-half ago .

He also delivered bad news about Ken Webster 's knee and gave a candid explanation of the secondary 's second-half woes . <p> Every week , we 'll be sorting through Hugh Freeze 's presser to bring you only the notable information and explain why it matters . No more scrolling through long transcripts or sitting through a 20-minute video replay filled with 95 percent coach speak . We 've already done that for you . <p> On a night that saw Ole Miss squander a 22-point lead and an opportunity to begin its season with a defining upset over a top-five team , the lowlight was watching Webster carried off the field in tears after wrenching his knee at a gruesome angle early in the first quarter . We already knew that the Rebs ' starting corner was done for the year , but that did n't make Freeze 's revelation any less jarring : " Webster tore everything , every ligament in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one that raises the question of whether Webster will ever be the same player he was before the injury . <p> The news is relatively better for running back Eric Swinney , who only tore the ACL .

" <p> The more intriguing question is whether five-star freshman quarterback Shea Patterson plays this weekend .

Freeze 's response was significantly more substantive . <p> Eye discipline on defense and just playing poor technique . Some of it had to do with you lost Ken and he 's our boundary guy that you expect to play 95 percent of the snaps . Then you put somebody over there that maybe is not as comfortable , and his technique was really bad at times . It cost us some . And then if you 're carrying a guy , your eyes should n't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the crucial third-and-longs that really killed us in that drive right before the half . I think I 'm as hard on critiquing us as coaches as anybody , and when you look and say , Man , that 's a perfect call , ' then we 're either not communicating it well enough or teaching the techniques well enough or they 're not disciplined enough to do their job . We 've got to work through that . That 's why most people would rather play a game week one that you can maybe make those mistakes and still win . You ca n't do that when you play one of the top teams in the nation . <p> Ole Miss allowed a redshirt freshman to average 8.1 yards per attempt and convert four of six third-and-5-plus opportunities in the second half . A big part of that was the Rebs ' insistence on playing soft coverage on the outside , where Tony Bridges and Webster 's replacement , Carlos Davis , looked completely lost . <p> " It was n't very fun for me to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in offcoverage that we 've got to get looked at and get corrected , and obviously it hurt losing Ken , " Freeze said in the immediate aftermath of the game . " We really felt like he was a guy that we could leave on an island and have success . When we lost him , you know , it did affect us . " <p> I understand being wary of less-talented DBs getting burned for big plays , but at some point while Francois was picking apart the secondary , you 'd think the staff would have tried to make an adjustment . Instead , they just stuck with soft coverage and let FSU do the same thing that Memphis and Arkansas did last season . The coaches have to figure out a way to strike a balance between big-play prevention and disrupting offensive efficiency .

Treadwell was one of the most prolific receivers in SEC history " despite playing just two and a half seasons ( factoring in the 2014 injury ) , Quon 's 202 career receptions rank seventh among the conference 's leaders , and he would have almost certainly passed Jordan Matthews ' all-time record of 262 had he come back for his senior season . Over a quarter of the footballs that left Kelly 's hand last season were aimed at Treadwell , and no one receiver in this year 's group can expect to play that prodigious of a role . <p> Which might be a good thing . As Chad was learning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a big-bodied , apex receiver to whom he could just chunk it up when pressure was closing in or he could n't make the right read . ( Remember the miraculous Tip Six against Bama ?

Treadwell 's departure should allow him to step that production up dramatically . String will be especially dangerous in the red zone , something I wrote about earlier this summer : <p> Treadwell ranked seventh in the country last season in red zone targets , and a lot of those goal-line fades that Swag was slinging towards Laquon will now be aimed at Damore'ea , whose combination of size , strength and jumping ability make him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ' 2 with the third highest vertical and broad jumps on the team , the fifth highest power clean on the team ( behind four linemen ) and , despite his size , enough explosiveness to rank second in the receivers room in the 10-yard sprint ( Quincy Adeboyejo leads the whole team ) . That all adds up to plays like this : <p> Jefferson had already taken a lead over the vet during spring camp ( Jefferson was on top of the depth chart that was released before the beginning of spring ball ) thanks to his route running , a skill developed in part by his NFL dad , who 's currently the receivers coach for the Dolphins . <p> He 's the best route runner we have , as far as getting in and out of breaks , and his hands are very , very steady .

Man him up with a safety or linebacker and his crisp route running will leave them in the dust ; play zone and the coach 's son should be able to find the gaps . It would n't be shocking if Jefferson ended up leading the Rebels in receptions in 2016 . <h> Look out for the freshmen <p> Freeze re-upped with a trio of four-star croots in 2016 , adding A.J. Brown , D.K. Metcalf and Tre Nixon .

@@87888427 @3388427/ <h> Ole Miss vs . Mississippi State determined the Playoff two years ago , but regression from both schools this season has dulled the luster of the Golden Egg . <p> Just two years ago , the Egg Bowl had national title implications . In November of 2014 , No. 4 Mississippi State lost to Ole Miss in Oxford , knocking the Bulldogs out of the Playoff . The Landshark defense held Heisman candidate Dak Prescott and the Mississippi State offense to a season-low 17 points and Jaylon Walton 's 91-yard touchdown run helped the Rebels pull away . Regardless of the result , many believed the game would serve as a turning point for both programs , perhaps signaling that the Egg Bowl would carry national significance for years to come . <p> Unfortunately , those expectations have failed to turn into a reality . This Saturday 's Egg Bowl will once again determine last place in the SEC West , and the teams resemble the struggling squads of the early 2010 's more than the national contenders of 2014 . The Rebels will be looking to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season that has failed to live up to lofty expectations . The Bulldogs are simply playing for pride , hoping to knock off their rivals and manufacture some momentum for in-state recruiting heading into the offseason . So how are we back here ? Let 's take a look at how the two programs , in just two years , have fallen from national contenders to division doormats . <p> For the Rebels , the most obvious decline is on the defensive side of the ball . The 2014 Landshark defense led the country in opponent 's points per game . This season 's defense ranks 93rd in that same category , good for 12th in the SEC . Following the 2015 season , much was made of the departures of Ole Miss ' trio of five-star recruits , ( DL Robert Nkemdiche , WR Laquon Treadwell , and OT Laremy Tunsil ) , but it 's the losses of safety Trae Elston and do-it-all corner Mike Hilton that have had the most devastating impact . The Rebels surrender over 450 yards per game on average , with the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young secondary has struggled to lock up opposing receivers . <p> Despite these struggles , the Rebels are not ranked last in the SEC West in total defense ; that distinction goes to the Mississippi State Bulldogs , whose defensive ineptitude has served as a season-long Achilles heel . The Bulldogs expected to struggle on offense coming into the season , with sophomore quarterback Nick Fitzgerald replacing All-SEC and current Cowboys star rookie Dak Prescott . However , Fitzgerald has performed admirably as Prescott 's replacement , while the defense has been increasingly responsible for State 's woes . In the past five games , the Bulldogs have given up an average of 43.6 points , including back-to-back 50-point games to Alabama and Arkansas . <p> Of course , the downward trends of both programs can not be blamed solely on defensive downgrades . The Rebels have been plagued by injuries all season long , which began in the opener against Florida State with the early exit of two key players in DB Kendarius Webster and RB Eric Swinney . Additionally , the playcalling and game management by the Ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ole Miss offense averages the third-shortest time of possession among Power 5 teams , while its defense averages the third-longest time on the field . For the Bulldogs , problems on special teams have exacerbated their misfortunes . They are 10-18 on the year in field goals , with key misses in losses to BYU and , unforgettably , South Alabama . <p> So where do we go from here ? For both Ole Miss and Mississippi State , the Egg Bowl will only serve as the beginning to a long and vital offseason . Hugh Freeze will be forced to address questions surrounding his defensive staff as well as the impending NCAA violations that loom heavily over the program . Dan Mullen will face questions regarding his future with the Mississippi state program and will also be tasked with recruiting to rebuild a defense that could very well finish dead-last in the SEC . The answers to these questions have the potential to define both programs .

The Musketeers love to distribute the ball -- they average just over 16 assists per game -- and their sound passing play drew the Rebs out of position around the arc for 10 three pointers on the day .

And further , Xavier attempted 21 free throws to Ole Miss ' five . Five free throws . Yuck . <h> Offense <p> Ole Miss was 19-4 on the season when they shot just 40 percent from the field , so it 's little wonder that Thursday 's 32.9 percent performance netted them a short stay in the Big Dance . Likewise , the Rebs ' 6-of-27 from beyond the arc lands their three-point shooting percentage somewhere between whale shit and the bottom of the ocean .

@@87888437 @3388437/ <h> Nobody 's been able to stop Trevone Boykin and the Horned Frogs , but Baylor and West Virginia managed to at least slow them down . The Rebs can learn from what those defenses did right ... and wrong . <p> The Ole Miss defense , the secondary in particular , is arguably the best unit in the country . Anchored by a pair of All-Americans in Senquez Golson and Cody Prewitt , they 're giving up just 188 passing yards per game and have hauled in the sixth-most interceptions in the country . <p> But they have n't faced an air raid quite like that of TCU and Trevone Boykin , who they 'll meet on Wednesday in the Peach Bowl . The Horned Frogs ' 333 passing yards per game ranks seventh in the country and Boykin , who 's thrown for 30 touchdowns and over 3,700 yards , finished fourth in the Heisman voting . <h> You should also read this <h> You should also read this <p> The Rebels have faced just one other top-20 passing attack this season , No. 12 Texas A&amp;M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about slowing down the Frogs ' prolific spread attack ? Let 's start by taking a look at what 's worked with other teams this season , then compare it to what the Rebs have done against similar offenses . <h> Baylor and West Virginia 's aggressive defense worked ... kind of <p> In TCU 's only loss this season , Baylor employed an aggressive and somewhat risky strategy to hamper Boykin . Whenever the Frogs lined up in a four- or five-wide set ( which was just about every snap ) , Baylor played tight , single-man coverage with no safety help , then loaded the line of scrimmage and blitzed the hell out of ' em . The idea is to bring more defenders than the offense can block , force the quarterback into a rushed throw and pray you do n't get burned deep . <p> On this third-and-four , Baylor brings seven rushers against TCU 's six blockers . Three of TCU 's four wideouts run deep routes , meaning Boykin 's only real shot at getting the ball out in time is to his slot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extra blitzer comes free and a hurried Boykin makes an errant throw . <p> As good as Boykin has been this season , there have been a few times when he 's struggled with his accuracy -- most of which have been when he 's facing heavy pressure and tight coverage . West Virginia mixed in more Cover 1 and Cover 2 looks when they hosted TCU in Morgantown , but on passing downs , they often employed the same aggressive strategy as Baylor . <p> Here , Boykin does n't even have time to get a throw off . Multiple blitzers come free and because of the tight coverage , there 's no choice but to tuck and scramble . <p> Facing man coverage and overloaded blitz packages , Boykin completed just 43 percent of his passes in the two games against Baylor and West Virginia . <p> ( In fairness , his 12-of-30 outing in Morgantown was played in cold , rainy conditions . ) <p> The obvious problem with that strategy is that by leaving your defensive backs in single coverage with no safety help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush is late getting home or if a corner gets beat off the line , you 're toast . <p> Baylor brings six on this play but leaves Boykin enough time to get off the deep bomb . <p> So while Baylor forced seven punts and five three-and-outs , they also let TCU rack up 44 offensive points and 346 passing yards . Boom or bust . <h> Ole Miss will be aggressive ... but not that aggressive <p> Baylor can take gambles on defense because they know their No. 1-ranked scoring offense can pull them out of just about any hole ( they overcame a 21-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat TCU ) . But the Rebel offense is n't that kind of point machine , so they ca n't afford to sell out on defense the way Baylor did . Do n't expect many Cover 0 blitzes . <p> But that 's not to say defensive coordinator Dave Wommack ca n't utilize the core principles of blitzing the quarterback and playing tight man coverage behind it . Against Mississippi State -- whose tendency to run four- and five-wide sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to TCU 's offense -- Ole Miss did a ton of that . <p> On this first-and-10 , the Rebs play single man across the formation , with middle linebacker D.T. Shackelford dropping back into a shallow zone . Linebacker Keith Lewis ( No. 24 ) blitzes off the right side and with the pocket collapsing around him , Dak Prescott has to make a hurried throw to a receiver that 's fallen down on the sideline . <p> The thing is , the Rebels do n't need to bring the house to get after the quarterback . Because of Robert Nkemdiche , Marquis Haynes and the rest of the deep and ultra-athletic D-line , Ole Miss can get pressure rushing just four -- which frees up a safety or two to play back . <p> Check out this third-and-9 . Once again , Lewis blitzes ... but this time defensive end C.J. Johnson ( No. 10 ) drops back in coverage . Even with a four-man rush , Haynes ( No. 27 ) beats his man around the edge and forces Prescott to pull it down and run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because they 're only rushing four , they can leave a safety playing center field to help prevent the big play ( you can see Trae Elston coming into the top right of the screen just before the snap ) . <h> So what should we expect ? <p> The Rebs will probably mix in a fair amount of zone and wo n't be blitzing every play . Keep in mind that they also have a dangerous run game to defend , and turning your back in man coverage on a mobile quarterback can be a dangerous gambit . <p> But in passing situations , especially on third downs , do n't be shocked if Wommack takes some chances and brings multiple blitzers . Ole Miss should make Boykin prove he can pass into tight windows under heavy pressure . Whether he can or not will likely go a long way in deciding the game .

This is compared to a TCU defense that held opponents to a touchdown every five drives . <p> Ole Miss ' biggest hurdle will be finishing drives . In the few close games that TCU played this season , the Horned Frogs had a tendency to give up quick strikes .

Of course , when your offense is putting up over 45 points per game , it tends to get the media recognition . <p> In the end , while the matchup that everyone is excited about is the TCU offense facing the Ole Miss defense , it might just be the Rebel offense against the Frogs defense that determines the outcome of this game . 
@@87888441 @3388441/ <h> Yes , any game between Dak and Swag is going to be pass-heavy , but shaky secondaries , ground-challenged offenses and formidable defensive fronts give Ole Miss and State even more incentive to go to the air . <p> Here 's something you probably thought you 'd never read : this season 's Egg Bowl features the two best quarterbacks in the SEC .

Each one of Ole Miss ' three losses can be blamed in part on poor secondary play -- Florida , Memphis and Arkansas averaged 341 passing yards and threw for 10 combined touchdowns in those three games . State 's been better against the pass for most of the season , but Brandon Allen torched them for 407 yards and seven touchdowns last week in Fayetteville . <p> Injuries do n't help matters . Starting Rebel safety C.J. Hampton , who missed the LSU game with a stinger , has been wearing a non-contact jersey in practice this week and could be limited . Tony Conner still is n't 100 percent and freshman Cam Ordway , who helped fill in for Hampton , has to sit out the first half for " fighting " against LSU . <p> State 's secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redmond , a projected first-rounder who tore his ACL in practice a month ago , was the only legitimate hope for marking Laquon Treadwell , who 's probably going to do just about whatever the hell he wants on Saturday . <h> There 's not much in the way of ground attacks . <p> Neither of these teams are good at running the ball and neither wastes much time trying to do so : State and Ole Miss are first and second in the SEC in pass attempts and 14th and 10th in rushing attempts . <p> Bad run blocking has plagued both teams all season , and while Ole Miss has gotten considerably better in that area since Laremy Tunsil 's return , it 's still far from a strength . Jaylon Walton 's shiftiness ( remember this ? ) and Chad 's newly-emphasized running ability could cause some problems for State , but it 's not like the Rebs are going to control the game on the ground . <p> State 's rushing attack starts and ends with Dak , who has more carries than top running backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdowns to that duo 's one . As a whole , State 's offense ranks 12th in the SEC in rushing yards per game . <h> Both defensive fronts can stop the run , especially Ole Miss ' . <p> State 's run D is n't great , but it ranks inside the 65th percentile in rushing S&amp;P+ and has a front studded with playmakers : Chris Jones is the second most disruptive DT in the state of Mississippi , defensive end A.J. Jefferson is fourth in the SEC in tackles for loss and the linebacking duo of Richie and Beniquez Brown ( no relation ) are one of the nation 's better duos in cleaning stuff up at the second level . <p> But I really like how Ole Miss -- which ranks eighth best in the country in rushing S&amp;P+ and just finished up an impressive bottling up of Leonard Fournette -- matches up against State 's ground attack . Dan Mullen 's strategy has been to spread the defense with receiver-heavy sets , then let Dak attack the exposed middle .

State 's hoping to get defensive backs on the field instead of linebackers , and then have Dak run them over , but the versatility of Conner and Hilton allows Ole Miss to play the run while matching up with spread personnel . <p> Ole Miss did a good job of limiting Prescott in last season 's contest , allowing Dak just two yards a carry on 24 rushes .

From a football standpoint , however , falling to the Vikings at No. 23 might be the best thing that could have happened to the former Ole Miss star . <p> Had Cleveland snagged Treadwell instead of Coleman , Laquon would be stuck catching passes from the deteriorating RGIII ( at least until he went down with an inevitable injury ) . Instead , Treadwell joins promising young quarterback Teddy Bridgewater on a team that won the NFC North last season .

" <p> Stefon Diggs led the team with 54 receptions for 720 yards last season , but at 6 ' 0 , 195 , he does n't have the size to be the dominant physical presence that Zimmer craves . Things set up for Treadwell to be the rangy , intermediate target and Diggs , who ran a 4.46 at last year 's combine , to be the vertical threat on the other side . <p> " After the season got over , and you go through your year-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we wanted to get a big receiver with a big catching radius , " Zimmer said last week . " We just felt like with this football team that was important for us to get some size out there . We have Diggs , Jarius Wright , kind of smaller guys , so that was part of it . " <p> The only guy that could , potentially , give Treadwell a run for playing time is Charles Johnson , a third-year player the Vikings nabbed from the Browns ' practice squad . Johnson was hyped by many last season as a player that could " make the leap , " but a rib injury early in the season made him a non-factor . Of the Vikings ' remaining receivers , he 's the one that has the size and the catch radius to compete with Treadwell for that spot . But , by the time the smoke clears , I 'd expect Treadwell to be the guy . <p> Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports <h> The Vikings do n't need Treadwell to be a downfield threat . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former Rebel receiver . The Vikings traded for Mike Wallace last offseason , hoping he would add a vertical threat to Norv Turner 's offense . The experiment was an utter failure : Wallace caught a career low 39 passes for just 473 yards and two touchdowns and was released in March . <p> The reason for Wallace 's flameout in Minnesota is simple : the combination of a rickety O-line and Bridgewater 's underwhelming arm strength meant the Vikings just could n't get the ball to him downfield . According to Pro Football Focus , Bridgewater attempted only 48 passes that traveled 20-plus yards in the air last season ( 23rd in the league ) , completing just 15 of them for 436 yards , three touchdowns , and four interceptions . The depth of Bridgewater 's average target was just 7.4 yards . <p> All of which is to say , the Vikings did n't draft Treadwell to be a downfield burner . <p> " We all ca n't run 4.3 , " said legendary former Vikings receiver Chris Carter when asked about Treadwell 's oft-criticized 4.63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the Vikings draft a lot of guys who can run . But they ca n't play receiver . And did n't they just let a guy go named Mike Wallace ? Was n't that his thing ? Speed ?

" <p> Indeed , Bridgewater has been cautious with the football " GM Rick Spielman told Pro Football Talk in February that he 'd like to see his quarterback " letting it loose a little more , giving some guys a chance to make plays even though it may not look like it 's open .

Pair that pinpoint accuracy with a receiver like Treadwell and the results could be lethal . <p> And this is where Treadwell is really going to be valuable : serving as an outlet receiver for his young QB . Bridgewater was pressured on a league-high 46.9 percent of his drop backs in 2015 , according to Pro Football Focus . The Vikings addressed their offensive line issues with the free agent signings of Alex Boone and Andre Smith , but having a guy who Bridgewater can chuck it up to when things get dicey is just as important . <h> He can also help in the running game . <p> Treadwell or no Treadwell , the offense in Minnesota runs through Number Twenty Eight . Superstar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only two teams in the league had a higher running percentage than the Vikings ( 51 percent of all offensive snaps ) . <p> Anyone who watched Treadwell in college knows that run blocking is part of his game . <p> " I could put a highlight reel together and I know Adrian Peterson 's going to be very excited how this guy plays the game and blocks at the edge , " Spielman said . <p> Treadwell 's vicious crack-back blocks are the ones that show up in Vines , but it 's his ability to latch onto a defender and drive them out of the play that makes him so valuable . <p> " He 's the best blocking receiver that I have ever seen , " Zimmer said . " I ca n't remember one that blocks as well as this guy does that I have seen on tape . " <p> It also helps that Treadwell is a willing blocker . The Vikings , who had more rushing attempts than passing attempts in 11 games last season , wo n't be throwing the ball nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I ca n't imagine the modest , soft-spoken Treadwell whining about not getting targets . <p> It should be noted , of course , that the Vikings did n't spend a first round pick on Treadwell for his blocking acumen . He 's a receiver first , and it 's in that capacity that he 'll be most valuable to Peterson and the ground attack . The effectiveness of pounding the ball with AP is blunted if there 's no pass threat to keep defenses honest , something that 's not lost on offensive coordinator Norv Turner . <p> " We 've got ta make plays to back people off and get people to say , ' Hey , if we play this defense , if we play this eight-man front , if we single these guys up , they 're gon na make us pay .

They 'll likely be spending even more time together in Minnesota . Carter , who 's 40 time coming out of college was identical to Treadwell 's , built his legendary career on making tough catches in clutch situations and the knowledge he shares will be directly applicable to Treadwell 's new role . <p> Carter , by the way , agrees that his pupil found the ideal landing spot . <p> " I think his football IQ , his temperament , is the perfect fit to what they 've been looking for an awful long time , " Carter said .

Shea Patterson was expected to redshirt 2016 and study up under the Rebels ' standout quarterback Chad Kelly , but that insulated tutoring came to an abrupt end last Saturday against Georgia Southern , as Kelly 's Ole Miss career was undone by twin tears to his ACL and lateral meniscus . <p> After Kelly went down , Hugh Freeze had a decision to make : start backup QB Jason Pellerin , a somewhat experienced former three-star recruit with a less-than-serviceable arm and situational running ability , or go with greenhorn true frosh Shea Patterson , the best quarterback of 2016 's signing class who aligns best with Ole Miss ' spread offensive attack . Ole Miss ' ungodly receivers need someone to throw the the ball to them , after all . <p> Freeze elected to go with Patterson " for the most part " against Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it worked . He owned every Ole Miss freshman quarterback yardage record , and he only got better as the game sauntered on . <h> Shea had an understandably shaky first half . <p> Try to understand yourself in this situation : a highly recruited true freshman quarterback suddenly forced to lead a still-potent but dwindling offense on the road " in deep November " against a No. 8 ranked SEC team and in front 110,000 cacophonous fans . Dare you not to flinch , because they HATE you . Also , there 's that stupid 12th Man yell-house , so they REALLY hate you , because SEC football is nothing if not irrational , blind , searing rage . <p> When decibel levels are causing your rib cage to jump out of our chest as you 're trying to call in offensive plays , life can get MIGHTY STRESSFUL . As it can when your offensive line fails to perform the duties of offensive lines in your first career start . <p> Patterson did n't complete a pass on his first drive . He scrambled twice for 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . He finished out the first half 10 of 19 for 92 yards and no touchdowns or interceptions . <p> In the second half , Patterson went 15-of-23 for 246 yards with two touchdown passes and an interception . On the drive that ended with an infuriating fumble by Pellerin , Shea completed passes of 26 , 23 and 15 yards in a row to three different receivers . He marched the offense into the end zone three consecutive times , and on the fourth he brought it within range of Gary Wunderlich 's leg for the win . <p> Throughout the second half , SEC Network analyst Jesse Palmer kept calling up echoes of Johnny Manziel when lauding Patterson 's out-of-pocket mobility and awareness . Certainly his final scramble for a first down before the game-clinching field goal held whispers of Manziel 's jackrabbit takeoffs from way back when . <p> Aided by strong Landshark defensive stops on the Aggies ' final two possessions , Patterson drowned out the noise and narrative and whatever else to lift a beleaguered Rebel football team past a top-10 opponent on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shea Patterson 's team now , and that 's good for Ole Miss ' football future . <p> Many criticized Freeze for shredding Patterson 's redshirt this year . It was desperate they said , it preemptively ruined a frosh 's window to catch on , it was a cheap but lucrative ploy to attract recruits with an unknown NCAA punishment hanging over the program . Sure , whatever . <p> Freeze needs to win games now , because last season 's 10-win season ai n't gon na happen in 2016 . Freeze has an arsenal of superlative receivers that need to catch footballs and Pellerin ca n't deliver them receptions . Freeze wants success in the present " which is the case for every SEC coach " and his offense is built such that it requires an arm of Patterson 's strength and accuracy . <p> Freeze also needs to set the table for next season and , yes , enhance his recruiting clout . Winning helps recruiting . Also , winning strengthens job security . Cry NCAA SANCTIONS OR SOMETHING all you want , but Ole Miss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that face includes Shea Patterson racking up 402 total yards in his first career start . <p> Given the win-now necessities and other sundry panoply of CFB job market forces , Freeze escapes without blame here . He played his best position player in the most important offensive position . He 'll do so until the season is over . Maybe more college coaches should decide to do things like this . Oh right , they all do .

Here , let Yelp do the talking : <p> Buckhead Saloon <p> Five-star : 3 Stars ? ? 3 Stars ? ? 10 stars if I could ! ! ! ! This place rocks . Chad took care of us , as usual . He is the best bartender around . My husband and I always experience great food , great service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! We LOVE this place .

Parking is limited , but use Landmark across the street for easy access . Plenty of choices to satisfy most . Kitchen is quick , so order only when you 're ready to eat .

I will definitely be coming back here when I stop by in Atlanta again ! <p> Oh , and in response to the few reviews I read that said Dive Bar is racist : that 's nonsense ! ! !

I lol'ed . <p> Most of the other complains involved rude bartenders and a terrible experience with a fried goat cheese appetizer . <p> *** <p> Stats and TacoMac are the places Downtown that you 'll find most Ole Miss fans before and after the Peach Bowl , but if you want to venture elsewhere for drinks around the Georgia Dome , our first recommendation would be Park Bar . <p> Five-star : Great location , right across from Centennial Olympic park , with a nice view of the Ferris wheel .

Overall , cool spot ! <p> One-star : N/A <p> Two-star : I had high expectations for this place based on other reviews but my oh my was this place overpriced and underwhelming . Not a good value at all . I ordered the Cuban frita ( sp ? ) burger since it was highly recommended by our waitress . What a disappointment ... It was n't terrible but it was n't memorable either . For $15 I expected something more enjoyable . My wife ordered a salad and it was mostly large pieces lettuce with dry chicken slices overtop . All in all we felt unimpressed and frankly ripped off considering the price . <p> We ( that 'd be Whiskey Wednesday and I ) like Park Bar because the drinks are strong , inexpensive , and can be ordered in a plastic lidded to-go cup complete with a stupid little bendy straw . It 's not as corny as it sounds , considering that a tall Jack and Coke slurped on your walk to the Georgia Dome is far from the worst way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta from a rooftop in Five Points , try SkyLounge . It 'll probably be cold and wet , but whatever . You 'll have fun . <p> Five-star : If nothing else , come here for the PHENOMENAL view . That 's worth it alone . Had a wonderful time on a Wednesday evening , enjoyed a few drinks , and enjoyed the magnificent view from sunset into the night . Drink prices were actually less than I was expecting for such a nice place ; definitely recommend stopping by here for a drink ! <p> One-star : It 's still on top of a great hotel but the vibe is gone , the views are now limited . The plush leather sofas have been replaced with Ikea sectionals . The open sky is now blocked by a white canvas roof that looks like a cheap tarp from a tailgate . The on-trend music has been switched for a DJ blasting outdated tunes ( with no theme or transition ) WAY too loud from a setup on a folding table with temp speakers posted around . The drinks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the changes I ca n't blame them . <p> Maybe that 's not what you 're looking for , though . Maybe you 'd rather pretend to be cultured and smoke hookah while eating Mediterranean food . If that 's your jam , check out Anatolia Cafe and Hookah Lounge , a spot that 's generally well received by folks looking for food , drinks , or tobacco inhaled through a water pipe . <p> Five-star : Dope spot . Came here often to chill with folks after classes . I probably did hookah about twice a week . Great spot for food too . The gyros are delicious . Awesome atmosphere . <p> One-star : Service was n't very friendly . They charge beyond two coals . The building does n't have a very welcoming atmosphere . The staff moves with zero sense of urgency .

First , El Bar , a spot that has a reputation for good music dished out in cramped quarters : <p> Five-star : I love el bar fridays because Speakerfoxxx and Cristodisco are some of the best djs around . They mix new and old music so effortlessly and everyone inside is gettin down by the end of the night . The only thing missing is a huge fan in the corner cooling us off because it gets hot in there but when I go home soaked in sweat I know I had a good time . <p> One-star : Some guy threw a drink at me and tried to fight me , and i got thrown out ! ? The security at this place is horrible . I find it strange that an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends and we got thrown out . If you do n't care about your personal safety , come to El Bar !

Son racista ? <p> Other compliments were that the bar was crowded and loud . Other complaints were that the bar was crowded and loud . <p> One-star : This place is awful . If you enjoy ordering a Jack and coke and being ignored for 12 minutes when the the bartender finally acknowledges you again as you request the same beverage and the response is " you can see we are busy " that 's a joke . #shittyservice #attitude #terriblebar <p> Most of the one-star reviews were novellas written by spurned hipsters , so this really does seem like my kind of place . <p> And what of the Bookhouse Pub ? <p> Five-star : Excellent food , drink , and service . Shrimp and grits was insane . Pot stickers were also great . Entrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Carnivore Cab were delightful . Every single drink and bite I consumed were excellent . Cool dark atmosphere and back deck with a view of the Bank of America tower . Great little spot . <p> One-star : Worst service ever , managers and staff were flat out were rude . poor high gravity beer selection . Need to fire the staff , change the menu , and get some real beers in there . Go somewhere else . <p> Again with the poor reviews that consist of paragraphs after paragraphs of complaining . It 's like people think that folks who read Yelp are looking for a riveting tale of how your waitress was rude and something more than " the french fries were soggy imo . " <p> Of course , no trip to Ponce is without a stop in the Clermont Lounge . Instead of a pair of Yelp reviews , here 's a video of Anthony Bourdain taking in Atlanta 's finest establishment with a visibly uncomfortable Alton Brown : <p> Of course there are gobs and gobs of places outside of the aforementioned watering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a criminally underated eating and drinking scene . So , if you 've got the time , venture out to Little Five Points , Decatur , East Atlanta Village , or anywhere that you find a Waffle House worth patronizing . You wo n't regret it , probably . <p> Have fun , be safe , do n't drink and drive , and do n't make the rest of us look like assholes . Happy New Year , and we 'll see y'all in Atlanta .

But I think most of us figured the Playoff hopes would die with some last-minute interception against LSU , or a botched special teams play in Starkville , or hell , maybe even a lackluster performance in Atlanta .

Think Freeze would n't trade half his paycheck to have Senquez Golson back on the field ? <p> But the most egregious shortcoming of this game was , once again , terrible situational playcalling by Freeze . I 'm specifically referencing two first-half decisions to go for it on fourth-and-1 . On the first , which occurred with Ole Miss up 14-7 in the first quarter and the ball on its own 10 , ended with Robert Nkemdiche coming up short and sustaining a concussion that knocked him out for the rest of the game .

The Rebs came into the day as the third worst team in the country in converting third or fourth downs with two yards or less to go . They had already been stuffed on a third-and-1 and a fourth-and-1 earlier in the half . So Freeze , in his infinite wisdom , decided it was a good idea to go for it in his own territory while Memphis had every available ounce of momentum . Look , I appreciate Freeze being aggressive , but at some point simple math tells you the odds of converting that play are far outweighed by the odds of it backfiring . Six plays after Kelly 's keeper was stuffed by an unblocked defender , the Tigers took a 10-point lead and firm control of the game . <p> It 's hard to be optimistic about the Rebs turning this ship around -- they just got dinged with two losses in the easy half of their schedule .

Everyone who follows college football has heard of Robert Nkemdiche from his days as a top-flight recruit , and safety Cody Prewitt was on nearly everyone 's all-American list this offseason , but this season we 're hearing national pundits and casual fans alike tossing around names like C.J. Johnson , Senquez Golson , and Deterrian Shackelford in support of the idea that this Ole Miss defense is one of the most complete units in the Southeastern Conference . <p> The numbers do support that idea , as the Rebels are in the top-10 nationally in several defensive statistical categories . Consider that the Landshark defense is : <p> First in the nation in actual scoring defense ( 8.4 points per game ) <p> Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10+ yards ( 45 ) <p> Fifth in total defense ( 277.6 yards per game ) <p> and ninth in pass defense ( 152.4 yards per game ) . <p> Of those categories , Ole Miss is the top team in the SEC save for total defense , where they 're just behind the Alabama Crimson Tide .

They 're pretty good at everything , but are on an elite level when it comes to defending the pass . This makes sense with a defensive line that can pressure quarterbacks into bad throws and a secondary that can keep up with skilled receivers and pick off errant passes . <p> Considering this team 's success thus far , it 's not crazy to argue that Ole Miss has the best defense in the college football playing nation , let alone the defense-heavy Southeastern conference .

But this year 's group of Landsharks , if they continue playing at the level they have been , could go down as the best defense in Ole Miss football history . <p> *I use the term " actual " scoring defense because the statistic , for some reason , includes points scored off of safeties and defensive touchdowns .

Kyle is a junior marketing major from Long Island , NY who started at a Div 3 school his freshman year and later transferred to play lacrosse at Ole Miss his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Baltimore , MD and is the team president in addition to a four-year team member . <p> How and when did the Ole Miss club team get started ? It started about 20 years ago when it was n't as nearly as competitive as it is now . About seven years ago we joined the Men 's Collegiate Lacrosse Association ( MCLA ) which is the big club association nowadays . We started out in the Great Rivers Lacrosse Conference ( GRLC ) which consists of teams such as Indiana and Missouri . Then about five years ago , we moved into the South Eastern Lacrosse Conference ( SELC ) which is the " SEC " of lacrosse . There are about 20 teams in the the SELC but within our division are Georgia , Georgia Tech , Auburn , Vanderbilt and Alabama . Those are our division rivals that we play year in and year out . The level of competition is really high for club play . <p> What are the costs of playing club lacrosse ? What about sponsors and fundraisers ? The team is fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to pay . It 's very important that every player does their part to pay for their membership . It 's $1,500 for freshmen and new players to the team and for returning players , it 's $1,100 , mainly because you do n't have to pay for new equipment . The dues help pay for league dues , travel expenses , and all of the necessary equipment . I know $1,500 sounds like a lot , but it 's really not that much compared to other club programs . A club like Arizone State is paying around $4,400 . Regarding fundraisers , our head coach is from Long Island along with a lot of the team members and we put together a big fundraiser in NY over the summer . A lot of the people up there are excited to give some money to help grow the sport back down south . <p> Regarding practice , could you touch on your practice schedule leading up to a game ? On a game week , we practice Monday from 6-8 , Tuesday 5-6 , and Wednesday 6-8 . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Away games are about the same except for Fridays we load up on the bus to leave town . Typical game weekends anyway will have 2-3 teams play round robin style . It 's a lot of fun to host teams in Oxford and it 's not hard getting teams to want to travel here due to the reputation Oxford has for being a great college town . <p> Do y'all show the other teams around Oxford ? Yes , for example , the first home weekend game we hosted Kentucky . It was a lot of fun to meet up with them on the square Friday night , just hangin out with their team and getting to know their players . Then the next day we battled it out on the field against them . <p> Could you talk about your away schedule ? So far we 've travelled to Lafayette , LA to play University of Louisiana-Lafayette and Texas . In two weeks we travel to Auburn , then two weeks after that we travel to Atlanta to play Georgia Tech and UGA the next day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowl collegiate lacrosse series in New Orleans against Texas A&amp;M . For our roster of guys mostly from the northeast , that was a blast for us get down there and experience New Orleans . <p> Speaking of your roster of mostly northeastern guys , what 's the out of state representation on the team ? I was surprised by the amount that goes into Ole Miss Hockey recruiting , is there a similar aspect for the lacrosse team ? Well there are n't many division-1 schools with a varsity lacrosse team so the next step if you want to play lacrosse at the college level is go to a smaller division 3 school or play at the club level . Given those choices , for me , it makes more sense to go to a bigger school and still be able to play at a competitive club level . So I went on to the Ole Miss lacrosse website and filled out a recruiting interest form . The recruiting coordinator at the time talked to me and convinced me of the perks of playing at the club level and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts with their own schedules back home , we do n't have a set date for all recruits to come and visit . Instead , whenever a recruit is able to come down for a visit , we show him the town and introduce him to the team . It 's a great advantage to have most of our team from the northeast because potential recruits already have something in common with our current team . <p> What 's the closest state representation on the team ? In the south , the closest would be Louisiana , Florida and North Carolina . Other than that , you 're looking at guys from New York , New Jersey , Connecticut , Pennsylvania and Maryland with California and Texas splashed in there . We are able to pull a bunch of kids from some of the top high school programs in the country and that helps us to keep up with the high level of competition at the club level . <p> What other lacrosse teams are your main rivals and why ? Bama is always a great game along with Auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up being pretty competitive . <p> What 's a typical season like ? Has the team been successful ? What are some accolades worth noting ? A typical season is about 12-14 games , all depending on the budget and how many games you can afford to play ( referee fees , travel , etc ) . We try and get as many home games lined up as possible so our friends can come out and support us . We also try and set up some scrimmage games against local division 3 schools such as Rhodes out of Memphis . <p> If there was one thing you could say to any of our readers to plug and convince them to come out for some Ole Miss lacrosse games ? It 's a really exciting sport . It 's the fastest sport on two feet and most people here have n't had the chance to see it in person . I think if they came out and saw it one time against one of our rivals they would really enjoy it . There are hits , goals ... it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one sport . <p> The lacrosse games are held at intramural fields , and this past weekend was a beautiful day for any outdoor sport . As for the game , they were n't lying ; I had a helluva fun time watching . The game was very fast paced with lots of contact . It reminded me a lot of hockey , except on grass and with much more fighting for possession over loose balls . Loose balls on the ground turned into a giant divot party as opposing players tried to dig out the ball and gain possession . I was also surprised by the constant yelling of plays from the sideline and coverage assignments from the field . <p> To my untrained eye , it seems the most skilled position on each team is the goalie . Imagine standing in a net armed only with a stick that has an over-sized head and pocket . Aside from his stick , the only other pad that sets him apart from the other players on the field is a chest protector . <p> Aside from his stick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other players on the field is a chest protector . This seems slightly insane considering other players are hurling a G " lb. rubber ball at you at very high speeds . <p> This seems slightly insane considering other players are hurling a G " lb. rubber ball at you at very high speeds . Despite that , the Ole Miss goalie made some crazy stops with his stick and un-padded limbs . Shout out to freshman #17 Walker Sawers from Baltimore , MD . Sick moves , bruh . <p> The other players that stuck out were senior #2 Connor Kelly from Pottstown , PA and one of the guys I talked to earlier , Mac Ford . Connor and Mac were the main " attackmen " , hanging out behind the net to set up plays or rushing in towards the crease to get open for a shot . Apparently Connor had a crazy season last year with 83 points ( 56 goals and 27 assists ) . Dude , I 'm sure I could score half that many points in ten lifetimes of playing lacrosse ... do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess as to why lacrosse is n't that popular is because of the lack of exposure the local chirruns have to the sport in contrast to the buffet and obsession with football here in the south . After our interview , Mac , Kyle and I talked about the idea of offering some clinics/camps to some of the local elementary and middle schools in hopes of instilling an understanding and appreciation of the sport . It also starts with YOU , the Ole Miss fan , student or supporter , to go out and show some love to the lacrosse team next time you happen to be around for one of their games . Their home games are done for this season , but I will be trying to get the word out next Spring as a kind reminder to send some love their way if you want to watch some high speed , high action LAXing .

@@87888510 @3388510/ <h> A moment in the bright glare of the spotlight for the players who go through all of those horrible workouts and practices without ever being noticed . <p> A hearty congratulations to me for remembering that I started this series , followed by me getting motivated enough to execute the second round . The alignment taking place before you is something akin to a rare eclipse , but not the kind that will burn out your retinas if you stare at it for too long ( though nausea is a possible side effect here ) . <p> If you missed the initial version of Get To Know Your Walk-Ons , first , PAY ATTENTION FROM NOW ON , and second , you have the opportunity to rectify that mistake by clicking here and learning more about quarterback Drew Davis . However , if clicking that link is too exhausting ( I mean , your mouse arrow could be way over by the scroll bar , plus reading ?

But I 'm sure it 's a brotherly pummeling that ends with them being picked up and slapped on the helmet or butt while they check to ensure all body parts are still functioning as they should . <p> How this works is I 'll use a random number generator , which will give me a random number , and I 'll find the walk-on on the Ole Miss roster closest to that number . Today 's random number has led us to #84 Hunter Thurley , a junior from Nashville , Tennessee . <h> Who is Hunter Thurley ? <p> That sounds like some horrible question he 'll be asked at a job interview in a few years ( note : looking for a job is THE WORST EVER ) . It will be followed by Hunter assuming the person interviewing him is insane ( they are ; no sane person ever asks a question like that ) , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight nod of the head and his or her eye intensity reduces by a few degrees , which will be interpreted by Hunter 's brain as a sign that he may now land this plane . <p> Anyway , steering this thing back in a reasonable direction , Hunter came to Ole Miss in 2014 after transferring from Wofford . As a member of the Terriers , he played defense in all 11 games in 2013 , a season in which Wofford was sitting pretty at 5-2 , then in a tribute to David Cutcliffe , lost its last four to finish 5-6 . <p> His best game at Wofford came against Southern Conference foe Presbyterian , in which he produced 3 tackles , 1.5 tackles for a loss , 1 sack , 1 interception , AND scored a touchdown off of that interception . You know who did really well against Presbyterian the following year ? <p> Coincidence ? I THINK NOT . <h> Has Hunter Thurley played in a game ? <p> He has not , but with tight end depth behind Evan Engram best described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Of course , that assumes Jeremy Liggins does n't morph into a hybrid super tackle/tight end where he plays both positions at the SAME TIME . <p> " Wait a second , Evan . Let me step out there and stop all of this traffic for you . " <p> " Why of course this Ajax catfish could be poisoned , Evan . Let me eat it for you . " <p> I 'm sure there are other very important things that he actually does , but that 's how I imagine it . <h> Reminder that walk-ons were pretty good in high school <p> As a senior , all Hunter did was rack up 70 tackles and 7 sacks on defense , then turned around on offense and caught 7 touchdowns on just 9 receptions . The lesson back then was if you wanted a touchdown , THROW IT TO HUNTER THURLEY . <p> For those efforts , he was selected to play in the East/West Tennessee All-Star game and was a first-team All-State selection by the Tennessee Sports Writers Association . No word if that group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And due to his talent level and superior hand-eye coordination , Hunter also played baseball . In 2011 , he managed to hit .368 , with 6 home runs and 28 RBIs , which would make him the second-best hitter on the 2015 Atlanta Braves . <h> Where can we see him this season ? <p> I was n't sure last time , and I 'm still not because I have n't looked it up , but it 's possible we could see Hunter on the sideline at some home games . This entire series will run its course before I take the time to find out how many players can dress out for conference and non-conference home games . <p> Wherever he is on Saturdays , we can be certain he was a part of the team getting ready to SEEK AND DESTROY . And if that entails dedicating his weeks to Evan Engram 's safety , a finer endeavor I can not recall .

All of that to say , the chances of Patterson as a freshman matching Kelly 's productivity is slim to none . <h> Can he win the backup job ? <p> Patterson is an electrifying prospect , definitely . He 's 6 ' 2 with pinpoint accuracy and can scramble pretty well . He does n't make many poor choices and can make things happen when plays break down .

Here he is showing out on a couple plays in last season 's Egg Bowl , in one flushing Dak Prescott out of the pocket despite a very obvious hold to help force Dak 's first pick-six of the night . <p> Jones ranked 10th on the team last year in solo tackles with 23 , and sixth in tackles for loss with 5.5 . With Woodrow Hamilton and Nkemdiche no longer rostered , Jones will almost certainly jump up to a starting position .

When asked by reporters , Tunsil apparently acknowledge that he had indeed taken money . <p> What was supposed to be the climactic celebration for Ole Miss ' legendary 2013 signing class devolved into a stomach-turning , real-time nightmare during the first round of the NFL Draft on Thursday night . Moments before commissioner Roger Goodell took to the podium , social media hackers launched a malicious and cruelly-timed attack on star offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil , releasing disparaging content on his Twitter and Instagram accounts that tanked his draft stock and , eventually , led to what appeared to be a live admission that he accepted money from an Ole Miss athletics staffer . <p> Here 's what happened . <h> Someone hacked Tunsil 's Twitter and sent out a video of him smoking . <p> Roughly 10 minutes before the Rams went on the clock with the first pick , this video was sent from Tunsil 's own verified account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account " was quickly deleted , but the damage had been done . Tunsil , who went into the night expected to go as high as No. 3 to the Chargers , plummeted to No. 13 before the Dolphins mercifully stopped the fall . During the cringe-worthy slide , a shaken Tunsil could be seen in the green room being consoled by family members and head coach Hugh Freeze . <p> Tunsil 's camp quickly declared that the account had been hacked and insisted that the video , which shows him smoking out of a gas mask bong , were several years old . <p> This should n't shock anyone but the Tunsil camp is telling teams that the step dad leaked the video of him from a few years ago . <p> That stepdad , of course , is the same one that plunged Tunsil into an NCAA investigation last summer by going to the media with claims that his star stepson had engaged in illegal contact with pro agents . That same stepdad filed a lawsuit against Tunsil earlier this week . <h> Then Tunsil 's Instagram was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst of it seemed to be over .

But when asked about it during a post-draft press conference , Tunsil seemingly confirmed that he indeed accepted money from Ole Miss coaches . <p> Tunsil , who 's understandably flustered , stumbled through his responses , which makes it difficult to discern exactly what he 's admitting . <p> At the : 45 second mark , a reporter asks " Are those conversations you had with John Miller , with Hugh Freeze ?

Today 's random number has led us to #84 Hunter Thurley , a junior from Nashville , Tennessee . <h> Who is Hunter Thurley ? <p> That sounds like some horrible question he 'll be asked at a job interview in a few years ( note : looking for a job is THE WORST EVER ) .

As a member of the Terriers , he played defense in all 11 games in 2013 , a season in which Wofford was sitting pretty at 5-2 , then in a tribute to David Cutcliffe , lost its last four to finish 5-6 . <p> His best game at Wofford came against Southern Conference foe Presbyterian , in which he produced 3 tackles , 1.5 tackles for a loss , 1 sack , 1 interception , AND scored a touchdown off of that interception . You know who did really well against Presbyterian the following year ? <p> Coincidence ? I THINK NOT . <h> Has Hunter Thurley played in a game ? <p> He has not , but with tight end depth behind Evan Engram best described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .

" <p> I 'm sure there are other very important things that he actually does , but that 's how I imagine it . <h> Reminder that walk-ons were pretty good in high school <p> As a senior , all Hunter did was rack up 70 tackles and 7 sacks on defense , then turned around on offense and caught 7 touchdowns on just 9 receptions . The lesson back then was if you wanted a touchdown , THROW IT TO HUNTER THURLEY . <p> For those efforts , he was selected to play in the East/West Tennessee All-Star game and was a first-team All-State selection by the Tennessee Sports Writers Association . No word if that group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And due to his talent level and superior hand-eye coordination , Hunter also played baseball . In 2011 , he managed to hit .368 , with 6 home runs and 28 RBIs , which would make him the second-best hitter on the 2015 Atlanta Braves . <h> Where can we see him this season ? <p> I was n't sure last time , and I 'm still not because I have n't looked it up , but it 's possible we could see Hunter on the sideline at some home games . This entire series will run its course before I take the time to find out how many players can dress out for conference and non-conference home games . <p> Wherever he is on Saturdays , we can be certain he was a part of the team getting ready to SEEK AND DESTROY .

Minimal , if any . <h> So where does this go from here ? <p> Here 's Forde on next steps : <p> According to standard NCAA protocol , Ole Miss and/or other parties charged with violations have 90 days to respond to the allegations . Unless there is agreement on the facts and the case can be resolved by summary disposition , a Committee on Infractions hearing date will be established . The COI generally meets six times a year ; it most recently met last week . <p> If there is a hearing , NCAA enforcement will present its case and the school can present its side .

" In fact , 18 of the 174 ( just over 10 percent ) of y'all offered up an answer that conveyed an intention to eat lunch , but a lack of conviction over what that lunch may be . Answers ranged from " I do n't know yet " to " I do n't know , probably beef jerkey " to " Probably some tacos . But maybe not . Who knows . " <p> The most popular answer of any real food item was a variation of chicken , such as " chicken , " " chicken tenders and fries , " or " chicken sandwich ya bish . " Chicken , as we all know , is a very popular dish in Mississippi , as the Magnolia State is one of the nation 's largest chicken producers .

This was open ended as to allow survey takers to be frank and honest in a way that allows us to truly understand the needs and wants of you , the reader . <p> The most sizable contingent of the respondents simply wanted to answer the question in the negative , and inform us that they did not have anything else to add . <p> Nah <p> Nah <p> Nah <p> Nah fam <p> No <p> No <p> No <p> No <p> No <p> No <p> No <p> no <p> No , HottyToddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Another offered a more nuanced take , that " a hotdog has some of the same characteristics as a sandwich , but should be considered in its own category , " while someone else , who is completely bonkers , said " Hot dogs are not sandwiches but can be eaten with ketchup . " <p> It seems this issue will never be resolved . <p> Other opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs " do n't deserve to drink good cocktails , " that " Jurgen Klinsmann should be fired in favor of Mark Wilmots , " and that one survey taker 's dog is " pretty great . " I bet he/she is ! Dogs are all pretty great . <p> But it was n't all opinions and takes in our responses . Many of you offered up a stone cold fact , all of which are important and interesting . Some examples include : <p> Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both participants are registered blood donors <p> There 's a new Katy Perry single out today ( ED : July 15 , 2016 , not the date of this publication ) <p> Girls have more tastebuds then boys . <p> My 8yo son is in first place in his weekly Fitbit challenge with a bunch of 30-60 year old folks . <p> I have a mole in my belly button . <p> Of course , the unassailable and very important fact that was on the minds of much of our respondents was that Ole Miss is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting someone sleep on a couch and giving someone else a ride to Memphis . <p> Related to this was the response that " the NCAA is a corrupt organization that levels punishments in a capricious manner according to what they think they can get away with without being sued .

That number is up to 30 percent this year with Riley Ferguson at the helm , and they 're currently the third most explosive offense in the country .

An advantage in field position meant that Memphis ' touchdown drives only took 54 yards on average , while Ole Miss 's took 78 .

For those that did n't get picked , signing as an undrafted free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's a running list of all of the former Rebels who have signed in the wake of the draft .

Another night wasted due to awful defense and even more awful playcalling . Ole Miss loses their third straight to the Auburn Tigers , 40-29 , and Gray Hardison joins to try and figure out what exactly we hated the most from this game . Was it the Pellerin Package in the red zone ? Was it the poor tackling clinic that Dave Wommack put on ? Or was it just all of the above and then some ? 
@@87888655 @3388655/ <h> Podcast Rebellion : Did Hugh Freeze make the right coordinator hires ? <h> Here 's what you need to know about Ole Miss ' new hires . <p> After weeks that seemed like months , Ole Miss has finally filled their defensive and offensive coordinator voids with Auburn secondary coach Wesley McGriff and Sam Houston State offensive coordinator Phil Longo . It 's a tale of two hires . McGriff has been a position coach at numerous Power 5 schools and spent three seasons in the NFL ... but has little experience as a coordinator . Longo has extensive coordinator experience and has directed record-breaking offenses everywhere he 's been ... but none of it has come at the FBS level . 
@@87888661 @3388661/ <h> Podcast Rebellion : Things we loved and hated about the comeback win over Texas A&amp;M <h> Shea Patterson : good ! Overthinking redzone playcalling : bad ! <p> Ok , wow so Ole Miss goes on the road and steals a win over a top 10 team on the shoulders of five-star do-it-all quarterback Shea Patterson . The redshirt was pulled and the red cape was thrown on . The kid was masterful in his first EVER collegiate start in front of 104,000+ at Kyle Field , totaling 402 total yards and threw two touchdown passes . There 's nothing really else to say . Patterson had the poise of a veteran and the defense rallied around the newfound confidence on offense to halt A&amp;M and give Gary Wunderlich a chance . <p> But , enough about all that awesome stuff , you 're here to hear all the scorching hot hangover taeks from Gray and myself . And we pull no punches as we touch on the good and the bad from Saturday 's remarkable finish . As you know , as an Ole Miss fan nothing comes easy
