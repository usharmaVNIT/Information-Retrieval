@@37033182 @6033182/ <p> Any number of issues can cause either the buyer or selleror bothto apply the brakes to the process of putting together a sponsorship contract , but along with the deals price tag , there are two other areas where it is often difficult to find the middle ground . <p> Below , best practices on how to negotiate fair compromises for these commonly contentious issues : determining the value of in-kind contributions and establishing exclusive category definitions . <p> What Is The Value Of Value In Kind ? The use of goods or services in exchange for sponsorship rights takes on more importance when economic conditions force marketers to reign in their cash spending . <p> " Value in kind is a vastly underappreciated aspect of the negotiation process , " said Kevin Adler , president of Engage Marketing . <p> VIK can play a major role in helping sponsors limit their cash outlays . For example , Hallmark Cards Inc. significantly reduced the cash component of its 02 Olympic Winter Games and U.S. Olympic Team sponsorship by providing printing services . <p> " The Salt Lake Organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating budget , " said Adler , who represented Hallmark while working at agency Relay Worldwide . " We were able to offset that cost for them by providing VIK and using the cash value of that service to buy down the cash Hallmark needed to spend for the deal . " <p> But placing a cash equivalent value on goods or services is a frequent sticking point between properties and their corporate partners . The challenge : Sponsors typically want to receive the full retail value of whatever is being provided . <p> While that sometimes is fair to the property , in many cases it is not , and regardless , it can still be difficult to determine the specific cash value . <p> To reach a fair market value for contributed products or services , it is necessary to first determine which of three categories the donation falls in : <p> Budget relieving . By far the most desirable form of VIK , this type of partnership helps properties eliminate the costs of goods and services they normally would purchase as part of their operational expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Because the subtraction of those costs has a direct impact on the propertys bottom line , such donations typically are valued at their cash equivalent . <p> " If I make 10,000 widgets , and I can sell them for full price at retail , why should I give them to you at a lower cost ? " Adler said . <p> The picture is not always so cut-and-dried , however . Properties should ask whether the donated products always sell for full price and try to determine if there is an average price that includes typical discount offers , which may more realistically reflect what the property would have to pay for the products on the open market . <p> A number of properties and agencies say it is a good idea for a propertys sponsorship staff to pull in the organizations procurement or financial pros to help place an accurate value on budget-relieving deals . <p> " Sales staff do n't  always have the same perspective on a propertys profit and loss statement that someone else may have , " Adler said . <p> To that end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services and determining their ability to use them . <p> " Properties get in trouble when they only need $40,000 worth of paint , but they take $80,000 worth and paint like crazy , " said Rick Jones , head captain of FishBait Marketing . " That becomes an issuewas it really budget relieving ? " <p> When seeking in-kind deals , Jones recommends properties approach companies late in their fiscal year when they may have excess inventory to share . " If I know I need plastic bags next August , I 'll go to a manufacturer or wholesaler in December and say , Instead of carrying your inventory to the new year , you can make a donation now. " <p> Non-essential . This includes products a property does not need from an operations standpoint , but which it could use for fundraising ( as raffle or silent auction items ) , to enhance the attendee experience or for some other purpose . <p> Although these goods and services have the potential to positively impact the propertys bottom line , such results are not guaranteed . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> IEG recommends valuing these items at 50 percent of their cash value , but that figure can be adjusted upward as a negotiating tool to obtain something else or gain a concession from the sponsor . <p> Requiring additional property resources . This category includes products and services that would require the property to incur additional costs to capitalize on . For example , a sponsor gives the property product it can sell to event attendees and keep the proceeds . <p> For these items , the value should account for the costs to the property to generate revenue , such as building and staffing an on-site booth to sell the product on site . <p> In the first year of the relationship , IEG recommends valuing these items at 50 percent of their cash value minus the estimated implementation costs ( see Table 1 ) . After the first year , the property can base the value on the revenue it was able to generate and the actual costs to implement . <p> Navigating Category ExclusivityDetermining where to stake the fence that defines sponsor categories is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as deregulation , industry consolidation , technological advances , mergers , retail changes and sponsors shifting priorities . <p> The challenge of negotiating category exclusivity typically comes into play when a sponsor wants to lock up broad exclusivity that would include categories the property has a reasonable chance of selling separately ( see Table 2 ) . <p> Although companies should not assume they can own as many categories as they want for the price of one , it is reasonable for them to expect not to have to pay the full cost for each category when purchasing more than one . <p> To reach a compromise that is fair for both parties , IEG recommends the following steps : <p> Define sponsors core competency . This can be either the sponsors primary business category , or , more relevant to many sponsorship discussions , the primary products the deal will be used to promote . <p> " Sponsors need to be honest and realistic about what categories they legitimately need versus what categories they want , " Adler said . " A quick-service restaurant asking for exclusivity across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Adler believes sponsors should try to secure exclusivity in categories " that represent choices in which consumers might reasonably divert spending from your brand to another . " Under that parameter , McDonalds and upscale steak house chain Smith &amp; Wollensky would not be deemed competitive , he noted . <p> " From a marketing perspective , Principal Financial Group can be defined very broadly , " Duffy said . " We try to hone in on the legal side , where there is not a gray area on which services it offers and which it does n't  . " <p> Having a defined core competency helps make the negotiation process smoother , he said . <p> " When we speak with properties , its not about what they are losing by selling to The Principal , but what they still have available . " <p> Case in point : When negotiating The Principals sponsorship of two Dale Earnhardt , Inc . NASCAR Sprint Cup Series teams , the agency purchased exclusivity in two categories : retirement and financial planning , administration and investments ; and group health benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We took the core categories for our client and left a number of bigger-ticket , more lucrative categories available for the team to sell , " said Duffy , referring to retail banking , credit card and other types of insurance . <p> For properties it can come down to asking a potential sponsor to identify which categories it plans to activate against . <p> " Our litmus test is , If I give you these 15 categories , how will you market against them , or do you want them just to lock out the competition ? " said Russell Wallach , Live Nations president of national alliances . <p> Discussing a prospective sponsors core competencies can actually open up the possibility of working with another company that a property may have assumed to be a competitor . <p> For example , Traverse City , Mich.s National Cherry Festival this year worked with two energy companies , each of which titled a parade at the event . <p> " There appears to be a conflict , but they agreed to coexist because one of them does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the festivals director of marketing &amp; corporate partnerships . <p> Once a core competency is defined , the sponsor should be prepared to pay the full established price of the package to lock up the category . <p> Determine propertys ability to sell additional categories and price accordingly . When a sponsor wants to obtain categories beyond its core competency , the property needs to assess the likelihood of selling those categories to other companies . <p> The property can then offer those categories to the original sponsor with discounts applied to the full package price based on how likely it is that the property could find another buyer at the full rate ( see Table 3 for a hypothetical example ) . <p> Rhode Islands Newport Harbor Corp . took such an approach to its deal with the local Pepsi distributor , allowing the sponsor to lock up multiple non-alcoholic beverage categories at a price below what each category would cost if purchased separately . <p> The property included the energy drink category at no additional charge because category leading brand Red Bull is not an active sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp.s director of corporate sales . <p> Regardless of whether the company purchases one or multiple categories , the parameters of exclusivity should be clearly spelled out in the contract . <p> That language should include detailed information on the categories locked up ; a list of categories the sponsor can pass through or resell to other companies ; and a list of companies the sponsor designates as competitors , and thus off limits for soliciting . <p> Editors note : This article does not constitute legal advice and should not be regarded as a substitute for legal advice .

Case in point : Wayne Rooneys testimonial match was only aired on television in select markets in Europe , so the Facebook Live broadcast allowed fans from around the world to view the game . <p> While Univisions MLS and Liga MX games are broadcast in Spanish , the Facebook Live broadcasts will be in English , helping Univision and MLS connect with an expanded pool of soccer fans , some of whom may be more mobile or socially connected . <p> Facebook Live also gives rightsholders a platform to experiment with interactive broadcasts targeted at millennial audiences . Last fall , Bleacher Report broadcast three high school football games exclusively via Facebook Live that featured audience interaction with broadcasters , fan polling , unique camera angles , sports performance metrics and integration of Instagram Stories . <p> The live MLS matches will be produced specifically for the Facebook audience watching on a mobile device and will integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will interact directly with the audience . <p> That interactivity represents a key benefit for stakeholders . <p> " Facebook reports that , on average , people comment ten times more on Facebook Live videos than on regular videos . This interactivity presents a giant opportunity for both brands and properties to engage fans in real-time via Q&amp;A and live polling , " said Zack Sugarman , Wasserman Media Group senior vice president , properties . <p> That feedback can provide insight into what camera angles to work into a broadcast , performance infographics and other broadcast enhancements , he said . <p> Consumer feedback provides another major benefit : the ability for properties to track consumer sentiment in real-time . For example , consumers can use emoji symbols to let people know what they think of content when viewing live streams . <p> " They can like it , love it and cry in real timeIts a tool for brands and sponsors to see at which precise moment they feel engaged with the content . We may be getting closer to answering the question if consumers really care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lesley Pinckney , GMR Marketing senior vice president of digital and social . <p> When strategizing a Facebook Live broadcast , Sugarman recommends that properties focus on one key element : the story . <p> " Facebook Live broadcasts that focus on the story over the video quality are generally my favorite . All stories have a beginning , middle and end and Facebook Live broadcasts that keep that top of mind will succeed . " <p> Sugarman points to the World Surf League and Tough Mudder as properties with engaging Facebook Live events . The WSL takes advantage of the platform to provide compelling , immersive and interactive broadcastsincluding filling downtimes with athlete interviews , polling , etc.while Tough Mudder shows its personality through its broadcast by taking viewers up close and personal with competitors . <p> " They show you why people are here to compete , what the competition looks like in real time and what it feels like to finish the race , " said Sugarman , noting that Wasserman does not work with either property . <p> How Rightsholders Can Monetize Content On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature ads , Facebook is testing the ability for publishers to place short ad breaks and earn a share of the revenue . For example , Facebook is exploring different options with Univision to use ad breaks to fill breaks in the on-field action . <p> Facebook also is helping partners drive revenue through branded content . That includes photos , videos , articles and other content that features a third-party sponsor . Based on partner feedback , Facebook in April 2016 updated its policy to enable Verified Pages ( leagues , teams , etc. ) to share branded content on the social media platform . <p> Last summer , nine USA Basketball mens and womens national team games were simulcast on NBA TV and Facebook . During the pregame , halftime and commercial breaks , the Facebook broadcasts featured analysis and highlights sponsored by Verizon . <p> Both the NBA and USAB leveraged Facebooks branded content tools and policies to clearly indicate that the live streams were in partnership with Verizon . Once the NBA and USAB tagged the broadcasts " with Verizon " in posts , Verizon could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional spend to support distribution . <p> How Publishers Can Share Branded Content on Facebook Live <p> Publishers are required to tag the marketers page in any post the features a third-party brand , product or sponsor . <p> Publishers can use Facebooks Branded Content tool to tag the marketer . Branded content posts will then appear in the news feed with the " with " tag . <p> When tagged , the marketer will be able to see high level performance insights , such as reach and engagement for the post . <p> Marketers can also collaborate with publishers to expand the reach of the content . For example , marketers can share the " Share &amp; Boost " button to share the post to their page and boost it to a chosen audience . Marketers must share the post to their own page in order to boost the post . <p> When evaluating potential sponsor tie-ins , properties need to look for partners that are comfortable with the quality of content captured on a smart phone , said Pinckney . <p> " Some brands have a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

IEGs 32nd annual year-end industry review and forecast sees steady sponsorship spending growth in 2017 , with the caveat that caution on the part of brand and corporate marketers could grow into concern as the year progresses , thus limiting their willingness to commit additional dollars to partnerships . <p> For now , global sponsorship spending is projected to rise 4.5 percent in 2017 to $62.8 billion from the $60.1 billion spent in 2016 . That growth rate is nearly equal to last years 4.6 percent , which was slightly below the forecast of 4.7 percent . <p> Total Global Sponsorship Spending <p> In North America , the worlds largest sponsorship market , growth is expected to lag behind the global rate , increasing 4.1 percent in 2017 following 4.2 percent growth last year . <p> Spending of $22.3 billion in 2016 was below projected growth of 4.5 percent .

Global ad spending is expected to increase 4.4 percent in 2017 , while spending on other marketing services is expected to grow by just three percent . <p> In North America , sponsorship growth should outpace the other forms of marketing , with ad spending expected to grow just 2.6 percent and other marketing spending up 3.2 percent , according to the GroupM report . <p> The song remains the same in terms of the breakdown in North American sponsorship spending among the six property types . Although growth in sports spending is expected to slow from 4.7 percent last year to 4.3 percent this year , at $16.37 billion the segment will continue to command seven out of every ten dollars spent and will grow at a higher rate than each of the other property types . <p> North American Sponsorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Sponsorship Market <p> About IEG IEG is part of ESP Properties , a WPP company .

For example , Colgates Facebook application called Smiles languished for months , until Colgate recast the tool , offering donations each time users shared Smiles . The result : The widget was shared 500,000 times in five weeks . <p> Similarly , Targets " Bullseye Gives " invites users to choose from a list of 10 charities to which Target donated $3 million . The social twist : After voting , users are invited to broadcast their selection to their Facebook friends via their news feeds . In less than a week , Target tallied 40,000 votes , which translated into tens of thousands of peer-to-peer impressions . <p> The new sponsorship paradigm leverages brand equity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the property . <p> IEG Insights and Recommendations <p> Create communities worth joining . See what Nike has done in running and Carlsbergs Part of the Game platform as good examples . <p> Offer access , content and apps worth sharing . Lenovos Voices of the Olympic Games promo around the Beijing Games offers a great model . <p> Leverage content . MLB is getting some $200 million from subscription revenues for its digital offerings . Virtual communities make it easier to create niche networks . <p> Sail.TV and Cycling.TV created IPTV channels around these communities . Other examples include Iveco Rugby Radio , Bacardi BLive radio , etc . <p> Use mobile technologies . This year , to help attendees keep their fest to-do lists in order ( and save them the trouble of lugging around printed schedules ) , the Sundance Film Festival debuted its first official iPhone app . Designed by Vancouver-based mobile marketing company QuickMobile , who pulled it together with the assistance of a grant from Telefilm Canada , the application offers users a comprehensive list of screening schedules and events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Facebook links . <p> Invite participation . NFL sponsor and Super Bowl advertiser Doritos invites fans to create its ads through its Crash the Super Bowl campaign , while others vote on their favorite user-submitted spots . Six finalists each win $25,000 , and instead of airing a single contest winner , the top three submissions are aired . <p> Doritos allows comments ( furthering fan engagement and collecting consumer research ) , as well as prompts voters to share their vote via Twitter and Facebook . <p> Reward participation . Each time a Facebook user passed a virtual Coke to a friend , Coke donated $1 to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America . Budweiser offered first view of its Super Bowl ads in exchange for Facebook fans . <p> Design for youth . The youth audience creates content and uses it as social currency .

That 's a major word-of-mouth opportunity missed . If the Olympic committees had used Twitter as a channel to connect versus a channel to push content , the interactivity and conversations that stemmed from that two-way relationship might have spread outside the confines of the Internet , increasing overall attention and interest . <p> Adopt alternative and emerging platforms . Beyond Twitter , Facebook and YouTube , think Tumblr , Dailybooth , Ustream and Foursquare , the latter of which is a mobile social networking platform , city guide , gaming application and friend finder that let 's users " friend " other users and " check-in " to establishments in exchange for points and badges based on the depth of their experiences . <p> Measure objectives not eyeballs ; turn outputs into outcomes .

We have seven million followers across our social channels , there are conversations going on on Facebook , Snapchat , Twitter , etc. , and we want to be part of that conversation . <p> Develop content beyond tent pole events Were defined by moments . The worst thing you can do as a rightsholder or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only time you can activate . <p> What about Friday afternoon ? What are you going to do then ? When someone is leaving work on a Friday afternoon , they 're going through an emotional journey . Data and insights tell us they 're going to be on their phones , and they love McLaren . So why do n't  we get involved in that conversation ? All it takes is a short vignette of a car sliding around the corner or an amazing shot of Formula 1 . <p> All of a sudden Formula 1 transitions from a sport that fans watch on Sunday afternoon to being part of their everyday lives . <p> Scheduling is critical when distributing content When content goes out the door , we know the right times to feed it into the system . You have a commuting audience between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. , they go online during their lunch break and they go home in the evening . <p> Just check the number of green lights on Facebook on a Sunday night . Everyone is online , and you have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content Weve moved to a world of shorter vignettes and snippetsInstagram Stories , tweets , even Facebook itself . But let me tell you thisfrom our data , long-form content is not dead . People will watch a video for three or four minutes if its good . But it has to be bloody good . <p> Create content for a new generation of consumers You have the impact of Generation Z on todays content activation . The content they 're consuming is shorter , snappier , and more frequent . All of our data tells us that Generation Z is n't consuming the same kind of content that older millennials are . <p> But let 's not just assume its confined to Generation Z. Generation Z typically normalizes content . So whilst they 're doing Snapchats , all of a sudden that 's transcending to a slightly older demographic . So we cant think that these shorter video snippets are relegated to a younger audience . They have done a good job of normalizing it , and that 's the kind of way millennials and older consumers are sharing content . <p> Do n't  overlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into the B2B activation space . You think about consumers all the time about how were unlocking this . But brands have B2B requirements as well . <p> So whether its LinkedIn , Twitter , blogs or web sites , there 's probably a B2B story in the sponsorship as well . <p> I look at some of the content that goes out on LinkedIn , and many companies are forgetting a key point : the passion . You talk about Formula 1its really cool and interesting . So why go down the road of dull and boring content ? This is an opportunity to unlock the interest behind the B2B community . They are people too , and they want interesting content served into their LinkedIn newsfeed . <p> We measure the impact of different pieces of content , and we 've been surprised how close we get to our B2C fan engagement philosophy with B2B content . <p> Fluctuate content distribution around live events When you get closer to a main eventwhether its a music festival or a Grand Prixthe intensity of content output from the property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content should reduce . <p> We put out preview videos on Monday and Tuesday before a race that might be three or four minutes long .

Its shorter snippets of content but the intensity in which it is coming out is increasing . <p> Its the emotional journey of a sports fan , or someone who loves music or football . As you get closer to the main event , you get more and more excited .

That includes the $4.75 billion acquisition of Grupo Modelos U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2013 and $1 billion acquisition of craft beer maker Ballast Point Brewing in 2015 . <p> Constellation has signed a handful of new deals as part of the new strategy .

What kind of role does sponsorship play in Tecates marketing mix ? <p> Guerra : Tecate focuses on the bi-cultural Hispanics two biggest passion points , soccer and boxing . Overall , our strategy for both is to bring fans closer to the action than anyone else . As a brand , we do n't  just sponsor these sports ; we take a long-term deep look into a partnership for how best we can activate with 360-degree above-the-line and below-the-line campaigns . <p> IEG SR : Has Tecates use of sponsorship evolved over the years ? <p> Guerra : Yes , in most cases , that means we focus on fewer , bigger events . Those consumer experiences provide the best chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> IEG SR : Tecate is considered the official beer of boxing . What is appealing about boxing from a marketing standpoint ? <p> Long before that , we sponsored Oscar de la Hoyas 2007 fight against Floyd Mayweather , Jr . From that moment , we saw how our target market , bi-cultural Hispanics , responded to seeing the Tecate logo at the center of the ring and in the fighters corners . <p> Plus , its the perfect opportunity to activate the fight as a gathering occasion for friends and family .

Back in 2006 not many people knew about Marvel . It was all about D.C. Comics . <p> We had this idea from the studio thrown in front of us . They said they have a character named Tony Stark and they 're bringing in a well-known actor and an unknown director . We said Ok , were a progressive brand that is n't afraid to take risks. That 's because we loved the storyline . You had a self-made individual who used technology and his intelligence to create an empire , save his life and save the world . <p> Iron Man has been a fantastic partnership . We have been able to show every iteration of the Audi R8which is Tonys carand a variety of other vehicles . <p> And it is n't just Marvel with whom we have seen success . We need to be on the cutting edge of Hollywood , and we had an opportunity to engage new media platforms with Netflix and Showtime . That 's where consumers engage content , and we needed to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand . <p> We have done that many times . Look at a film franchise like 50 Shades of Grey . There was a lot of controversy around the film . From our standpoint , the writer , E.L James , would n't accept another brand . She had written Audi into her books because she believed it was the right choice . <p> We have also used these opportunities to bring our social story to life . A good example is Pretty Little Liars . The show draws a young demographic , and you may ask what a premium brand like Audi is doing with a show like that . The program , at the time , had one of the highest Twitter followings of any program . We engaged the producers to bring to life an experience that included extra insights . <p> Consumers on Snapchat were following our brand . It was snackable content they were able to engage and have a better experience with . In fact , Twitter noted that , at the time , it was one of the best TV experiences . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your brand is relevant and understood and that you 're providing a progressive approach to every experience you deliver to your customers . <p> Driver Image Driver image was incredibly important to us back in 2008 . We as a brand had to build a tremendous amount of credibility . Many consumers would n't consider Audi . <p> Experiences help change the way millennials think about brands . A study from San Francisco University shows that consumers are more happy spending money on experiences than on material goods . <p> Last year we struck a partnership with Airbnb . Airbnb is consistent with our brand values . They are a disrupter that has changed the hospitality industry , and we are disrupter in the premium car segment . <p> Last year we introduced the new V810 , which is a car that goes over 200 miles an hour . There are not many places in the U.S. where you can drive the vehicle legally . We needed a solution , and that came from working with Airbnb . We identified a house in Death Valley , Calif. that was two hours from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveraged the partnership to offer a curated experience . <p> We promoted seven experiences , and they each sold out within five seconds . You could visit the house for 24 hours , have a curated experience with a chef , go stargazing or participate in other activities . There was also a professional driver and a full tank of gas . <p> The program became a social firestorm . Key influencers shared the story , and we had 20 million impressions around the experience . <p> When bringing those kinds of experiences to life , its important to understand what 's important to your core consumer group . Audi customers want to give back . That 's a key driver for most affluent consumers . <p> Roughly 89 percent of consumers want to invest in brands that have shared values . That led us to a partnership with Toms . Toms is very much a progressive company . They give a pair of shoes to someone in need for every pair that you purchase . And they 're very much design-centric . <p> We were looking for a way that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales events every year . As part of that , we look for unique opportunities that we can bring to our customers . We came up with the idea of offering up a unique pair of shoes designed by Toms . When someone purchased an Audi , we gave them a pair of shoes and donated another pair to people in need . <p> Driving Excitement We also use sports marketing to push our brand forward . This is all about visceral excitement . Things that bring consumers to their feet , bring fans to the game , and get them embracing your brand . <p> The important thing is , we do n't  want to be a brand with a logo in the background . <p> There couldnt be a better story than our partnership with skiing . Our partnerships with the International Ski Federation and the U.S. Ski Team are a perfect demonstration of a space that we own . <p> We have used our involvement with skiing to tell the story of the technology that goes into the all-wheel drive Quattro . The traction control of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology that goes into the sport ; every single skier has a tech that is with them on each and every run throughout the year . <p> The focus on pushing technology forward is consistent with what our brand stands for . <p> Our premise of progressive performance does n't  just win on the snow , it wins on the pitch as well . In 2015 we started our partnership with soccer . Audi has been a global partner of soccer for a number of years . We have worked with FC Bayern and other teams in Europe . But we had n't  embraced soccer in the U.S. <p> Were always looking at how we can push the status quo and not just stay in the sport that weve always been in . When you look at diversity , Millennials and the fastest growing sports in America , soccer was clearly it . <p> Major League Soccer was taking on the same kind of spirit as Audi . They had the challenger spirit and wanted to push forward . They wanted to carve out their own space , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positioning in the premium space . <p> We loved the leagues tenacity , we loved their spirit , and we loved the opportunity to engage our target consumer . Audi has one of the youngest customer bases in the premium automobile segment . Were setting ourselves up for future opportunities as soccer grows in America . <p> We have done a variety of things to bring that experience to life . What 's exciting for us is the work we have done with dealers . Dealers have their own budgets , and they fund their own local experiences . Our dealers have partnerships with five MLS teams and are in discussions with additional clubs . They see value in the sport as well . Its not just a national sponsorship strategy .

With some meal plan included in it , MiLB ballparks purchase pallets upon pallets of certain types of products for each homestand including hot dogs , buns and potato chips/tortilla chips . With this in mind , we set the business development strategy in 2015 to specifically target brands that were " endemic " to the MiLB ballpark experience . <p> Our clubs were spending significant amounts of money on both potato and tortilla chips , and only a handful of them had what you would consider a strategic partnership with their potato chip provider .

All told , cable and satellite companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on new sponsorships over the past year , ranging from naming rights deals with live entertainment venues to pro sports ties to grassroots event affiliations . <p> A major reason for the stepped up activity is the sound of footsteps encroaching on their turf from the likes of AT&amp;T , Inc.s U-Verse and Verizon Communications , Inc.s FiOS TV .

Time Warner Cable Inc. is number two with 13.3 million subscribers , followed by Cox Communications , Inc. with 5.4 million ; Charter Communications , Inc. with 5.2 million ; and Cablevision Systems Corp . with 3.1 million . <p> At the same time , Cox announced a new agreement with the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AHL All-Star Classic and cosponsor the Chippewa Valley Outdoor Games in Eau Claire , Wis. , among other deals . <p> Although Comcast has long been the most visible sponsor in the category , the latest flurry of activity sees TWC at the forefront . The companys objectives reflect those of its cable brethren <p> TWC , which evaluates and funds deals out of six regional offices , as well as local divisional offices , has increased its sponsorship activity over the last few years to promote its bundled packages , which include digital cable , digital phone and Road Runner high-speed Internet service . <p> TWCs Carolina region is one of the more active offices using sponsorship , taking the two venue titles in North Carolina . <p> " Our business has gone from a pure monopoly to a very competitive business in which we compete with a number of different companies ; this is an opportunity to stake out our turf and say this is our area , " said George Douglas , the regions vice president of marketing . <p> The naming rights deals give TWC a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> " The localized aspect of our business is very important to us .

The company also serves as an associate sponsor of the Richard Childress Racing Sprint Cup Series entry driven by Clint Bowyer , with primary sponsorship at select races . <p> " Sponsorship is another way for us to show leadership in sports and our superior content over cable . We have sports packages that no one else has , " said Josh Stern , DirecTVs director of advertising . <p> DirecTV aligned with IndyCar to promote its high definition programming .

The company uses the tie to promote its DishDVR and TurboHD products . <p> Tips For Working With TV ProvidersBelow , IEG SR shares hot buttons and other insights for properties selling or working with cable or satellite companies : <p> Promote bundled offerings . Properties should provide demonstration opportunities for cable companies to use to promote their full suite of services . <p> For example , TWCs Mid-Ohio division leverages its sponsorship of the NHL Columbus Blue Jackets by providing high definition TVs and offering free long-distance calls and Internet access at the Time Warner HD Lounge in Nationwide Arena . <p> The region activates its partnerships with the MLS Columbus Crew and Triple-A Columbus Clippers with similar programs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from switching to another provider , players in the TV distribution categories seek benefits they can pass along as rewards to promote loyalty . <p> For example , Comcast leverages its title of Everett , Wash.s Comcast Arena by offering discount tickets to concerts and other events . The company alerts customers and directs them to a specified channel to see the latest offers . <p> Provide access to content for video-on-demand . Exclusive content for on-demand channels is a key deal point for cable companies . <p> " Its all about content . The bottom line is , what kind of content can the sponsorship bring to the table ? " said Eric Smallwood , vice president of project management with Front Row Marketing Services , which evaluates and negotiates deals on behalf of Comcast . The agency is a division of Comcast-Spectacor , L.P. , the sports and entertainment arm of Comcast Corp . <p> " Provide them with exclusive content that could not be accessed through a satellite TV company or other non-cable means . " <p> Such content can range from non-game sports programming to activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sponsorship of the NFL Denver Broncos to provide an on-demand feature showing a behind-the-scenes view of the making of the team cheerleaders calendar . <p> Offer pass-through rights to TV networks . Cable companies often look for opportunities to promote the channels and programs they carry through joint promotions . <p> TWC Mid-Ohio frequently works with ESPN , Nickelodeon , TNT and other networks to access costumed characters and other content that it can bring to events . <p> " Our network partners like it because it helps promote their product , " said Judy Barbao , the divisions director of public affairs . <p> Leverage cross-promotion opportunities . Like other sponsors , cable and satellite providers can take advantage of new distribution channels and marketing opportunities offered by cosponsors . <p> Howard Freeman , president and CEO of event producer Promo 1 put the largest sponsors of the Quick Chek New Jersey Festival of Ballooning in association with PNC Bank to work for cosponsor Cablevision . <p> Noticing Verizon was going door to door to tout FiOS TV , Freeman put the cable company together with Quick Chek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . <p> The end result : Cablevision used the partnerships to distribute free coffee and talk up its service to consumers at Quick Chek c-stores and PNC branches in New Jersey . <p> Pay attention to competitive inroads . On the local level , companies may be particularly interested in new deals when a competitor enters the market with new services . <p> For example , Cablevision signed with the Norwalk Oyster Festival on the heels of AT&amp;Ts launch of its U-Verse service in Connecticut , said Gary Marcus , senior vice president of business development with Elite Marketing Group , the cable companys grassroots marketing agency of record , which screens , negotiates and implements ties . <p> Know who to approach . Cable companies primarily screen and fund deals out of regional and local marketing offices . Deals are typically evaluated by marketing vice presidents or directors . <p> Some companies fund deals out of community relations budgets , as well as marketing . <p> For example , TWCs Mid-Ohio division sponsors pro sports teams out of marketing , and the Columbus Arts Festival and other community organizations out of public affairs .

@@37033329 @6033329/ <p> Selling sponsorship to arts and cultural properties has never been easy . Now faced with an economic downturn and especially bad times for the sponsor category that is by far the most active in the arts , marketers of arts properties are pulling out all the stops to reach their revenue goals . <p> Although fallout from the crisis facing many financial services companies is still to be determined , many arts properties no doubt are in a vulnerable position given the preponderance of deals from banks , brokerages and other businesses in the sector ( see chart ) . <p> So what should arts rightsholders do to retain existing partners and secure new deals in such uncertain times ? <p> IEG SR posed that question to some of the most innovative , experienced and successful practitioners in arts and cultural sponsorship . Below is their advice : <p> Offer business-building opportunities . Arts properties should try to move away from program book acknowledgements and other standard benefits in favor of programs that provide business-building opportunities with patrons and other stakeholders . <p> " Most deals offer branding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill down and help sponsors establish a relationship with patrons or donors that will result in new business , " said Jon Holman , president of The Holman Group , a sponsorship sales agency that represents the Houston Grand Opera , Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn. and other arts properties . <p> Often business-building in an arts setting requires no more than offering a sponsor face-to-face interaction with a targeted audience . Case in point : a six-figure sponsorship Holman recently secured with Credit Suisse ( USA ) , Inc. for the opening night gala at the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . <p> " Credit Suisse knew it would get branding in the Los Angeles marketplace through the deal , " Holman said . " But ultimately it signed the sponsorship to play a key role in a gala that attracted high-net-worth celebrities and other patrons and to be able to have 10 of its key executives there to foster relationships with those people . It gave them an exclusive opportunity and a competitive advantage . " <p> Holman said a popular benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to host special events at leading patrons homes . <p> Examples from his clients include Chanel S.A. hosting a private luncheon around its sponsorship of the Houston Grand Opera ; Toyota Motor Sales , U.S.A. , Inc.s Lexus division hosting a reception around its sponsorship of the San Francisco Symphony ; and De Beers S.A. hosting a fundraiser around its sponsorship of the Geffen Playhouse and the organizations renovation effort . <p> " Its all about letting a targeted demographic interact with a brand in a non-threatening way with the implied endorsement of the arts organization , " Holman said . <p> Breathe new life into existing deals . Sponsorships not generating excitement for partners or audiences are in greater jeopardy when companies become worried about spending , thus properties should develop new promotional and activation elements on a regular basis . <p> That is what The Philadelphia Orchestra did around PECO Energy Co.s long-running sponsorship , generating media coverage and buzz for both parties . <p> The orchestra created a one-off event to highlight the utilitys green energy initiatives . <p> The electricity supplied by PECO for the orchestras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind energy . To attract attention to the effort , the orchestra broadcast the live performance to more than 40 colleges and universities , had the conductor applaud PECOs participation and green efforts , and allowed the company to distribute energy-saving kits to audience members . <p> The sponsorship generated extensive media coverage , said Kim Fraites , director of corporate affairs for The Philadelphia Orchestra Assn. , adding that PECO executives were " thrilled " by the coverage . <p> Help sponsors engage employees . Properties should try to provide tickets , volunteer opportunities and other benefits sponsors can share with their employees . <p> A number of arts properties echoed the sentiments of Susan Brady , Carnegie Halls director of development . " As more and more companies look at issues of work/life balance and how they can promote their commitment within their companies , the opportunity to engage employees has come to the fore . " <p> Rather than just offering tickets , Carnegie Hall offers sponsors access to dress rehearsals , chats with artists , the opportunity to volunteer with the organizations community outreach efforts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the involvement of employees also helps companies think twice about dropping a deal when budgets tighten , Brady said . <p> Convert donors into sponsors . The majority of the New Jersey Performing Arts Centers sponsors began their association with the venue as donors , said Peter Hansen , vice president of development . <p> NJPAC has been able to transition such companies by building rapport and relationships with its contacts on the philanthropic side of the company , introducing the subject of marketing-driven sponsorships once the relationship is established and then keeping them apprised of suitable marketing opportunities , Hansen said . <p> " Its all about building trust and gaining internal cheerleaders . We 've had an internal advocate with every donor that we 've converted . Its not just a referral , but an endorsement . " <p> Communicate the importance of sponsors . For sponsors to achieve their objectives , the propertys audience must understand the role partners play and be willing to support the sponsors when they can . <p> NJPAC highlights the importance of its sponsors in a monthly feature in its program book . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its corporate partners . <p> " Our ticket buyers and donors understand that we are a nonprofit , and some of the things we do will never be self-sustaining , " Hansen said . We want to reinforce to them that we need sponsorship to make it work . " <p> NJPAC also is putting more focus on showcasing its partners in local media and on the venues Web site , Hansen said . <p> Offer one-of-a-kind hospitality opportunities . Hard economic times do not eliminate the need for financial services and other B2B marketers to entertain clients and prospects . <p> But there is greater impetus on those programs to deliver new business , so arts properties must offer memorable hospitality experiences and not just tickets to a show , said Bonnie Hillman , president of Arts &amp; Communications , which represents both corporate sponsors and arts and cultural institutions . <p> " Try to create experiences that money ca n't buy , " she said , offering as examples providing access to conductors , curators and other " rock stars " who are willing to participate in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Sponsorship gives us an opportunity to be part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We want to bring our brand to life through ticket sweepstakes and other experiential activities that reinforce consumers enjoyment . <p> With a brand like Coke , awareness is not an issue .

What do motorsports properties such as NASCAR and NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing Series , and your driver deals under the Coca-Cola Racing Family banner , bring to the table ? <p> Reiling : There are a couple of ways that motorsports benefits our company , our brand and the Coca-Cola system . <p> First , motorsports fans understand the role of sponsors , including our logo on vehicles and driver suits and how a 20-ounce bottle of Coke is part of a drivers presence during interviews .

How has your approach changed over the years ? <p> Reiling : There has been an evolution in our approach to motorsports . That evolution is not exclusive to motorsports : Just like everything we do , we constantly look at the consumer and retail landscape , and how our business is adjusting and evolving . <p> One area of change is the evolution of social media and how race fans consume the sport . We are paying more attention to that type of communication and the best way to reach fans . <p> For example , we have established the Coca-Cola Racing Twitter site as a platform to communicate and interact with fans . Race fans want to hear from their favorite drivers , and we have enlisted members of the Coca-Cola Racing Family . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .

It gives us an opportunity to reach thousands of people during a weekend . <p> IEG SR : Why did you add Kurt Busch to the Coca-Cola Racing Family this year . <p> Reiling : We added Kurt because he represents the spirit of our brand , not just from a TV or print standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers in a positive manner . <p> We have 10 Sprint Cup drivers in the Family program . We leverage the relationships at the point of sale , through out-of-home media and the My Coke Rewards program . <p> In addition to the 10 drivers , we also maintain relationships with former drivers such as Richard Petty and Ned Jarrett to give us more breadth throughout the year . We conduct more than 130 driver appearances each year . The program gives our customer teams and bottlers the opportunity to bring the drivers to life in local markets . <p> IEG SR : You have a new partnership with Buschs team , Penske Racing . What does that add ? <p> Reiling : Penske is a tremendous business organization , which is an added benefit . We use all of our relationships with race teams to look for business-to-business opportunities . <p> We are still early in the relationship , and we are still discussing a number of things . But think about the number of vehicles the Coke system has on the road . One portion of Penskes business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations . <p> In any relationship we have , whether its Joe Gibbs Racing , Richard Childress Racing , Stewart-Haas Racing or Roush Fenway Racing , we look for business opportunities to work together . But it has to be good for them and good for us . <p> IEG SR : Can you share a B2B success story ? <p> Reiling : Several years ago we welcomed Tony Stewart into the Coca-Cola Racing Family , as well as Home Depot , his primary sponsor at the time . We worked with Home Depot to place vending machines in Home Depot locations . Joey Logano has taken the drivers seat for Home Depot , but the relationship still exists today . <p> Tony Stewart moved on to Office Depot , and we now sell in Office Depot locations . <p> IEG SR : Any new activation programs planned for 2011 ? <p> Reiling : There are two highlights this year . First , we have some initiatives in place around Cokes 125th anniversary . We will bring that celebration to life through our NASCAR partnership . <p> We also plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .

Its not very often you get to walk around the field before the Super Bowl or a baseball game . This program allows consumers to walk the hallowed ground where their heroes will be competing . Its a very uplifting experience . <p> We will have five events this year , some of which are new markets . People loved the program , and we will continue to look at how we can expand it . <p> IEG SR : How does Coca-Cola evaluate success of its partnerships ? <p> Reiling : We measure a combination of elements .

We will look at a number of key markets and , from a NASCAR or NHRA standpoint , we will work with local teams to measure the number of activation plans put into place , how many customers activated a partnership , and our volume and share numbers . From there , we can glean a profitability number . <p> We also use syndicated data and proprietary research to determine whether or not customers are walking away with a more favorable impression of Coke or Coke Zero , and if our awareness scores that result from programs that we 've put in place with NASCAR and the NHRA are as strong as those associated with the Olympics and NCAA.

@@37033345 @6033345/ <p> Once content to use sponsorship to gain face time with listeners and perhaps a handful of pass-through rights to offer advertisers , radio stations now view events as their go-to medium for generating non-traditional revenue . <p> The landscape for radio station sponsorships changed dramatically in the wake of industry consolidation , leaving events with fewer options when seeking radio station partners and less bargaining power in negotiating deals . <p> Today , properties seeking to sign new radio sponsors or retain existing ones must be prepared to answer the one question that all prospects and current partners have : " What do you have that we can sell ? " <p> The core concept is helping radio partners earn revenue that is not based on the sale of ad spots . Where once stations concentrated on securing pass-through rights to offer sponsorship benefits as added value to advertisers , the emphasis has shifted to viewing events as sources of NTR , non-traditional revenue . <p> According to the Radio Advertising Bureaus most recent survey , 86 percent of radio stations increased their non-traditional revenue activity in 04 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce themselves , as well as those they sponsor or partner withas their primary vehicle for securing non-advertising dollars . <p> Radio stations need for NTR is fueled by several factors . For one , advertisers are demanding that in addition to spots , purveyors of traditional media provide integrated marketing platforms that offer one-to-one interaction and other meaningful ways of communicating with audiences . As their print and TV counterparts ramp up their ability to do just that , radio must keep pace . <p> NTR programs also allow radio stations the opportunity to tap into corporate promotion and sponsorship budgets . <p> " Advertising dollars are not growing as quickly as sponsorship dollars . As budgets shift , stations need to find additional revenue opportunities , " said Elaine Clark , general manager of Revenue Development Systems , Inc. , an NTR consultancy . <p> In some cases , stations also view sponsorship as a way simply to gain incremental inventory to sell . Unlike print media , radio stations can not increase the amount of airtime dedicated to ad spots without compromising the listening experience . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left looking for other fields from which to mine revenue . <p> Nowhere is that more evident than with Clear Channel Radios Less Is More initiative . The nine-month-old program reduces the number of hourly ads and promotional interruptions across the 1,200 stations owned by Clear Channel Communications , Inc . That has prompted many of those stations to scout new sponsorship opportunities to make up for the lost inventory . <p> How Radio Station Deals WorkThe methods through which radio stations generate money through partnerships with properties vary greatly , but can typically be boiled down to two scenarios : The station secures from the rightsholder the right to sell and retain sponsorship revenue in several categories , or it gains the rights to all sponsorship inventory and agrees to share a portion of the subsequent revenue with the property . <p> The initial determination to be made in each scenario is the value of the rights changing hands and how the station will pay . While property owners most often prefer cash fees , many stations will seek to buy out rights in exchange for promotional support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that promotion time has a real dollar value . A potential sale is lost when space or time is given up , " Clark said . <p> Thus an important step for properties seeking radio deals is to determine how valuable radio promotion is to their organization and its sponsors . In many cases , such exposure will have a value that is much higher than a cash payment because it will help sell tickets and recruit other sponsors . <p> For example , event producer Promo One earlier this year aligned with two Clear Channel radio stations to promote a new community festival in Syracuse , N.Y . ( IEG SR , March 7 , 2005 ) . The two parties inked a revenue-sharing agreement that gave Clear Channel the right to sell and retain sponsorship revenue in the automobile , beer , wireless and other categories , as well as a cut of ticket and concession sales . <p> The partnership with the radio stations gave the upstart event instant credibility and access to salespeople with local connections , said Howard Freeman , Promo One president . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas for properties on effectively pitching and working with radio stations : <p> Learn station demographics and ownership structure . Properties need to reach out to stations whose listeners mirror their audience . If more than one station matches the target profile , the property should research their recent sponsorship histories and pitch the most active sponsor . <p> Each of the companies that dominate the radio landscape , including Clear Channel , Entercom Communications Corp . and Viacom , Inc.s Infinity Broadcasting Corp. , typically own several stations in a market . These " clusters " sponsor on behalf of both multiple stations and individual ones . <p> " We share resources among our stations , but at the end of the day , what is good for one station may not be good for another , " said Elisabeth Logan , marketing development manager with Clear Channel Radios Cleveland cluster , which owns six stations . <p> While sponsorships in her cluster most often are for a single station , Clear Channel Radio Cleveland did support the Body Worlds 2 exhibition at the Great Lakes Science Center on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , Logan said . <p> Properties should note that the appropriate points of contact for stations that are owned by large radio companies and are in major-market clusters , are people with positions similar to Logans and who work in a central office . Typically such cluster offices have dedicated NTR staffers , often with titles such as business development managers . <p> At individual stations , start with the general manager . When a property approaches a station not affiliated with a cluster , radio insiders say it is a mistake to begin the sales process by reaching out to the promotions or marketing departments , even though they work most directly on events . The better approach is to start at the top , with the stations GM . <p> " A lot of events do n't  understand why they do n't  get their calls returned . Marketing directors , program directors and general sales managers are all important , but the general manager is the decision-maker , " said Sheila Kirby , senior vice president of Interep Innovations , Inc. , the marketing division of Interep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generate significant revenue . " Radio stations cant afford to align with an event without having the potential to receive multiples in return , " said Clark . <p> Higher-level packages such as title or presenting sponsor will gain the most attention . " They 're not interested in selling booths for $500 a pop , " Clark said . " Radio stations want an opportunity to put together customized packages based on their clients needs . " <p> Rightsholders also should be prepared to offer lucrative categories to their radio station partners . " Events should n't give radio stations the widget category , " said Kirby . <p> Properties should consider offering radio partners the opportunity to sell other + la carte inventory , such as program advertising or signage . Rightsholders also should be prepared to share contact lists with radio stations . <p> Approach deals as partnerships . " In each deal you have to see what each party can bring to the table and negotiate a deal that is fair and gives each player the maximum incentive to generate as much revenue as possible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties should pay attention to what the other is doing . For example , rightsholders should work with radio partners to make sure that they are incenting their sales people to sell sponsorship . Typically , this means structuring bonuses and commissions for NTR sales that are on-par with spot sales . <p> " The reality is a salesman will do what 's best for him . Rightsholders need to understand the reality of the situation and work with the station on a payment package that provides maximum incentive , " said Freeman . <p> Spell out specifics of stations commitment . Rightsholders should insist that their radio partners be as detailed as possible in terms of what they are delivering to the property . <p> When negotiating promotional spots , for example , properties should ask the station when the spots will run and the number of sponsors they can include in the spots . <p> " When negotiating a deal , I ask for X number of spots with a minimum of two sponsor mentions , " said Ellen Ornato , president of Solutions PR &amp; Marketing , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key question is , Will the spots run during the day or at 3 a.m. ? You have to get specific schedules . " <p> Ornato also recommends that properties review promotional spots before they are recorded . Thats advice she learned the hard way : " One promotional spot for an event I represented said the event was brought to you by the radio station . It did not mention the presenting sponsor that paid $25,000 for that privilege . The sponsor called me and they were flipping out . " <p> Help stations demonstrate ROI to sponsors . Just as properties face increased demand from sponsors for help in measuring return , radio stations have the same pressure from NTR clients . <p> " They have to work with clients on their goals and design packages that help them achieve and measure those goals , " added Clark . Common metrics for measuring ROI from radio-connected events include coupon redemptions , mailing lists and the number of products sampled , she said . <p> Be prepared to work with consultants . Many radio stations work with NTR consultancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consultants such as RDS and Morrison and Abraham , Inc. can play a large role in putting partnerships together . <p> Properties also should find out the role played in sponsorship , if any , by a stations media rep firm . Most stations use such firms to sell time to non-local advertisers . Some of the larger players include Clear Channel Katz Advantage and Interep National Radio Sales . <p> Explore non-exclusive relationships . A number of properties , especially nonprofit and community-based events , have been able to recruit competing radio stations as sponsors by ensuring that they do n't  overlap in either exposure or in the categories they are able to sell . <p> For example , the multi-sport Canada Summer Games secured $1 million worth of in-kind radio support from two radio stations by carving out exclusive inventory for two sponsors . <p> " We convinced them this was a community initiative and that they both needed to be on board .

However , it is no longer exposure , impressions generated or image transfer that drives and determines value .

It changes the conversation from exposing sponsors to a large amount of people ( which shouldnt have been the idea anyway ) to identifying , understanding and communicating one-on-one with a brands best targets . <p> One client we work with has illustrated this through an innovative partnership activation with its official airline . Using in-depth analysis and customer segmentation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for transatlantic flights , one of the partners key growth objectives . <p> Instead of blanket targeting using one message to the clients audience introducing a new partner , the client was able to build multi-channel campaigns to build brand awareness among the general fan base , while specifically targeting the top prospects for a series of upcoming exclusive events . Throughout the campaign , the client helped the partner track and measure progress not just in media exposure , but in customer awareness and , critically , acquisition . <p> While successful sponsors of the past achieved positive return through creative and relevant activations , the above example shows how data takes things to a new level , allowing for : <p> Better determination of fit between a brands target and the rightsholders audience <p> Rightsholders must recognize that changes to the media landscape have changed the game for sponsorship . As marketing budgets have had to work harder , sponsorship has come under increasing scrutiny . Leading rightsholders are therefore investing in the technology and expertise required to show brands that their properties are worth more than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys . <p> What Brands Are Looking For <p> Among the new set of questions asked by brands exploring sponsorship opportunities are : " Is the potential partner a data-driven organization with good information that is connected and accessible ? " and " Is it willing and able to analyze and share data insights to help us maximize the value of this investment ? " <p> Putting any opportunity ( or current partnership ) to that test is an effective first screen for filtering out properties not ready to meet sponsors requirements for next-generation partnerships that deliver results . For a start , brands are digging below the surface of the usual numbers presented by rightsholders . Many properties tout fan numbersrunning into hundreds of millions for global opportunitiesthat do n't  stand up to scrutiny . Likewise , a database of 30 million people is useless if none of these people are engaged with the rightsholders communications . <p> Forward-thinking brands are able to ascertain a propertys ability not only to hold a large number of strong direct customer relationships , but deliver value through those relationships . First and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential partner understands its own audience : what insight and profiling capability it has , and how this information informs its approach to activation . If the rightsholder can not overlay a brands customer segmentation rules onto its own customer database , the brand will question the propertys capability in this space . <p> Rightsholders able to organize and connect data can go far beyond telling you they average one million television viewers per match , have 20 million Twitter followers , three million website visitors per month and 19,000 members . They can tell you who each of those people are in terms of what they do , where they live , what they buy , and more . <p> Second , brands need to be confident of the propertys ability to act on the data it holds . This means having a marketing and communications strategy in place that is fully integrated with their sponsorship activation plans . All too often rightsholders see activation as an afterthought and an obligation , rather than an opportunity to provide truly additive experiences for fans . <p> Until now , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto sponsor : " Our research shows that 14 percent of our fans own your make of car and 35 percent of our audience will be in the market for a new vehicle in the next 18 months . " Using current data analysis tools , rightsholders can sayand sponsors should expect to hear " We can individually identify which of our customers are in the market for a new car , their current vehicles make and model , and their proximity to a dealer , in addition to knowing the activation platforms that will be most effective at getting them to visit a dealership for a test drive . " <p> A leading-edge rightsholder should be able to offer this level of capability to brand owners throughout the relationship cycle . This requires them to blend a volume of direct customer relationshipsbalanced with technical capability , analytic skill and customer empathyto engage on the brands behalf with the right message to the right customer through the right channel at the right time . And , of course , evaluate the impact of doing so . <p> Properties primed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer segments are , and will be ableusing datato map their audience against those segments to demonstrate where they reach the same group or groups . <p> Building on that knowledge , they can be proactive in helping to develop a bespoke activation strategy , including segmented activation campaigns to reach marketable individuals in their sphere of influence , be they current brand purchasers , prospects or lapsed customers . Recently , we worked with a rightsholder and its core automotive partner to specifically target customers of competing car brands for test drives at the rightsholders events . One-hundred percent of test-drive places were filled with high-value customers from rival brands . <p> Rightsholders with a firm grasp on their data should be willing participants in helping their brand partners measure return on objectives and return on investment . This is currently a service that is severely lacking in sponsorship . According to IEGs most recent survey of sponsor decision-makers , assistance measuring ROO and ROI was the most desired property-provided service , ranked as a 9 or 10 in importance on a 10-point scale by 42 percent of sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping with measurement , 73 percent of sponsors said they did not . <p> The data-driven rightsholder clients we are privileged to work with commit to their partners that regardless of the client channel a customer engages with , they will track customer conversion and demonstrate a tangible return . Rightsholders should be bringing evidence of having driven ROI for previous partners to the table as part of any initial conversations . This is about more than media value or an estimation of its equivalent . In the auto sponsor example above , the rightsholder was able to quantify the hard value of a test drive to the sponsor . <p> What the Future Has in Store <p> We are working with a handful of forward-thinking rightsholders that are taking the next steps in data-enabled sponsorship marketing . These entities have seized on the big idea that their exclusive customer information can allow them to offer unparalleled digital marketing solutions to brands . <p> For the majority of rightsholders , sponsorship predominantly has been an asset playbrands could buy the real estate on the front of a jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drive for exposure . But brands have always been interested in the audience , not just the asset . <p> For the first time , leading rightsholders are in a position to put the brand in contact with exactly the right audience to be able to achieve its objectivesas well as able to activate across first-party and third-party channels using a variety of digital media inventory . <p> This represents a seismic shift in the sponsorship conversation . Instead of nitpicking over an off-the-shelf package of rights , brands and organizations proposing sponsorship opportunities can have a productive discussion about target markets , demographics , preferred channels and desired outcomes .

@@37033363 @6033363/ <p> Some sponsors looking to minimize their cash outlays or recoup dollars spent on unwanted assets and benefits are turning to corporate trading specialists for help . <p> While bartering is not a new phenomenon in sponsorship , corporate partners , properties and go-betweens continue to develop new twists to finding solutions that satisfy each partys needs . <p> For example , trading specialist ICON Intl , Inc. has worked on a number of sponsorship deals over the past few years , each with a unique set of variables . In general , ICONs sponsorship projects take one of three shapes : <p> Financing the fee payment of a new or existing sponsorship Financing the buyout of a sponsorship a company wants to exit Taking unwanted or unsold inventory off the hands of sponsors or properties <p> Although ICONs core business reflects the scenario envisioned by many people when they hear the terms " corporate barter " or " corporate trading " a middleman takes a companys excess inventory in exchange for credit that can be used to acquire products or services from the middlemans other trading partnersdeals typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of ICONs sponsorship arrangements include a cash component as well . Thus companies that do n't  have distressed assets to trade can still participate . <p> Often , sponsors use cash and the trade credits issued by ICON to purchase media buys through the firm . That is because a great deal of the inventory that ICON and other barter specialists have to offer clients is advertising time or space that has been traded for or purchased outright . <p> " Media is the engine that drives the train , " said Brian Mieth , ICONs vice president of sports and event marketing . Other inventory in which barter firms typically acquire " futures " includes hotel rooms , printing company press runs and trucking cargo space . <p> Below , IEG SR details how each of the three scenarios above might work . <p> Offsetting Cash Fees Through BarterICONs typical sponsorship funding program is basically an added-value offer . In exchange for a companys commitment to purchase media from ICON , the firm will pay the companys sponsorship fee to a property for a new or existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsorship fee is seven-to-1 , Mieth said . For example , if a company wanted a $1 million sponsorship , ICON would pay that amount to the property in return for a commitment from the sponsor to purchase $7 million worth of media from ICON ( see Figure 1 ) . <p> Assuming that company was already planning to spend at least $7 million on media , it essentially receives a free sponsorship for spending it with ICON . This allows the company to allocate the sponsorship funds to other properties or for an entirely different purpose . <p> Such an arrangement was at the heart of a deal ICON structured for TD Waterhouse Group , Inc.prior to the brokerages acquisition earlier this year by Ameritrade Holding Corp . The agreement routed a significant amount of TD Waterhouses media spending through ICON in exchange for the barter firm paying off the final three years of the companys deal to title the TD Waterhouse Centre in Orlando . <p> Barter As An Alternative To Buying Out ContractsIf a sponsor decides that a sponsorship has run its course before the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be far less painful for both sponsor and property than the corporate partner paying an exit fee and winding up with nothing . <p> ICON offers sponsors two exit strategy options , one in which it takes over the rights fee payment in exchange for a contractually committed media buy and the other in which it offers the sponsor trade credits equal to the companys obligation to the property . <p> In the first case , the deal essentially works the same as in the added-value scenario aboveincluding the seven-to-one ratio , with the exception that ICON takes ownership of the sponsorships rights and benefits , which it can offer to another client interested in a partnership with the property ( see Figure 2 ) . <p> In the second case , the sponsor continues to make its payments to the property but is compensated by ICON with an equal amount of trade credits that it can put toward a media buy or other goods and services available through ICON ( see Figure 3 ) . <p> To be able to use those credits , ICON requires that the sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ratio can vary based on the type of goods obtained , Mieth said . <p> Thus if a sponsor has a $1 million obligation left to a property , it would receive $1 million in trade credits from ICON . It would then be required to obtain $5 million in products or services through ICON , spending only $4 million in cash for them . <p> Offloading Unwanted And Unsold InventoryGiven that corporate trading began as a way to relieve companies of extraneous goods , this is perhaps sponsorship barter in its " purest " form . <p> As was the case with a recent ICON client , if a sponsor receives a large number of TV ad units as part of a title sponsorship of a golf tournament but does not want to use them all because it has only one creative execution , it can turn over those ad units to ICONwho will remarket themin exchange for trade credits . <p> The unused inventory does not have to be media-based . For example , Golf Digest traded hospitality benefits it did not need from a golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into integrated sales packages . <p> Mieth noted that trade credits can be useful in extending the shelf life of other sponsorship-related items , such as airline ticket vouchers , that have expiration dates . " Instead of liquidating the asset , the owner of those benefitswhether its a sponsor or a propertygets something out of them , " he said . <p> Properties also can take advantage of barter to help with unsold sponsorship packages , receiving trade credits in exchange for granting the barter firm the right to remarket the benefits . <p> ICON worked with the inaugural Ginn Clubs &amp; Resorts Open LPGA tour stop earlier this year . The firm was contacted by Westport , Conn. -based sports management company Pantheon Intl , LLC , which co-owns the April event with title sponsor The Ginn Co . <p> The three parties negotiated an agreement that had the tournament providing ICON with a package of benefits that it could resell . ICON gave the property $300,000 in trade credits , some of which it eventually used to acquire TVs for its hospitality tents . Finally , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in TV spots it had planned to promote both the tournament and the companys real estate developments . <p> " The trade credits were budget relieving for the tournament , " said Tim Kramer , Pantheons vice president of sponsorship marketing . " Its a unique way for a property to be able to monetize unsold inventory and prevent assets from going undervalued , as ICON takes those assets at full value . " <p> The primary deal also had an offshoot . ICON learned that The Ginn Co. did not think it was optimal to use all 17 spots it had during CBS coverage of the events final two rounds . ICON took more than half of those spots and gave the developer trade credits that it can use to obtain media avails whenever it feels it needs them . <p> Because the main deal occurred so closely to the event , ICON did not resell the sponsorship benefits . But for similar transactions in the future , Mieth said the firm would look to offer the package to a client or leverage it as added value to incent a deal .

The number of solar installations in the U.S. grew 41 percent from Q3 2013 to Q3 2014 , the second-largest quarter ever for solar installations , according to the Solar Energy Industries Assn . <p> Solar energy companies use sponsorship to accomplish the following : <p> Build awareness <p> Drive demand <p> Gain business from sponsored properties <p> Showcase expertise in action <p> Generate sales leads <p> Yingli Green Energy is one of the industrys largest sponsors at the global level . The company sponsored the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa , 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and is negotiating a deal with the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia . Yingli also sponsors Germanys FC Bayern Munich . <p> Yingli uses sponsorship to promote solar on the global stage . <p> " We partnered with FIFA because we wanted to raise awareness of solar energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not otherwise be exposed to solar energy , " said Judy Tzeng Lee , Yingli vice president of global marketing . <p> Yingli activates sponsorship to demonstrate solars affordability and accessibility . The company leveraged the 2014 FIFA World Cup with in-stadium charging stations , solar-powered information towers , ticket giveaways and other activities under the " All Under One Sun " marketing campaign . <p> " Our sponsorships have yielded significant return in terms of brand awareness and name recognition that have provided invaluable , especially when entering emerging markets . " <p> The San Francisco 49ers identified solar as one of several go-to categories prior to the construction of Levis Stadium in Santa Clara , Calif . The goal : create a gold LEED certified stadium that will serve as a model for sustainability . <p> " We wanted to reshape how stadiums are built moving forward , " said Ethan Casson , the San Francisco 49ers chief revenue officer . <p> To accomplish that task , the team worked with NRG to install 1,162 solar panels throughout Levis Stadium .

The company installed a solar canopy at Coachella , a practice it plans to replicate at other music festivals . <p> " We cant make them completely sustainable , but were taking steps to get them there , " said Christine Brown , NGR Energys senior director of sponsorships and events . <p> Below , three other ways NRG activated Coachella : <p> Electric vehicle charging . NRG promoted its eVgo charging network by offering customers free charges on their way to the festival . <p> The roads to Coachella from Los Angeles and San Diego have numerous eVgo charging stations , said Brown , noting that the drive to the festival from the two cities is farther than the range of most electric vehicles on a single charge . <p> " It demonstrated that electric vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> NRG also offered preferential parking for electric vehicles in the Coachella parking lot and free charges for eVgo customers . <p> Goal Zero and the Re-Charge campground .

What got us here is not going to get us there , and we brought in a new CEO in 2014 . <p> Brians goal is to do a couple of things . The first goal is to reduce the complexities at our corporate office , and the second goal is to promote signature categories that will help differentiate Target in the future . <p> Style , wellness , kids and babies are the four categories that well double down on in 2015 and beyond . <p> On Targets evolving customer base Six or seven months ago we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What we found , over time , is that our core guest is a boomer mom . She drove a minivan , lived in a nice house in the suburb and wanted it all . She wanted her job and her kids and the crazy life that goes with it . <p> Fast forward 10 or 12 years , and our guest has changed a bit . The boomer mom still shops at our stores , but the new guest that were looking at is more diverse , more millennial , more Hispanic , more technologically advanced and more urban . <p> Even things that worked a little bit in the past will have to go away because were not going to have the resources to figure them out . If it does n't  ladder up to style , babies , kids and wellness and extend cultural leadership , well have to take a break . <p> On Targets evolving motorsports program We have been with Chip Ganassi Racing for 26 years , and the partnership continues to inhale and exhale depending on the needs of the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of engagement we have with race fans . As a whole , we found that we have relatively low fan engagement . We werent telling our story properly , and that required a shift in assets . <p> Target has sponsored the racing community for 26 years , and we have invested millions of dollars in the sport . More people in the racing community shop at Walmart than Target . Where is the loyalty ? We werent engaging them in the right way . <p> We got rid of one of the cars that we sponsor in the Verizon IndyCar Series , and we invested that money in a marketing campaign that included broadcast , digital and paid social , all under the guise of driving fan engagement . <p> Our vendor partners help our race program go . We need fans not only to shop at Target , we need them to recognize that without Energizer , Coca-Cola and other companies our race program would n't exist . We created the concept of " Together We Win , " which we debuted at the Daytona 500 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so good . <p> Was it a tough conversation with Chip Ganassi Racing ? They said yes , we get it . Its the right thing to do. We keep the best of both words with Kyle Larsonour young gun in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Seriesand Scott Dixon , who has been in our Verizon IndyCar Series car for 13 years . <p> On using strategic partnerships to promote music Target is one of the last retailers that actually cares about music . Music occupies a very special place in the soul of societyyou attach your most wonderful experiences to music . Its also a place where we differentiate ourselves from our competitors . All of our CDs have incremental or exclusive tracks that you can only buy at Target . That model has worked well for us over the years . <p> A proof point is our exclusive relationship with Taylor Swift . We sold more Taylor Swift CDs than any other CD in the history of Target . <p> Last year we stole the show at the Grammy Awards with the Imagine Dragons and this year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told CBS that wed like to buy four consecutive minutes of time during the Grammy Awards broadcast , and that we 'd like to cut from the live Grammys feed to a live show in Las Vegas with the Imagine Dragons performing one song in front of 300 super fans . They said that is exactly the kind of thing they 're looking for . <p> The goal was to drive engagement , and we accomplished it . We were the number two trending hashtag worldwide during and after the performance , and the number one hashtag in the United States . Our Net Sentiment was 97 percent positive , which eclipsed anything we have ever done before . We eclipsed more than one billion media impressions in less than 48 hours . <p> What made me most proud is that the advertising industry and our colleagues in the marketing world really did n't  know what to call it . Is it a commercial ? Content marketing ? Native advertising ? Its a good thing if you can stump people along the way . <p> On the importance of storytelling Every investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my team to be the best storytellers on the planet . <p> To do that , you have to learn from the best . I have hired scriptwriters who have won Oscars , songwriters who have won Grammys and poets and newspaper reporters to speak to my team and help them understand what it takes to build a story arc . <p> This is a skill you have to learn over time . There are very few people who are actually born with the skill of storytelling . You can learn it , as we have proven . <p> At Target its more of a love story , not just a story about the love that guests have for Target or how we love our guests . The " Expect More Pay Less " brand promise is the love affair between those two concepts , and the gentle tension between those two things that ultimately have catapulted Target to success . Its a brilliant statement .

Then Pepsi famously passed on sponsoring " Idol " in its first season and Coke jumped at the opportunity . <p> The rest is history . <p> " American Idol " far exceeded expectations , averaging 12.7 million viewers in that first season when it aired during the sleepy summer months , prompting Fox to move it to its regular season . <p> The show " brought Coke to viewers young and old alike , as ' Idol ' at the time had a younger-than-average median @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that truly crossed generations , " said Billie Gold , VP-director of buying and programming research , Carat .

The 13-season partnership included the branding of the show 's green room into a " red room " and its " Perfect Harmony " program , which enlists fans to write a song to be performed by a pop star in the finale . Coke also routinely used " Idol " to launch new ad campaigns like the ongoing " Open Happiness " effort , which broke during an episode in early 2009 . <p> Coca-Cola 's decision to end its partnership with " American Idol " signals another blow to the sagging TV show and closes a significant chapter in the cola wars . <p> What made the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior VP-content strategy at sponsorship consultancy IEG .

Jewel-Osco said the ad was congratulatory and not a commercial use . Were not promoting any product or services. The court said no , you 're promoting Jewel-Osco. <p> Many companies want to send out a congratulatory ad to be part of the conversation when someone wins the Stanley Cup or the Super Bowl . They key takeaway is that simply congratulating a newsworthy event is n't necessarily newsworthy in the eyes of the law . You might have to get legal permission or talk to your legal department about the risk because it could result in a lawsuit from a celebrity or a team . <p> Bogart Estate and Burberry <p> Here we have Humphrey Bogart in a Burberry trench coat in Casablanca .

Below , they share four steps properties can take to find new sponsors . <p> Step #1 : Do Your Homework The prospecting process begins with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both the regional and national level . <p> " The biggest effort we make is education . We read the trades , newspapers and online articles to stay on top of what major companies and advertisers are doing , " said David Lehanski , the NHLs group vice president of integrated sales . <p> Local market developments . For local properties , the educational process begins with an understanding of the local business community . That includes companies moving into the area , expanding their local presence or gearing up a new brand or product launch . <p> Those developments often lead to new sponsorship activity . <p> Case in point : The QuickChek New Jersey Festival of Ballooning in association with PNC Bank this year secured a partnership with Farmers Insurance following the companys launch in the Garden State . <p> Sellers can also take advantage of hometown companies that are expanding their local reach . Creative Strategies Group brought on Belco Community Credit Union as a sponsor of the Cherry Creek Arts Festival presented by Janus following the companys expansion in the Denver market . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out what 's going on and where they are growing , " said Bruce Erley , CSG president , who reps the Denver-based event . <p> The sales agency also looks for companies moving into Colorado , a market where most of its clients are located . One company under consideration : Mrs. Fields Original Cookies , Inc. , which is in the process of moving its corporate headquarters to Broomfield , Colo. from Salt Lake City . <p> Out-of-market activity . Rightsholders should also monitor sponsorship activity at similar types of properties located in other markets . <p> " If a mobile technology company is sponsoring the Tribeca Film Festival , there may be a company in the category that might be interested in sponsoring an art festival in Denver , " said Erley . " We try to glean leads from what others are doing . " <p> Sellers should also consider advertisers that target a similar demographic . <p> Howard Freeman , president of Promo Onethe producer of the QuickChek New Jersey Festival of Ballooning and other eventslooks for companies that advertise on family-friendly TV and radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got rid of my subscription to Sirius satellite radio because there werent any commercials , " he said . <p> In a different twist , Freeman tries to take advantage of sponsorship developments at nearby properties . The sales vet plans to approach former sponsors of the NBA Brooklyn Nets that decided not to follow the teams move from Newark , N.J. to New York City . <p> " Those companies need an opportunity to replace the Nets . As a festival , were not dependent on winning and losing , and we can provide the perfect platform to activate against their initiatives . " <p> Corporate anniversaries . Companies are increasingly using sponsorship to promote anniversaries and other corporate milestones . <p> Among recent activity , Sun-Maid this year partnered with the California State Fair to promote its 100th anniversary , while Union Pacific Corp . sponsored Cheyenne Frontier Days presented by Bank of the West , the Nebraska State Fair and other events to promote its 150th anniversary . <p> " Its easier to convince an experienced company about a festival sponsorship than a company that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sellers take the opposite tact . Premier Partnerships , has sold multi-million naming rights deals to companies with no previous involvement in sponsorship . Those include Dolby Laboratories , Inc.s recent title of the former Kodak Theatre . <p> " Companies rarely look to buy naming rights until they buy naming rights . The same goes for big-time investments in other major events , " said Randy Bernstein , president of Premier Partnerships . <p> The key : offering " killer applications " the prospect can use to break through the clutter and accomplish its marketing objectives , he said . <p> " Non-traditional companies are thirsty for unique associations . " <p> Step #3 : Go Wide And Deep While finding contacts was once a challenge , the advent of social media and other online tools has made the process significantly easier . <p> Online databases . Sellers can use The List , Hoovers.com and other subscription-based online services to identify corporate decision-makers . The sites offer contacts ranging from C-level execs to brand managers . <p> Social media . A growing number of properties are using LinkedIn.com to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ask a mutual connection to make an introduction . <p> In a different twist , Erley uses social media to identify potential partners . The sponsorship seller plans to approach two companies that tweeted or retweeted tweets for the Coldwell Banker Denver Century Ride presented by Rickenbaugh Cadillac Volvo &amp; Stapleton , an event CSG owns . <p> " Were mining data on who is engaging our social media sites , " he said . <p> CSG this year leveraged its relationship with Coldwell Banker to access new sponsors for the Coldwell Banker Denver Century Ride . Those include two companies that want to build relations with the real estate brokerage : Johnson Storage and Moving and Metrolist , Inc. , a multiple listing service . <p> " We used Coldwell Banker as an opportunity to get them on board , " said Erley . <p> Agencies . With sports marketing , media buyers and other types of agencies playing an increasingly larger role in sponsorship , properties would be well served by keeping an open line of communication with agency contacts . <p> That is a tactic used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has placed more focus on keeping agencies apprised of open categories and other new developments . <p> " Most buys flow through advertising and promotions agencies , and we want to make sure we have good relations , " said Lehanski . <p> The sports league has placed more focus on advertising and media buying agencies as it expands inventory on NHL.com and the NHL Network , he said . <p> Press releases . One easy but often overlooked source for contacts : sponsorship-related press releases . <p> Case in point : The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis secured a partnership with The Procter &amp; Gamble Co.s Swiffer brand after researching Swiffer press releases to identify a contact at the consumer packaged goods company . <p> Step #4 : Host Prospects While sellers can explain a sponsorship opportunity in a proposal , some go one step further by hosting prospects at the event . <p> " I believe festivals sell themselves better in person . Not everyone knows your event , how successful it is and how beneficial it can be for a sponsor , " said Diane Hampton , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The festival used the strategy to secure a deal with Bush Brothers &amp; Co.s Bushs Baked Beans , she said . <p> When hosting prospects , properties should demonstrate how other sponsors are activating the event . " We want them to see how other sponsors interact and to envision how a partnership may benefit their organization , " said Erley . <p> The event is not the place for a hard sell , he said . " It comes down to kicking the tires , establishing your credibility and an understanding of the event . " <p> Needless to say , properties should roll out the red carpet for prospects . Shamrock Sports &amp; Entertainment offers prospects the opportunity to attend once-in-a-lifetime experiences such as dinner with Richard Childress at Childress Vineyards . <p> The sponsorship sales agency also offers behind-the-scenes experiences for prospects and their families at SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment properties . <p> " Seeing is believing . The only way to showcase a property and the passion of fans is by bringing prospects to an event , " said Brian Corcoran , SSE president .

The industry has incorporated those learnings and sponsorship " mavens " from near and far have incorporated those ideas into their books , blogs and practices . <p> We at IEG moved from teaching and preaching to consulting , valuing and measuring with modeling and analytics . However , working with a fine nonprofit recently reaffirmed what I 'd encountered over the last year at speeches and gatheringsa new generation of visionaries launching events , festivals and nonprofits were falling short on sponsorship sales because they lacked some basic guidelines . This post is for the newbies : <p> Sell solutions not sponsorship . Before picking up the phone or sending the proposal , identify your value proposition . What 's the big idea ? How would sponsorship of your event be meaningful to your fans , your property and the prospects business ? <p> Sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you need money to produce a concert in the park , does not mean that is what you should be selling . Your strongest assets may be something else entirely , such as access to your influential board of directors and the opportunity for year-round promotions to your Facebook community . Remember , sponsorship feesunlike philanthropic donationsare unrestricted . <p> Highlight benefits , not features . Focus on the prospects need to build their business , not your need to sell . And do not expect a prospect to wade through your data dump and figure out what they want . <p> Do n't  prorate your packages . Give prospects a reason to buy at the highest level . Reserve key benefits for your biggest sponsors rather than prorating your benefits and making them available to partners at every level . <p> Tailor to sponsor category . Identify what your prospect wants to accomplish and who it wants to reach . This will vary by category and requires research into the categorys hot buttons and budget priorities , e.g. , automakers want to generate qualified test drives ; biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the category at once . Once you understand the category , do not send out proposals one at time as it will take you years to get through the category . If there 's a fit for one company in the category , likely you can apply it to the others . <p> Sign your media partners first . Having media sponsors signals to prospects that your property will be high profile and minimizes their risk in signing . <p> Do n't  send a proposal until after the initial discussion . Youve gotten the prospect on the phone and they 've asked you to send something in writing . This is not the time to create a full-blown proposal . Instead , use a one-pager . Once you 've met or had the 30-minute call that ensures you are clear on their objectives , budget , process , etc. , its time to do the proposal . <p> Commit full-time . Sponsorship sales are partially a numbers game ; most sponsorships start with a cold call , according to IEG research . Sponsorship sales ca n't be done between other responsibilities ; its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more fish you catch , " says FishBait Marketings Rick Jones . " And , the most important sales call is the next call , " says Jones . <p> Put a deadline on your offers . There are only three acceptable outcomes of any call or meeting : yes , no or definite next steps . Next steps might include getting the go-ahead to prepare proposal . Or scheduling a time/date for next discussion . <p> Base fees on value , not budget . The fee must be commensurate with the rights and benefits being delivered , which may be more than the budget of what 's being sold . Reduce the prospects risk with an independent , third-party valuation .

Companies with foundations often use these dollars to support programs that do not fall under the guidelines of its foundation . A company can deduct up to 10 percent of its pre-tax income for direct charitable contributions ( this includes giving to the companys foundation ) . The average percentage is closer to one percent . Corporate giving programs can include cash , employee matching gifts and in-kind gifts of a companys products or services or volunteers . <p> Rights and Benefits <p> Fundraising Partnership Defined by IEG as the use of a companys outlets as collection points for donations .

While no cash changes hands , the companys promotions build the causes brand and gets its message wider circulation which should lead to new customers and donors , behavior changes , etc . <p> The company benefits from the halo the cause brings to its brand .

@@37033428 @6033428/ <p> When it comes to sponsorship truisms , the following goes near the top of the list : Whether providing information to potential sponsors about why they should become involved in a property or reporting results to an existing sponsor to help prove a deals worth , reliable audience research is essential . <p> Although there is general consensus on that point in theory , in practice properties seem to be coming up short in delivering the data that sponsors want . <p> " If you ask sponsors whether they are getting enough audience research , by and large they will say no . If you ask properties if they are providing enough research , you will hear a yes . That gap needs to be addressed , " said Tim McGhee , director of national sponsorships with AT&amp;T , Inc . <p> With more sponsors employing opportunity assessment models that screen proposals based on specific audience information and other criteria , not to mention companies increasingly emphasizing specific measurement of return on objectives and investments on the back end , the need for properties to provide good audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightsholders for the investment of time and resources to acquire audience data comes in multiple forms . Research can identify and prioritize new qualified prospects ; make it easier for prospects to say yes ; improve the activation efforts of current sponsors ; and provide evidence that a sponsorship is achieving results , which leads to renewals . <p> Landmark conducted its research via an online survey of the companys 1,024 Film Club members . The company gave each member two movie tickets in exchange for participating . <p> In addition to acquiring age , household income and other basic demographics , Landmark asked for detailed information on its customers lifestyle activities , product usage and purchasing habits . The product-specific questions spanned several categories the chain had targeted for sponsorship , including automobiles , credit cards , cable and satellite TV providers , financial services and spirits . <p> " The survey provided us valuable information that we used successfully in making pitches , " said Cary Chevat , president of sales agency Sponsorship Resources , which secured the deals on behalf of Landmark . <p> Among the findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of respondents said they were somewhat likely , very likely or extremely likely to buy or lease a new car within the next 12 months , and 59 percent of the surveys tequila drinkers indicated they usually choose a premium or super-premium brand . <p> The research also has helped Landmark identify new categories to pitch . For example , the company is scouting sponsorship opportunities with marketers of green products and services based on its customers concern for the environment , said Michael Sakin , the chains senior vice president of sales . <p> What Sponsors Really Want To Know Is : Who Are YouWhile it is obvious sponsors need to know if a propertys audience is in the market for their products and services , smart sponsors also want to find out whether audience affinity for the event or organization translates into consideration for sponsor products , willingness to switch brands , etc . <p> Further up the sponsor food chain , the most enlightened sponsors are equally interested in finding out what makes these consumers tick and what bonds them to the property so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Without research to answer those questions , making assumptions about what triggers a consumers interest in a property is a dangerous game , one that often results in misguided conclusions pointing a marketing program in the wrong direction . <p> " If you represent a food festival , you ca n't leap to the conclusion that everyone is there because they are passionate about food , " said Bill Doyle , vice president of sponsorship research firm Performance Research . " People may be there because its an inexpensive family entertainment , and food is just the nucleus . Knowing those types of motivations is key to planning the correct marketing strategy . " <p> McGhee points to AT&amp;Ts title of a NASCAR Sprint Cup team . " I know what NASCAR fans like to do on Sunday . But what about Monday through Saturday ? Why are NASCAR fans avid ? And how does that avidity manifest itself in terms of sponsor loyalty , purchase of sponsor product , and their willingness to switch to new telephone companies ? " <p> Painting a better picture of the lifestyles led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey conducted by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Assn . Determining the interests of audiologists , speech pathologists and related scientists outside their professional life has allowed the organization to identify and secure non-endemic sponsor prospects , such as Subaru of America , Inc . <p> Prior to conducting its first member survey , ASHA " had a good sense of our members professional situation , but we did n't  have a clear understanding of who they were after 5 p.m. , " said Rick Henderson , the organizations director of marketing and sales . <p> The lifestyle data also helps ASHA develop targeted activation programs . After learning its members were facing a high degree of stress , ASHA worked with Subaru to create a sponsored area at its conventions where members could receive massages . ASHA and Subaru also distributed all-natural soaps to attendees based on members interest in those products . <p> Answers To Questions About Asking QuestionsOn a macro level , there are essentially three ways for properties to collect audience research : Hire someone to conduct the research ; find someone who will do it pro bono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , properties should try to gather whatever information they can , Doyle said . <p> " Some information is better than no information . If you have a limited budget , learn a little . Its better than doing nothing . " Regardless of how they do it , properties should try to conduct research once a year , or at least every other year , to ensure the information is fresh . ASHA , for example , updates its survey every year . <p> Option 1 : Hiring professionals . Generally speaking , properties that have an up-to-date attendee or participant contact database can expect to pay roughly $5,000 to $7,000 for a basic audience survey . Properties that do not have a database are likely to spend roughly $15,000 to $30,000 . <p> Those fees can vary depending on the scope of the project . ASHA , for example , spends roughly $20,000 to survey all of its more than 100,000 members . That cost can come down to roughly $13,000 for surveying a portion of the group , Henderson said . <p> In addition to ensuring results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring another valuable benefit : credibility . " Sponsors know a respected third-party wont cook the books to make you look good , " Chevat said . <p> Option 2 : Having it done for free . Some properties without the resources to hire professional researchers have been able to get the work done by a local college or university . Marketing departments frequently look for real-life projects for their market research classes . <p> Case in point : The Monterey Jazz Festival works with the Monterey Institute of International Studies for its audience research . The festival works with a class to develop questions , interview attendees and tabulate results . The students present the data to the festivals staff and board of directors , said Paul Fingerote , the events director of marketing . <p> Option 3 : Doing it yourself . Properties can conduct research themselves , but it can be difficult . <p> The biggest mistake properties make is not having a clear understanding of how to compile research data , Doyle said . His advice : Think about the finished product , and work backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report , what you want it to say , and how it will be used . Writing questions is the last thing you want to do . " <p> It is imperative properties have a clear understanding of how the data will be tabulated prior to writing questions , he said . " Often , a property will write a survey , and they come back with boxes of completed surveys that they do n't  know what to do with . " <p> It typically costs five times more money for a research firm to retrofit surveys that were not property compiled than conducting the study on their own , he advised . <p> Sample Category-specific QuestionsWireless <p> Which of the following had the greatest impact on your decision to buy a wireless phone and service ? Service provider reputation . Manufacturer reputation . Cost . Features . <p> How frequently do you use your wireless phone ? <p> For what purposes do you use your wireless phone ? <p> Who is your wireless service provider ? <p> Who is the manufacturer of your wireless phone ? <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 12 months ? <h> Digital Discoveries <p> User-generated feedback . Properties can use YouTube , MySpace , Facebook , Flickr and other social networking sites to gain insight into how consumers feel about events and organizations , Doyle noted . <p> He points to the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer as an example . " There are hundreds of videos from people who participated in the event talking about the personal loss that motivated them to get involved , what they liked about the event and how they participated . Its amazing how much information is out there now that can be accessed with very little effort . " <p> Death of the dial tone . With the growing number of consumers relying on mobile phones , surveys using landline phone numbers are no longer as reliable as they once were . <p> " Fewer homes have them , and those that do do n't  answer them , " said Doyle , who recommends that properties acquire wireless phone numbers and email addresses .

The first garden was planted on March 11 , 2009 in Los Angeles , CA . <p> Last July , I wrote a blog about the gardening/home farming industry and its sponsorship potential . My thoughts were that gardening is an upward trending industry and I wanted to see more sponsorship activity from gardening related products and companies . My point was that a gardening company could use sponsorship as a platform to educate people about home farming , provide much needed information and of course demonstrate its products/services . <p> However , I now know that when I wrote the blog , I was thinking too narrowly . I concentrated on gardening related companies because I thought that those companies would benefit the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Triscuits partnership with Urban Farming , I should have expanded my argument to persuade non-gardening related brands to sponsor organizations that promote gardening . <p> Not only has Triscuit figured out a way to make its brand relevant to a growing movement and fervent group of people , its partnership with Urban Farming gives Triscuits program credibility , showcases its community responsibility and is rich with activation opportunities . <p> To promote the partnership Triscuit is including dill and basil seed cards and branding on four million boxes . Triscuit has also created dedicated webpages with robust , instructive content and tools to encourage home farming and to support the home farming movement . Additionally , HGTVs Gardening by the Yard host , Paul James , is featured on the webpages , providing expert gardening advice through video clips . James will also make appearances at the openings of the sponsored community gardens . <p> Other activation elements include a PR campaign , print ads , online ads and a social media component . A Triscuit print ads headline reads " When you plant a seed , you grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Triscuits " Weave Some Wonder " marketing campaign which emphasizes Triscuits simple and quality ingredients . Triscuit stated that it wants to help champion the return to basic and simple living . Additionally , Triscuit cites a recent survey that found that nearly two-thirds of Americans are interested in growing food in a backyard garden . <p> Recently , the Triscuit Home Farming Movement was featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show during a four minute on-air segment . Taja Sevelle , the head of Urban Farming , talked about the organization , Triscuits support of Urban Farming and she also helped plant a home garden on-air for Ellen . Overall , it was a really nice feature and provided some nice exposure for Triscuit . Triscuits integration was noticeable , but not a distraction . <p> Triscuit is doing a lot of things right . The website is great and full of information and the on-pack seed promotion is a neat idea and looks really well done . Triscuits exposure on The Ellen DeGeneres Show was tasteful and engaging and the involvement of HGTVs host Paul James further augments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its part to promote the partnership through various channels . <p> However , I do have a couple of concerns about the initiative , primarily around the execution of the program . At this time , there is very little information available about when the gardens are actually scheduled to be planted and the activity and conversation on Triscuits home farming webpages is pretty limited . Also , for whatever reason , the on-pack seed promotion does n't  mention the community support aspect of the movement , which seems like a missed opportunity to me . Furthermore , even though Urban Farming has had success with getting the attention of the media in the past , I did n't  find significant press coverage around the opening of the farm in Los Angeles . Maybe Triscuit should take a cue from Ford . Ford hosted themed house parties around football . Triscuit could host home farming house parties to help build up interest and involvement . <p> Urban Farming is a relatively new organization and I do n't  know how much experience Triscuit has executing these types of programs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater awareness of the program because it seems to have a lot of potential .

Even when my title included the word " Development " at one point in my career , and even when I ran a small annual giving campaign for an association , I never considered myself a fundraiser . Instead , I " sold corporate sponsorship and marketing relationships , " and I " marketed a pin campaign . " I never " asked ; " I " sold . " It was n't a judgment on either profession ; I just put myself in one bucket and stayed there . And I had a lot of company in seeing the nonprofit world as a bucketed , black-and-white place when it comes to corporate relationships . <p> Hang on to your gingham frock , Dorothy , its time we all switch from black and white to Technicolor . <p> My experience at the Association of Fundraising Professionals International Conference made real my hunch about our merged and converged world . Corporate sponsorship and corporate philanthropy are very different , yes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is paying to accomplish , and what and how they pay to accomplish that goal , is very different in sponsorship and corporate philanthropy . <p> Yet the disciplines must not be confused for the professionals that make them happen . Fundraisers and sponsorship sellers need very similar if not the same skills to survive and thrive in our colorful and confusing marketplace . This is good news , since we know that many nonprofit organizations have these as overlapping functions . IEGs research shows what the overwhelming number of audience members in my colleague Stacey Goldbergs session indicated : many nonprofit professionals have responsibility for both corporate donations and corporate sponsorship . <p> A list of those fundamental shared roles ( and corresponding skills ) follows , with my thanks to the many AFP 2010 presenters who did the heavy lifting to describe them . <p> Steward . Sponsorship sellers do n't  generally do a great job on stewardship . Does n't  matter what you call itin sponsorship vernacular we typically call it " account management " or " servicing " the activity is as important as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of your partners , acknowledge them , thank them , get curious about them . As Sherry Schiller , Ph.D. , reminded her session attendees , " Interested ALWAYS trumps interesting . Use curiosity as a bridge to positive emotions . " To paraphrase , its all about them . Our consulting team conducts hundreds of sponsor interviews each year and the #1 complaint remains the same : " The organization does n't  get what I 'm trying to accomplish . And I do n't  know how they would get it , since nobody ever asked . " <p> Storyteller . This week , keynoters Lee Woodruff and Archbishop Desmond Tutu demonstrated the power a fantastic storyteller can wield . ( Case in point : they got me to buy their books even though my bags were already too heavy . ) While storytelling is important in securing donors and corporate sponsors , the area where the storyteller role is most crucial in corporate alliances is in talking to the stakeholders reached by that corporate alliance . Its not manipulation ; its illumination . <p> here 's an illustration . Transactional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has a very different connotation than " royalty . " And that comes down to the story behind it . With a royalty arrangement there is no story ; its just a business transaction . But with a donation , the money can go somewhere , do good , mean something . No matter what the partnership looks like , do n't  let the story get untold or mis-told ; take responsibility for getting the real , authentic , best story out there . <p> Auditor . Grantseeking organizations must properly reconcile each grant , or they get a bad reputation and lose funding . Sponsorship-seeking organizations must report on value delivered , expectations met , and plans for the future , or they get a bad reputation and lose partners . <p> The Steward and the Auditor are yin and yang ; emotional and rational , creative and measured . Do n't  forget one while exercising the other . <p> Standard Bearer . Compensation structures notwithstanding , fundraisers and sponsorship sellers again have the underlying responsibility to bring in funds and relationships that can advance the organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraiser knows she should not accept a grant that will damage the organization , every sponsorship seller must be in the position to say no to a bad deal .

" Know thy partner , know thy audience , know thyself . <p> Put every deal through a litmus test : If this corporate alliance went away , would anyone care ? Or would they be happy about it ? Would there be a negative or positive impact ? Use that information to craft the relationship and bring up the Storyteller to communicate it . <p> Tailor . AFP Chair Robbe A. Healey , MBA , NHA , ACFRE , put it best when she implored all AFP attendees to " see each individual tree in the forest , " and forget about having a generic " forest-based " strategy as each donor and sponsor needs to feel that the solution is customized to them and them alone . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and my colleagues that discuss topics related to the AFP Conference experiencefrom campaigns run by speakers to topics of great relevance to nonprofit stewards , storytellers , auditors , standard bearers and tailors .

To cite him : <p> " I heard 90 pitches in four months . Only one of those said to me , We do n't  understand your business , but we do understand your audience . We can tell you all about how they interact with our sport . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe offer a trigger point we can use to drive your sales , using digital as the primary lever for this. " <p> Three months later , they had a deal . <p> This story encapsulates many of the key themes we heard at IEG 2016 . In particular , we heard countless examples of the fact that brands are now looking to rightsholders to provide deep and credible relationships and interactions with specific customer audiencesnot just inventory that puts them in front of those audiences . <p> They expect to do so in a world in which digital is the new normal and data the enabler of such a hyper-personal relationship . <p> The volume and substance of the conversations in Chicago around those themes was , of course , gratifying for us to hear , as 11 months ago we launched ESP Properties to help rightsholders take advantage of these seismic shifts in the marketplace . This is accomplished through a customer-led , data-driven approach that takes brand partnerships beyond a volume CPM play based on the size of the audience reached , into a more productive relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinct , high-value audiences . Of course , this is predicated on true understanding of the reasons and motivations behind their passions . <p> Let 's make this real through some examples : <p> MasterCard tracks customers digital footprints to identify key passion points , e.g. , music and shopping .

Brands we heard from at IEG 2016 were focusing on quality of interaction and razor target to a single customer . They evaluate with data science , not exit surveys . <p> Successful rightsholders are disrupting themselves to respond to this challenge .

" <p> Ultimately of course , this changes our notion of what " premium content " entails when positioning sponsorship opportunities and securing brand partners . In a world of selling interaction , not inventory , rightsholders and sponsors alike are challenged to rethink their content strategy to deliver depth for specific audiences rather than a big-bang one-size-fits-most approach . Fortunately , technology enables this to be possible without materially impacting spend levels . <p> This new normal initially requires bravery .

But , as companies recognize the direct link between social justice and increased shareholder value , they are abandoning this mandated model and instead embedding sustainability and ethical values into customer loyalty-building , cost reduction , new product creation , sourcing and HR . <p> IEGs recent conference , Unbound , homed in on the breaking down of barriersbetween activists and business , sponsors and rightsholders , philanthropy and marketingand the transition from campaigns to movements that is happening in sponsorship , as well as in CSR . <p> By making the business caseand with commitment from the top and alignment throughout the rankscompanies are moving from ad hoc and short-term initiatives to creating financial value with umbrella platforms . <p> British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer epitomizes this new approach . Having identified the need to address the social and environmental issues on which it had an impact , including its supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own operations ( hundreds of stores and trucks ) and the millions of products it sells , M&amp;S announced 100 commitments related to those issues in 07 . <p> Three years on , seven lessons have emerged . <p> Lesson 1 : Brand it . M&amp;S created a new asset , a powerful change brand around its new agenda : Plan Abecause " there is no Plan B when it comes to saving the planet . " <p> Plan A is a broad enough umbrella to incorporate activities as disparate as removing trans fats from the food it sells to reducing its carbon footprint and only selling fair-trade coffee and tea . <p> Lesson 2 : Make commitment unconditional . As a moniker , Plan A was an improvement on " M&amp;S ' Sustainability Plan , " but it was not enough to connect with the 90 percent of its shoppers who are not green-led consumers . <p> To engage these customers , M&amp;S recently added a cutline for Plan A activities : " Doing the right thing . " The companys support of 7,500 local nonprofits such as schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Engage consumers by inviting participation . Companies get more traction when consumers are engaged in change and not just told about it .

It includes bespoke energy advice , renewable energy solutions such as solar panels and heat pumps , and energy-efficient heating solutions . <p> Again , rather than ghettoizing its partnerships in marketing , M&amp;S is using them as a source of innovation . For its new energy offering , M&amp;S signed a five-year 200 million eco-plan with WWF , which includes making its U.K. and Republic of Ireland operations carbon neutral by 12 . M&amp;S is going outside the sponsorship silo within WWF and tapping into its processes and expertise to become carbon neutral and offer solutions like the WWF Footprint Calculator to customers and staff . <p> Lesson 6 : Make it tangible . To help people connect the dots between individual action and collective impacts , M&amp;S is putting numbers around behavior .

@@37033452 @6033452/ <h> Sponsor Perspective : Trends To Watch In 2016 <p> IEG SR posed those questions to executives at Barclays , Mondelez and Visa . To no surprise , technology and content take center stage in terms of connecting with consumers and enhancing the fan experience . <p> Below are edited excerpts from their comments . <p> Mark Winfield , insights manager , brand , insight and sponsorship , BarclaysIncreased investment in non-sports properties ; more alignment with business objectives ; more focus on short-form content . <p> I expect to see brands investing more money outside of the sports industry . Sports have tended to get the lions share of sponsorship investment , in part because of the widespread media coverage that they get . However , people are also passionate about other things from music to art to cooking . Those passions represent a real opportunity for brands who want to build emotional connections with their consumers I expect to see more and more brands seize it . <p> I also hope to see sponsorship become more aligned to broader business and marketing strategies . Too often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to start with their target customers , investigate what makes them tick and then select properties based on that knowledge . If the industry can make this shift , it should drive a fundamental change in how sponsorship is viewed by CEOs and CFOs . <p> From an activation point of view , I expect to see a change in the type of content being put out on social media . Until now , brands have tended to make very well-produced films to share on platforms like Facebook and YouTube . This undoubtedly has its place however , social media is also a reactive environment , where people respond to current events . Short clips even those captured on camera phones can generate a lot of interest at much less cost , provided they have this sense of immediacy . Beyond social media , we are seeing striking developments in augmented and virtual reality . This technology is likely to deepen and intensify the fan experience over the next five to ten years . Brands have begun using it in a niche way I expect it to become part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope to see experiential become more scientific this year . There is a wide array of research in social psychology and behavioural economics that has implications for what we do . To give an example , how we remember an event is heavily affected by how it ends . Generally-speaking , it is much better to start badly and end on a high , rather than the other way around . Service designers have been drawing upon this knowledge already . The sponsorship industry should too it will allow to super-charge our work . <p> What I 'm most excited about are the trends in technology and content . We will continue to push and look for ways to connect with our consumers and shoppers through that innovation and technology lens . So we ask the question what is new or different about this property that will enable our brands to deliver the most exciting opportunities to our retail customers/shoppers and consumers . <p> We are in an era where a fantastic piece of shareable content is just as likely to come from a brand as it is a media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or team that people are sharing should be coming from brands they love . <p> Reaching consumers and leveraging our sponsorships , partnerships and alliances is changing extremely fast as consumers take in media and messaging in different ways . TV is still very important to us ( and will continue to be ) but the maturity of digital , social , multi-screen penetration and the new content reaching consumers continues to be the trend I 'm most focused on . <p> Another trend we see is the increasing value of experiences . In a world where people are spending so much time on their devices/consumed with technology , fantastic experiences are more valued than ever . Brands have the ability to deliver once-in-a-lifetime experiences that people can enjoy , talk about with their friends , post to social media , etc . We enable life moments and memories . <p> Social influencers are an interesting area to keep an eye on . We are in a time when the up and coming generation is just as , if not more , likely to look to a YouTube star for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie star . Their followings are astounding . And viewers see them as friends more than they would a celebrity ... they can relate more ... there 's a level of trust that is valuable for brands if we can enter the picture authentically . <p> Two-thousand and fifteen was marked by some of the greatest scandals in the world of sport with rightholders and athletes being in the spotlight for the wrong reasons . I believe that served as a wake-up call for sponsors . They should start structuring deals differently so they can have more leverage . <p> Currently , a lot of what is sold by rightsholders offers limited reach . As social becomes more important , sponsors must start looking at rights in a different way . They should be acquiring things that can serve as content for reaching fans beyond the venues . <p> This will be particularly important as sponsors battle the growing cost of rights fees . Expanding reach will deliver better ROI and justify deals .

@@37033456 @6033456/ <p> To demonstrate why properties should emphasize adding value to their intangible benefits , it is helpful to look at the other side of the coin : the tangibles in a sponsorship package . more ... <p> By now it should be a well documented fact that the real value of sponsorship lies in the intangible benefits of the relationship between sponsor and property . This is true because most of the tangible benefits sponsors receive also can be secured through other marketing expenditures , and even those that can not have a limit to their value ( see sidebar ) . <p> It is a sponsors ability to borrow a propertys image , tap audience loyalty and differentiate itself from its competitors that makes sponsorship different than a media buy and allows a sponsor to actually influence attitudes and change behavior . <p> However , the concept of intangible value remains a difficult one for many sponsorship sellers to wrap their arms around . On a theoretical level most everyone buys into the importance of intangibles , but often it is a struggle to translate that understanding into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to add significant value to their sponsorship offerings and in return receive larger commitments from their corporate partners . <p> Below , using the 10 types of intangible benefits accounted for in the IEG Valuation Services methodology , IEG SR examines how properties can enhance each one . <p> Intangible Benefit : Prestige Of PropertyPrestige in this sense must be determined within a propertys sphere of influence . Is the World Cyber Games as prestigious a property as the Olympics ? Most people would say no . But that is not a relevant measure . To gamerspresumably the audience that potential sponsors of the property are trying to reachthe WCG represents something akin to the Holy Grail . <p> So adding value in this area boils down to making a property more meaningful and relevant to its audience , as reflected in such areas as the quality of programming , improved member benefits , enhanced on-site experiences , etc . <p> Intangible Benefit : **27;302;TOOLONG instantly identifiable property name or logo automatically conveys a host of attributes that the sponsor is hoping to borrow . Without such notoriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection and why it is relevant to the audience , with no guarantee that the message will be received . <p> To add value , sponsorship sellers should invest both in additional marketing and promotion of their events and properties . One of the best and most cost-effective methods is to recruit media and promotional partners . <p> Properties also should make sure that they are protecting their identities through such measures as securing the proper trademarks and strictly policing any unauthorized use of marks and logos . <p> Intangible Benefit : Level Of Audience LoyaltyThe theory is that the more loyal stakeholders are to a property , the more loyal they will be to the propertys sponsors . But that transference is far from automatic . <p> Particularly in todays marketplace , where so many sponsors are vying for consumers hearts through so many properties , no marketer can assume a Pavlovian response . <p> The key is for properties to proactively educate their audiences as to the role that sponsors play in their success , and equally importantly , as to the part the audience must play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the results of what sponsorship brings to the organizations . <p> Intangible Benefit : Category ExclusivityThe ability for a sponsor to have a spaceboth physical and intellectualthat its competition can not lay claim to is a benefit that few other marketing opportunities are able to provide without the costs becoming prohibitive . <p> Adding value in this area can be tricky in that the property should not give away such broad exclusivity to a sponsor that it would restrict the propertys ability to sell marketable categories . However , there should be plenty of room to balance sponsors wishes with the need to generate revenue . <p> One solution is to offer a discount on fees for additional categories that a sponsor wishes to lock up . For highly salable categories , the discount may be only the amount that the property will save by not having to commit resources to selling and servicing an additional sponsor . <p> Intangible Benefit : Protection From AmbushLocking up categories does not guarantee that a sponsors competitor wont try to associate itself with the property . <p> Although no one can stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thematic space " surrounding the property , sponsorship sellers can take steps to insure that their own practices do n't  invite ambush . <p> For example , they can close loopholes by offering such items as program ads and signage only as part of a bundled sponsorship package and not + la carte . They can secure sponsorship rights to host venues , participating teams or entertainers , and other affiliated organizations . <p> Intangible Benefit : Degree Of Sponsor ClutterAlthough the definition of what constitutes clutter varies widely depending on the property type , all sponsorsincluding those involved in clutter-tolerant activities such as motorsportswould like to have more of the stage to themselves . <p> It is up to the property to determine how best to accommodate this desire while still generating enough sponsor revenue . The good news is sponsors in many cases are willing to pay more for a less noisy environment . <p> As an alternative to drastically reducing the number of sponsors , properties can enhance value vis + vis clutter by carving out proprietary programs for partners within events and organizations .

However , its pavilion promoted the Vatican more than Vatican City , as has been typical of the churchs participation in Worlds Fairs dating back to Londons 1851 Exhibition and including nearly every major expo since , in addition to many of the smaller , specialized expos . <p> The theme of its Milan pavilion , " Non di solo pane " ( " Not by bread alone " ) , was a Gospel-infused variation of the theme of the expo , which was " Feeding the Planet , Energy for Life . " <p> Inside the pavilion , treasures from the Vatican museums and holdings were displayed . These were complemented by a series of conversations on world hunger , food sustainability , diet and nutrition , and a theological conversation on the relationship between food and mankind organized by the Pontifical Council for Culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On top of the Vaticans 164-year history of going in big , considering the host country was Italy , the pavilions 747 square meterswhich cost a reported 3 million euroswas , if anything , considered modest . <p> Pope Francis did not agree . According to Fatto Quotidiano newspaper , the decision to participate was made before Francis became pontiff and was condemned by him , saying it promotes a " culture of waste and does not contribute to a model of equitable and sustainable development . " <p> By the fairs opening May 1 , the pope turned the expo into an opportunity to influence . Via video address , he urged fair-goers not to be distracted by the shining pavilions and the delicacies they offered , but to focus on the exhibition 's theme of Feeding the Planet and instead help those who suffer from hunger . <p> " The expo is a good opportunity to globalize solidarity .

John Don Bosco is a local heropriest , educator and saintwhose bicentennial falls in 2015 . The Salesian pavilion aimed to draw young people into issues of food justice and sustainability . <p> The Milan cathedral installed a replica of its newly restored golden statue of the Virgin Mary . <p> Why the Vatican Invests In Events Holy See pavilions at past Worlds Fairs have served many functions depending on the political , social and religious context of the time and host country , as well as the aspirations of the sitting pope . <p> For example , participation in the 1893 Worlds Columbian Exposition in Chicago was in part a response to the anti-Catholic-school lobby sweeping the U.S. Designed to counter rumors that its institutions were turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational institutions joined forces to create a 30,000-square-feet Catholic Educational Exhibit . <p> The Vaticans presence at the 1937 Esposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in Paris was directly tied to the simultaneous release of two encyclicals published that year by Pope Pius XI that opposed Communism on the one hand and Nazism on the other . The " Pavillon Pontifical " was characterized by its " supranational " character , with displays focused on mans upbringing and education during his various stages of life , beginning with a great baptistery at the entrance to the pavilion . Roman Catholic teaching was presented in opposition to totalitarian political regimes . <p> The Vatican decided to bring the Piet+ to the New York Worlds Fair of 1964-1965 at the conclusion of the Second Council of the Catholic Church , where a key theme was the need for the church to engage more with the modern world . In addition , the New York Worlds Fair motto was " each through understanding " and the Vatican positioned its involvement in the fair as an opportunity to facilitate peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to New York on Oct. 4 , 1965 , Pope Paul VI spoke on the topic at the UN General Assembly ) . <p> One constant : Worlds Fairs give the Church the opportunity to promote its spiritual identity through its artistic masterpieces , with pavilions functioning as a mobile Vatican museum . <p> Through the years , the Holy See not only understood the power of its art , it became a master at stagecraft . For example , as if it were not dramatic enough that Michelangelos left St. Peters Basilica for the first time ever to appear in New York , the display was amplified by Broadway lighting and set designers , who positioned the Piet+ in front of a royal blue backdrop and illuminated it with 400 flickering lights attached to a halo and suspended on strings . Attendees were transported on one of three moving walkways operating at different speeds to the calm and even arrangements of Gregorian chants . <p> It was the second-most-visited attraction at the fair , drawing 78,000 people each day . <p> Exterior of the Vatican Pavilion at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1964-65 New York Worlds Fair featured Michelangelos Piet+ <p> Hostesses guided visitors through the 10 rooms of the Vatican Pavilion at the 1964-65 New York Worlds Fair . <p> Seven Other Religious Pavilions at the 1964-65 New York Worlds Fair <p> In the midst of the Cold War and the perceived threat of the Communist nations to liberty , fair organizers hoped for a single interfaith pavilion , such as the one at the 1939-40 New York Worlds Fair . The thinking was that it would be best to present an image of a united American religious community . <p> However , this did not occur , as individual religious groups did not feel they had intersecting agendas . Even within the same faith , there were splits . For example , there were four Protestant pavilions . <p> By far the most successful belonged to the Billy Graham Evangelical Association , which was originally contacted by the Protestant Council of the City of New York to rent exhibition space in the councils venue . <p> But the BGEA concluded that participating in the Protestant Pavilion would limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other groups films . It believed its conception of evangelistic outreach would be considerably limited or even harmed if surrounded by exhibitions from other Protestant denominations striving to be ecumenical . <p> There was also the fear that the council was anxious to have the BGEA 's presence in its pavilion because of the pulling power of the Billy Graham name , which would not serve the BGEA 's own interests . <p> The BGEA chose instead to erect its own 50,000-square-feet , octagon-shaped pavilion near the fairs main entrance . The structure included a 400-seat theater and counseling rooms for ministry purposes . <p> Pamphlet for the Billy Graham Pavilion at the 1964-1965 New York Worlds Fair . <p> Moody Bible Institute was another evangelical Protestant group with its own " Sermons from Science " pavilion . According to the fairs information manual : " The Christian endeavor aims to illustrate the compatibility of faith and knowledge through live demonstrations and films , thereby winning men and women to Christ and fellowship in His church . " <p> The intent , as a 1963 preview brochure noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ; exciting from an entertainment point of view ; stimulating from an intellectual point of view ; and faithful from a Biblical point of view . " <p> Among the many live demonstrations used to illustrate scriptural points were " Metal Rings Floating in Air " ( when placed over an electric transformer ) ; " Invisible Energy Sets Steel Aflame " ( steel wool actually , placed inside a copper coil fixed to a transformer ) ; " Frying an Egg On a Cold Stove " ( the key being the presence of a coil of wire inside the cold plate affixed to a high voltage source , which demonstrated the " selective nature of physical forces " ) ; and " The Cry that Can Shatter Glass " ( placing a glass above an " electronic voice " and adjusting it to the right frequency ) . <p> The most famous demonstration was the " Million Volts of Man-Made Lightning , " in which demonstrators would literally allow a million volts of electricity to pass through their body and ignite wood they held in their hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central lesson of relating science to scripture was taught : Natural laws needed to be followed . Even those not interested in the pavilion 's religious message found this demonstration worth seeing . <p> MBIs building , with its 500-seat circular theater and scalloped roof , was reached by a ramp which curved over a reflecting pool . Jets of flaming gas and splashing water ringed the area and drew attention to the pavilion . <p> Another Protestant organization , Wycliffe Bible Translators , also had a pavilion . The missionary groups Two Thousand Tribes pavilion exhibited blowguns ( " just one of the hazards WBT missionaries have encountered " ) along with panels showing " the conversion of an Amazon jungle headhunter . " <p> The original Protestant pavilion , the councils Protestant &amp; Orthodox Center , was there too .

Missionaries acted as tour guides , and the Book of Mormon was featured prominently . <p> The pavilions theme was " Mans Search for Happiness , " and a 15-minute film was produced for it . <p> ROI : A new branch was created as a result of Worlds Fair converts , according to a Mormon history of the fair .

Its reach extends well beyond Europe to include 70 countries in Asia , Africa , Middle East and North and South America . It blends the tribalism of club football with the pageantry of FIFA World Cup . It features the worlds top players competing in the worlds most popular sport . And , its sponsors are not just buying into a sporting event , but rather a piece of Europes cultural fabric with its own protocols , icons , traditions and heritage , including the UEFA Champions Festival , Champions League Trophy , Trophy Handover , UEFA Champions League Ball , the eight-star UCL logo , and the UCL Anthem , which is played before every game . <p> In addition , the competition delivers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most watched annual sporting event in the world , surpassing the Super Bowl . <p> Long activation window . Eight months and 144 matches . <p> Maximum exposure and promotional opportunities and minimal clutter . Beginning in 1992 , UEFA capped the number of sponsors at eight and built in key rights and benefits , including tickets and hospitality , perimeter signage visible to broadcast viewers , marketing and promotional rights , priority on TV ads during matches , category exclusivity , etc . <p> Robust digital media and vibrant social communities . UEFA controls its digital assets , which benefits its sponsors in terms of delivering fans , protecting them from ambush and providing additional touch points . For example , UEFA.com hosts MatchCentre 90 minutes before the Finals kick-off , Matchday Live panel show , etc. , while UEFAs Facebook page has 8.7 million fans and its Twitter account has more than one million followers . <p> Strong track record partnering with leading brands . Long-term deals , high renewal rates . <p> Brand <p> Since <p> Through <p> Additional Information <p> Primary Sponsors <p> Ford <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2015 <p> Heineken <p> 1994 <p> 2015 <p> MasterCard <p> 1996 <p> 2015 <p> Payment Systems <p> Sony <p> 1997 <p> 2015 <p> PlayStation <p> UniCredit <p> 2009 <p> 2015 <p> Official Bank <p> Secondary Sponsors <p> Adidas <p> 2003 <p> 2017 <p> Balls <p> HTC <p> 2003 <p> 2015 <p> Mobile Phone &amp; Tablet <p> Rising viewer numbers in key markets . In the U.S. , the 2010-12 Champions League finals broadcast on Fox averaged 2,049,000 viewers , a 676 percent increase over the last decade . The 02 finals on ESPN2 delivered 264,000 viewers . This years final is likely to have lower viewership in the U.S. than the previous three years because of the lack of star players and star teams . English and Spanish clubs like Manchester United , Real Madrid and Barcelona are better known among U.S. soccer fans than the two 2013 German finalists , Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund . <h> Activation : Whos Doing What <p> MasterCard .

During live broadcasts , an HTC smartphone " will interactively appear in the middle of game highlights and an animated finger will take a digital photo of the previously watched game scene , " according to German online TV magazine Quotenmeter . <p> Heineken . The brewers numerous eye-catching executions include 1 ) Heineken Star Player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tells the story of a guy surviving on his wits to get to the finals at Wembley in time for kick off ; 3 ) press stunt in Barcelona where the Legends TV harrowing journey was recreated via an immersive theatre experience prior to one of the semi-finals ; 4 ) Facebook football-themed pinball game in which people can emulate the star of the TV ad to earn bragging rights against their peers ; 5 ) a competition to win a spot as an intern with Heineken Italys sponsorship team , including a highly unorthodox series of interviews filmed for the viewing public . The resulting video featuring interviewees holding their would-be bosses hands and saving a stranded office worker during a fire drill has received nearly five million views on YouTube ; 6 ) Tweets by a Dutch footballer who took to the brands Twitter account during the semi-finals to offer his take on the action in real-time and respond to fan questions ; 7 ) Champions League-themed TV and digital advertising in the U.S. that directs soccer enthusiasts to the nearest retail or on-premise accounts and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heineken Light with instant messaging ; and 8 ) a Heineken Social Reporter contest in India that flies the winner to London to report on the finals for Heineken social media channels in India . There were more than 400 applicants through the brands Facebook app . <p> Sony PlayStation . At the UEFA Champions Festival , a free four-day event in London leading up to the 2013 finals , Sony created PlayStation Stadium , where fans can try out its new titles , have a kickaround , participate in coaching sessions and more . Twitter hashtag is #PlayStationStadium . <p> Adidas . Season-long activation centered around the three Adidas football boots equipped with miCoach technology promoted by prominent Adidas players Lionel Messi , Xavi and Bastian Schweinsteiger , as well as Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho . <p> Adidas promos ask : " Are you UEFA Champions League level ? " and the miCoach enabled boots let players test themselves against the very best during various stages of the competitionfrom pre-season through the group stages all the way to the finalstracking and sharing their results on Facebook . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve their varying objectives , not all are equally adept at doing so . Based on fan engagement in social media , Heineken takes the gold . <p> And when activation is too heavy handed , it wont just be ignored , it will alienate the very fans brands are hoping to win over . <p> For example , MasterCard and UEFA came under sharp attack for a promotion that gave preferential treatment to MasterCard customers in the ballot for Champions League finals tickets . MasterCard customers were entered into the ballot twice , prompting one influential fan group to say they would raise the " unfair " practice with European football 's governing body ; other fans took to Twitter to express their displeasure . ( There was a similar outcry when London 2012 tickets could only be purchased by using a Visa card . ) <p> Sponsorship has evolved and sophisticated sponsors are not an add-on or interruption to conversations , but creators of conversation . Its no longer about riding the coattails and promoting official designation , but rather bringing something new and valuable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands tone of voice . For example , you can spot Heineken content instantly , even it had no branding . It has Heinekens imprint in its values , aesthetics , humor , etc . This approach is carried over to Champions League content that Heineken produces . <p> In 2013 success means being timely , relevant and a creator brand . My view is that sponsors need to have their own point of view and to share their opinions on things as they happen . When things are happening on and off the pitch , they need to be in that conversation sharing relevant ideas . <p> In addition to their kit manufacturer , participating clubs are allowed one non-endemic sponsor per jersey , even if it competes with a Champions League sponsor . Exceptions are made for nonprofit partners , which can be on the front of the shirt , incorporated with the main sponsor , or on the backbelow the squad number or between the player name and the collar . If the match is in a country where the sponsor category is restricted ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo from its jersey . <h> Share : <h> More : <h> Comments <p> The global audience for this Saturday 's final ( 25 May ) is expected to top 220 million ; that 's more than the Super Bowl . <p> Also , second-screen viewing is creating added experiences and viewership for the brands and their audiences . The viral element . Very interactive and engaging ... <p> In addition , the power and influence of sponsors in football ( soccer ) is added to the mix , to the point where brands who sponsor a player can demand the transfer of such player to the team the brand is also sponsoring ... <p> Finally , UEFA is able to manage two parallel championships going on at the same time ; Champions League and Europa League , thereby increasing the exposure to many more countries and teams within Europe , and hence greater ' engagement ' opportunities for sponsors and brands , and loyal fans/audiences ... <p> @iSponsor 187873 @qwx387873 187875 @qwx387875

" That is , taking the same stuff the league was already selling to men , scaling it to size and then splashing on a lot of pink dye . <p> That 's not enough anymore . <p> Fans will see pinked-out fields this weekend for the start of the NFL 's version of " Breast Cancer Awareness Month . " Keep in mind the league took in more than $9 billion last year from an audience in which women made up almost half ( 46 percent , or 93 million total viewers ) . <p> The NFL 's fourth annual campaign , dubbed " A Crucial Catch , " is a good cause to be sure . Like any runway show albeit one with violent collisions the participants will be accessorized head to toe . According to the league 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gloves , sideline caps , helmet decals , captains ' patches , chin straps , shoe laces , skull caps , sideline towels , eye shield decals , quarterback towels and mouth guards . " <p> ( OK , maybe not mouth guards , since players who agreed to wear them to endorse Crest toothpaste were allowed to opt out after corporate parent Procter &amp; Gamble pulled out of the campaign in response to the league 's colossal bungling of the Ray Rice affair . ) <p> Fans wo n't be shortchanged , either . In addition to being handed pink rally towels in some stadiums , they 'll be treated to pink goal post padding , cheerleaders waving pink pompoms , special pink ribbon game balls and pink-ribboned caps for coaches , team personnel and officials . <p> You might think all that pink would translate into a lot of money . <p> Maybe , maybe not . Depends on who you ask . <p> The NFL donates 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of pink merchandise and game-worn items through an auction on NFL.com . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meant a check to the American Cancer Society for $310,175 ; last year , it was for $1.86 million . It 's not a direct comparison , but the society 's campaign with the Walgreen 's chain which offers customers a chance to add a donation when paying for their purchases raises about $5 million annually . <p> The NFL has kicked in about $6.7 million total so far , and there 's no question their partnership with ACS has been increasingly effective at getting out the word . This year , in every NFL market , there will be free , on site-screenings and support staff to answer questions . The campaign has already provided 10,000 free screenings and educated another 72,000 women on its benefits . A survey last season found that 70 percent of the women who watched games during October got the message as well , and the number has been steadily climbing . But as far as tangible benefits that 's about it . <p> Cancer society spokeswoman Tara Peters says there 's no easy way to calculate the real value of putting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which should be well north of 150 million viewers by the end of the month . There are sponsorship analysts who measure the impact of similar campaigns , and a few say there are better and perhaps more impactful opportunities out there . <p> October also happens to be " Domestic Violence Awareness Month , " though you 'd be hard-pressed to find its symbolic purple ribbons amid the avalanche of pink . It 's also an effort that could benefit greatly from the NFL 's outsized reach , and in turn , restore some of the luster to the league 's image . <p> " The fight against breast cancer is obviously a very well-supported cause . Just look at how many events coalesce around the pink ribbon , " said Jim Andrews , senior vice president for the sponsorship firm IEG . " That makes the NFL just one of many corporations that are part of the effort . ... But domestic violence is a cause that needs help , both in terms of organization and financial backing . <p> " Given the recent issues the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's a cause the NFL could get behind and actually make a difference imagine PSAs ( public-service announcements ) by some well-known players , a campaign to raise funds for local programs and shelters ...

Sponsorship spending on associations and membership organizations is expected to total $548 million in 2012 , up 3 percent from $532 million 2011 . The projection lags the projected increase for sports ( 4.6% ) , entertainment ( 4% ) and causes ( 3.1% ) and barely exceeds the arts ( 2.6% ) and festivals and fairs ( 2.4% ) . <p> Associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of marketing-driven programs have seen success gaining the interest of new sponsors and taking existing partnerships to the next level . <p> And those deals can be sizeable . Case in point : The National Electrical Contractors Assn. this year secured a two-year partnership worth more than $200,000 with Thomas &amp; Betts Corp. , a manufacturer of transmission towers and other products for the electrical construction industry . <p> All told , NECA will generate more than $2 million from seven corporate partners over the next three years , up from roughly $1 million over the previous three-year term . <p> Below , IEG SR shares tips and tactics on how NECA and other associations are taking sponsorship to the next level . <p> Properties can then sell the packages to a select group of partners , each of which gains more touchpoints in an uncluttered environment . <p> Case in point : The Intl Society of Automation in 2010 moved from roughly 25 sponsors with deals ranging from $200 to $13,000 to 13 companies with $25,000 to $150,000 packages following the rollout of a new sponsorship program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $215,000 to $456,000 . <p> " We saw a dramatic increase in not just revenue , but in the quality of the relationships , " said Jennifer Infantino , ISAs manager of marketing communications and corporate partnerships . <p> Now and Then : The Evolution of Association Sponsorships <p> Days of the Past <p> Partnerships of Today <p> Focus on association need/gratitude <p> Focus on corporate business objectives <p> Transactional , a la carte relationships <p> Delivery of organization-wide solutions <p> Off-the-shelf ( gold , silver , bronze opportunities ) <p> Customized , flexible approach based on partner needs <p> Price based on need <p> Price based on value of marketing rights and benefits <p> Partner is responsible for activation <p> Association is responsible for helping partners resonate with their audience <p> Other properties have also seen success from repacking individual assets into integrated programs . The Assn. of National Advertisers in 2010 generated a 50 percent increase in revenue after repackaging exposure at conferences and other inventory into a handful of high-level sponsorship packages . <p> The packages offer year-round access and exposure to ANA members through conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not signage . When packaging and selling sponsorship , associations should play up one of the most desired benefits : access . <p> " Its not about selling signage and casual exposure , its about facilitating relationships , " said Mel Poole , president of SponsorLogic , a consultancy that works with NECA , the Construction Financial Management Assn. and other associations . <p> " No one can track a sale back to a sign . The value of sponsorship comes from relationships . " <p> Offer custom packages.Many associations have found success by moving away from gold , silver and bronze packages in favor of tailored packages . <p> That was the case with the Emergency Nurses Assn. , which several years ago replaced predefined packages with tailored inventory . <p> " There was not a lot of room to select options . It was either buy the package or not . " Our partners wanted the option to buy packages that fit their needs , " said Pierre Desey , ENAs chief development officer . <p> That is a key driver behind NECAs program . The program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use to demonstrate their support of the electrical construction industry . <p> " Our program is designed not to have partners sell our members . Its designed to help our members do better business , " said Daniel Walter , NECA vice president and chief operating officer . <p> For example , Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp . activates its partnership by soliciting product feedback from NECA members , while Westex , Inc. sponsors a member safety forum , around which it offers advice on the use of its products . <p> " Its not about the latest products they have , but how they service the industry . " <p> Establish pricing benchmarks . Like other types of properties , associations can speed up the sales process by having packages valued by a third-party firm . <p> Some sellers have found success using pricing benchmarks . For example , SponsorLogic hired IEG Research to analyze the fees paid for partnerships at other associations and membership organizations when selling the NECA program . <p> " The first thing an association needs is an objective idea of their assets and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Poole . <p> Adjust program to sales environment . Associations need to monitor programs and make adjustments where needed . <p> For example , NECA dropped lower-level packages from its sponsorship program after receiving limited interest from sponsors . <p> " One of the things we learned is that companies of a certain size are not interested in having second-tier positioning . They werent going to buy into anything other than that top level , " said Walter . <p> Help service existing partners . Associations should make sure they commit the time and resources to properly service and manage relationships . <p> For example , the American Quarter Horse Assn. this year has taken a deeper dive on measuring sponsor exposure in social media . That includes tracking sponsor messaging associated with archived content . <p> " We know something hits when we put it out in the social media world , but what is the long-term exposure ? Some people find that information months later . Were taking a deeper dive into the shelf life of social media , " said Leman Wall , AQHAs director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automation uses an online dashboard to keep sponsors up-to-date on their partnerships . The password-protected site includes information on contract terms , deliverables and action items . <p> Help measure success . Like every other type of property , associations should take a proactive role in helping partners measure return on investment . <p> " Associations have to steadily and robustly help sponsors measure as much as possible , " said Poole . " At the end of the year you need to say You shook this many hands , got this many business cards , entered this number of people into a database and converted that to X-amount of business. " <p> The Intl Society of Automation demonstrates those efforts in a bound fulfillment report . The association designed the document as a coffee table book to appeal to C-level executives . <p> " Its not a huge binder with pages and pages of print outs , but rather a concise write up that shows gross impressions , click rates and other metrics that allow them to see where their investment went , " said Infantino.

Her charge : develop concerts and live programs that highlight the companys content offerings and provide opportunities for sponsor integration . <p> In one of her first tasks , Stevens next month will oversee a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert at the Barclays Center in Newark , N.J. CBS Radio will produce the Feb. 1 eventdubbed " WFANs Big Hello to Brooklyn " as part of an expanded partnership with the venue that includes coverage of NBA Brooklyn Nets games and the production of concerts and events marketed on stations in 27 markets . <p> " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners , and we can work together to bring cool experiences to listeners and sponsors , " said Jennifer Morelli , vice president of integrated marketing with CBS Radio . <p> The Red Hot Chili Peppers will follow up the concert on Feb. 2 at the Super Bowl halftime show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , N.J. <p> " Every program today has to be integrated . Advertisers want to be where the consumer is , whether they 're online , driving their car or in the community , " said Susan Novicki , president of Morrison and Abraham , a media sales consultancy . <p> With more advertisers looking for integrated packages , radio stations are doubling down on proprietary events to create more inventory and increase revenue , she said . <p> " Radio stations control every piece of the sale with proprietary events . They 're not locked out of any categories and business . " <p> THE MOST ACTIVE RADIO STATION SPONSORS <p> Figures represent the percentage of properties with a sponsor in the radio station category reporting sponsorship from each company . <p> National Reach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer advertisers a national marketing platform that can be activated locally . <p> The festival represents a major shift in how Clear Channel uses event marketing . Prior to the festivals launch in 2011 the company primarily sponsored events on behalf of local stations and radio station clusters . <p> " It used to be that local stations sold sponsorship with their own profit and loss statements . We realized we can wire them up to make national events feel local . That 's our new approach , " said Greg Glenday , president of Clear Channel Connections , an in-house department charged with creating multi-platform marketing solutions for national advertisers . <p> For example , Macys , Inc. leverages the iHeartRadio Music Festival with the Macys iHeartRadio Rising Stars national talent search . Clear Channel radio listeners , iHeartRadio fans and Macys shoppers last year cast more than six million votes for their favorite up-and-coming band with the top five finalists performing in-store performances at local Macys outlets . <p> The winning band also performed at the iHeartRadio Music Festival and Macys Passport presents Glamorama events . <p> " Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noting that local stations create non-traditional revenue programs around the in-store events . <p> Other sponsors of the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival included AT&amp;T Inc. , Pepsi , State Farm and Unilevers Fruttare ice cream bar . <p> Clear Channel created the iHeartRadio Music Festival as a platform to promote its eponymous online radio station . The festival was spearheaded by Bob Pittman , Clear Channels chairman and CEO who joined the company in 2010 . <p> " The first festival was literally a launch party for the iHeartRadio app . It went from a marketing vehicle to a platform for sponsorship . " <p> Clear Channel programs the music festival with A-list artists across pop , rap and other musical genres to promote the diversity of iHeartRadio programming and gain an activation platform across multiple radio station formats . <p> National sponsors of the iHeartRadio Country Festival include NBC , State Farm and Jim Beam . <p> Similar to the iHeartRadio music festivals , Clear Channel uses Jingle Ball to provide opportunities for national and local advertisers . <p> For example , JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.s Chase brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour . The sponsorship afforded ticket presale opportunities , on-air promotion , digital contests and other benefits . <p> Local stations sold backstage access and other inventory to local advertisers , said Glenday , noting that the stations were locked out from the banking category and focused on beverage , electronics , pet food and other categories . <p> Clear Channel may reduce the number of Jingle Ball stops in 2014 , he said . <p> " Were evolving . It may be fewer markets , but well make them better . Were evaluating market response and ratings on pop stations . " <p> CBS Radio also activates national events with local extensions . For example , the company last year leveraged a concert that featured Robin Thicke , Jason Derulo and Sammy Adams at The Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas with a national ticket sweeps that dangled trips to the show . <p> CBS Radio cosponsored the Aug. 17 event on behalf of Radio.com . CBS streamed the concert on the online radio station and Youtube.com . <p> " It was a multi-market , multi-format platform , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won tickets to the event . <p> WHERE RADIO STATIONS SPEND MONEY ( THIRD-PARTY EVENTS ) <p> Still Committed To Third-Party Events While CBS Radio and Clear Channel are doubling down on proprietary events , both companies say they are not backing away from third party events . <p> Clear Channel earlier this month announced a partnership with SFX Entertainment , the owner of electronic dance music festivals and other EDM platforms . <p> The partnership provides an authentic platform to engage listeners and sponsors , said Glenday . " We prefer to create events in-house , but if something makes sense for our listeners , were thrilled to do it . " <p> Clear Channel will leverage the tie with a DJ talent search . The company will host the search at iHeartRadio Theaters and promote the search on air . <p> Clear Channel also gains the right to sell-in advertisers , added Glenday , noting that the relationship is new and specific categories have yet to be ironed out . <p> Radio stations remain active sponsors of third-party events at the local level . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts with a tie to the Texas State Fair . The cluster gains the right to sell one categoryamong other benefits-in exchange for on-air promotion . <p> " Its a win-win . We receive an affiliation with a high-traffic mass market event while the fair gains a new sponsor and promotion on the number one station in the market , " said Kevin Maus , director of event marketing for Clear Channel Dallas . <p> Other radio stations focus almost exclusively on third-party events . <p> For example , Emmis Marketing Group Austin sponsors the Austin City Limits Music Festival , South by Southwest and other large local events . <p> " Weve been able to partner with the biggest events and carve out opportunities for station marketing and selling in sponsors . There is minimal financial risk on the front end , and we can reap the same benefits as we would be creating our own events , " said Kevin Brelsford , director of Emmis Marketing Group Austin . <p> Like other radio stations , the cluster evaluates opportunities based on the quality of categories it can secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malt beverage , spirits , insurance and hospital categories . <p> " Some events offer 20 categories , but many of those are fringe categories that are hard to work with . A half dozen key categories offer enough revenue potential for us . " <p> In addition to selling open categories , the Emmis cluster looks to generate revenue from existing sponsors by selling media and other inventory as an activation platform . The cluster helped Bud Light activate its sponsorship of the ACL music festival through a package that included mention during live backstage radio broadcasts and promotions at bars and restaurants around Austin . <p> " Bud Light can use the ACL name , and we helped the brand exploit that right .

Other noteworthy design elements include : <p> Understanding the value of digital and social to sponsors , the COC has reserved the rotating ad ( see white arrow in image below ) on the front page of each of its sectionsStories , Videos , Photos , Athletes , Sports , Gamesfor its eight national partners : Bell , Air Canada , BMW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Teck . Ensuring ads from those partners would be fully compatible with the new site design also meant creating custom dimension units specifically for mobile . In addition to the rotating ads on section home pages , each of the national partners also gets ad space in other sections of the site . <p> Capture Fan Identity to Inform Content and Advertising To build community , engagement and efficiency of its ad placements , the COC launched Canadian Olympic I 'd , which behaves as a registration system on the site . Fans grant permission for the COC to access demographic and psychographic info housed within their social profile . This info is aggregated , indexed and stored within a database and can be used by the COC to better understand who its fans are and what type of content they want and want to share . <p> Analyzing fan data during the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi , the COC discovered that users logging in via Facebook shared interests in certain sports , TV shows and gaming apps . These types of insights were used to build look-alike audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to convert across Facebook and Twitter via promoted campaigns . The result : Facebook ad conversion rates increased 106 percent and campaign costs decreased 51 percent , according to Gigya . <p> Extend Promotional Window with Campaigns and Hashtags The COCs creation of non-Games-related initiatives enables the organization to deliver fans year-round rather than once every two years . For example , the Instagram post below promotes its seasonal #ChooseTheMoose effort , inviting fans to vote for Santa to replace reindeer with moose . COC dedicated a page on its website , created a dedicated Twitter handle , @Komak , and created videos and stills for the campaign . <p> The COC also enlisted 12 of its sponsors to spread the word , with each sponsor providing incentives for fans to promote the campaign . Below is the offer from Canadian Tire for a chance to win a Christmas tree and ornaments by retweeting . Similarly , Air Canada offered Twitter followers a chance to win a $200 Air Canada gift card , while Petro-Canada offered a chance to win one million Petro-Canada reward points in exchange for retweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media channels to promote the sponsor offers . <p> Enlist Media Partners Campaigns and hashtags also serve as a call to action . For example , the COCs " We Are Winter " campaign for Sochi 2014 invited Canadians to join the conversation leading up to and during the Games . Rather than relying on its own channels to get the word out , the COC negotiated some $14 million in donated media from partners like CBC , Bell Media , Airtime Media , MLSE , Globe and Mail , Cineplex Entertainment , Juice Mobile , Rogers , AOL and Twitter Canada . <p> Its " We Are Winter " contentincluding athlete documentaries , a series of breathtaking stills , two 60-second , four 30-second and one 15-second spotsappeared on billboards , restaurant video screens , in newspapers and more . Twitter Canada placed promoted #WeAreWinter tweets from the COC ( @CDNOlympicTeam and @OlympiqueCanada ) , Canadian Olympic athletes and key partners in the timelines of Canadians . <p> #WeAreWinter stats : <p> 534,000 Canadian mentions of #WeAreWinter on Twitter during Sochi <p> One million-plus mentions worldwide <p> The hashtag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channels &amp; Initiatives Example , a COC #ChooseTheMoose post on LinkedIn included a link to a Komak video as well as embedded sharing ( both on LinkedIn and Twitter ) . <p> Similarly , COCs Google+ post also embedded sharing and used Komak to promote sales of COC merchandise . <p> Digital Newsletter with Embedded Shares Social media networks continue to be important organic content discovery channels , but they are increasingly hard to control as content distribution channels . There is no guarantee all of your followers or fans will see your updates or articles ( thanks to continually changing algorithms and pay-for-play ) , which makes solutions like newsletters even more attractive . <p> Newsletters can feature popular content , or even automated content pulled from social channels . Below , the COC promotes an offer from Petro-Canada in a newsletter it emails to holders of a Canadian Olympic I 'd . Note the embedded share button in the newsletter post . <p> Promote Partner Programs Unrelated to Property COC uses its social media channels to promote sponsor programs unrelated to the Olympics . For example , it created a Facebook post for RBCs golf tournament .

Since 2005 brands have been thanking our troops ( Budweiser , Jeep ) , honoring our farmers ( Ram Trucks ) , and celebrating our heritage ( Coca-Cola ) , just to name a few . <p> But directly promoting a cause marketing effort between a for-profit company and a nonprofit organization is something more unusual in Super Bowl ad circles . <p> With more than 110 million U.S. viewers and attention focused as much on the ads as on the game , any nonprofit would jump at the chance to have a corporate partner use its $4-million-per-spot platform to raise awareness and funds . <p> But success is not guaranteed . <p> This year , two major brands stepped up to the plate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of America in support of ( RED ) and Chevrolet in support of the American Cancer Society . <p> In the Bank of America spot , U2 performed their brand new single " Invisible " and made the song free for downloading for 24 hours following the game . Bank of America donated $1 to ( RED ) for each download . All of that was clearly spelled out in the spot . <p> The ad generated 3 million-plus downloads and more than $3 million dollars for ( RED ) exceeding Bank of Americas initial pledge of $2 million . <p> Chevys more cinematic " Life " spot promoted its Purple Roads campaign with the American Cancer Society . ( The two have been partners for 11 years . ) At its end , the spot asks viewers to " Join Chevy and the American Cancer Society in celebrating survivors and those who support them on the road to recovery , " touting last Tuesday as World Cancer Day . The spot closes with the URL : chevy.com/purpleroads <p> What is n't obvious from the spot is that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering a donation of $1 for every consumer who turned their Facebook or Twitter profile purple ( up to $1 million ) , but you would only know that if you went to the microsite . Purple , according to ACS , is the color of cancer survival . <p> Chevy says that more than one million people have turned their social media pages purple , so the campaign has reached its goal . What we do n't  know is what the result would have been if the ad had been as direct as Bank of Americas . Would Chevy have exceeded its goal by 50 percent , like Bank of America did ? Even if GM kept its donation amount capped , that would still have been a major amount of additional social media buzz generated for ACS . <p> I also wonder if even more people would have gotten on board had the call to action been simpler . In Bank of Americas case , consumers simply went to iTunes and downloaded the song , something most do regularly . <p> For Purple Roads , Facebook users had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they could even start the process . Twitter users were asked to grant permission for the Purple Your Profile app to " Read Tweets from your timeline ; see who you follow ; follow new people ; update your profile ; and post new Tweets for you . " Even if you were willing to accept those terms , there was still plenty of confusion about exactly how to change the profile color , based on online comments I saw ( and my own experience ! ) . <p> Again , I 'm not ignoring the fact that the Purple Your Profile campaign generated $1 million for ACS . But other campaigns that do n't  follow cause marketing best practices that we routinely recommend to IEG Consulting clients might not be as fortunate . <p> My advice for cause marketing campaigns from the Super Bowl to the Supermarket includes : <p> Ensure the brand is communicating and promoting the organization and its mission correctly and consistently <p> Ensure the campaign is compelling , easy to understand and makes it easy to participate through minimal steps <p> Ensure that donation amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly stated . When applicable , minimum donation amounts and/or caps should also be spelled out , along with the timeframe for the campaign <p> Ensure the campaign is promoted through all the partners communication channels

Unlike pro sports leagues , the platform affords access to intellectual property , digital assets and other team inventory . <p> And national brands are taking notice , some of which have never previously had a significant presence in college sports , said Roger VanDerSnick , IMG Colleges chief sales and marketing officer . <p> The sales vet points to United Parcel Service , Inc. as an example . Prior to signing a national deal with UPS in 2011 , IMG had two partnerships in the shipping category . UPS sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a partnership with Auburn University . <p> " Categories that havent had a large presence in college sports are high on our prospect list , " he said . <p> More recently , IMG in late 2012 announced a partnership with Lowes Cos. , Inc. that includes all of the 90-plus schools for which it owns multimedia rights .

Card members who purchase a Chase Preferred Seat receive an exclusive invite to a pre-concert reception including complimentary parking , food and non-alcoholic beverages . <p> JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has long maintained its status as one of the banking categorys biggest sponsors and in 2011 created an enterprise-wide sponsorship department charged with developing strategy and activation programs across the companys vast portfolio . <p> The department oversees a portfolio that includes ties inherited from mergers and acquisitions over the past two decades . Deals include the J.P . Morgan Corporate Challenge Series ( Manufacturers Hanover ) , WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden ( Washington Mutual ) , Sundance Film Festival ( First USA ) and Chase Field and the Chicago Bears ( Bank One ) . <p> On JPMCs sponsorship objectives What we want to accomplish from sponsorship is no different than any other brand . First , we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch and interact with our products and services in a way that moves beyond digital advertising or TV commercials . <p> Second , we want to provide a true reason , a very explicit reason , why you do business with JPMorgan Chase versus a competitor . That may be preferential treatment , a ticket onsale or hospitality . We want to give people affirmation on why they choose Chase . <p> We also want to create envy among people that do n't  have experience with our brand . If you 're a fan of a team , or love to attend a specific event , we want you to say " Why not Chase ? The company gives me an advantage , and their brand is something that I want to be associated with . " <p> The forth reason for our sponsorship activity is often overlooked : its part of our civic duty to support events that are near and dear to the local community and that provide an economic boon to the local population . <p> On JPMCs 360-degree approach to sponsorship We have changed our approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the time an event starts and finishes . At the US Open we have a presence digitally , in the community , in social media , on TV and at the venue itself . Our strategy is audience-centric , not property-centric . <p> On JPMCs activation strategy We approach activation as the core of what we do . We do n't  manage each property individuallywe manage activation as a collective portfolio . Early access for tickets , in-venue discounts and community programs are standard benefits across the board . <p> My overarching goal is to make sure there is a standard set of activation programs that consumers can depend on . <p> Each audience member deserves something special and unique . Its all about the experiencepeople do n't  remember an event , they remember how people made them feel . A photo from a photo booth or a hat giveaway makes an event last far beyond the few hours you 're there . <p> On the technology front , the thing were most excited about is the change in the way you pay for events . We leveraged our partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first NBA area to accept Apple Pay . The point-of-sale system is going into the next evolution of commerce , which will reduce wait time , reduce fraud and enable us to offer personalized experiences . <p> On JPMCs growing involvement in music What were doing in music is a natural maturation of looking at consumers in the broadest mindset possible . Just because someone is a fan of the New York Knicks does n't  mean they would n't like to see Billy Joel the next day . <p> We do n't  look at music as a completely different segmentits an evolution of our marketing strategy . If you 're a customer we want to be where you are , support what you like and give you a reason to bank with us . <p> Its been eye-opening to expand into music . Not because music is different , but because a lot of it is really the same as other types of properties . <p> We try to diversify our participation in sports , and we take the same approach to music . We sponsor the Jingle Ball at Madison Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Jay-Z and Beyonc+ , and cause-related marketing like the Concert for Valor and the Concert for Sandy Relief . <p> Diversification is not something that we should be patted on the back for . Its how people consume music via downloads , streaming and live events . <p> On sponsorship trends in 2015 Were going to see a flight to quality versus quantity . Well see brands have a smaller number of large deals and deep partnerships as opposed to a sprawling portfolio of very minor relationships .

Salespeople and others within the company who have responsibility for inviting guests , hosting them on site , etc. , should be given tools to make the most of the opportunity , as well as monitored to make sure they are inviting the right quality of guest and properly following up . <p> Some companies deliver information on how to host guests , along with specific event information that can be passed along to invitees , through Intranets or other dedicated Web pages . <p> Make invitations stand out to gain notice .

That can include sending a jersey with the guests name on it or having celebrities involved in the event phone guests to invite them , he said . <p> Be diligent in following-up . Marketers who send out invitations and simply wait for RSVPs to return often find themselves with vacant seats . <p> Henry Rischitelli , president and CEO of Next Marketing , suggests that companies use multiple forms of communicationemail , letters , phone calls , etc.to follow-up invitations . " In the past , we used to hit them through one or two touchpoints . Now we 've begun to use a CRM model with multiple points of entry . " <p> Offering one-of-a-kind experiences . Unlike companies that merely buy tickets or rent a skybox , most sponsors have access to unique perks such as behind-the-scenes tours and appearances by coaches , players and entertainers that can make the occasion unforgettable . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a particular event and immerse them in that experience , such as going on field to receive instructions from players or coaches , having a private music lesson with classical musicians , or touring a venue like Carnegie Hall and spending time with an archivist , " said Schiller . <p> FedEx Corp . leverages its NBA sponsorship in part by hosting clients and prospects at the leagues All-Star Game . Taking advantage of the international makeup of the league , the company uses the event to build business for its overseas shipping services by pairing up players with representatives of companies who do significant business in the players home countries . <p> " They have the opportunity to meet the athletes , participate in basketball clinics and go out for dinner , " said Mark Tatum , the NBAs senior vice president of marketing partnerships . <p> Finding opportunities to demonstrate products and services in action . Technology companies and a growing number of other categories look to use events to showcase their offerings . <p> For example , technology products retailer CDW Corp . leverages its primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Car World Series powered by Ford to demonstrate how products it supplies help the team compete . <p> " All of the guests who come to a race are given a tour of the paddock and one of the engineers addresses what we have done to incorporate technology into the car , " said Bruce Delahorne , the companys senior manager of national advertising . <p> Similarly , IBM Corp . leverages its sponsorship of tenniss U.S. Open , PGA Tour , Wimbledon and other high-profile sports properties to demonstrate products and services ranging from servers to software to IT solutions . <p> " Its a thrill for ( guests ) to walk into the bowels of a stadium and pass athletes and people with the media . We then engage them in a discussion of how the events business needs relate to their needs , " said Rick Singer , IBMs director of worldwide sponsorship marketing . <p> IBM tries to engage clients and prospects on their " pain points , " using the propertys pain as an example , Singer said . At the U.S. Open , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for the event to reduce costs while facing a growing infrastructure , and how IBM was able to provide virtualization technology that helped reduce the number of servers it needed from sixty to nine . <p> Ensuring that your senior executives attend . Inviting senior managers of other companies and not having their peers from your organization show up conveys a negative message . <p> Even if your guests are mid-level managers , the presence of your top people is a way to demonstrate your companys commitment to its customers . <p> Best Practices : Measuring ResultsHow can a company determine whether its hospitality programs influenced sales or other desired behavior ? The critical steps in determining hospitality return on investment are : <p> Sponsors should start with a database to track who was invited ; what and when they attended ; who from the company hosted or met with them ; whether or not they were an existing client ; and their purchase/behavior history after attending the event . <p> To collect all of the necessary data , sponsors should develop pre- and post-event forms for salespeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pre-event forms should require information on each prospect to be invited . For existing clients , the form should include total business over the last three years and sales projections for the upcoming year . <p> For prospects , the form should indicate where in the sales pipeline they are . The document also should include short- and long-term revenue projections if the prospect becomes a client . <p> In addition to being the first step in tracking return , the form also can be used as a screener to ensure that the best prospects are invited to the program . The forms should be mandatory : No invitations will be sent nor tickets released until a completed form is received . <p> Post-event surveys help salespeople record immediate informal feedback from guests , such as what they thought of the event and the quality of the hospitality . The forms also can be used to track no-shows , including reasons why and the name and title of any substitutes . <p> To encourage guests at its Hogans Alley PGA Tour event hospitality program to fill out on-site surveys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards . " That turned the form from a do n't  have to to a want to , " said David Jessey , who managed the program while at Bank of America and who now serves as vice president of sales and marketing with Evernham Motorsports . The incentive paid off : 90 percent of attendees filled out the form , up from 20 percent before the bank instituted the giveaway , he said . <p> Establish post-event tracking mechanism . Because the impact of hospitality on guests behavior is not likely to be immediate , the sponsor must ensure that measurement is appropriate to the sales cycle . <p> As a result , sponsors should require their salespeople to submit forms at regular intervals updating where a prospect is in the sales process . <p> Reasonably estimate responsibility of hospitality for new or incremental business . A companys decision to buy a product or service is based on a number of factors such as price , the quality of the product , the skill of the sales rep and the impact of hospitality efforts . In order to calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a realistic assessment of what percentage of a sale can be attributed to the buyer having been entertained . <p> According to IEG Advisory Services models , the highest percentage attributable to hospitalityand applied only to sales that would not have happened without the entertainment componentis 70 percent . On the other end of the spectrum , for incremental sales to clients with whom the company already has a strong relationship , the percentage drops to 20 percent or less . <p> To calculate return on investment , the sponsor can then multiply the revenue from the sale by the percentage attributable to hospitality and subtract the costs of entertainment and the portion of the sponsorship rights fee that can be allocated to hospitality benefits ( see box ) .

" That requires a stronger investment in community events . " <p> At the same time , non-traditional food purveyors and new supermarket formatssuch as limited assortment supermarkets like Trader Joes Co. and Aldi Inc.have burst onto the scene and some of those segments also are ratcheting up sponsorship to raise their profile and draw more shoppers . These include fresh format supermarkets ( Whole Foods Market , Inc. ; Wild Oats Markets , Inc. etc. ) and dollar stores ( Dollar General Corp. , Freds , Inc. , etc . ) . <p> Each of those segments has its own sponsorship hot buttons , Hauptman noted . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote grassroots community involvement , as well as their health and wellness positioning ( a growing hot button among traditional supermarkets as well ) , while dollar stores are increasingly looking for opportunities that will help attract more upscale shoppers , he said . <p> Another emerging area for sponsorship within the grocery retail category : local independent stores and small chains . Although properties may have overlooked them in the pastassuming they did not have enough resources to become all-out sponsorssuch operations also are turning to the medium in a bid to differentiate themselves . <p> " For us , supermarket sponsorships have continued to grow in importance , " said Dave Rhody , president of RhodyCo Productions , which has signed a supermarket sponsor for each of the seven running and cycling events it produces in Northern California . The company works with both local chains ( Andronicos Markets , PW Markets ) and Whole Foods . <p> Rhody recommends that smaller properties in particular should approach local retailers , because that segment is typically easier to access and more receptive to smaller sponsorships than their regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of retailers can use their considerable leverage with packaged goods companies and other manufacturers to help properties secure deals with vendors that are on the lookout for marketing platforms that support the dual objectives of driving retail traffic and selling product . <p> A retailers involvement can be critical in landing those deals because many packaged goods companies have centralized spending at the corporate level and have reduced or altogether eliminated local and regional marketing budgets , making it much more difficult for all but the largest properties to sell sponsorships in the category . <p> " Unless they 're looking for exposure or sampling opportunities , a packaged goods company typically wont sponsor a property if a retailer is n't on board , " said Lowell Cantor , managing partner with Blue Chip Marketing &amp; Communications , a retail marketing agency that executes national promotions for packaged goods manufacturers . <p> A significant reason why the balance of power between retailers and vendors is weighted in the stores favor is the desirability of in-store marketing support . Retailers wield control over a vast array of promotional inventory , including posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure in ads and circulars . <p> Such promotional opportunities can be put into service on behalf of the property , as well as used to support packaged goods sponsors . <p> " Having a grocery chain as a partner is an amazing asset in building our visibility , " said Darrin Gross , vice president of corporate partnerships and broadcasting with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats , whose home field is titled by Raleys , Inc . " We draw 900,000 people a year ; that 's a decent day for a grocery chain . " <p> The regional supermarket company distributes pocket schedules , applications for the teams kids club and promotes other team programs at local stores , he said . <p> How Deals Typically WorkSponsorships on behalf of supermarkets and other retailers usually are structured in one of two ways . In the first scenario , supermarkets sign cash deals that give them the right to resell cosponsorships to their vendors , thus partially or fully offsetting their fee . <p> In the second scenario , the supermarket agrees to a promotional commitment in lieu of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for providing in-store display and other promotional support to the property and to packaged goods companies sold by the property . <p> Larger retail chains favor the cash fee model , as it allows them more control over their highly valuable promotional inventory . The no-fee scenario is more popular with smaller , local retailers , such as those that RhodyCo works with . <p> " Most of our supermarket programs involve a commitment of promotional inventory such as grocery bags , circular ads and in-store display , which we turn around and sell by building the retail promotion into packages for packaged good sponsors , " Rhody said . <p> On the other hand , Whole Foods paid a cash fee for its title of the Young Champions Races , Rhody noted .

Those staffers are charged with determining what products stores sell , as well as their accompanying advertising and promotional support .

Properties should make programs for both vendors and supermarkets as turnkey as possible . That includes managing on-site sampling and other logistical elements . <p> Provide access to mothers . Supermarkets sponsor in large part to reach mothers , because they make most household purchase decisions . <p> " Sponsorship on behalf of supermarkets can be very challenging . Were not interested in sponsoring sports because they do n't  draw our core customer : women 25-to-55 with children , " said Amy Murphy , Stop &amp; Shops merchandising program manager . <p> Provide access to multicultural audiences . Supermarkets are also using sponsorship to target African-American , Latino and other groups . <p> " Supermarkets see great opportunities to drive growth by attracting ethnic shoppers , many of whom buy their groceries at local independent food merchants , " said Hauptman . <p> " The larger supermarkets have learned that before they can win a piece of that business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local ethnic community , " he noted , pointing to The Kroger Co.s sponsorship of Atlantas Peachtree Latino Festival last month .

This creates a spectacular visual of light and movement as the noise level in the stadium builds and the players get pumped up , too .

Here the company is on site at the Louisiana Superdome , home of the New Orleans Saints . <p> The past two years have been a busy time on the partnership front for Verizon Wireless . <p> Since 2008 , the largest U.S. wireless service provider by number of subscribers has both retooled its sponsorship strategy and expanded its portfolio . <p> In terms of strategy , the company has moved away from ties that afford tickets , hospitality and other standard benefits in favor of content-driven partnerships that can be leveraged with 360-degree marketing platforms . <p> New deals for Verizon Wireless , a joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group plc , include most notably a four-year NFL partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nextel Corp . as the leagues official wireless telecommunications partner has been valued at $720 million including rights fees and promotional and advertising commitments . <p> Verizon is supporting the NFL platform with pre-existing team deals and several new ties , including cornerstone sponsor status of the New Meadowlands Stadiumhome to the New York Giants and Jetsand a two-year partnership with the Super Bowl Gospel Celebration . <p> In motorsports , Verizon has opted out of its two-year-old NASCAR team sponsorship with Penske Racing in favor of an expanded presence with the Izod IndyCar Series , including an official league deal and full-season primary sponsorship of one of Penskes entries in the open-wheel circuit . <p> IEG SR recently spoke with Suzy Deering , executive director , media and partnerships for Verizon Wireless , about the companys evolving strategy , its recent partnerships , how it is activating deals with content and in-store promotions , and the challenges of measuring return on investment . <p> Deering : Two years ago we put a stake in the ground to advance our sponsorship strategy .

Our technology helps enable consumers to support their passion , which is ultimately at the heart of a sponsorship . <p> The NFL is more than a traditional sponsorship . Its not about official sponsor status or signs and logo treatments . What 's important for us is providing a vehicle that helps consumers tap into their passion points . That includes accessing the latest news or team updates through the NFL RedZone channel or using devices to view games . <p> Deering : Yes . We approach media by examining the lifestyle and behavior of our key target audience . When you talk about their interests , it is not just what TV programming they are watching , but what they do in their free time . <p> That is where sponsorship plays into it . Sponsorship allows us to have a conversation that extends beyond a 30-second TV spot . <p> There are properties in our portfolio right now that do not line up with our strategy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything that does not align with our strategy will not be renewed . <p> IEG SR : Apart from content , how else are you activating the NFL partnership ? <p> Deering : It is important for us to enable consumers passion for content , but at the same time , we do not want that to be the only activation element .

We are a cornerstone partner of the New Meadowlands Stadium , where we have a studio where consumers can check out our latest handsets , experience our FiOS and telecommunications products , and get the skinny on the latest apps on the market . Consumers who visit the studio also can experience our 4G service , which is the next evolution of our network . <p> Those types of environments allow us to have a more dynamic interaction with consumers , instead of us trying to explain FiOS in a 30-second TV ad . <p> We also do in-store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowl or Pro Bowl . We also do player appearances , as well as a big in-store push for the mobile NFL app . <p> We are also gearing up a promotion called 45 Days to the Super Bowl , which is a program that will offer random surprises for customers . People who visit our stores at certain times may receive a special greeting by a player , win tickets or receive signed merchandise . <p> We look at sponsorship as an extension of our media mix , so there are also a lot of elements on the media side . That includes TV ads and a very aggressive online plan that includes a dedicated landing page on VerizonWireless.com . <p> IEG SR : The company decided not to continue its involvement in NASCAR after two years in favor of an expanded presence with the Izod IndyCar Series .

Although this annual conference on data , research and analytics is for social sector professionals , much of what we learned applies not only to nonprofits , but to rightsholders of all types . <p> We heard from innovative and forward-thinking leaders in the social sector about how they are using data to create a more effective and efficient world . It was heartening to hear so many great examples of how these data-driven organizations use data to not only track one point in time but continuously track data to inform strategy and measure successes or failures . These organizations have built systems to constantly monitor KPIs to provide real-time insights to shape strategy and measure impact . <p> We are in exciting times where we have more data and processing power than ever before . The keys to success are : building data-first-minded organizations , learning which data to track , knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Below are four key themes we feel are great learnings for all organizations for all manner of initiatives and functionsmarketing , programming and so on . <p> Big data should n't be scary.Dean Karlan , professor of economics at Yale , implored the audience to track data with a purpose . He encouraged the audience to use the CART principles to stay on track with using the results of measurement : <p> Credible : Do the findings answer the question ? <p> Actionable : Do you have a plan on how to use the data and the right systems in place to handle the information ? <p> Responsible : What is the right amount of data ? How will the data generate guidance ? <p> Transferable : Will the data be understood across key audiences ? <p> Data should inform strategy , but data is just a tool . While all speakers advocated for better measurement , they were careful to warn against viewing data as a panacea . <p> Matthew Scharpnick , co-founder and chief strategy officer at Elefint Designs , said , " The belief that big data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of data will erase all the errors is not true . Human analysis and decision-making is going to get us to where we want to be . " Scharpnick went on to encourage all organizations to avoid leaving data in its raw state . Use data visualization to highlight key stats , and make sure you use the data to support a story ( rather than seeing data as the story ) . <p> His quick tips were as follows : <p> Know your audience and their level of engagement <p> Know the objective of the visual and the story you want to share <p> Always source your information and provide a narrative to the visual <p> Technology is no longer a barrier . According to Sheri Chaney Jones of Measurement Resources Company , " there is no correlation between size , budget and high measurement cultures . Even small organizations without large budgets can use available tools and measure key data points that will help them in their work . " In other words , we have all run out of excuses not to measure ! <p> Knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to share data within organizations .

For UniCredit , S.p.A. , the answer is sponsorship . <p> Looking to unify its vast holdings under a common name , the Milan , Italy-based company in 2007 rolled out a master brand that saw it move from a " house of many brands " to a " branded house . " <p> The goal : To unify , endorse and enhance its local brands and allow each bank to be perceived as part of a leading Pan-European financial institution . <p> To support the strategy and generate excitement at the local level , UniCredit in 2009 signed a three-year partnership with the UEFA Champions League . <p> UniCredit in 2011 extended the tie through 2015 after generating the following results in the first two years of the partnership : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in aided brand awareness <p> Steady improvement in propensity to buy <p> Effective sales conversion and leads <p> Extensive media exposure from UEFA Champions League Trophy Tour <p> 170 percent net return on comparable sponsorship costs <p> " The results were really good , so we decided to prolong the sponsorship , " said Daniele Penna , UniCredits head of strategic sponsorships . <p> Supporting The Master Brand Through Soccer UniCredit in 2008 began to search for an international sports marketing platform to promote its new brand .

After that , we wanted on-site exposure . That led us to Dale Earnhardt , Inc. , where we sponsored cars driven by Mark Martin and Regan Smith . <p> One reason we left NASCAR was the cost associated with the sport . When the economy went south we did n't  have the same dollars to invest , and we found that other sports were a better fit with our target audience .

Activation should occur off-screen in addition to on-screen to bring the partnership to life . <p> Starbucks has taken a baby step in that direction as presenting sponsor of The Voices Twitter poll to select specific songs for contestants to sing on the show .

They also can be used by Red Bull as digital bait to build its own channels . <p> For example , in addition to the two-hour live stream of the jump on Red Bulls YouTube channel , the Red Bull Stratos web site and the Red Bull Stratos Facebook page , the leap also was broadcast on traditional television , including on the Discovery Channel in the U.S. , Seven Network in Australia and more than 75 other outlets across 50 countries . Also , the BBC , The Telegraph and scores of other media outlets were allowed to stream the live feed through their own sites , each in turn publicizing the event and getting more eyes on screens . <p> Red Bull did n't  just sponsor the mission , it commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why it mattered . It documented the history of the records that Felix was attempting to break , showed us his preparation , populated a web site with information on the technology being used to break these records , and so on . <p> Takeaway : Brands are now media , high quality content is critical in the mix . <p> Promote the Purpose , Not the Sponsorship Sponsoring something newsworthy does not itself make a brand newsworthy . What catapulted Red Bull onto the top of the earned media charts were the stories it told around the mission and the newsworthy way it told the stories . <p> The Red Bull Stratos team members described the projects mission as advancing scientific discoveries for the benefit of mankind . This helped Red Bull attract an older , more educated audience than it typically targets . For these newcomers , Red Bull posted videos and blogs featuring the scientific importance of the mission , its technological advances , etc . <p> For its traditional extreme sports audience , there was the jump as " death defying " story . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torch from 84-year-old Joe Kittinger , the surviving record holder , to Baumgartner .

Everything was about getting Felix up and down safely . <p> Takeaway : Red Bulls posts went viral because they were linked to dreams bigger than eyeballs and sales . <p> Create Event-specific Web Sites , Social Skins , etc . With a pre-Stratos community of more than 30 million followers across Red Bull social channels , Red Bull could have relied on its existing base to spread the word . It did n't  . <p> Red Bull built a Stratos-specific site with a wealth of content and frequent updates to please all sorts of people <p> Red Bull created Red Bull Stratos accounts on : <p> Google+ ( 1,457,228 people in its circle ) <p> Facebook ( 847,201 Likes ) ; <p> Twitter ( 221,810 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted frequent updates on these dedicated Stratos accounts , while its main brand pages continued posting about the full spectrum of Red Bull news and events . <p> This multi-pronged approach brought new people into the Red Bull fold without diluting its existing channels . Indeed , the five most engaging posts on Red Bulls Facebook page during the 30 days leading up to the jump were all related to Stratos . <p> And , because each network offers different values , audiences and opportunities , Red Bull tailored content to each . <p> Rather than creating one update for Twitter and simply reposting it to Facebook , Google+ and other social media platforms , Red Bull created content specifically designed for each of its social platforms and to optimize interaction and engagement rates in each channel . <p> For example , the Google+ audience skews older than Facebook and better educated , so Red Bull used Google+ to host hangouts with the medical team and to discuss scientific goals for the mission . <p> On Facebook , Red Bulls goal was to get people to look and share , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high quality image and a link . <p> Red Bulls social pages contained high-quality images and video clips , tailored to the channel . For example , there were images of Korean rapper Psy of " Gangnam Style " fame on the Red Bull Stratos Facebook page . <p> Red Bull created a hashtag with both its name and the event : #redbullstratos . Tweets from the @redbullstratos account , which contained an update and/or Instagram shot from test flights , preparations , etc. , were short enough for easy retweets . To quickly gain trending status , Red Bull suggested Twitter hashtags . <p> Blog posts on the Red Bull Stratos web site were longer and provided more in-depth analysis . Instagram was important both because it connected with Twitter , Facebook , Flickr , Foursquare , etc. , and also because images are the most viral type of content . <p> Takeaway : Create snackable content and parse it out in formats right for the channel : plug-and-play web clips , interviews , documentaries , games , news features , photo shoots and editorials . <p> Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live updates and photos of Felixs preparation and a computer-generated simulation of the leap . Red Bull produced a series of videos documenting the history of the record ; Felixs training regime and prior jumps ; the technology behind the jump and his space suit ; etc . Just before the jump , Red Bull produced and posted a video of Red Bull athletes wishing Felix good luck . <p> But Red Bull did n't  just post . It also engaged by crowdsourcing questions for interviews with Felix and the team , asking fans to share their stories of inspiration , and inviting viewers to guess where Felix would touch down after the jump .

Just download or share a Mean Stinks wallpaper and Secret will donate $1.00 to PACERs National Bullying Prevention Center .

@@37033580 @6033580/ <h> Follow <h> All For One And One For All : The Importance Of Cross-promotions <p> Both sides are interested in boosting joint promotional activity , but the onus is on properties to facilitate such programs . <p> Properties may be missing out on a key way to add value , attract new partners and retain current ones : facilitating cross-promotions among their sponsors . <p> Although shared promo activities between sponsors is far from a new idea , corporate marketers interviewed by IEG SR say there is more lip service paid to the concept than actual plans and programs that get put into action . <p> And while sponsors place the blame for that on the shoulders of both their property partners and themselves , their interest in changing the situation means a large opportunity exists for properties that are willing and able to step up and make cross-promotions happen . <p> Sponsorship decision-makers are quite clear about their interest in joint promotions and the necessity of properties playing the key role in facilitating relationships among cosponsors . <p> " Anytime we enter a partnership were always curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anything that we can do to enhance the relationship through a cross-promotion , " said Tracy Sandford , director of advertising and promotions with JetBlue Airways Corp . <p> " I always look to our partners to facilitate those synergies , " said Rich Karlis , director of sponsorships and events with Qwest Communications Intl , Inc . " Its my expectation that they are brainstorming and bird-dogging those ideas for all of their partners . " <p> Cross-promotions offer major benefits for sponsors and properties alike . <p> For sponsors , they offer the opportunity to gain exposure through new channels , earn a positive rub-off from alignment with like-minded and well-regarded partners , and share promotional costs . <p> " You get a more efficient marketing program when you bring two companies together that have different audiences , customers and distribution channels , " said Rick Singer , director of worldwide sponsorship marketing for IBM Corp . " You can also benefit from an affiliation with a strong brand , which helps raise the value of your presence and image . " <p> " The real power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new distribution channels , " said Gary Jacobus , managing director of corporate partnerships with the USTA , who previously served as the NFLs vice president of corporate sponsorship development . <p> Jacobus cited a past promotion that the NFL facilitated between Sears , Roebuck and Co. ; Starter Corp. ; and Del Monte Foods Co.s StarKist tuna that brought the apparel brand and the retailer into supermarkets while giving StarKist non-traditional exposure in Sears stores . <p> Such promotions also benefit the properties involved by providing them incremental exposure and , perhaps more importantly , making the sponsorship more valuable for the corporate partners . <p> " Its good to have two or more partners work togetherit makes it difficult for them to say no down the road , " said Matt Brown , director of corporate sales with the MLB Cleveland Indians . <p> In addition to keeping current sponsors happy , cross-promotions can be used as a hook to secure new partners . For example , the Teva Mountain Games is offering select potential partners presence within Teva Outdoor Corp.s exhibit space at industry trade shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , which non-industry companies would n't purchase on their own because they would be seen as blatantly out-of-place , non-endemic companies without the connection to Teva , " said Joel Heath , president of Untraditional Marketing , the agency that produces the Vail , Colo. games . <p> Success Story : How The Broncos Play MatchmakerThe NFL Denver Broncos took their interest in facilitating sponsor cross-promotions to a new level this year . <p> " We are big believers in sponsor cross-promotions , " said Brady Kellogg , the teams director of corporate partnerships . " Its a great way to extend a sponsors relationship with us and make its dollars go further , which is especially important as budgets come under more scrutiny . " <p> The team earlier this year hosted its first-ever series of one-on-one sponsor networking meetings . The goal : Let sponsors brainstorm ideas , share best practices and commiserate on common challenges . <p> " To say there is an opportunity for cross-promotions is one thing . But it indicates an additional level of support to take a more active role and actually bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Broncos established the individual breakfast meetings to provide sponsors a more intimate environment apart from the teams annual sponsor summit . <p> " Weve done a great job hosting sponsor summits , but you get to a point where it can be intimidating when you have 80 to 100 people in a room . People tend to gravitate to who they know , " Kellogg said . " From a process standpoint , its much easier sitting down with three , four or five people at a time . " <p> To find out which partners to pair up for the breakfast meetings , the Broncos sent out a questionnaire asking sponsors which other companies they would like to meet . <p> The team also suggested meetings to partners it thought could benefit from a cross-promotion . " Knowing their personalities and inventory , we tried to play matchmaker , " Kellogg said . <p> Thus far , the meetings have resulted in several cross-promotions this season between Cold Stone Creamery and other Broncos sponsors . <p> For example , Cold Stone teamed with U.S. Bancorps U.S. Bank on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic to the ice cream shops and prompt transactions using the banks Broncos-themed debit card . Consumers that used the card at Cold Stone received a 15 percent discount . <p> In addition to driving card usage , the partnership gave U.S. Bank two other business-building opportunities : The ability to pitch its banking services to Cold Stone franchisees , and the opportunity to include direct deposit information in employment packages sent to new Cold Stone hires . <p> Cold Stone also ran promotions with two other companies : IAC/InterActiveCorp.s Ticketmaster and Dicks Sporting Goods , Inc . <p> The ice cream chain ran a promotion with Ticketmasters TicketExchange secondary ticket service in which it distributed two-for-one coupons in ticket packages . In exchange , the retailer touted TicketExchange in its Denver-area stores . <p> The Broncos also have facilitated relationships between partners by leveraging the products and services they can provide each other . For example , AT&amp;T Inc. over the past two years has provided back-end support for a co-branded text-message promotion conducted by Anheuser-Busch , Inc.s Budweiser beer . <p> " Instead of paying a company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring that resource to the table , " Kellogg said <p> In addition to generating revenue from each text sent by its subscribers , AT&amp;T also receives equal billing with Budweiser in the promotion . <p> Host sponsor summits and networking meetings . Corporate partners typically do not take the initiative to reach out to cosponsors to discuss potential joint promotions , thus it is up to the property to get the ball rolling . <p> Know your partners business practices . To generate cross-promotional ideas that make sense , properties should have a good understanding of each sponsors business practices and their history of working with others corporations . <p> " Its incumbent on us to really know our partners and their willingness and flexibility to work on cross-promotions , " Kellogg said . <p> For example , Kellogg points to Cold Stones practice of distributing two-for-one offers through other channels and its ability to customize in-store offers as indicating potential interest in working with other team sponsors . <p> Share ideas on a regular basis . Properties should offer cross-promotional ideas with sponsors as part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly conference calls with each sponsor , " said Wade Martin , president of the AST Dew Tour . " We walk them through event updates , both big and small , and they do the same with their activation plans . That ongoing dialogue helps you to connect the dots . " <p> Those conversations helped prompt a cross-promotion this year between Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. , Inc. and gear bag manufacturer Ogio Intl around their partnerships with the Dew Tour and pro skateboarder Bob Burnquist . <p> Unfortunately , sponsors say that making time to have that type of dialogue often is overlooked , as properties focus on making sure contract deliverables are fulfilled . <p> Start off with small-scale promotions . Properties should test the cross-promotional waters with ideas that do n't  require large investments of resources . <p> " One of the things that we have benefited from is our willingness to start small and see if they lead to other opportunities , " Wade said . " We have n't had success with big national promotions , because you always get tripped up . The bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around it . " <p> Look for sponsors willing to take the lead . Properties should look for partners willing to drive a promotion with or without other sponsors . <p> " You always need one partner that will be the driver and will do the promotion by themselves if necessary , " Wade said . " You can talk and talk and never get over the hump if there is n't a driver behind it . " <p> Leverage sponsors products as prizes . Where possible , properties should try to use sponsors products as prizes for sweepstakes and other promotions . <p> For example , Teva Mountain Games leverages its partnerships with outdoor apparel and sporting goods companies to secure prizes for promotions conducted by its non-endemic partners . <p> Confluence Watersports Co.s Dagger Kayaks and Trek Bicycle Corp . have partnered with Molson Coors Brewing Co. to provide prizes for the brewers off-premise promotions at reduced or no cost . The promotions gave the two equipment companies exposure in a non-traditional channel . <p> " They have product that mainstream sponsors would love to get their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dollars from my mainstream partners , " Heath said . <p> Leverage retail partners . Properties with sponsors in the retail category should leverage those relationships to develop cross-promotions with packaged goods companies and other vendors that sell through them . <p> " The easiest cross-promotions are between retailers and food , beverage and other vendors . They are the low-hanging fruit , " said Jason Pearl , vice president of corporate sponsorship with the MLB San Francisco Giants . <p> Properties should also take advantage of categories that naturally go togethersuch as beer and salty snacksto create cross-promotions . <p> The April/May Indians-themed promotion touted a $5 mail-in rebate to consumers who purchased all three products ; the companies touted the offer on display cards and other point-of-sale collateral . <p> Cross-promotion Best Practices For SponsorsGuidelines for making the implementation of cross-promotions run smoothly include : <p> Give yourself plenty of lead time . Cross-promotions can take time to brainstorm , create and implement . As such , partners should try to begin planning such programs at least six months out . <p> Determine competencies . Participants should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . That can include media support , in-store merchandising opportunities , etc . <p> Prioritize objectives . When developing a promotion , each sponsor should identify and concentrate on achieving a primary goal or outcome . For any one partner to try to use the promotion to accomplish multiple objectives can be difficult when numerous companies are involved . <p> Set ground rules up front . Sponsors should establish expectations as early as possible in the planning process . <p> For example , if a company promises $X in advertising support , will they need to provide media affidavits to show they spent that much ? Or , if the cost of running the promotion is $X , will one company pay for it all and be reimbursed , or will each company be expected to pay their share up front ?

While in-game virtual advertising is not a new concept ( baseball has been utilizing it for behind-the-plate advertising for 10+ years ) , it is becoming more prevalent amongst NHL teams in recent years . Thinking about it in greater detail , selling digital advertising inventory would be a great fit for teams in several different sports and a potential league-wide activation platform for a sponsor . <p> Teams in other professional sports could build off of MLBs and NHLs existing digital advertising model . MLS teams could place virtual advertising behind the goalies during games . A brand could also implement a strategy similar to Allstates imbedding its logos in the goal post nets during college football games and place its logo between the goal posts during the NFL London game each year ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A few months ago , my colleague Sarah Hartman wrote a blog post about the overwhelming number of logos cluttering the basketball court during several NCAA college tournaments . Beyond the clutter issue , the logos negatively impacted the on-court performance because they caused several players to slip throughout the game . While I am not advocating for the same number of corporate logos to appear on the court ( it was slightly ridiculous ) , replacing those court stickers with virtual logos would at least eliminate the negative performance impact while still allowing for nearly the same in-game exposure . <p> While the 25,000+ attendees would n't see a digitally-inserted sponsor logo , that loss of exposure is not likely to have a significant marketing impact on the partnership . From a Valuation standpoint , IEG views on-court logos as signage , which would add ( at most ) $.05 per attendee to the sponsorships fair market value .

This would increase the value of a sponsors ad by connecting the brand with a specific moment or message that the sponsor could also activate/promote around .

" <p> Step #2 : Securing The Meeting . The focus of the meeting should be to gather information , not make a sale .

The seller uses information from the meeting to create a proposal targeted to the prospects specific marketing needs . <p> The multi-page document should be comprised of two parts : a one- or two-page offer letter and a separate document that contains supporting information . <p> The offer letter is essentially a more detailed version of the proposal brief . The document should include a summary of the sponsorship opportunity , four or five tailored benefits , customized promotional overlays , the rights fee and a call to action . <p> The addendum should include information that supports the sponsorship opportunity .

The companys activation around the deal not only allows it to collect those leads , but also to qualify and target them . <p> For example , as presenting sponsor of the Hank Aaron Award , which recognizes the best overall hitter in both the National and American leagues , Century 21 conducts fan voting for the award on its Web site , as well as on MLB.com and all 30 team sites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is voted on solely by fans ; recipients previously had been selected by broadcasters and writers . <p> To vote , consumers must supply the following information : name , email address , whether or not they are considering buying a house , and if they are , whether it would be their first home purchase .

Weve done the same thing with sponsorship , where we test to find out what works and what does n't  . " <p> For example , BellSouth tested different uses of its suites and ticket allotments at pro sports events and found that the best use of those benefits was to offer evening opportunities for business-to-business hospitality and to use daytime events for radio promotions giving tickets to consumers .

While such language was once the domain of sponsors endorsement deals with athletes and celebrities , the growing number of cases of corporate malfeasance show the potential for a sponsor to do damage to a propertys reputation . <p> " The issue is n't solely whether or not a company in trouble can pay its rights fee , but whether it would be a public embarrassment for the property to continue to be sponsored by a company under scrutiny , " said Pam Lester , an attorney and president of Lester Sports and Entertainment , a consultancy specializing in sports marketing , licensing and management . <p> Preparing For Getting Out When You Are Getting InIn addition to anticipating changing circumstances , sponsorship contracts should be drafted with an eye toward making the obligations of each party crystal clear and must address what will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contractual grant of rights should be as specific as possible , " Lester said . <p> Agreements should completely spell out every right and benefit and every operational arrangement necessary to deliver those rights and opportunities . This makes it easy to identify when either party is not fulfilling its obligations . <p> There are usually far fewer ways for sponsors to be in breach of a contract than properties . They typically include failing to make payments or improperly using a propertys logo and other trademarks . <p> On the flip side , properties generally have more ways to breach because they have many more deliverables . The key protection for a sponsor is to account for all the variables that could impact the value of the benefits they have purchased . <p> For example , " sponsors will want to protect themselves in the event that new technology lessens the value of their rights , such as Internet broadcasting cannibalizing the over-the-air broadcast of a sporting event , " Lester said . <p> To address breaches of contract , attorneys recommend that agreements include a notice-and-right-to-cure provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party that the other party believes there has been a breach . <p> The provision should then specify that the party in breach has the right to cure the breach within a specific time period , such as 15 or 30 days . <p> It is very important that the contract spell out remedies if the situation is not cured in that time period . <p> Remedies For SponsorsThe remedies sponsors have in case of breach might include what attorneys refer to as " specific performance , " which simply requires the property to provide the rights and benefits spelled out in the contract . <p> Remedies also could include liquidated damages , which can take the form of an agreed-to sum that the rightsholder must pay for failure to deliver a certain benefit , or a full or partial refund of the fee paid . If it is a partial refund , the agreement needs to make clear on what basis it will be calculated . <p> Negotiating the monetary value of benefits up front is critical , said Wesley Zirkle , general counsel with motorsports agency Just Marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may hate each other to sit down and fairly determine value . The clause demonstrates that the two parties convened at one time and determined that this is the money that would be owed back if the contract was terminated early . " <p> A sponsor also will want to specify that if the event to which it bought sponsorship is canceled for any reason other than an act of God , then the sponsor should not be obligated for any future payments . <p> In that situation , the sponsor should also receive a rain date , i.e. , the same rights and benefits the next time the event is held . That would prevent the property from breaching its contract because it received a more lucrative offer from another sponsor . <p> In the case of new properties , or if there is a question about a propertys financial wherewithal , a sponsor may require the rightsholder to post a performance bond that would provide reimbursement if the event does not take place , said Mary Hutchings Reed , an attorney with law firm Winston &amp; Strawn who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ensure that if the entire contract is terminated due to a breach by the rightsholder , the sponsor is reimbursed for part or all of the fee that it has already paid . Additionally , sponsors will want to secure the right to continue using property trademarks so that , if it desires to , it can still promote its association and benefit from the relationship . <p> Sponsors and properties should note that breaches of contracts do not result only from direct actions or omissions in fulfilling agreements , but can be caused by seemingly far removed activity . <p> For example , contracts with properties that sell sponsorship across multiple assets , events or venues should include language that addresses what will happen to its corporate partnerships if one of those assets is sold . <p> Such could be the case for deals involving mega properties like The Walt Disney Co. and Universal , which often cross multiple divisions , including theme parks and movie studios . " In this climate there is a lot of buying and selling of those types of assets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to take them away , " she noted . <p> Remedies For PropertiesIf a sponsor is responsible for a breach , rightsholders should ensure that the contract specifies that future installment payments remain due and must be made . Without such a clause , a sponsor could deliberately breach the contract as a way to walk away and owe nothing . <p> If a sponsor misuses its partners trademarks , properties should be able to terminate the contract and receive liquidated damages in addition to any money owed for the rights fee . <p> Rightsholders should try to establish a payment structure in which they receive as much of their fees as possible early in the relationship , and are fully compensated by the time of an event , Reed advised . That may lessen the need for legal action in the event of a sponsor breach , she noted . <p> " A property does n't  want to have to sue to recover fees and damagesnot only is it time consuming , distracting and expensive , but it is likely to lead to bad publicity , " Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rightsholders breach or incompetenceto justify its own breach . That is destabilizing for an event . " <p> Rightsholders also should include a clause addressing late payments by the sponsor . The contract should specify the penalty and an interest rate to be charged per month until payment is received . <p> Properties concerned about a prospective partners financial situation and its ability to make payments on time and in full can protect themselves by asking for a letter of credit or an escrow account , with payments made upon performance of certain deliverables . <p> " There is a cost to carrying a letter of credit , but it does provide some protection to the rightsholder , " Reed said . <p> Just as sponsors may desire to continue promoting the association with a property when a contract is terminated early through a rightsholder breach , a property will most likely want to immediately suspend those rights when it is the sponsor that has broken the agreement . <p> Regardless of whether a contract is terminated early or simply expiring , it should specify when the sponsor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sponsor continues to use promotional footage , branded merchandise and other property imagery after the end of a contract , it may conflict with the rights being granted to a new sponsor and , if continued , may insinuate an ongoing association with the property . <p> As a result , provisions must be made for the sponsor to remove inventory bearing property marks from retail and other distribution channels . In general , when a contract is expiring normally , a sell-off period will be provided whereby the sponsor has the ability to sell off the stock for a defined period , after which all stock should , at the option of the rightsholder , be either destroyed or acquired by the rightsholder . <p> Finally , in any circumstance resulting in termination , contracts should indemnify and protect the rightsholder from legal action taken by other sponsors of the property that may be negatively impacted by a cosponsors exit . <p> For example , a sponsor that aligned with a property to piggyback another sponsors media campaign may feel injured if that sponsor ends its relationship early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsorship sales agency . <p> " There should n't be any compensation involved with soothing the sponsor , but properties should at least indemnify themselves from risk , " he said . <p> Editors Note : This article does not constitute legal advice and should not be regarded as a substitute for legal advice . <h> Who Decides <p> Sponsorship contracts should explicitly spell out the dispute resolution mechanism for any breaches and make the use of the mechanism mandatory . <p> Arbitration is usually the preferred method of resolution because it is generally quicker and more economical than filing suit . <p> But arbitration has limitations . For example , an arbitrator can not issue an injunction , so if trademarks are being used improperly , a property must go to court to seek to stop the misuse immediately . <p> A contracts arbitration clause must provide : what countrys or states laws will govern the dispute the method of invoking arbitration ( typically by written notice to either party ) that arbitration is the exclusive mechanism for dispute resolution if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ) that it is the exclusive remedy whether it is binding or not , and if not binding , what the next approved means of dispute resolution is ( litigation , mediation , etc. ) who pays the arbitration costs <p> In addition , the prevailing party in the arbitration or other proceedings should recover its attorneys fees and other out-of-pocket costs incurred in the dispute resolution process .

The chief job descriptor for a sponsorship director would be to manage the agency . <p> This would require a major change to the current sponsorship landscape : Rightsholders would have to let go of the notion that it is highly preferable to work directly with the client .

@@37033603 @6033603/ <p> Whirlpool Corp.s partnership with Habitat for Humanity Intl is a textbook case of how a company can use sponsorship to respond to a market challenge . By researching the touchpoints that trigger brand loyalty among its target , Whirlpool was able to identify a clear course of action , which in this case was leveraging an existing philanthropic relationship to deliver against business-building objectives . <p> For other sponsors and their potential partners , the lesson from Whirlpools example is that basing sponsorship decision-making on a thorough modeling of consumers desires and motivations , coupled with understanding the direct financial impact of changed consumer behavior , will result in highly effective , bulletproof campaigns . <p> Below are excerpted remarks from the keynote presentation at IEGs Sponsorship at Light Speed conference delivered by John Alexander , the companys vice president and general manager , Whirlpool and value brands , North American Region . <p> To understand how Whirlpool analyzes sponsorship , its important to understand our industry and business . The major home appliance category has been in a stalemate for years . It has tended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized primarily by cost and quality parity , with competitors quickly following any new product features . <p> The industry also has been marked by high fixed costs , slow growth , little customer loyalty to brands and concentrated trade distribution power . <p> One of the serious implications of that situation is that price becomes a major element of the consumers decision process , leading ultimately to marginal shareholder return . <p> Thus Whirlpool had two paths we could go down . We could strip all the cost out of our company and play the commodity game , or we could choose the path that we call brand-focused value creation . The second option , which we chose , meant finding ways to build strong brands that consumers would pay a premium for , and then innovating around those brands . <p> We needed to become much more than a world-class manufacturer . We needed to move from an organization that builds great products , does well at distributing them through the trade , and then hopes to make a great margin on them , to a company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request , or better yet , demand . <p> Our mission became " the passionate creation of lifelong relationships with our customers by being their most trusted , desired and selected brand . " <p> As we started on that path , we did a great deal of work to define what each of our brands position is , and we developed a clear description of who our target consumer is for each brand . But we also realized that as important as positioning the brand and understanding the target is , unless we understood how to drive value from that consumer , we were going to go nowhere . <p> The key to success would be understanding those things that make consumers loyal to a brand . This is different than being loyal to a product " I love my washer , so I would go back and buy the same washer . " We want people to be loyal to the Whirlpool brand , so whatever Whirlpool comes out with , they will want to buy . <p> More than two years ago , we started to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven behaviors that we use to gauge consumer loyalty : <p> We define passionately loyal customers as those who answer absolutely yes to four of those seven . <p> We then define the brands CLIcustomer loyalty indexas the percentage of all customers who are passionately loyal . We believe that the higher a brands or companys CLI , the better its future growth will be . <p> But again , the key questions for us to answer were , " What are the touchpoints and drivers of loyalty to the brand in our business and how can we capitalize on them to build our CLI ? " We developed an incredibly complex survey model to answer those questions . <p> The big " aha " for Whirlpool that resulted from this consumer research was that in determining brand loyalty , emotional motivations were twice as important as rational motivations . <p> This was very scary to a manufacturing company with lots of engineers ; we only became a truly brand-focused organization about five years ago . The actions we needed to take to drive growth and profitability were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one group that needed to be persuaded that this uncharted direction was a good one were our financial people . They needed to know the real impact that increasing our CLI would have on the bottom line . <p> Our model had a very compelling answer ( see Chart 1 ) . Looking at four levels of loyalty , it showed significant increases in ownership as you moved up from level to level . Overall , every one-point increase in our CLI translates into a nearly five percent increase in sales . <p> Giving The Tin Man A HeartOnce the numbers had persuaded everyone in the company to become interested in driving loyalty , it then became a matter of how to do it . <p> Our loyalty model showed us what our key drivers of loyalty were . In our survey , we tested about 50 touchpoints of what was important to consumers in terms of loyalty . Product was number one , but we knew that loyalty to the product would not drive us high enough . <p> What popped out at us was that social responsibility was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had added it to the survey at the last minute , not really knowing if it was important to consumers or not . <p> Up to that point , Whirlpool had not really understood the impact of social responsibility . We were doing a lot of great things in that area , but we viewed them simply as something a $13 billion company should do . We had never connected such activity with business results . <p> So knowing from one part of our model that we needed to make an emotional connection with consumers and then understanding that social responsibility was very important to that audience , it became clear that a cause was the way to tie those two together . <p> We did n't  have to look any further than inside the company , because we were already supporting Habitat for Humanity Intl . We had partnered with Habitat since 1999 at a level of $25 million over five years , donating a refrigerator and range to every Habitat home built in the U.S. But we had never leveraged it for our business ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first started to discuss leveraging the relationship a little more than a year ago , we really wrestled with the idea . We did n't  want to be selfish and appear to be exploiting this cause that is dear to our heart . <p> It is still something we struggle with , but one of our realizations was that leveraging the partnership not only would help Whirlpool , but also would shine a spotlight on Habitat and benefit it by potentially raising interest from other businesses that could offer support . <p> So our challenge was : How do we go out and let people know what we are doing with Habitat without raising our hand and saying , " Look at us , were a great company , give us credit for it . " <p> We put that challenge to our PR and advertising agencies , Zeno Group and Publicis , respectively . And they came back with the big idea of linking Habitat with our target audiences passion for music . <p> And so we launched a program last year working with Reba McEntire . We sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whirlpool . Reba was already working with Habitat , so she was a natural fit . <p> The most important thing to understand about this program is that it is done to raise awareness and support for Habitat and to establish an emotional connection with consumers by publicizing Whirlpools commitment to the cause . It is not about product promotion . <p> Reba is not our brand icon , our corporate spokesperson , or our target consumer . She is a voice . In my first meeting with her , I said , " Our measure of success will be if you can get more people involved in helping this cause by making them aware of Habitat and all the good things about it . I do n't  want you to sell product . The worst thing you could do is become our spokesperson . " <p> The program , which we are repeating for 05 , has many elements . At each concert venue , there is a Habitat tent to get people involved . We support the program with national TV , radio and print advertising and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the programs other key piece is employee engagement . Since we started the relationship with Habitat , we had had thousands of employees who donated their time to the organization . When we told employees that we were now going to tell the whole country how they supported this cause , it made an unbelievable difference . <p> Results from our annual survey that measures employee engagement rose 25 percent last year , all attributed to the companys social responsibility . Employee engagement is one of the key factors in driving profitability of the company , so this is a powerful argument in favor of supporting worthy causes . <p> Among the specific elements we put in place for employees were contests in which the winners were able to take trips to see our TV spot with Reba being filmed in Los Angeles and to watch her appearance on Today in New York City . <p> Habitat For Humanity Relationships Impact On Loyalty And SalesThe initial response from consumers and employees to the Reba/Habitat program was overwhelmingly encouraging ; we started receiving emails the day we announced the partnership last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in moving the loyalty numbers ? Yes it did .

Our average Web site visitors had a CLI of 22 percent ; consumers who saw the TV ad and then went to the Web site had a CLI of 37 percent . <p> What is most encouraging is that the behaviors that scored the highest increase were the ones most closely tied to emotional motivations : only buy Whirlpool ; ask for Whirlpool ; overrule the salesperson and switch stores to buy Whirlpool . <p> We have had the greatest impact on the emotional piece of the puzzle , the piece we previously did not know how to move .

For example , Kia Motors America Inc. in January signed a multi-faceted agreement with the NBA as official automotive partner , which includes title of on-court awards presentations that will be bundled under The NBA Performance Awards presented by Kia banner . The deal supports Kias existing partnerships with 16 NBA teams . <p> In addition to supporting their all-important brand imagery , on-site sales and promotional platforms to drive traffic to trade partners are equally important to beer marketers . <p> Sponsorships in the category range from the near ubiquity strategies of mass-market brandsaligning with a wide variety of property types where beer is sold and consumedto the more focused strategies of specialty products . <p> Sponsorship activity in the beer category is expected to heat up even more following the completion of the planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a combined estimated 07 sponsorship budget of roughly $250 million , MillerCoors will be a formidable competitor to Anheuser-Busch , Inc. , whose estimated $360 million budget places the company at the top of IEGs list of the largest sponsorship spenders . <p> Insurance <p> Hot buttons : Generate leads/acquire new customers Tout new product lines Gain business from underserved markets Entertain/interact with customers and business partners Showcase community involvement <p> The insurance category can be divided into three major sectors : health , life , and property/casualty insurers , which write auto , home and commercial insurance policies . <p> All three segments are active in sponsorship , with the most active being property/casualty . Nearly every major player in the sector sponsors on either the national , regional or local level . <p> In one of the categorys higher-profile new deals , Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. this year replaced A-Bs Busch beer as title of NASCARs second-tier series .

Its primary competitor Allstate Insurance Co. is heavily involved in both property categories as well . <p> Category exclusivity is a major issue for players in this category , as there are a number of product types that fall under its umbrella , including bottled water ; carbonated soft drinks ; coffee ; tea ; energy , sport and isotonic drinks ; fruit juice and other juice-based drinks ; meal replacement beverages ; milk ; and others . <p> Sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either because they control brands in many of the sub-sectors , which they want to include in the deal , or simply because they want to keep out any product that competes for thirsty consumers . <p> For example , Coca-Cola North Americas new 10-year partnership with Intl Speedway Corp . affords exclusivity across the soft drink , sparkling beverage and water categories . The deal also includes pouring rights at six motorsports tracks and title of Julys Sprint Cup Series race at Daytona Intl Speedway . <p> One hot area : energy drinks . Red Bull North America , Inc. , Monster Beverage Co. and other brands are increasingly using sponsorship to break through the clutter and reach their young adult male targets . Last week , Rockstar , Inc. signed title of the inaugural Get A Life Tour presented by Samsung Mobile . <p> Consumer products companies look for sponsorships that meet the needs of three key audiences : sales people , the trade and consumers . <p> Sales people look for turnkey promotions that can easily be sold into retailers , while retailers want account-specific promotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To motivate consumer purchase , the sponsored property must be highly recognizable . <p> Burger King Holdings , Inc. ; McDonalds Corp. ; Sonic Corp . and other fast-food restaurants typically use sponsorship as a promotional platform to drive traffic and promote new products . <p> To a lesser extent , they also use the medium to gain on-site sales rights at permanent venues and use hospitality benefits to recruit new franchisees . <p> Although they once focused their sponsorship activity on pro sports , QSRs are increasingly aligning with festivals and other types of properties to reach audiences outside their core 18-to-49-year-old male target . <p> Case in point : 29 percent of civic festivals in IEGs annual property survey reported having at least one sponsor in the QSR category . <p> Corporate offices typically fund national sponsorships , while local or regional deals are usually funded by franchisee marketing groups or individual franchisees . <p> Historically , retail banks have viewed sponsorship as a way to get their name in front of consumers , entertain key clients and demonstrate support for the communities in which they operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks compete for a larger role in the financial affairs of their customersmoving beyond traditional banking services to investments , insurance and other lines of businessthey often look to include more specific product promotion and seek direct bottom-line impact . <p> The slowing economy and continued fall-out from the subprime mortgage mess has dampened sponsorship spending by retail banks , but new deals continue to be reported . <p> On the local level , Venture Financial Group , Inc.s Venture Bank last month announced a five-year partnership with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers .

@@37033612 @6033612/ <p> To launch its full-size Tundra pickup , Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. , Inc. adopted a new marketing approach , one that eschewed traditional media advertising in favor of sponsorships and grassroots efforts that could better build relationships with potential buyers . <p> At IEGs The Next Big Thing conference , Steve Jett , the companys national truck advertising and engagement marketing manager shared why the automaker chose this new direction and outlined how it is being implemented . <p> Below are excerpted remarks from Jetts presentation . <p> The launch of the 2007 Tundra was the biggest launch in our companys history . Going into it , a process that began four years before the first new Tundras would be in dealer showrooms , we knew we had a big task in front of us . <p> Toyota has been in the compact truck business for a long time . About 15 years ago we came out with the first-generation Tundra as our first full-size truck , which was n't even full sizeit was deemed a 7/8ths truck . <p> Since then , we have struggled mightily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . <p> We knew we had to overcome the perception that Tundra was not a true half-ton truck and that it would be critical to earn the respect of traditional buyers in that category . <p> Secondly , for us to be successfulwhich means selling 200,000 Tundras this year and more in the futurewe couldnt rely on our traditional geographic strengths , which are the coasts . We were going to have to conquer the heartland . <p> That meant convincing truck owners who have lived and breathed Fords , Chevys and Dodges all their lives that we were the real deal . These were the people in focus groups who repeatedly told us they did n't  like us and never would . If that is n't a challenge , I do n't  know what is . We had a great product , but we could n't get people to even look at it . <p> Essentially , there were three types of barriers we faced . The first were rational barriers that would be addressed by the new Tundra itselfits size , power , durability , etc . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenges that only engagement marketing could address . <p> The emotional barriers were that Toyota trucks were " soft , " that most Toyota buyers were people who drove them to nice restaurants but never got them dirty . This was a significant barrier for a critical truck-buyer segment that we had to have : independent contractors . <p> The social barriers tie back to the fact that we were not accepted by the truck buyers peer group . Most of the target has a history with our competitors . For us to be successful we had to be able to win barroom debates . We needed to engage and speak to influencers who could sit down with their friends and say " I just bought a Tundra and you 've got to check this thing out . " <p> To do that , the most important thing we had to do was connect to their passions for things such as hunting , fishing and country music , and then connect those with their passions for their vehicles . If we could accomplish that , we would be accepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual launch in February 07 . The key was how to accomplish that convergence . <p> But before we got into the discipline of engagement and grassroots marketing , we recognized that what we were doing was turning our traditional way of bringing a vehicle to market upside down . <p> We typically would start with national TV advertising , then we would cascade down to regional spots , local dealer association ads , and then , almost as an afterthought , we would do some grassroots marketing and events at the end ( see Chart 1 ) . To be successful , we needed to build relationships with truck buyers first , and you do n't  do that through advertising . <p> Strategy And ImplementationThe engagement marketing piece for Tundra began about four years ago when we received word that Bass Pro Shops would not be continuing its relationship with General Motors . <p> We moved quickly to establish a partnership with Bass Pro in which we put Tundras in the stores and conducted ride-and-drives at grand openings . We also added a relationship with the Bass Anglers Sportsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , but before we got too far down the road and just started adding a bunch of partnerships , we knew we needed to formulate a strategy and have criteria for determining that we were aligning things the right way . <p> Our strategy is made up of a number of elements ( see Chart 2 ) . One is doing things the Toyota way and incorporating the companys kaizen system of continuous improvement and its respect for people . In the case of engagement , respect is reflected in how you make their experience at an event or at Bass Pro Shop , etc. , better . <p> Another is category ownership . Were there property types and other partnership areas that Tundra could own ? Given the level of competitive activity , this is very difficult , if not impossible to achieve in our business . <p> But our objective is to gain as much of a foothold as we can in three distinct areas : adrenaline lifestyle , which we do through our involvement in Supercross and other motorcycle racing events ; heartland/outdoors lifestyle , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnerships with companies such as Bass Pro , 84 Lumber and Tractor Supply Co . <p> The advantages of category ownership include the ability to have continuous dialog with consumers , boost the credibility of our involvement , and maximize efficiency of the partnerships , media and our assets . <p> At the end of the day after we had built all of these partnerships , we also made sure to give money to our regional offices so they could really connect the dots at the local level . In addition , we offered training to dealers , as well as additional co-op funding for the dealer associations , and a great deal of shared learning from our programs across the country . <p> Bringing It Home : Connective DNA And Early ReturnsConnective DNA is a fancy term for getting all of our partnerships to work together . Its about cross-pollinating everything we do to connect the targets passions and reinforce the link with Toyota . <p> One of the most effective ways to accomplish this is to repurpose activation elements so that whether a consumer is attending a Toyota-sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing tournament , they would encounter the same elements . <p> For example , we have a photo simulator that allows consumers to have their picture taken and have it look like they are in a NASCAR pit box or are on stage with Brooks &amp; Dunn . At each location , consumers can have their choice of a NASCAR , music or B.A.S.S . photo , so we are connecting those different stories for them . <p> Another cross-pollination example was when we brought Brooks &amp; Dunn to the Daytona 500 . They visited our Prove It Tour test drive area and spoke to the crowd and participated in some of the acceleration and towing power demonstration elements that are part of the tour . <p> This integration , or convergencein which we leverage all of our partnerships and relationships , whether it is by including them in incentive programs , print ads or other waysis vitally important if we are going to truly engage and win over the truck buyers we need . It starts with those who are receptive to imports , who will put us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this truck game for the long haulthe more we do the engagement piece correctly , research tells us that others will come around . Its not going to happen overnight ; its going to take a lot of time . <p> We are in the very early stages , but already we are seeing positive results . For our Prove It Tour ride-and-drives , we have 48 percent of participants requesting more information on Tundra . The best we have ever done in that regard before was about 40 percent and the industry average is between 25 and 35 percent . <p> In terms of sales , it is much too early to tell , but even over time it is unrealistic to take a single program and connect it to a sale . It begins with the progression of discovery , the recognition by consumers that we are involved with the things they are passionate about , and its about overcoming their rational barriers as well . <p> But at the end of the day , our management understands it is marketings responsibility to get prospective buyers to arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the salespeople and pricing and financing become a factor . No one element trumps the other ; everything works together to get to a sale .

Finally , moving forward will online company categories be more narrowly defined , will a property have multiple online-based companies as sponsors ? <p> I would like to hear from properties that have either successfully partnered with or unsuccessfully pitched an online company .

@@37033617 @6033617/ <h> Follow 187871 @qwx387871 <h> Elevating Property Publications and Collateral <p> By Carrie Urban KapraunDec 11 , 2009 <p> Often , similar to signage , sponsor recognition on a propertys publication and collateral pieces is taken for granted . It is relegated to sponsor recognition via " logo soup " or a barely visible band of sponsor logos . I believe that even though a sponsor mention on a flyer is n't likely to be the " showpiece " of a sponsorship , with some thought and a little creativity it is possible to elevate publications and collateral beyond the mundane to be a valuable component of a sponsorship package . <p> For almost all property types , items such as merchandise and tickets are more valuable than items such as flyers and postcards . Also , any item that is considered a keepsake is of value . However , the manner in which a sponsor is recognized is a primary factor in determining the value . One of the keys to recognizing sponsors on publications and collateral is n't always the " what " ( e.g. , brochures , postcards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , location of sponsor recognition , sponsor integration into piece , size of sponsor recognition ) . A sponsor coupon on the back of a ticket is much more meaningful than simply a sponsor logo . <p> Beyond simple logo recognition or text mention , some other ways to include sponsors in publications are sponsor specific advertisements , promotional messaging ( e.g. , couponing , special offers ) , editorial features , or including sponsor provided editorial . <p> I wanted to mention a few general guidelines-reserve the best pieces and most prominent visibility for top sponsors , limit the amount of sponsor clutter and when possible , avoid selling ads in publications to nonsponsors , especially a sponsors competitor . <p> Audience It would be a mistake to assume that all publications that a property produces are delivered to basically the same audience . The audience that receives a general promotional flyer is going to be very different than the audience that receives a membership renewal brochure . Publications that are sent to members or subscribers are more valuable because of the audience . Members or subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in a property than the general population . The same can be said for certain newsletters , property-produced magazines , membership kits , etc . <p> It might be worth the time and effort for a property to rank its publications and collateral by the audience that receives each piece . On the top of the list would be items that are sent to season ticket holders , members , subscribers , etc . The bottom of the list would include pieces that are distributed to the general public . Additionally , a property that can target specific audience attributes through its publications and collateral has an advantage . For example , a property that can separate its email newsletter list to include only high income individuals could customize a luxury brands messaging to that group . Or even better , a property could customize its newsletter content to that audience in addition to the sponsors messaging . <p> Positioning In the world of real estate , the focus is on " location , location , location " . For sponsors it is " position , position , position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cover positions include the front cover , inside front cover , inside back cover and back cover . If cover positions are not an option , it is preferable to feature sponsors near relevant editorial . A company that is a sponsor of a particular area or event within a property should be positioned near mentions of the sponsored component . <p> If possible , position a top sponsors logo near the propertys logo . It conveys a sense of partnership . Additionally , do n't  be afraid to recognize a sponsor , especially a high-level sponsor , multiple times within a piece . For example , a sponsor may have an editorial feature or promotional blurb in an email newsletter and also receive logo identification around its sponsored component . <p> If a property wanted to get really crazy , it could offer a sponsor a high-impact position or piece , something like a cover wrap , belly band , an insert , the opportunity to include a sample , or several consecutive pages of advertising/editorial recognition . <p> Content The content of a piece is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect with a propertys audience , a property should provide the sponsor with additional property-related content or creative beyond a propertys marks and logo . A sponsor can include elements such as property photos in its messaging in property publications . <p> In some cases , a sponsor can provide valuable content based on its area of expertise . Financial service sponsors sometimes provide financial tips or a beverage sponsor could provide tips for staying hydrated . Similarly , provide sponsors ownership of a certain element . For instance , a cellular phone company could be the presenting sponsor of the " Picture of the Month " feature in the monthly newsletter . To extend the benefit , include the sponsors product/service in the contest . I also think it always helps to personalize a sponsor . People are interested in other people . I 've seen some symphonies include a picture of a sponsor representative in addition to an editorial feature in their publications . It is much more impactful . As well , sponsor recognition has included sponsor web addresses for some time now ; allow sponsors to incorporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , many properties are moving their collateral pieces online instead of printing them . Some properties are publishing their pieces online and in print , but reducing the number of printed pieces . In addition to the cost savings , publishing pieces online gives properties a lot more flexibility and room for experimentation . <p> To close , I 've included an example of a property publication that I like . I like this piece because the largest sponsors receive prominent cover recognition , the number of sponsors recognized within the piece is limited , some sponsors are included multiple times in the piece and they are positioned near their sponsored component . Also , the fair prints this piece and also has it posted online . Overall , I like that they feature people throughout the piece . Let me know what you think of it or any other practices that you 've found to be effective .

" We are challenging our partners to be timelier in sharing information that will help what we are trying to accomplish . " <p> Not only are more sponsors requesting an increase in reporting frequency , but also a growing number of properties have taken it upon themselves to provide additional updates without prompting from their corporate partners . <p> For example , the American Quarter Horse Assn.which began offering recap reports less than two years agois mulling the possibility of increasing its reporting to twice a year . <p> " Theres so much data to get through at one time , " said Leman Wall , director of corporate &amp; affiliate partnerships , referring to year-end reports . <p> Other properties are already going down that road . Floridas Broward Center for the Performing Arts supplements year-end recaps with one-sheet updates following each sponsor activation activity , said Cristina Ladin , corporate relations coordinator . <p> " We want to make sure the relationship is top of mind and that our sponsors are seeing value , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the 2010 IEG/Performance Research Sponsorship Decision-makers Survey , fulfillment reports are one of the most important property-provided services , valued more highly than leveraging ideas and research on sponsor recall and loyalty , among others . <p> " They are absolutely necessary , " said Jim Vandak , director of the Army Ten-Miler run . " They provide an opportunity to report back to key stakeholders , let them know about their return on investment , as well as any lessons learned . " <p> Fulfillment reports also can tout successful partnerships to multiple stakeholders within the sponsoring company , including new sponsorship decision-makers . <p> " All too often , the person you 're working with today is not the person you 're working with tomorrow , " said Dino Richardson , corporate sponsorship &amp; sales manager with the MCAS Miramar AirShow . " If you keep success a well-guarded secret , no one will know how the program turned out when you try to resell it . " <p> Fulfillment reports also can help properties demonstrate success to less experienced sponsors that are n't  measuring return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property performance , so ( recap reports ) are necessary , " said Bill Glenn , senior vice president with The Marketing Arm , which manages sponsorships for AT&amp;T Inc. ; Monster Worldwide , Inc. ; and State Farm Insurance Cos. , among others . <p> " Once an event is over , people tend to move on to other projects , " Richardson noted . " A post-event sponsorship report is a bona fide reason to meet and discuss what happened , including successes and failures . " <p> Properties can use such a meeting as an opportunity to discuss how the two parties can build on the successor overcome challengesthus setting the stage for contract renewal , he added . <p> Going one step further , Miramar also uses current sponsor reports as a sales tool to pique the interest of potential partners . The air show uses non-proprietary information from the documents to highlight successful partnerships and allow prospects to see what they will receive . <p> " A picture is worth a thousand words , " Richardson said , noting that the reports do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects being pitched . <p> More Than Just Documenting DeliverablesThe most common critique sponsors have of the fulfillment reports they currently receive is that properties often simply provide a laundry list of benefits delivered , and fall short in offering more relevant data that sponsors find particularly helpful . <p> " Many properties fall into the trap of recapping print exposure , LED signage and other things we already know , " Haas said . " We 'd like to dig deeper into consumer information . Enlighten us on things we do n't  already know . " <p> As an example , Hass points to in-depth research on audience behavioral activity and their thoughts on and responses to corporate sponsors . " We receive a large amount of high-level demographic information , but we 'd like properties to become more granular with market research that we can use to make business decisions . " <p> Both sponsors and properties noted that information in fulfillment reports should not be simply a stream of data , but must be put into context . For example , the Army Ten-Miler uses industry benchmarks to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the race Web site to average click-throughs for online advertising , Vandak said . <p> When it comes to measuring actual return on investment or objectives , both sides acknowledge that sponsors are responsible for the metrics and data that will allow them to determine the outcome of a sponsorship . However , all properties have some information from their audiences that can contribute to a sponsors evaluation , and that data must be shared as part of the fulfillment report , noted Richardson and others . <p> Customize for each partner . When possible , each element of a report should be tailored to the objectives and sponsorship hot buttons of each sponsor . When fully-customized reports are not possible , properties should develop a template that includes at least several pages of custom content and data . <p> Information in fulfillment reports should be prioritized according to the objectives and sponsorship hot buttons of each sponsor . For example , if a partners primary goal is building relations with B2B customers , hospitality and other types of similar benefits should be discussed at the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives at the start of the relationship , then the report should appropriately address how those objectives have been impacted , " Glenn said . <p> Ensure appropriateness for multiple audiences . Recap reports should be designed to appeal to multiple stakeholders within the sponsoring company , including the sponsorship decision-maker , and the chief marketing and chief financial officers . <p> Reports also must be understandable to senior executives and other personnel who are likely to be unfamiliar with the details of the program . <p> Take the tone of a consultant . When developing recap reports , properties should take the tone of an independent third party and provide objective feedback . That includes analysis of areas where the rightsholder fell short , and how those challenges can be overcome in future years . <p> " A report can easily sound like a renewal pitch , unless the context of the metrics is properly established , " Glenn said . " A report should be viewed as an opportunity for the property to discuss its overall performance and highlight areas of strength , acknowledge areas of improvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to address each of those areas to enhance the results . " <p> In the view of the Miramar AirShow , " you want to be upfront with any problem , and you want to address it early , " Richardson said . " Get the negative stuff out of the way and then you can talk about the positive stuff to re-secure the client for the next go-around . " <p> Richardsons reports typically discuss weather conditions on the third page , Richardson said , because inclement weather can have a dramatic impact on attendance and sponsors on-site activation activities . <p> Make it an ongoing process . To avoid having to pull all information related to a sponsorship together at the time a report is due , properties should compile information related to sponsorship benefits and deliverables continuously . <p> " You have to stay on top of it every single week , or some items will fall through the cracks , " said Ladin , who is charged with developing fulfillment reports and activation programs for the Broward Center for the Performing Arts 20-plus sponsors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with appropriate internal departments for assistance in gathering usable information . The importance of sponsors to the organization may need to be emphasized to encourage participation , some industry veterans noted . <p> At the Miramar AirShow , Richardson taps the public affairs team to capture broadcast inventory bearing sponsor logos through direct video recording . <p> Deliver it in a timely fashion . Post-event reports should be delivered shortly after an event ends to ensure the partnership is top-of-mind for the sponsorship decision-maker . Event-based reports should be delivered within 30 days after an events conclusion . <p> Year-round partnerships should have reports produced at agreed-upon intervals , with the final report of a sponsors term delivered well in advance of the contract expiration date to inform discussions regarding renewal .

I encourage you to click the link above and check out the full list . I especially like their inclusion of an approval process , unacceptable sponsor categories and characteristics ( i.e. , greenwashers ) , editorial control , branding ( TEDx , not TED ) and reporting procedures . <p> The establishment of a " maximum contribution amount " would not be something I would typically endorse , but given the non-commercial aims of the TED movement , I see why they have put these guidelines in place .

" <p> Holman advises clients to begin including a clause in their concession contracts that grants them the right to require sponsors products be sold . <p> Below , IEG SR looks at where new on-site sales deals are coming from , ways that properties can add value to sales rights and how to keep all parties involved happy . <p> Properties And Sponsors Find More Options To Choose FromWhile soft drink and beer companies have long seen the value in acquiring marketing benefits to augment their pouring rights , many properties are seeing increased interest in purchasing sponsorship inventory on the part of other products that are typically consumed at events . <p> While those categories represent potential incremental revenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most likely , properties are not going to get a six-figure deal for the ketchup category ; you have to be realistic on what the category can withstand , " said John Alper , vice president , central region , for Premier Partnerships , a marketing agency that has brokered many on-site sales sponsorships for property clients such as the Pizza Hut Park soccer complex outside Dallas and the NBA New Orleans Hornets . <p> Winemakers also represent new hunting grounds for on-site sales deals . <p> Nearly every property contacted by IEG SR for this story reported increased interest or new deals in the wine category , building on a trend over the past several years that has wine brands using sponsorship to gain a point of differentiation in an increasingly competitive industry . <p> Denvers Cherry Creek Arts Festival presented by Janus this year signed a first-time partnership with Cru Vin Dogs Wine Group . The company used the tie to sample product and promote its wine club . It also donated product for the festivals annual gala and sponsor reception , said Bruce Erley , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the festival . <p> On the arts front , The Holman Group is negotiating sales deals with a watch manufacturer and a wireless phone provider . The watch deal involves the sale of a property-themed watch , while the phone deal includes a mobile phone with downloadable ringtones from the sponsored property . <p> To determine which categories and companies to pitch , Holman reviews the propertys on-site sales records from the previous several years to ascertain products that have a successful sales history . He then incorporates those numbers in his sponsorship pitch . <p> " The reason a company is going to align with an organization is because of a successful sales record , " he said . <p> Increasing The Value Of On-site Sales RightsSellers who have closed on-site sales sponsorships say that pitching such deals is about providing the sponsor with an increased number of distribution points , making those vending and pouring locations as inviting as possible , and providing turnkey promotional activities to drive on-site sales . <p> " It is a propertys job to help optimize every revenue- and business-driving opportunity for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marketing , an agency that represents Crocs , Inc. and other marketers . " They need to do everything they can , especially with revenue-sharing relationships , to act as a partner and help their sponsors drive business . " <p> Adler points to Crocs sponsorship of running events as an example . The footwear brand looks for events that take an active role in promoting Crocs on-site sales opportunities . <p> " One of the things that we negotiate into our contracts is email blasts to registered race participants to let them know well be at the finish line , " he said . " Properties need to integrate that kind of messaging in their communication efforts to make people aware of on-site transaction opportunities . " <p> Properties also can increase their value by providing multiple points of sale throughout their venues or grounds . <p> For example , in addition to sales rights at concession stands in Giants Stadium and the Izod Center , sales in the venues suites were also incorporated into the deal for popcorn brand Dale and Thomas , said Tom Lindon , vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sports &amp; Exposition Authority , which owns the venues . <p> The festival created evening balloon glows during five of its nine days . To generate even more excitement , it also hosts concerts and fireworks displays during the events . <p> " People tend not to drink beer in the early morning , which is when we typically have balloon glows , so these new events help Warsteiner by drawing people to the park at the time they usually drink beer , " said Nathan James , CEO of Fishbone Marketing , which represents the festival . <p> To further add value , properties also should be sure to include sponsors with on-site sales rights in off-site retail and other promotions when appropriate . For example , the Hollywood Bowl has incorporated sponsors E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery and Heineken in a picnic-basket-themed ticket sweepstakes that is running at roughly 800 grocery stores in the Los Angeles area . <p> Balancing The Needs Of Sponsors And **25;618;TOOLONG need to work closely with their concessionaires to develop on-site sales packages that work for all three parties . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the products they want to sell and we then try to find marketing partners in those categories , " said Chris Hibbs , senior director of sales and marketing with the NFL Chicago Bears . <p> Most sponsors typically sign two contracts : A marketing deal with the team and a vending rights deal with the concessionaire . <p> It is important for properties to insist sponsors offer their products to concessionaires at competitive prices , a factor that has long been a bone of contention between vendors and sellers . <p> " We have to make sure product and costs are in line . We cant bring in a company where prices are through the roof , " said Joe Croce , Comcast Spectacors senior vice president of sales . <p> In addition to looking out for their concessionaires , properties also need to be aware of sponsor-related costs they may accrue themselves . For example , a soft drink bottler may require a property to purchase branded cups or other products . <p> " Some properties just want to sell a category and they do n't  pay attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premiere Partnership Marketing , an agency that represents the Municipal Theatre Assn. of St. Louis and other nonprofits . <p> " You need to know your cost of goods and other elements in the supply chain so that your sponsorship fees are dropping to your bottom line . " <p> Properties also must be sure not to prioritize a vendor willing to pay a sponsorship rights fee over a company with popular brands and products that fans and attendees want , or over a company that is better able to meet the propertys needs . <p> " We have 400 events a year and sometimes our partners have to deliver food every day , " Croce said of the Wachovia Center . " Our warehouse is n't that big , so service is huge ; we cant advertise a product and be out of it . " <h> Who Can Sell What ? <p> August 11 , 2008 : <p> When it comes to the category that typically represents the largest on-site sales opportunitybeveragesthe age-old conundrum of category exclusivity rears its head . <p> " It was much easier five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for event producer Norfolk Festevents . " Beer distributors sold beer , another distributor did water and juices , and the soft drink bottler did soft drinks . Our local beer distributor now has bottled water , energy drinks and flavored beverages . " <p> The big question : Should a property bundle sales rights for multiple products with one sponsor or try to divide and conquer based on the strength and popularity of individual brands ? <p> For its part , the Albuquerque Intl Balloon Fiesta examines product sales patterns to determine what direction to take . <p> " The biggest area of discussion is their broad reachPepsi , Coke and other beverage companies have so many categories covered , " James said . " We literary dissect their sales in those categories to see what would make sense to hold open to other sponsors . " <p> For example , the festival worked with Pepsi Bottling Group , Inc. to drop the sponsors exclusivity in the energy drink category " because their sales record did not indicate high demand , " James said . <p> Milwaukees Summerfest takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories under one deal , but if a property has the resources to monetize each category and manage each relationship , that 's something to consider as well , " said John Boyer , vice president of sales and marketing with owner Milwaukee World Festival . <p> Baroody recommends properties review their beverage suppliers product portfolio on a monthly or quarterly basis to stay abreast of new products and other changes in their beverage portfolio . <p> That process can lead to growing a partnership . Festevents this year signed a $2,500 deal with Pepsi Bottling Group for the right to sample Starbucks Corp.s Ethos bottled water at two of its events . <p> " We would n't have known about Ethos if we did n't  do the research , " Baroody said . " It was n't a lot of money , but it was a nice bump and something that we did n't  have to fight for . " <p> Other properties have looked to sales rights for products in nonsalable sponsorship categories that could be offered to their beverage partner . For example , Cherry Creek Arts Festival gives its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors at the event . <p> " Its an overlay to their sponsorship , Erley said .

Sponsorship research can help both properties and sponsors with their decision making . There are many applications for sponsorship research . It can be used to determine the fit between a property and a sponsor ; it can be used by a sponsor to measure an audience 's response to its sponsorship and activation programs ; it can be part of return on sponsorship or ROI exercise ; a property can use information garnered from research to demonstrate to its sponsors some of the benefits of the partnership ; and it can be used to track trends or changes related to the sponsorship . Some properties and sponsors have the luxury of hiring an outside research agency . However , a lot of properties and sponsors have never conducted any research , or the property or sponsor conducts its own research ( which is preferable to not conducting any research ) . <p> I would encourage sponsors and properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there should be a clear purpose to the research , and the findings should be actionable , otherwise the results will be disappointing . Although the findings wo n't be as specific , as a first step , a property or sponsor could consider using syndicated third-party research such as Scarborough or MediaMark ( MRI ) . <p> The properties and sponsors that do their own research are generally able to capture audience demographics pretty well , but then fail to gain any additional insights about their audience such as their audience 's loyalty to the property and its sponsors . <p> Anyone that has conducted any type of research that is not a researcher knows the difficulties faced . There are challenges and decisions throughout the process . The first challenge is identifying the opportunity or problem ; then you move to research design and method ; followed by selecting the sample and collecting the data ; and then finally analyzing and presenting the data . At each step there are decisions that need to be made that can affect the integrity of the research . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . Is it someone within the property , is it a sponsor , or is it both ? This will play a role in the development , execution and presentation of the survey data . <p> Other questions that may come up include : is the desired information qualitative or quantitative in nature ?

Nonprofit properties should first ensure that they have in-house staff , attorneys , accountants or other advisors who are well versed in both sponsorship and UBIT regulations . more ... <p> SPONSORSHIP BENEFITS : WHAT 'S SAFE AND WHAT 'S NOT <p> SPONSORSHIP BENEFITS : WHAT 'S SAFE AND WHAT 'S NOT <p> Its been more than four years since the Internal Revenue Service finalizedand nonprofits had to start complying withtax regulations regarding sponsorship income . So what have been the developments in the interim ? What do we know now that we did n't  know then ? <p> Not much , say tax advisors , attorneys and nonprofit executives that deal with the issues regularly . And that 's not necessarily a bad thing , some of those experts point out . <p> " The IRS has not yet had aggressive enforcement in this area , " said attorney Ben Tesdahl , of counsel to law firm Powers , Pyles , Sutter &amp; Verville and a specialist in tax-exempt-organization law . <p> In the nonprofit arena , the IRS has concentrated its recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international grant-making , along with hospital charity care , credit counseling organizations and private foundations . <p> The IRS also has not issued any further guidance or clarifications on the elements of the sponsorship regulations that are universally agreed to be limited and/or vague . <p> But just because the IRS has , for now , found bigger fish to fry and not made any official pronouncements regarding sponsorship , does not mean nonprofits should not stay on top of what they have to do to keep their sponsorship revenue tax free . <p> This is especially true given that IEG SR estimates corporate spending on sponsorship of causes is expected to rise 20.5 percent to $1.34 billion in 06 . <p> Sponsorship And UBIT : An Overview Of The IRS RegulationsAt the heart of the matter , the IRSs interest in sponsorship income is to determine whether or not payments for specific sponsorship benefits constitute revenue to the nonprofit that is allowed within its tax exempt status , or whether such revenue should be defined as unrelated business income , which is taxable . <p> The key to making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor as either insubstantial or substantial . <p> Insubstantial benefits qualify as allowable ways to recognize and express appreciation to the sponsor . Substantial benefits could be viewed as the provision of advertising or related services to the sponsor , which the IRS says meets the definition of unrelated business as " a regularly carried on trade or business not substantially related to furthering the exempt purpose of the organization . " <p> The IRS released its first proposed sponsorship guidelines in 1993 . Following nearly a decade of public and Congressional debate over what constituted " qualified sponsorship payments " revenue not subject to unrelated business income tax ( UBIT ) because it does not carry the expectation of " substantial return benefit " the IRS in April 2002 issued its final regulations . <p> The key development during that nine-year period was the passage by Congress of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 , which addressed the sponsorship issue by adding section 513(i) to the Internal Revenue Code . The new section effectively defined payments for most traditional sponsorship benefits as not subject to tax . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and section 513(i) . The final regs , for the most part , maintained the 97 legislations safe harbor for the most common types of sponsorship benefits and actually added an additional benefit to the insubstantial column : links from nonprofits Web sites to sponsors sites ( see table ) . <p> The 02 regulations also address the division between qualified payments and payments for substantial benefits within a sponsorship . When a sponsorship provides both insubstantial and substantial benefits , the IRS requires the nonprofit to determine the portion of the fee that is a qualified payment , as well as the fair market value of the substantial benefits . <p> The regulations state that the IRS will accept " reasonable and good faith " valuations , but they also make it clear that if the property does not establish a value for substantial benefits , " no portion of the payment constitutes a qualified sponsorship payment . " <p> It is important to note that even for those benefits that are defined as providing substantial return to sponsors , the regulations do not say that payments for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment is non-qualified only means that it can not be excluded from UBIT . Whether it should be included as unrelated business income is evaluated separately under the tax codes UBIT rules . <p> For example , granting a sponsor the right to use a nonprofits trademarks is defined under the sponsorship regulations as a substantial benefit . However , under the UBIT regulations , most payments for that benefit will not be taxable because they will qualify as an allowable royalty payment . <p> The Devil In The DetailsOn the one hand , it is relatively simple for nonprofits that want to avoid even the possibility of triggering UBIT to stay out of harms way by only offering sponsors the benefits the IRS defines as insubstantial . <p> However , many nonprofit properties want to offer some substantial benefits , and the IRS regulations can be daunting , confusing and burdensome when it comes time to calculate how much , if any , of a sponsorship payment is then at risk for UBIT . <p> In particular , the rules regarding the provision to sponsors of tangible benefits such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewings , as well as those dealing with category exclusive sales rights have caused the most consternation among nonprofits . <p> Tickets , pro-am spots , receptions , etc . IRS regulations treat such deliverables as insubstantial only if the total " fair market value " of those benefits is less than two percent of the total fee paid by the sponsor during an organizations taxable year . <p> If a property provides other types of substantial benefits , such as advertising or the right to use its marks , the IRS will look at whether the combined value of those benefits exceeds two percent , essentially lowering the ceiling on the acceptable amount of tickets or other inventory . <p> If the value exceeds two percent , the total value of the substantial benefits is potentially subject to UBIT , not merely the difference between the total amount and the two-percent level . <p> Category-exclusive sales rights . What the IRS terms an " exclusive provider arrangement " is defined as a substantial benefit to the sponsor and thus the portion of the sponsorship payment attributable to those rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exception " when the nature of the goods and services to be provided necessitates the use of only one provider because of limited space or because the competitive bidding process requires only the lowest bid be accepted . " <p> The real challenge for properties is that the regulations put the burden of establishing the dollar value of sales rights and other substantial benefits on the nonprofit . <p> In the case of tangible benefits with face values , such valuations are not difficult . The IRS even allows the use of equivalentsfor example the average cost of a restaurant dinner may be used to estimate the value of an evening reception . <p> But valuing benefits such as the value of a propertys trademarks or of its exclusive sales rights is another matter . The regulations themselves note that " the Treasury Department and the IRS appreciate the difficulty " in determining those values , but stop short of offering advice on how it should be done . <p> Marcus Owens , who served as director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division from 1990 to 2000 and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that the IRS has n't  expanded its guidance in the area of valuation since the regs were finalized and does n't  expect it to do so . <p> " My sense is that the IRS is assuming that most tax-exempt organizations will be unable to establish the value of the exclusive marketing right , thus triggering the default rule that the entire amount of the payment they receive for providing the exclusive right is taxable as unrelated business income , " he said . <p> Owens advice for determining the market value of benefits such as sales rights is to " base the calculation on as much objective data as possible . " For example , he said , in the case of soft drink sales , the property should attempt to get historic sales figures or other estimates from the sponsor . <p> Tesdahl again sees the lack of action by the IRS to be as much a blessing as a curse . " To some degree ( the lack of guidance on valuation ) is good because it allows for considerable bargaining room in the event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note : This article does not constitute legal advice and should not be regarded as a substitute for legal advice . <h> What You Should Do <p> Work with good counsel . Nonprofit properties should first ensure that they have in-house staff , attorneys , accountants or other advisors who are well versed in both sponsorship and UBIT regulations . <p> But they also should take a critical next step and sit down with those counselors and make sure they are comfortable with how the advisors interpret the regulations . <p> Consider the following example : A nonprofit wants to commit to a potential partner that it will " promote their products over the next year by encouraging our members to buy the sponsors products in our monthly member newsletter . " <p> Tesdahl says his response to that client would be " that if you actively promote the products of a sponsor , you are essentially conducting advertising and marketing services for them , which is an inherently commercial activity that will likely subject thesponsorship fee to ( UBIT ) . " <p> John Stiefel , a partner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has drafted numerous sponsorship contracts , takes a more liberal view . " The IRS regulations permit a broad range of promotion by the nonprofit , " he noted , advising that properties simply take care to avoid the rules specific prohibitions on qualitative language , explicit endorsements , etc . <p> Which interpretation is " right " or " wrong " is not the point . What matters is that the nonprofit client has a clear understanding of its advisors point of view and , in the best-case scenario , that the view matches the approach the property wants to take vis-+ -vis the benefits it wants to offer sponsors . <p> Pay close attention to contract language . Owens pointed out that " the starting point for an IRS analysis will be the contract , so careful wording will pay dividends . <p> " It is important to review draft sponsorship agreements for language that suggests a marketing message will be involved , and to avoid the provision of a marketing message if the goal is to avoid UBIT . " <p> Also , consistency within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This applies to the way a property values benefits , Owens noted , and to other ways it applies the regulations . <p> " We have someone in-house who reviews all of our agreements , " said Mary Kate Wilson , cause marketing director for the American Cancer Society . " Were consistent and tend to be relatively conservative in our interpretation of things . But being consistent in how you apply the regulations is a must . " <p> Owens also advises that nonprofits " keep representative copies of the sponsorship communications , as the IRS is going to want to review them as well . The documentation should be kept for six years to ensure that it is available if the IRS decides to conduct an audit . " <p> Conduct a cost-benefit analysis . Although sponsorship-related UBIT is typically discussed as if it were something to be avoided by any means necessary , there may be times when it is worth paying the tax . <p> Owens advises properties that " if a given sponsor is willing to pay more for a marketing message , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity is subject to tax .

It is n't based on product specs , logic , reason or really any other describable tangible benefits . Sure it has features and benefits that are enticing , but to me , " it just feels right . " I 've read a lot of reviews both positive and negative about the iPad and I could create my own review and support my opinion with thoughts like the iPad is super portable , responsive and has a nice display . I could add that I love the picture frame feature . I could also point out that a lot of the apps have n't caught up to the technology ( including the Facebook app ) , the eBook reader has a pretty limited selection of books and the iPad definitely has the potential to be a big money pit . Honestly , none of that matters anymore ( until I get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No , I have n't been brainwashed by Steve Jobs , but my husband and I have brought the iPad everywhere , showing it to friends and family , basically anyone that would listen , and even a few that werent that interested . We probably sound nerdier than the Apple consultants . <p> Anyway , on the marketing front , there is Chases corporate sponsorship of TheNew York Times app and Courtyard by Marriotts corporate sponsorship of the USA Today iPad app . Further , several other media companies such as ESPN , ABC , Conde Nast and CBS Radio have embraced the iPad offering paid and ad supported shows , music , news , behind-the-scenes clips , games , editorial content , etc . Some of the sponsors and advertisers include Buick , Coca-Cola , Fidelity and Toyota .

It will have full screen video and embedded interactive content . Apparently , iAds will be easily included in developer apps . Also , initially , Apple is touting that it will even help advertisers design and create ads . <p> A lot of people are still trying to figure out what this all means , marketers included . People have hailed the iPad as the catalyst for the reinvention of print and print advertising . Some have called it the downfall of all flash supported internet advertising and content , and others foresee the hostile take over of the internet by apps . The iAd network opens up a whole new advertising opportunity and OS 4 greatly enhances the usefulness of the iPhone . As I 've mentioned in previous blogs , the internet and now mobile devices such as the iPad have changed how we think of media . Televised content is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the printed page . Is mobile another medium ? Is it the evolution of traditional media or is it just an extension ? Since mobile has the potential to revitalize media , are there positive or negative repercussions for corporate sponsorship ? <p> Also consider that for the first time , more people would do without television than the internet . According to a recent survey conducted by Arbitron Inc. and Edison Media Research , 49 percent of those surveyed said they would give up television , and 48 percent said they would give up internet . The last time the survey was conducted in 2001 ( which is ages ago ) , 72 percent said they could do without the internet and 26 percent said they would give up TV . <p> There are many considerations and implications for marketers and sponsorship professionals . I see properties talking to their media partners to gage how/if their media partners will have iPad/iAd initiatives and how properties can be included . Also , similar to the iPhone , I imagine properties will create and enhance their own apps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are tons of possibilities for cobranded apps . There will be continued creation of content for a variety of channels including the expansion of YouTube for both properties and sponsors .

Officials from Dallas and Fort Worth , co-owners of DFW Airport , saw this as a threat and lobbied then U.S. House Majority Leader Jim Wright ( D-Ft . Worth ) to pass legislation restricting Southwests flights from Love Field to destinations solely within Texas borders . When that met resistance , the law was amended to also allow flights to four adjoining states " Oklahoma , Arkansas , Louisiana and New Mexico " and it was signed by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today but for the addition of Kansas and Missouri in later years . <p> The Wright Amendment is set to expire on October 14 , 2014 .

According to the July 15 , 2013 edition of IEG Sponsorship Report , Southwest uses sponsorship to tap into local passion points and educate customers about the Southwest travel experience " currently , the airlines strategy revolves around building awareness in former AirTran markets such as Charlotte ; Portland , Maine ; and Grand Rapids , Mich .

Furthermore , Southwest has identified Atlanta , Chicago , and Denver as key growth markets " three locations that would benefit from brand new non-stops to Dallas . <p> In the months leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a stretch to expect Southwest to shout from the mountaintops about its brand new ( and increased ) daily non-stops to and from Dallas .

We find many great examples in sports , but I have been keeping my eye on the fashion game , specifically designer Rebecca Minkoff , a leader in casual luxury handbags , accessories and apparel who has become one of the savviest marketers around . <p> In the last few years , she has used social media to break down barriers that traditionally separate a fashion designer from her customers , creating plenty of examples that brands in other categories could follow . <p> IEG has identified using social media to create consumer participation as one of the key ways to successfully activate partnerships . It became very clear during last months Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York that apparel and accessories brands are also trying to optimize participation . <p> From live-streaming and crowd-sourced coverage to debuting collections through social sites , Fashion Week is moving from an event for traditional media , buyers and celebrities to an event for consumers . Social media alone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing consumers to connect with fashion brands and participate in their creative process . By letting consumers participate , Minkoff and other designers are giving consumers a reason to care and share their experience , ultimately creating more buzz for their brands . <p> Minkoff engages her target consumer " the strong feminine woman " via social media to gain insight into what her consumers likes and dislikes are , and to ultimately create products they want . In an interview with Mashable , Minkoff said : " We believe in a different approach . We believe the consumer is part of Fashion Week , and that their inclusion is going to grow . The consumer has a voice and say in our brand , they should get special perks even if they ca n't attend the show . " <p> Specific examples of the designers usage of social media include : <p> In February 2012 , to celebrate Minkoffs first New York billboard , the brand announced a contest asking fans to take a photo of themselves in front of the billboard using hashtag #rmsoho . The first 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handbag . <p> At Fashion Week in New York this February , Minkoff put social media and the consumer front and center by creating a prominent Twitter backdrop for her runway show . Minkoff encouraged consumers to " join the conversation " by tweeting with the hashtag #RMFALL . Minkoff also released Vine videos on Twitter showing the behind-the-scenes action prior to her show . <p> During last months Fashion Week , Minkoff made the unique move of debuting her looks on Snapchat before they hit the catwalk . Although the previews were only 10 seconds long , Minkoff wanted to make the debut of her new line inclusive to all of her consumers , and Snapchat had the appropriate , organic , " just for you " feeling to it . <p> To create additional buzz and encourage consumer participation , Minkoff teamed up with Tumblr and Nordstrom in a crowd-sourcing initiative that invited Tumblr artists and photographers to submit a T-shirt design inspired by the brands favorite type of women : strong and feminine .

Unstaged transformed the typical runway experience through behind-the-scenes prep shots and insights shared on Instagram and Twitter leading up to the show . During the show , there was a live feed of photos and videos capturing the candid action in real time , as well as an exclusive backstage camera angle giving fans at home a sneak preview of each item before the models walked down the runway . Host Kelly Osbourne conducted exclusive interviews with Minkoff and Mon+e , giving fans at home unparalleled , instant access to the entire show .

Wireless service providers and handset manufacturers continue to leverage sponsorship to access content they can offer to subscribers . <p> For example , U.S. Cellular Corp . will activate its sponsorship of Milwaukees Summerfest with an on-site promotion offering free music downloads from bands that perform on the U.S. Cellular Connection Stage . The festival promotes the offeras well as free Summerfest wallpaperthrough a Diamond Vision screen and transmits the content using Bluetooth technology . <p> On the sports front , Alltel Corp . uses its tie to the NFL Carolina Panthers to access inside information on player trades , the draft and other team news .

The content is offered to both AT&amp;T customers and non-customers , she added . <p> When carving out content , Zebian suggests that properties keep an eye out for mobile content when producing material for a TV broadcast or Web site . Properties should also be prepared to quickly turn around the content in a mobile-ready format . " That 's critical so that the content does n't  become dated , " she said . <p> Properties also need to make sure they have secured all rights to the content before offering it to a sponsor . For example , music festivals need to gain approval from performers , their managers , record labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zebian said . <p> Interactivity . Wireless technology can be used to enhance the interaction with a propertys audience through text message communications , text-to-screen promotions and other applications . <p> For example , Cellular South , Inc. leverages its three-year-old tie to the Miss Mississippi Pageant with a promotion that allows fans to text votes for their favorite contestant in the July event . The top vote-getter receives a $5,000 scholarship , a free phone and one year of wireless service . <p> Where possible , properties should try to incorporate cosponsors into wireless promotions . For example , Vans Warped Tour fans that register for Mobile Warped are asked to opt-in to receive messages and offers from other tour sponsors . Those sponsors must tag their email blasts with the " powered by AT&amp;T " tag or some other mention to acknowledge the tours presenting sponsor , Baer said . <p> Properties Can Run Promotions Without A Wireless SponsorProperties interested in incorporating wireless technology for their own promotions or on behalf of other sponsors do not need a wireless partner . <p> Instead , they can create new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure from a technology vendor . <p> For example , the NBA Dallas Mavericks used technology from vendor Vibes Media to run an on-site promotion with Taco Bueno Restaurants , L.P. that offered fans a coupon for a free taco in exchange for sending a text message .

A sample of responses follows : <p> For Joel Heath , president of Untraditional Marketing and producer of Vail , Colo.s Teva Mountain Games , keeping partnerships fresh and productive requires working closely with sponsors to be in a position to respond to their needs . <p> " Investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal relationship , " Heath said . " You have to go into it with that same mentality .

" I want to be seen as an extension of their office . That 's a powerful way to make sure that our property continues to meet their needs . " <p> The largest accommodation Untraditional Marketing has made to keep the title deal relevant for brand owner Deckers Outdoor Corp . has been expanding the games programming to account for Tevas growing product portfolio . <p> While the event started out as a whitewater competition that was used to promote Tevas kayak booties and flip-flops , it now includes climbing , trail running , cycling and other eventsas well as concerts , photo exhibitions and other activitiesto support Tevas expanded line-up and its lifestyle positioning . <p> " We tweaked our property to be multi-sport and help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Heath said . <p> The event also now supports Tevas cause-related initiatives . For example , the games last year conducted a fundraiser for the Waterkeeper Alliance , one of Tevas key nonprofit partners , Heath said . <p> Some changes a property makes to keep a partnership relevant will not be audience-directed , but instead will be done to better align the sponsorship with new corporate goals or initiatives . For example , in negotiating the recently signed five-year renewal of Tevas deal , Heath agreed to forgo a set cash rights fee in favor of tying payments to the brands overall growth . <p> " I am a stakeholder in the company , and they are invested in my property . The exposure we generate will help fuel the growth of the company , and I feel responsible for that , " Heath said . <p> The contract has minimum and maximum guarantees to protect both parties , he added .

The fan paired with eventual champ Jimmie Johnson received the $1 million check at the same ceremony in which Johnson received the champions trophy at the season-ending race . <p> " Keeping a sponsorship fresh makes you relevant , " Kessel said . " There is an expectation from fans that we will roll out something new every year .
