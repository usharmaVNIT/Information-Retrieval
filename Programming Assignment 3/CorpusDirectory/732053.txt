I find it hard to criticise this game due to its outrageous number of positive attributes that include its addictiveness ( which is almost narcotic in nature ) , its potential for expansion , the mixing of tower defence strategy with true PokTmon battle style , its adherence to the original graphics and music , and general ability to create a sense that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quite miraculous in the first place that the game has converted me from a Tower Defence sceptic to an avid enthusiast of the genre , provided it is wrought with PokTmon and allusions to the original games for the first-generation Gameboy . Should the time ever arise that a third title is released , there are a number of features which I would put the icing on what is an already competently-baked cake . <h> Sam &amp; Dan Coins ( SnD ) <p> One of the ways in which Sam and Dan are able to continue developing the game and produce weekly updates is the innovation of Sam and Dan Coins , or SnD coins if you like to save a second or two in your pronouncing of already-short words and phrases . The idea is simple : SnD coins can only be purchased with actual , real-life money from the Sam and Dan website where you can enter your payment details and receive whichever amount of SnD coins you desire . <p> SnD coins transcend the regular in-game currency because they are the only coins with which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website that can be accessed from the in-game menu but is itself external to the game ) . With these coins , you are able to adopt PokTmon from the PokTcentre ; the list to choose from is extensive and is actually the entire collection of the original one hundred and fifty one PokTmon that were available in the first-generation PokTmon games . All the available PokTmon are also at a very high level ( level ninety to be exact ) and therefore gives whoever owns them a distinct advantage in story mode . In spite of these advantages , I feel that the idea has the potential to isolate a significant number of players who may not be willing to part with their non-fictional currency in order to give themselves an in-game advantage . <p> While the idea of SnD coins is a positive one from the perspective of Sam and Dan as well as dedicated followers of PokTmon and the PokTmon Tower Defence Games , the requirement of parting with your hard-earned cash may not be a prospect that is as intriguing to the more casual player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTmon team without having to actually pay money for what is usually a non-paying experience . As one of these people I am referring to , I felt a little isolated and at a distinct disadvantage compared to those who are happy to buy SnD coins to further their quest . Should a third game of PokTmon Tower Defence be created at some point in the future , I would find it a very welcome improvement if there was a way to adopt PokTmon without using money that I thought I would never have to spend on a flash game . <h> Possible in Game Methods of Earning SnD Coins Would Be Welcome <p> One way that the above problem could be alleviated is to include in-game ways of earning SnD coins ( or a usable in-game currency ) that will allow you to adopt PokTmon that you would otherwise be unable to obtain . I 'm not saying that PokTmon Tower Defence 3 does away with the current adoption system but it could certainly be made to feel less exclusive and restricted to those who are actually paying to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that is used in gaming , certain time-consuming or moderately challenging tasks could be issued to the player which they would have to complete in order to be rewarded with the ability to choose from a powerful that they can adopt . This way , a sense of exclusivity is maintained but the adoption system is not entirely closed off to the more casual PokTmon fan who thinks that having to pay for privileges in a flash-based internet game is a little outrageous . I enjoy owning a Charizard as much as the next person , but I would prefer not to pay real money for a fictional , pixellated version of him , and this is coming from someone who spent outrageous sums on PokTmon cards when they were popular . <h> Mystery Gifts With Even More Mysterious Riddles to Solve <p> Another example of such a double-edged sword idea in the game is that of the Mystery gift . In this section of the main menu , you are given the option of inputting a code which allows you to receive a weekly offering from Sam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTmon changes on a weekly basis along with the codes validity . To obtain the code , however , you are required to venture to the Sam and Dan website and solve a number of pseudo-riddles and answer various questions that are usually related to games of the tower defence genre on Sam and Dans website ; only then is the code of the week revealed to you . <p> While this is an extremely clever idea that both continues to entertain long-term players on a weekly basis whilst simultaneously encouraging players to start playing other games that are created by Sam and Dan , it tends to exclude all but extremely avid tower defence enthusiasts from enjoying the full benefits of the PokTmon Tower Defence 2 experience ; the level of tower-defence knowledge about other tower defence games that is required to solve the riddles and questions is dare I say a little greater than that of your average flash-game fanatic . On the other hand , the system is extremely popular and adds a completely unique dimension/degree of functionality and interactivity than any other flash game I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new PokTmon ( which incidentally could occasionally be shiny in nature ; this weeks gift is the first shiny PokTmon to be given away ) each week keeps the player engaged with the game and turns what is already an excellent tower defence game into a highly interactive experience which evolves more than the actual PokTmon contained within it . <p> I feel there could be a compromise out there in the ether somewhere ; a compromise involving less difficult questions or at least a system that does n't  involve some incredibly specific knowledge of games that many people may not be willing to take time to play . After all , my attempt at solving the clues became frustrating very quickly , leading to an angry googling of the problem and yielding results which told me the code anyhow . This is an easy solution which is tantamount to cheating , and one that would be unnecessary if obtaining the mystery gift code was a little easier for the unfamiliar gamer . An idea for the future threequel of the series , perhaps . <h> Too Higher Ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the features which I enjoyed less about the Story Mode is the relatively high ratio of multiple-enemy battles to on one battles with wild PokTmon . Instead , most battles involve multiple PokTmon that walk across the screen with the onus on you to move your PokTmon around into the appropriate position to attack the opponent that you wish to target . Even though most battles are fought in this way because of the tower defence format ( and to allow you a chance at catching more PokTmon while taking less time while also gaining the maximum amount of experience ) , battles do take place against single opponents , and I would like to see more of them ; partly because they remind me of the format of the original PokTmon games , but also because I find the constant stream of enemies quite annoying because fighting multiple enemies detracts from the battle feel of the game and the tactical aspect of PokTmon in the first place . I feel that the game contains ( and will contain ) enough battles with multiple enemies without the fights with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . After all , 1vs1 battles are what the game is really all about . <h> Battles that Reward More Experience Points Please <p> Not only would a sequel to the game benefit from more battles against single opponents that are tougher to beat , but it would be a refreshing if the battles yielded more of an abundance of experience points . Though I understand the requirement of the game to contain a certain number of multiple-enemy battles , I feel that a compromise could be reached where some areas have increased numbers of classic one on one battles which made PokTmon such an incredible game to play . <p> Leading on from increased experience points would be the ability of your PokTmon to evolve to higher levels in the game , possibly even leading to the maximum of level 99 which was seen in the original game of P=kemon . <p> One of the features that ( as far as I can see ) appears almost completely pointless and serves very little purpose ( at this stage of its development which it is currently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the main menu . In it , you take the form of Professor Oak ( the best and most badass researcher in the whole of the PokTmon universe ) and are able to walk around a map that consists of an outdoors area filled with trees and some patches of flat ground and dirt tracks . <h> Further Clarification on the Ability to Spawn Endless Pokemon <p> The only instructions available appear to be at the top of the screen , encouraging you to click on the map in order to spawn the PokTmon that is currently selected in the drop-down menu to the left of it . Though this did not cause any problems in itself , it is a shame that no further instructions or further information is available within the game to explain the purpose behind your ability to spawn an unlimited number of PokTmon on the map which are selected from the dropdown menu that I previously referred to . <p> If I was to take the title of the mode literally , then I would expect to be able to perform some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to me in some way , or at least benefits my progress in the game somehow . Sadly , it appears the only research that takes place is wandering around watching the PokTmon behave in the same manner as they do in the wild in Story Mode . <p> To describe the mode as fruitless would be to jump the gun a little , because I have no clue what Sam and Dan have in store for this mode , but as it stands it feels somewhat pointless and I cant really see where the idea can be taken at this stage . Should a PokTmon Tower Defence 3 be released , it certainly would n't harm the game to include a PokTresearcher option , but I would definitely like to see some more functionality such as being able to perform Professor Oaks research in a laboratory setting , including features such as testing the PokTmons moves , behaviour , weaknesses , and strengths ; perhaps you could earn items such as TMs and HMs ( items which allow a PokTmon to instantly learn a particular move ) depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a mode with the word research in the title , there does n't  appear to be very much actual research going on : it appears the scientific method has taken a leave of absence for the time being . <p> As a relatively recent addition to the game , I can acknowledge the fact that this mode may still be in its infancy and is going to be given some sort of overhaul or addition that will quash my doubts and offer the player a research-based function which allows you to pick apart the behaviour and attributes of different PokTmon . Even though it is indicated on the Sam and Dan blog that you are able to witness the interactions and behaviour of the PokTmon you choose to spawn , there appears to be very little going on when you do so . My point here is that an explanation of the mode would be beneficial , and the mode ( as it stands ) adds nothing worthwhile to the PokTmon Tower Defence 2 experience unless you happen to be extremely bored of the rest of the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for entertainment ; PokTresearcher will leave you extremely thirsty in that department . <p> One final quarrel with the game lies with the weekly update process itself . While I am most definitely not issuing a slamming critique of the updates themselves ( I am aware that a considerable amount of consistent and constant work goes into the updates ) , I often feel fairly frustrated that when opening the game , you are simply not looking at the finished article . Perhaps a point will arrive in the future when all possible updates have been applied and the game can be referred to as its final version , but until then , the levels will always be incomplete , bugs and inconsistencies will remain in the game , and above all , I simply do n't  wish my progress to be capped by the relative developmental progress of the game . The most recent update included a gym battle , for example , but this is as far as you are able to play ; the player is now left waiting for the next update in order to progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not offer much more progress in the way of progression through story mode . <p> Perhaps a sequel to the game could benefit from an update process that is more cumulative in nature ; instead of issuing frequent , incremental additions , perhaps development could go on for longer periods of time with updates being released fortnightly or perhaps even more infrequently . This way , the issuing of every update would be more impactful and would offer considerably more playability instead of simply a few additions here and there . <p> Due to the outrageous levels of enjoyment that I derived from the game , it almost pains me to offer the above criticisms and ideas for improvement . I feel that the next PokTmon Tower Defence title would greatly benefit from the above considerations and that ( at least in my point of view ) a more well-rounded experience that is more loyal to the original PokTmon games would be the result . Until such a time that PokTmon Tower Defence 3 is released , I will happily immerse myself in the sequel , because in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior PokTmon experience .

Discover new Pokemon and push your battling skills to the limit in what must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> The First PTD Reviewed <p> Pokemon Tower Defense is a flash-based tower defense game based on the extremely famous and popular Japanese anime series Pokemon . The game was released in March 2011 by Sam &amp; Dan Games and successfully incorporates the best parts of the original console-based Pokemon games from Nintendo into a tower defense format to create one of the most addictive games in the history of all mankind ( yes , that far back ) . This game only has the original 151 Pokemon though , which may prove slightly disappointing to the more recent Pokemon fans but will suit the purists ( in the context of the Pokemon world ) perfectly fine . Here are some of the key features of the game : <h> Gameplay <p> Let 's just come out and say it straightaway : This game is absolutely brilliant and a hell of alot of fun . You keep wondering all throughout how Nintendo with all of the millions of dollars that they probably spend on game design never managed to come up with a concept like this , so credit has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is also because while the idea of integrating a tower defense game with Pokemon is awesome , the integration itself in this case is very well executed . This will probably get mentioned a lot more in this review , but once you start playing this game you just ca n't stop . Even while writing this the game 's running in an adjoining window . <p> Poker Tower Defense starts off much the way the original Pokemon games do . You visit Professor Oak to collect your first ever Pokemon and are given a choice between Charmander ( fire type ) , Squirtle ( water type ) and Bulbasaur ( grass type ) . As soon as you select a Pokemon , Oak 's lab gets attacked by a group of hypnotized wild Rattatas ( which are rat-like Pokemon ) . The hypnosis is carried out by a villainous group called Team Rocket , who do this through the help of their own Pokemon . You defend against this wave of Pokemon attacks by placing your selected Pokemon in a square , selecting the kind of attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offending Pokemon . <p> The attacks , the upgrades , the Pokemon evolutions , they all work the same way as they did in the original games in Pokemon Tower Defense . Even the storyline followed by both the games is the same in terms of locations visited and challenges to be overcome . Having passed the initial challenge in the lab , you set out to find the actual offenders , accompanied by a very annoying boy called Joey who you rescued from the clutches of Team Rocket . Even the process of catching and collecting Pokemon is mostly the same . Instead of trawling through bushes in the hope of ( and eventually in dread of ) finding wild Pokemon , battling them , weakening them and then using a Pokeball to catch them , here you will be placed in routes with oncoming wild Pokemon that you must defend against in the old tower defense style ; by placing your current Pokemon in the aforementioned provided squares and telling them to attack . The more your Pokemon attack , the more EXP they gain , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they become stronger . After a certain amount of levels , depending on your Pokemon , they will evolve into a completely new Pokemon creature with new , stronger powers . <p> As for the storyline , you initially end up going to Brock 's gym in Pewter City , just like in the original games , and then you visit Misty , who is now married to Ash , the protagonist of the original cartoon series . Both Misty and Brock are villains in this game , so beware ! As you may well remember very clearly by now , spoilers are awesome , so you will eventually find out that a different Mewtwo is behind all this trouble . The first game has now been completed and can be played here , the second game is now in development and can be played up to level . <p> These are n't the only reasons to be excited about Poker Tower Defense however , it 's also the sheer range of options available to you that 's impressive for a free game . You have Training Machines or TMs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks or moves ( apparently that rule only applies to dogs ) , you have stones that you can buy to evolve your Pokemon as and when you want to and then there 's your Pokemon 's extreme willingness to learn new moves so you regularly get prompts telling you which Pokemon wants to learn what , what the move does , and asks whether you want to use it or not . <p> The strategy quotient is covered like the Earth is covered by its atmosphere , that is , completely , by Pokemon 's in-built strength and weakness charts . It works such that if you have a Grass Pokemon , your attacks will be highly effective against Water Pokemon but not against Fire Pokemon . Similarly , if you have a Fire Pokemon , your attacks will work best against Grass Pokemon but not so much against Water Pokemon . Considering that there are 8-9 types of Pokemon , all with various bonuses or disadvantages against other types of Pokemon , if the very fact that you 're playing a Pokemon game in a tower defense format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options available certainly will . <h> Graphics and Audio <p> PTD is almost completely based on the original Pokemon games . What this means is that the graphics are identical to the original games . Not similar , not close to , but identical . We have the same pixel-art graphics that we thought we 'd left behind in the last millennium . But they make a return in this game , and how . It just increases the " awesomeness quotient " of PTD way beyond the stratosphere . <p> The audio is also typical Pokemon music , and it just feels good . There is no handily available mute button if you do n't like it though , which could prove a nuisance . <h> Conclusion <p> If you 're a Pokemon fan , probably no tower defense game ever will come close to this . If you 're not a Pokemon fan I think you will still agree with all those Pokemon fans who say that no tower defense game will ever come close . The degree of complexity , challenge , range of options etc. available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible exception of Bloons Tower Defense 5 . But then BTD 5 is n't based on a worldwide phenomenon like this game is and , more importantly , it does n't have 150 different types of towers . <p> The hacked version of the game can be found here if you want to skip a lot of the game 's difficulty . <p> A sequel to the game - Pokemon Tower Defense 2 is in the middle of being created - you can play it as it is being gradually built upon . <p> If you want to play on your mobile device you can try the mobile versions of the two games . 
@@121146369 @10146369/ <h> Pokemon Tower Defense 2 Walkthrough/Wiki <h> Introduction , Small-talk and Polite Handshakes <p> There is not a day that goes by that does n't  involve me yearning for simpler , two dimensional times ; times when troubleshooting hardware issues simply involved alternately switching a console off and on again in rapid succession ; times before blu-ray , DVD or even the never-popular Minidisc ; these times that fill my head with a sense of longing and dreamy , rose-tinted nostalgia are of course a reference to older consoles , 8-bit graphics and truly immersive and challenging gameplay . Fast-forward a few years from the Super Nintendo and you happen upon the Gameboy , my favourite title for which was PokTmon ( Red , Blue and Yellow ; any titles that followed these were a waste of everyones time , money , effort and gaming ability ) . Well I 'll be damned if I 'm not going to tell the world how much I enjoyed happening upon PokTmon Tower Defence 2 : Generations by the dedicated developers known as Sam and Dan , the long-awaited and heavily anticipated sequel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combining all the sweet-tasting characteristics of tower defence , some hefty wedges of bittersweet strategy , a buttery biscuit base of a role-playing richness and all bound beautifully together with a creamy , PokTmon-flavoured filling , PokTmon Tower Defence 2 : Generations takes the original and adds a lot more variation , considerably more depth , a story mode which you can freely navigate and a 1vs1 mode to be altogether proud of , even if you are one of the many people out there that werent responsible for the games creation , which is almost everyone in the world besides Sam , Dan and any outside help they may have used in the games production . Do n't  worry : this means you can simply sit back and enjoy the fun as it was intended from a players perspective . <p> Since the games two main modes are pretty complicated affairs in their own right , I have taken it upon myself , with no justification or qualification , to attempt to compile a general guide which will take the reader through the game and at very least show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I intend to provide guidance through both story and 1vs1 modes , offering as much detail as is possible bearing in mind the complexity of the game and the extremely high number of variables which range from the types of PokTmon you catch in story mode and the PokTmon you choose to buy in 1vs1 mode to the simply endless number of combinations of PokTmon that are available to you , any one of which can result in either victory or defeat at any one time . While this guide can not possibly offer you a step-by-step encounter of every single possible route through the game with every possible combination of PokTmon , I hope for it to offer a satisfactory and successful route through the game , indicating the choices that I made in 1vs1 mode and the routes to take in story mode that will lead you to a successful completion of the most current version of the game . <p> 1vs1 mode is heavily reminiscent of the original PokTmon battle format that has been gently squeezed into the parameters of a tower defence game whereas story mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies in different locations and the ability to capture , train and fight with your own private army of up to six PokTmon at any one time . I am assuming that since you have come as far as to seek out a PokTmon-themed game in the first place , you are therefore aware of the general idea of the PokTmon basics such as levels , acquisition of moves and the " Got ta catch em all " sentiments of the PokTmon universe . <p> Story Mode immerses you in a free-roaming adventure in which you are able to wander freely and locate , collect , and train your PokTmon to fighting perfection ( left ) . Pure , unadulterated battling takes place in 1vs1 mode , where the only things required of you are tactics , forethought and the desire to mercilessly crush all opponents that stand before you ( right ) . <p> I will write this walkthrough while under the active assumption that you will not be confused about my occasional use of the technicalities of the PokTmon world , and that I can speak freely about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blank expression to surface on your otherwise understanding face . <p> Since Story Mode contains the largest amount of variables , it is the most difficult to compile a guide for . However , being the kind of man who ever enjoys a good challenge , and who finds mild satisfaction in getting lifes difficulties out of the way to make way for the relatively breezy easiness of the remaining tasks , I will begin with story mode . If the information contained within this guide is not up to the standard you expect , or the style of language in which it is written does n't  live up to your initial expectations , then I feel I must remind you that there is nothing I care about less than your standards or expectations , and that since this ( as far as I can see ) the only comprehensively- written guide for this game on the whole of the internet , then you are stuck with my standards and will be satisfied with my own expectations of myself . Let us begin .

@@121146371 @10146371/ <p> To protect the world from devastation , to unite all people within our nation ... I would like to make it clear that I have stopped my recitation of the Team Rocket introductory theme song at this point not because I am unfamiliar with the rest of it ( a fact which I am simultaneously proud and ashamed of ) , but because I would like to get down to the task of pushing Pokemon Tower Defense : Generations to the forefront of the entertainment section of your squishy , fun-hungry brain . I have happened upon this game recently and it is one of the very few games of the tower defence genre that I have played and actually gone on to enjoy . Aside from the fact that the games appearance and music is heavily based on the original PokTmon games for the Gameboy , it is unique in its blending of tower defence , role-playing and action-game characteristics . Possessing a definite storyline , the requirement of strategic thinking from the player and a refreshingly light-hearted approach to the genre , this game will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag . <p> Firstly , when a game has Pokemon in the title , I will never , ever be convinced of its value to me as entertainment or indeed its worthiness of using the great Pokemon name unless it actually contains at least one of the themes from the original game boy games . I 'm not talking about this post first generation rubbish like Pokemon Silver , Gold , Ruby or Sapphire , since it is a recognised and empirically proven fact that all the games after Pokemon Yellow were in fact terrible ( There are still only 151 Pokemon as far as I 'm concerned ) . It takes a creative individual to imagine the delight on my judgemental , eternally-disgruntled face when opening Sam and Dans Pokemon Tower Defense : Generations and hearing the crunchy , tin-like marching snare and memorable introductory melody that only the Nintendo GameBoy could produce , and could only be the wandering music from the original and best Pokemon games . <p> Now , before the word Pokemon loses all of its meaning , I 'd better furnish you with the basics of Pokemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly at its heart , Pokemon Tower Defence 2 : Generations attempts to give this genre a little twist by adding in features of an RPG such as the inclusion of a main character whom which you control and a definite ( if a little silly ) storyline to follow . Strategy is also a requirement of the game , with your selection of Pokemon and moves which they possess being the fundamental factors which decide whether you win or lose a particular battle . Items which are beneficial to your PokTmon such as health potions and power ups like Rare Candy ( a feature of the original Gameboy games which allow your PokTmon to level up ) are also available for you to purchase with coins which are won through winning battles . <p> The game is played by simply using your mouse to navigate through the menu screens and battle scenes , with the directional arrows being used to control Joey ( the main character and poor mans Ash Catchem ) in the intermediate sections where you are free ( to a limited extent ) to roam the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story or 1vs1 mode , is that once you encounter an enemy and the battle begins , you drag whichever PokTmon you have in your possession into the pre-designated battle zone . Adhering to the true essence of PokTmon battles , you are only allowed to have one equipped at any one time , but are allowed up to six of them in your arsenal which you can bring into play at your leisure , provided you drag your active PokTmon out of the battle arena first . Once the battle begins , the currently-active PokTmon will perform whichever attack it is set to use repeatedly until it is either victorious , defeated or told to use a different attack by the player . Depending on how many attacks the PokTmon currently has , you can instruct your PokTmon to perform different attacks by pressing the keys which correspond to them such as Z and X ( the actual keys vary depending on your moves but are kindly indicated on screen ) . <p> To play the game you must first register with an email address and password ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being required to do this , and I could n't sympathise any less with them . After all , the game is still free and it does n't  require actual registration , it is simply a tool for saving your progress so that you can return later . Due to the lengthy and engrossing nature of the game , you are going to need this save-your-game function , otherwise you are in for a very disappointing and severely frustrating experience akin to that of losing all your lives in the original Super Mario Bros game , back when saving was for wussies and for those who could afford a better console . <p> In its earlier versions , the only truly playable mode in the game was 1vs1 . In this mode you follow the daring adventures of Joey ( he is n't quite Ash Catchem , but hell do for a flash game ) and play your way through Professor Oaks PokTmatrix ; my enthusiasm at the inclusion of professor Oak in the game was unbridled and the humorous , self-referential dialogue that is exchanged between Joey and his acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-jokes , references to the original Pokemon games and even allusions to the ( in my opinion ) underrated TV show are indicative of the Sam and Dans good-natured sense of humour , making true Pokemon fans feel right at home while providing a means of access to the game for those who are n't  so familiar with the Pokemon universe . This means that regardless of prior knowledge or experience of the pocket-monster universe or even tower defence games in general , the player is able to pick up the game with incredible ease . <p> Of course , there are some aspects of the 1vs1 game ( and by extension , Story mode ) which require a little practice in order for the player to get to grips with them : such particulars include the attacking procedures once a battle starts and learning the different strengths and weaknesses of each Pokemon depending on its type and method of attack . With the game possessing such a rich selection of Pokemon , and each of these Pokemon in turn possessing their own types , levels and attacks , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . After involving myself in only a few battles , however , I found these variable very easy to get to grips with and they posed very little problem from that moment onwards . Play it for yourself and you will see what I mean . <p> I suggest you think of 1vs1 as a training ground in which you can feel free to thrash out a few battles to become accustomed to the unusual yet intriguing blend of the tower defence , RPG and strategy genres. 1vs1 mode is as close to the roaming battle format that is typical of the PokTmon games of yore . Instead of following a story and pitting you against multiple enemies at any one time in a given location as is the norm for tower defence titles , you encounter and battle your opponents on a one to one basis and in fair and true combat style . Much like an exotic cocktail purchased from an unfamiliar bar , the game can be quite overwhelming at first ; the individual flavours each competing for your attention and leaving you awash with confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and its particular variety of flavour , you find yourself beginning to enjoy it . Now I 'm not sure whether I 'm enjoying the game or whether I 'm just thirsty for a Manhattan . <p> Pretty much everything about 1vs1 mode is in some way an homage to the original Pokemon games ; everything from original 8-bit soundtrack to the areas in which Joey battles in the virtual world of the PokTmatrix including Oaks own house and Veridian forest ( where you can actually roam around in the grass to capture Pokemon as you do in the original game ) . I was particularly amused at the flashbacks which happen to Joey where the artwork becomes identical to the original Gameboy title and brings Ash Catchem back for a little cameo appearance . <p> I was distinctly impressed with the ever-evolving nature of the game : after all , it originally it only included the 1vs1 option with no story mode whatsoever , but due to the ongoing development efforts of Sam and Dan , the game is being updated ( or so were told ) as more additions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode allows much more depth to the game and brings it from the level of merely an excellent tower defence game to something that is truly worth investing your time in ( if you enjoy these sort of games that is ; those not accustomed to the genre or enthusiastic about its traits , get out now ) . Such is the extent of the ever-happening update process that there are some menu buttons which are not yet accessible and a constant reminder at the top of the screen overlays the action with the words Work in Progress . With the game constantly changing and being added to , the long-term player will most definitely appreciate the frequent additions and care being taken of their favourite title . <p> In contrast to the original game , you are given the ability to actually move around the levels in story mode , exploring the surroundings and interacting which objects , which is a nice distinction from the original where you were limited to the games format of selecting from a set of predetermined levels . You may now use your arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are involved in a true adventure , which is all that Ash Catchem ever would have wanted . Beginning with some eccentric interaction with Professor Oak , Story mode begins by selecting some user-specific details such as gender , name and which version of PokTmon you wish the game to take its variable aspects from . At this point the game almost lost me as a fan due to my allegiance to the original 151 PokTmon , but I soldiered on nonetheless because after all , the game so far had impressed me to a significant degree . <p> Story mode includes its own tutorial woven seamlessly into the gameplay in the form of Joey himself explaining the movement controls and giving you a chance to practice them by guiding him through his home , which is the place you begin your wonderful adventure . The Z button or Spacebar is used to interact with objects and characters around him . Upon exploring the local area and finding the lab in which three PokTballs reside , you are charged choosing your first PokTmon , selecting from Chikorita , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original PokTmon and being ignorant of anything beyond those titles , I have no idea who these PokTmon are but for the sake of the game , you must choose your first companion and stick with it . From this point onwards , you must train , battle and develop your PokTmon into maturity . <p> Story mode is filled with challenges that are simply variations on the strictly battle-oriented gameplay of 1vs1 mode . Such challenges include situations where you are able to place PokTmon in multiple battle positions in order to face multiple opponents . Your first challenge , for example , is protecting the professors PokTmon from the shadow PokTmon , who are attempting to steal them . This mode is where the tower defence aspect of the game really shines through , since you have the ability to make positional choices , placing your PokTmon at the optimum position to defend against waves of attacks . Story mode continues in this manner with challenges of increasing difficulty , which you must overcome by catching , training and battling with new PokTmon that you encounter along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entirely up to you which PokTmon you decide to use and in what order . As you continue to play the game , you will become accustomed to the different requirements of each battle , learning that some PokTmon types are more effective against others , and even down to the details of which move will be more effective against the enemy you are currently facing . You have the option of changing the characteristics of the attack which is currently in use including the speed and intensity of the attack . <p> Story mode gives you the ability to save your progress , which is a characteristic that most RPG games possess , and is one that is pretty much essential in this game due to the level of investment involved in developing your PokTmon and their abilities . The storyline unfolds as you travel , battle and converse wittily through the different areas within the game , starting with New Bark Town , moving on to Route 29 , Cherrygrove City and travelling through Routes 30 , 31 and 46 . All of these areas are similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gameboy ; this familiarity is a pleasant feature of the game which gives a sense of continuity and sense that it is a home away from home for fans of the PokTmon World . The adherence to the original games is nothing short of admirable . <p> As a battle begins and your PokTmon collection grows , you must choose which PokTmon to first send out into battle ; in the first few fights of story mode , you are limited to the few PokTmon in your possession ( beginning with only one ) , but as story mode progresses and your collection becomes more varied and abundant , your particular strategic choices begin to have an ever-increasing effect on the outcome of the battles . In particular , it is sensible to pay attention to the levels of your PokTmon , with your starting creature being at a mere level five . Perhaps your worries will diminish when you realise that the enemies you fight at this stage are usually this level or lower , making your battles at very least evenly matched , if not advantageous in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasting in the favour of the enemy , it pays to vary your attacks , using the starting moves of your PokTmon which are often intended to increase you defence and reduce the effectiveness of the enemies attacks and ability to defend themselves . <p> Positioning of the PokTmon is also a crucial factor in determining the battles outcome . For example , the first real battle involves defending Oaks remaining two PokTmon against attackers which enter from below ; when dragging your PokTmon from the bottom of the screen and into the battle zone , you are given the choice of multiple zones in which to place your PokTmon . Choosing the point with maximum coverage of the entrance allows maximum attacking potential for the highest number of potential opponents : such is the nature of this PokTmon-infused tower defence game . Cunning use of the items available for purchase also gives you an advantage in battle , allowing you to do things such as heal your PokTmon with potions or increase the level of your PokTmon with rare candy . <p> The main attraction of the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the acquisition and development of your particular PokTmon from untamed , untrained and frankly pathetic examples of fantasy-based wildlife into your own personal army of high-level minions of your heroic crusades . The challenge of creating something from almost nothing provides a sense of longevity for the game , being akin to what Sam and Dan themselves refer to as creating replayability . This description is entirely accurate , since the game is incredibly challenging and requires a significant amount of effort and long-term dedication in order to come close to completing it . Clear your schedule , its about to be filled with hours upon hours of PokTmon Tower Defence 2. 
@@121146372 @10146372/ <h> Pokemon Types <h> Shiny Pokemon and Shadow Pokemon Types <p> Almost all of the Pokemon you can have in the game have Shiny and Shadow types and as you may imagine , they are significantly rarer than the regular Pokemon that appear in the game . <p> These special Pokemon are easy to identify thanks to the small sparkles that appear on their images . Also , in the trading lists , Shiny Pokemon have light-blue boxes and there is a star on their names . Shadow Pokemon have darker images and in the trading lists , they have purple boxes . <p> Shiny Pokemon are special since they earn experience points at a very fast rate , this means that they gain levels faster and are able to improve stats ahead of other Pokemon . But aside from that , the Shiny Pokemon get an important status for players simply because of their rarity . In combat , they are completely the same . Hence , a level 50 shiny Mew and a level 50 regular Mew will have the same stats . <p> To get these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of options to take . The most basic one is automatic : wait for the shiny Pokemon to spawn . The odds are actually pretty low , way below .01 percent ( according to some sources , 1 in 8000 ) . This extremely low chance does happen and players are alerted with a message that will pause the game until you click the confirmation button . Also , once the shiny critter comes out , the game is set to x1 speed ( in case you had the pace sped up ) for players to have a chance of actually catching the special Pokemon . A last point worth raising : shiny Pokemon will always have a red life bar even if they are full . This means you can catch them the moment they appear on screen . <p> Aside from that , you can also purchase shiny Pokemon from the trading site . Some are available from the game corner in exchange for casino coins while others can be bought with real cash via SnD coins . Of course , you can also choose to try your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal for it . <p> Shadow Pokemon , like the shiny ones , are also rare and are considered as special collectibles by players . They do not get a bonus to experience points gain , instead , they can learn unique shadow moves . Obtaining Shadow Pokemon can only be done through three means ( currently ) , the first is to spend 300,000 casino coins to obtain one of the 70 available shadow types , the second is to use the mystery gift code ( which unlocks one of two shadow Pokemon ) , and lastly , through trading .

I highly recommend purchasing at least one Pikachu for use in the next battle , since its attacks are strong , and you go up against a Pidgey in the next battle ; Pikachus super-effectiveness against flying PokTmon becomes apparent here . If you have any money remaining , you should buy some potions too since the battles are becoming more difficult with every level you reach . At this stage , you can also purchase Antidote ( to cure poison ) , Rare Candy 2/3 ( increasing your PokTmons level by one with each use ; each Rare Candy can only be purchased and use once , so you may wish to put in some thought as to which PokTmon would benefit the most from its powers , ahem Caterpie ) and Parlyz Heal ( curing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once stocked up , line up your PokTmon and continue to the next battle . I find a mix of ground , flying and electric does the trick at level four due to the variety of PokTmon you will be facing . Your team at this stage should consist of at least two Rattatas , a Pikachu and a Metapod , with the optional Pidgey/Spearow , depending which tactics you have decided to employ . All these PokTmon should be at level 5 but every one of them will be encompassing the spirit and vigour of level 10 PokTmon ( aside from Metapod , who is level 7 at this stage ) . <p> Whilst wandering alone in the woods , you happen upon a girl who is doing exactly the same thing ; a chance encounter like this in PokTmon world can only mean one thing , and it requires PokTmon to facilitate it . That 's right , you are up against a strange girl and you may just win a kiss if you beat her ( apparently ) . <p> Her first PokTmon is a level 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent out Metapod immediately , using the opportunity to feed him a Rare Candy in order to push him into the exclusive club that only accepts PokTmon at level 8 . If you do not wish to use Metapod , or do not own him at this stage , then Pidgey or Spearow can just as easily win this battle . Spearow can use the Leer move to lower Rattatas defences and Peck to deal the actual damage . Without too much of a fuss , Rattata should fall . <p> Pidgey is the next PokTmon you face , and it is also a level 6 . This is where Pikachu comes in handy because of his effectiveness against the flying kind : retract Metapod ( or whichever PokTmon you are using ) from the battle and without a second though send out Pikachu . Without the need for any other attacks ( though I did use Tail Whip for a little defence-lowering ) , Pikachus Thundershock makes extremely light work of Pidgey in spite of my particular brand of Pikachu being one level lower . <p> The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : at this stage you should recall your Pikachu because PokTmon of the same types ( and particularly PokTmon who are exactly the same ) are very ineffective against one another unless there is a dramatic difference in level . Due to having three Rattatas , I sent one of them out since in these quantities they are expendable ( all is fair in love and PokTmon ) . Quickly using Tail Whip followed by repeated Quick Attacks will result in a fairly quick victory over Pikachu , and if your Rattata should fall , you always others waiting in your back pocket ( check your coat pocket if you cant find them ) . <p> Spearow is up next and I 'll be honest , I kept Rattata out and kept pummelling away with Quick Attack ; remarkably , this seemed to do the trick and Spearows health dwindled fantastically . Of course , you can always bring Pikachu back into play if you want to be a true PokTmon tactician , using the super-effective Thundershock to put an end to Spearows flight : this is entirely up to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Spearows antics and prepare for her next PokTmon . <p> Up next is a Nidoran at level 7 , which I wore down significantly with my flying PokTmon , requiring the sacrifice of both of them in order to prevail . After the death of my Pidgey and Spearow , I used Rattata to finish the job . <p> The final PokTmon is another Nidoran at level 7 yet again . My entire hopes were funnelled into Rattata , whose combination of tail whip and quick attack proves to be effective most of the time : this occasion was no exception . I do not recommend using Pikachu against Nidoran because if the relative ineffectiveness of electric moves against the Poison PokTmon . Again , the use of tail whip and quick attack should be sufficient to get you through ; if it is n't , you can extend your PokTmons life with a potion and victory should be yours through sheer longevity of your Rattata ( or other chosen PokTmon ) . <p> Again , this is a round that can be won by a mixture of tactics ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength in numbers ) . After this round it may be time think about levelling up your PokTmon with rare candy and always carrying at least one Potion with you into battle . This will ensure that you have the advantage going into the next battle because the levels of the PokTmon you face seem to be increasing with each level you complete . <h> Level 5 <p> As a result of facing your toughest battle yet , you are rewarded with the mighty Diglett , who would be a welcome addition to your collection at the rock-bottom price of ten PokTpounds . Rare Candy 4 is also now available to you and is even cheaper than a PokTon at five units of PokTmon currency Your next challenge is nothing less than an extremely tough Gym Battle , and you are going to need all the support you can get : I suggest you stock up on items such as Rare Candy and Potion and strengthen your team with Diglett since the next battle can not be won through sheer force of numbers alone . <p> Right , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are now in for a battle at Pewter City gym , and the true PokTmon fans among you will recognise that gym battles are always extremely difficult and often encompass a variety of PokTmon types . This selection of PokTmon is usually designed to test the skills and awareness of PokTmon types and the different moves which they possess . As you begin and some light fighting talk is exchanged between you and Luigi ( the gym owner/trainer ) , he attempts to intimidate you by going on about his Digletts Arena Trap ability , which if used , will disallow you from switching your PokTmon or calling them back while Diglett is still in battle . I assure you that he will use this ability , if only to make your life ( or at least the following two minutes of the battle ) that little bit more difficult , so I strongly recommend that you make sure your first PokTmon selection is adequate enough to make a significant dent in Digletts health . <p> Figure 7 : Diglett Win <p> Figure 8 : Luigi <p> With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle . At this stage , your PokTmon collection could consist of a Metapod , two Digletts , two Rattatas and a Pidgey , all at a humble level 5 aside from Metapod who is a level 8 . Again , it is possible to vary your PokTmon team and stand just as much of a chance at winning , but since this is my guide I intend to give you an account of my PokTmon selection at this stage . If you funds are sufficient , I recommend that you purchase some Potions which are almost essential for the battle ( I managed to win without them but it was by a margin far finer than my nervous temperament could handle ) . A rare candy here and there cant hurt either ; use this to level up whichever PokTmon you feel deserves it , but it pays to spend time concentrating on building up a single PokTmon , using most of the limited Rare Candy available on it and watching it grow accordingly . <p> Luigi only has two PokTmon , Diglett and Sandshrew but these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough opponents , and with most of my PokTmon at level 5 , you can see why my battle with him was such a struggle . When he releases Diglett , it uses the Arena Trap move , though this should make little actual difference to your battle . I began with Metapod and instantly used Rare Candy for a lovely bit of levelling up . You could also start with one of your Rattatas , alternating between tail whip and quick attack ; Digletts health proves difficult to reduce I think we are all ok with Rattata being sacrificed for the cause . If you used Metapod , rotate through all his attacks , ensuring Harden is your staple move between your attacks . <p> I managed to defeat Diglett using only Metapod in the end , but you can just as easily use one of your other PokTmon in order to whittle his health away further and finish him off . Pidgey can also be very effective here ( flying PokTmon are traditionally quite effective against ground types ) . <p> At a mighty level 11 , Luigis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy and well-defended . This PokTmons health seems to take forever to weaken , but victory is still possible ! I brought my second Diglett back into play , cycling between all of his attacks ; due to their similar types , the attacks are less than effective and Diglett was defeated fairly quickly . I cycled through my remaining PokTmon and all their attacks to chip away at Sandshrew , but it was Rattatas classic combination of tail whip and quick attack which proved most effective . With nearly all my PokTmon defeated and Rattata hanging on by the diameter of a rats tail , Sandshrew fell and the battle was over . Are n't  you glad you purchased the Potions now ? <h> Level 6 <p> Geodude is your reward for beating Luigi , but do n't  get carried away by snapping him up just yet . Just when you are convinced that you have reached the owner of the gym and therefore the safe haven of a checkpoint , you ( or at least I ) come to the realisation that this is not the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also signifies the culmination of all of your previous efforts of levelling up Caterpie into Metapod . <p> This next trainer has two Geodudes and will prove difficult , if not impossible to beat if you have not taken heed of my advice and ploughed all of your efforts into developing Caterpie into a PokTmon that is actually useful to you . All your effort is about to pay off ; if you did n't  manage to follow my advice , then I suggest a hefty amount of Potions and a significant quantity of praying . Buy Rare Candy 5 and however many Potions you can afford and proceed into battle . <p> As the battle begins , send forth Metapod into the fray and immediately use Rare Candy 5 . After some more dramatic proceedings , his evolution will take place and you will now be in possession of an extremely useful Butterfree .

I found that even cycling between these two moves only can lead to victory . <p> Use Potion if necessary , and if you should be unfortunate enough to get to the stage where Butterfree faints , then simply sent out Rattata and cycle through his attacks . Even though it takes a while , you will be able to do more damage than any other PokTmon could in this situation ; all other PokTmon prove themselves to be extremely ineffective against Geodude . If all went well , then you should emerge victorious ; if not , then I suggest you try again and perhaps invest more heavily in Potions and the ability to follow some simple yet effective advice . You should now understand why I recommended such heavy investment into Caterpie , since he just carried you through level 6 .

Regardless of this , it is still possible to win the battle because his PokTmon are at lower levels than yours . Silvers first is at level 5 ; I suggest you use all of your moves in this battle , relying on your primary attack ( which in Cyndaquils case is tackle ) to deal the damage . I found that I could not win the battle without using Leer , which reduces the opponents defence enough for you to deal enough damage to win .

I 'm sure Apple will be most upset about this name , however . You are also provided with an infinite supply of a PokTball-equivalent item , having the power of a PokTball but with none of the quantity restrictions . All this is excellent news , but before you are overwhelmed by the generosity , you should exit the laboratory and continue your quest . You emerge to a scene where some heated words are being exchanged between Silver and the gentleman which is blocking the entrance to Route 29 , who previously would have told you that he likes you but can not let you pass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some time , acting as a distraction and allowing you to pass the two unnoticed as they verbally bash each other for your indirect benefit . <h> Route 29 <p> I feel that the receiving of your PokTpad and PokTball gifts were not coincidental ; seeing as you can now roam about freely in the wilderness where you can clearly see PokTmon scurrying about , and since you now conveniently possess the means to catch them and index them neatly , it feels like a higher power is telling you to expand your PokTmon collection . I am also telling you to do so because A ) It is the purpose and premise if this entire game and indeed the principle of the PokTmon universe and B ) You barely scraped by your first friendly battle with your single starting PokTmon , so it benefits your ability to triumph over your opponents if you have more PokTmon . You should also feel free to battle wild PokTmon in order to gain experience points and as a result , allow your PokTmon the chance to level up . <h> Tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guide , I can not possibly hope to coach you through all eventualities of the game depending on which PokTmon you initially choose and which ones you decide to capture and train for yourself . I can however , tell you a little bit about the procedure of battling/capturing wild PokTmon . You should currently be in an area which contains some wild PokTmon roaming about in the middle of the grass and foliage . If you wish to battle these PokTmon , simply walk up to them and the scuffle will ensue . More often than not , the battle will consist of a steady stream of the PokTmon which you chose to battle moving from left to right across the screen . You simply have to place your PokTmon in any one of the available positions in order to attack the passing creatures until their health bar diminishes enough to turn red . Once their health indicator has turned red , you are able to capture this PokTmon by delving into your backpack ( click on the backpack icon in the right-hand corner of the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weakened PokTmon ; the icon should change from closed to open , in which case the creature should be captured . <p> If you wish to vary the kinds of PokTmon you catch , then I suggest waiting until different times of day in the games relative system of time quantification , since different creatures are available for capture at different times of day . Some creatures are only seen in the daytime , whereas others can only be spotted at night or early in the morning . <p> Giving you a distinct advantage is the ability to change the position of your PokTmon during the wild battles , and also the ability to use multiple creatures to grind down the health of whichever PokTmon you wish to capture . Occasionally , you will happen upon a one on one battle with a PokTmon , making the situation much simpler and allowing you to focus your attacks on one opponent and control the amount of health which you take from it . Ensure that you use your PokTball before the opponent PokTmon is defeated entirely , or your efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice in mind , it is up to you to capture and train your PokTmon to the best of your ability <h> Train Em All , or At Least Those You Have <p> Before you continue , it is advisable that you proceed to enter your PokTmon into various wild battles for the primary purpose of gaining experience points in order to increase their levels , but also to capture more creatures and increase the size of your PokTmon posse as well . You can catch PokTmon such as Pidgey , Rattata and Sentret as they wander about gleefully in broad daylight , with the more exotic Pokemon appearing at different times of the day and night . <p> When building a formidable PokTmon collection , the capturing of wild PokTmon is a good start . Encourage the creatures into the confines of your Pokeball , and do n't  worry ; the RSPCA does n't  tend to operate in fictional tower defence games . <p> After you have increased the size of your PokTmon collection and have managed to level them up sufficiently ( levelling up to ten or above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good stead for your future battles ) , then talk to the girl that appears to be furiously pacing up and down to the right of the clearing of trees . Her name is Zai and she proves to extremely useful during various battles in the game . Upon talking to her you learn that she is simply attempting to defend her Oran berries against attacks from wild PokTmon ; her dramatically speedy pace seems like an overreaction to the situations , but since this is primarily a tower defence game , it seems pretty obvious what you have to do . The battle begins and you realise why the girl was pacing around so frantically in the first place . <h> Big Trouble over Little Berries <p> The defence of the Zais Oran berries is actually quite difficult and is a step up in complexity from the previous battles . The offending PokTmon enter from below from the left and the right , meaning that it is beneficial for you to have a minimum of three high-level ( roughly level 9 or above ) PokTmon at hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite side . If your levels are high enough , you should have little problem defending against the waves of attacks ; even though they are PokTmon of relatively low levels , the sheer quantity of them means that you will be unlikely to win if your PokTmon are not strong enough or are still at a level that is too low to face up to the music . <p> Should you find yourself slipping into a little bit of PokTmon-related peril in the battle then try not to panic too violently ; there is no penalty for losing , and you can simply enter the battle repeatedly until you get the results that are satisfactory to you . However , if you are the kind of person who equates the accepting of bitter defeat to the experience of watching an episode of Take Me Out without blinking or repeatedly stabbing your eardrums and eyeballs with the nearest object suitable for the job , then you always have the option of healing your PokTmon . The girl for whom you are entering into this battle in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTmon ; if you see any of them struggling in the health department , simply drag it over to one of the three squares underneath her and drop it there and she will ( by the power of PokTmon medicinal knowledge or possibly supernatural ability ) heal your PokTmon back to full health . Just be sure to take your PokTmon out of the line of fire before it faints , since fainted PokTmon are no longer in play and can not be moved or used until the next battle . <p> The healing powers of Zai are second to none ; the girl exhibits the supernatural ability to nurse your PokTmon back to health ( forgive the darkness but blame the day-night cycle of the game in addition to my distinct lack of desire to wait for daybreak ) . <p> It may annoy you to realise that there is no final reward for defending the Oran berries , but you should be grateful for the experience points gained in the carnage . It is also possible to capture a Shadow Pidgey during the battle ( he appears at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , deep in the code and hidden in the mathematical probabilities/variables of the games design ; keep your eye out for it and go about capturing it in the usual fashion ; simply wear its health down until it turns red and capture it with your PokTball . It is a difficult battle because there are so many distractions but if you fight it correctly you will end up with a shiny new Shadow Pidgey to show for it . <h> Entrance to Mountain Road ( Sort of ) <p> If you explore to the north of this area , you should stumble upon a relatively wide building with a roomy entrance ; going through the entrance leads you to the relatively hidden-away area simply known at this stage as the entrance to the entrance of Mountain Road . You can not progress further north from here ; this area is simply a clear opportunity for you to catch a few new wild PokTmon for you to furnish your collection with , enhancing your battling capabilities , and well , making you look like more of an experience PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just a few of the different kinds of PokTmon available in the area that precedes Mountain Road . The Phanphy with his back rudely turned to me was a welcome surprise ; he was promptly ushered in a forcible fashion to the confines of a PokTball shortly after this shot was taken . <p> You will find PokTmon such of the likes of Phanphy , Spearow , Geodude ( these are becoming ten a penny at this stage ) , Rattata , and occasionally a Jigglypuff . I could go on all day about the benefits of catching these PokTmon and expanding your collection , but this is all pretty much common PokTmon sense and is a tactic that should always be in the back of your mind when encountering new wild PokTmon . It always helps to have a diverse range of creatures to pull out of the bag in any battle , and this holds particularly true in boss/trainer battles .

Feel free to wander around and bring some variety to your PokTmon collection , which can be a little lacking in variation if you stick to the PokTmon that are seen only in the daytime . <p> Head to the extreme left of the level until you find another hat-wearing gentleman blocking your way yet again ; upon approaching and talking to him , three excitable characters sidle in from the right and come to inform you that there has been a sighting of the legendary birds in Cherrygrove and that they wish for you to accompany them in their mission to catch one .

This mode enters you into a series of one on one battles that contain an increasing number of challengers , each with increasing numbers of PokTmon of escalating variation . As if that wasnt difficult enough , these increasing numbers of PokTmon are at increasingly harder levels to beat , so the challenge becomes more difficult with each battle you undertake . Each collection of fights are split into levels for the purpose of this guide in order for you to more easily track your progress and quantify your journey through the wonderful world of the PokTmatrix , which is apparently entirely virtual and does n't  correspond in any way with the real ( Story Mode ) world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't said to take place in the real world , it does n't  mean that it is any less challenging , as you will soon find out . <p> I am composing this section of the guide under the assumption that you are starting at the one and only true beginning , by clicking on New Game and starting with being able to scrape together just enough money to purchase your first PokTmon . Due to the sad fact that your finances are lacking ( to the tune of ten coins ) , you are severely limited in the PokTmon that you can buy ; you are also limited by the fact that you are still in the early stages of the game and you have n't yet had the chance to unlock the more formidable creatures to add to your arsenal , and even if they were available , you simply could n't afford them on your amateur PokTmon trainers salary . <p> Though there are many ways you could go about making progress and eventually completing 1vs1 mode , I will largely be covering the way that I and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , you are able to choose to buy whichever PokTmon are available to you with whatever money you may have .

With its variations being exponential in nature , and the word counts of my articles and reviews being absolutely finite in nature , I am offering you an account of my own actions , and not that of each and every path that is possible for the player to choose in the game . <p> You begin the game under the guidance of Professor Oak , a familiar and welcome face in the world of Pokemon . He gives you a detailed beginners tutorial about the ins of the game , and is kind enough to show you the outs as well .

These PokTmon are neither glamorous nor formidable , but at this early stage , you must swallow your pride since you simply can not be a chooser . I went for Caterpie based purely on his width : he has very slightly wider dimensions than Weedle and in my opinion has the thickness of a champion . This is not the only criterion I used to determine his worthiness to be my first PokTmon , however ; since PokTmon is often all about the long game , my suggestion to purchase Caterpie is based on my prior knowledge of what PokTmon you will be facing later , and having a Caterpie in your collection will benefit you in the long run , since he evolves into Beedrill , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTmon later in the game .

Or so the oh-so-famous slogan goes with Pokemon , and that is the true goal of every die hard Pokemon fan who has ever heard of Ash and Pikachu ( or for those of you Japanese purists , Satoshi and Pikachu ) . For the most part , the official Nintendo games have been released for the Gameboy , Gameboy Advanced , Nintendo DS , Gamecube and other Nintendo platforms as exclusive first party software . Recently though , many Pokemon fans have found a new game to conquer - Pokemon Tower Defense . This little fan-made game has not only stayed true to the form and style of its Gameboy origins , but has also innovated the tower defense concept to fit the rock-paper-scissors monster versus monster concept of the original Japanese smash hit . <h> A Little Info About Everything Pi 's , Ka 's and Chu 's ! <p> For those of you not familiar with the series , Pokemon is shorthand for the words Pocket Monsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed it ) is created by the folks at Nintendo . Basically , it is a JRPG where the lead character makes use of monsters to do combat with other monsters . <p> The idea of the game is that you can capture Pokemon and keep them as " fighting pets " , basically , you make them stronger , train them and have them compete in sanctioned tournaments . The Pokemon storyline revolves around a young kid who becomes a Pokemon trainer and aspires to get all the Pokemon in the world . And for those of you wondering about animal cruelty , the series has found its way around that issue by stating combat is never fatal , though it is pretty obvious that the creatures dish out and take a lot of pain . <p> All the Pokemon are depicted as cute adorable creatures , even the big dinosaur looking ones are designed with sparkly eyes . Also , Pokemon can only make sounds that are composed of the syllables of their names . Hence , a Jigglypuff can only say the syllables ji , gli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the species , Pokemon are able to understand each other and of course , will follow any human command . Okay , now that we have gotten that out of the way , on to the game itself ! <p> First off , fans of the series will be quite happy to see some of Cerulean 's most famous citizens appearing in this game in their original Gameboy looks . There are plenty of scenes where key people act totally out of character , but you will be laughing at the events so much that it will not matter at all . In case you are wondering , the story is set in a fictional timeline many years after the events of the first game for the Gameboy . <h> How it Plays <p> Pokemon Tower Defense brings together two elements : first , from the tower defense genre , the concept of creating defenses against attacking waves of enemies ( later in the game , this takes an even more interesting innovation ) . And from the original Pokemon titles , this TD game brings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them more powerful - and even further than that , you can " evolve " a monster into a higher breed of its type ( a caterpillar type monster would turn into something akin to a butterfly - to be specific , Caterpies turn into Butterfrees - though they do go through a middle phase known as a Metapod ) . <p> The tower defense part of the game plays like this , you have a maximum of 6 Pokemon to bring into battle , during which , you must assign any number of the six into designated defensive positions in the field ( sometimes , there are more than six slots to choose from , some maps will limit the number you can deploy at any given time ) . Once they are in position , the Pokemon will attack any enemies that pass by as long as they are within the attack range . In this mode , the Pokemons basically serve as the tower part of tower defense . <p> It is up to the player to determine how each Pokemon attacks . Each Pokemon can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depending on your preference , the Pokemon will use a specific attack . This chosen attack can be changed at any time during combat . To learn new skills , a Pokemon must defeat enough enemies to earn the necessary experience points for leveling up . Once you have reached the maximum of four skills and learn a new one , you will have the option of choosing a skill to overwrite or choosing not to learn the new skill . <p> Choosing the skill ( or attack ) of a Pokemon is very crucial . Charmander , a fire breathing Pokemon has a fire breathing projectile attack that is very powerful and also has a chance of igniting enemies on fire . However , some Pokemon are resistant to fire attacks , when facing these , poor Charmander is pretty weak . It would be better to switch to one of his non-elemental physical attacks instead . This requirement of being able to keep track of various Pokemon strengths and weaknesses will determine how well you will fare in many battles . While it is possible to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most efficient way to win is to actually know which kinds of attacks are more effective in defeating certain enemies . <h> Not Newbie Friendly <p> If you are new to the Pokemon scene - stop , and take a while to read up on the series and learn about the various kinds of Pokemon . The game is intricate and is loyal to many of the gameplay elements of the original Pokemon game . Knowing the types of attacks , resistances and leveling trees of the different pokemon will certainly put you at an advantage . If you feel that you are finding it hard to start out try asking for the help of a younger relative or neighbor - most kids are actually quite familiar with the various Pokemon types and are able to identify just by sight and more importantly , are able to recite stats as if they had a PokeDex installed in their brains . <p> More importantly , there are over a hundred Pokemon - with new ones being added with almost every other game . That said , the devs behind Pokemon TD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have new Pokemon being added to the game on a constant basis ( yes , this game has plenty of updates , which is great since it also means that bugs and performance issues are minimal ) . <p> The last issue why this game is not friendly to those new to Pokemon ? It requires time as an investment . That being said , if all you have been looking for is a quick way to pass the time , then there are plenty of other fun tower defense titles that you can turn to . But if you are a Pokemon fan who has mastered almost every single version of the game that has been released , then this game might just be the perfect thing for you to indulge in - new gameplay , familiar Pokemons and your favorite characters behaving in weird , yet humorous ways . <h> On Catching New Pokemon <p> As we said , you will have to position your Pokemon on various defensive hotspots . You start out with only one Pokemon and the game 's tutorial will teach you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy 's health bar down enough that it turns red , then you drag the PokeBall-that large red/white ball on the lower right of the screen to your target ) . If you can catch the desired target , the ball will open up . If it stays closed , it means that you may not catch that creature in that particular stage ( it happens ) . <p> The important thing here is to slow down the battle - which means pressing the 1x speed . While you can win battles easily when sped up , the timing of using the PokeBall is pretty crucial , since the target may accidentally get attacked by your Pokemon while you are still preparing the ball . <p> On the topic of creatures you can not capture - these are often the Pokemon types that appear with large big blue bars . These guys are not only tough and hard to bring down , but they also can not be captured .

@@121146386 @10146386/ <p> Ok , so its been a fair few weeks since the last story mode update from myself ; this is due to the festive season , the disproportionally large celebration of what is effectively just the changing of the calendar year to the next one , and most relevantly , the fact that I thought it best to wait for more features in Violet City to be accessible ( unless you want me to write about absolutely nothing , that is . Now that there are a few things to be done here in what must be the most sparsely populated city in the history of geography itself , we can go ahead and continue with the story mode and enjoy the fruits of Sam and Dans labour , which include a rematch with our old acquaintance Falkner ( apparently not to be forgot in the wake of the new year ) , a trade with a gentleman that feels it appropriate to stand alone in the woods and a visit to Bellsprout Tower , where a posse of shadow Bellsprouts seem to be loitering like Chavs outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to remind anyone with a bad memory ( or people who have n't read my previous guide ) that we are starting where we left off , and where we left off is the gate to Violet City in Route 31 which was previously blocked by Falkner , but is now free to be utilised for its purpose as a glorified door for the outdoors . Proceed through it and enter Violet City . <h> Damn , that Onix is Huge <p> Ok , let 's take care of the smallest business first , since it is business which leads to the most immediate benefit to ourselves which requires the least amount effort to be invested into it . Firstly , you must be possession of a Bellsprout : it does n't  matter which level it is , since you are only going to trade it , and the trade does n't  take the level of the PokTmon into account . If you do n't  already have one knocking about in your collection , I suggest you capture one of the low-level Bellsprouts that love to hang around on Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your leisure ; there is n't a time restriction on this ) . <p> Husky gentleman in the woods : Do n't  call the police , just give the man a Bellsprout to receive an Onix . Hell come in handy with the Falkner battle if you missed out on the Shiny Shinx giveaway or have an aversion to Geodude . <p> There is a rather husky-looking gentleman loitering in the north of the city with nothing but a ridiculously gigantic Onix for company . Apparently this man prefers the company of more vine-laden PokTmon ( though Im sure neither PokTmon are ideal candidates for scintillating conversation ) and wants to trade your Bellsprout for his Onix . The gentleman is hanging out in the woods in a suspicious manner , so head in a northerly direction to locate him . To commence with the trade you will need your Bellsprout at the front of your party , so have a fiddle about with your PokTstorage and get this Bellsprout to leftmost position of the six PokTmon in your party . Approach the man and initiate the trade ; sadly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to train him up if you want to use him for any battles of significance . Congratulations ! You have basically received something for ( almost ) nothing , since Bellsprouts are in abundance and at this stage , an Onix is rather hard to come by . Let it learn the powerful Rock Throw move , and it cant hurt to have Rage in your move-set either ; Onix is a great substitute for Geodude and can hold his own in most battles . <h> A Horticulturalists Nightmare ( Bellsprout Tower ) <p> Seeing as you are already at the north end of Violet City , you might as well go and do some nosing around in the grand , purple-roofed building at the top of the designated path . Inside , you will find a panicky gentleman who is having what would otherwise have been a perfect day spoiled by the disruptive behaviour of some Bellsprout troublemakers ( you can almost see the tracksuits , hoodies , they 're simply asking for an ASBO ) . These shadow Bellsprouts seem to be causing the man concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to help . Step forward into one of the wandering Bellsprouts and you will be thrust into a mini boss-type battle , which is the perfect opportunity for you to gain some delicious experience points , which go extremely well with the PokTmon main course . <p> Those Bellsprouts need some watering : The shadow Bellsprout battle is a nice little earner of experience points , particularly if you have a fire-type PokTmon to hand . <p> The shadow Bellsprout battle is pretty straightforward : a Level 30 Bellsprout sits in the centre of the arena and intermittently engages in a rapid spin which temporarily traps whichever PokTmon you have deployed in their current position . Smaller , lower-level Bellsprouts will hover around the battle zone while small , spinning vine-like objects are propelled at you from all directions . This battle is easy to overcome with fire-type PokTmon ; moves such as Ember will do the trick and have the battle over in no time . Try not to use Rock-type PokTmon , however , since grass-type moves are rather effective in the most super of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the battle repeatedly should you wish to continue training up your PokTmon and gaining some valuable experience points along the way . Unfortunately , experience points are your only reward for this little venture , so we now must move on to the main event of Violent City : the rematch with the lover of flying types known only as Falkner ( it seems he just wo n't go away ) . <h> Falkner the flying-type Falconer Fanatic <p> As if battling with his relatively-tough flying PokTmon the first time around wasnt challenging enough , we now have to face the flying-type fan once more , only this time around its well , not personal , but it feels that way and it makes me want to defeat him more if I put it like that . You will find Falkner waiting with a vacant stare outside the PokTmon Gym , which is located just to the left of the centre of the city , and is apparently not actually used for fighting in , and is simply a building used to be waited outside of . Talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why cant he just use the gym for its intended purpose ? ) . Let 's just hope we get a gym badge for our efforts this time ( spoiler : you do ) . <p> Close encounters of the second kind : Your rematch follows the format of your previous encounter , only Pidgeotto and Pidgeot are simultaneously present from the very beginning . <p> The battle with Falkner is pretty similar to your first encounter with the trainer of aerial inclination , only this time its a little more difficult . The only practical difference is that instead of facing Pidgeotto first and then going on to do battle with Pidgeot , you are thrust straight into an encounter with them appearing simultaneously , forcing you to do battle with both right from the outset . This would be simple if their attacks werent so damn irritating , but because we play PokTmon for a challenge and not for a cheap , easy thrill , we are forced to use a little bit of tactical manoeuvring during this encounter . I have covered the Falkner strategy in my previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you may not have/not want to have read my other guides , I 'll tender you with some light sprinklings of knowledge on how to go about the battle . <h> Battle Details <p> The battle takes place in an outdoor area with plenty of space for some unruly PokTmon action : the battle arena is comprised of multiple squares on which to place your Pokemon : Pidgeotto ( level 25 ) sits at the right of the screen and Pidgeot ( level 30 ) is hovering on the left side of the battle zone . Each of the birds emits a set of devastatingly powerful tornado gusts at regular intervals . Pidgeottos gusts are limited to one frequently-released tornado which seeks out the square which you were occupying on its moment of release ; you can simply move your PokTmon to a square that is out of harms way and continue with your attacks . Pidgeot attacks in the same manner but fires three tornadoes simultaneously which proceed to travel across the screen , forcing you to move your PokTmon swiftly out of the way , lest it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the assault . The trick is simply to keep your PokTmon moving and out of harms way whilst keeping it close enough to make its attacks on the two birds ; take out Pidgeotto first , then Pidgeot . You will notice an abundance of low-level Pidgeys flying around amidst all the action ; take some time to occasionally take these fellows out since they can get quite annoying and accumulate into an abundance of trouble quite quickly . <h> Electric and Rock-types are the sensible option <p> Now , what kind of PokTmon should you be using for this whole kerfuffle ? Ideally , you would want an electric PokTmon at this stage such as Shiny Shinx since electrical moves are supremely effective against flying types . The only way to have obtained this PokTmon however is to have been part of the Shiny Jirachi Mystery Gift giveaway , or failing that , to have received him in a trade . Its ok though , since you can use rock PokTmon with equally successful results , it just takes a little longer to achieve them . Ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule if you do n't  have an electric-type . It would n't make too much sense to go up against Falkner with PokTmon of any level lower than 18 , but ideally 20 should be the working minimum if you wish to beat Falkner on the same day which you started the battle . <p> Beating Falkner with a Rock-type PokTmon is as simple as following the above tactic ; continue dodging the gust attacks whilst using the powerful Rock Slide move to slowly wear their health down . Do n't  under any circumstance allow your PokTmon to be hit by the gust attacks since the tornadoes repeatedly chip away at your health as they pass , dealing massive damage as a result of one little mistake . If you happen upon a Shiny Jirachi in a trade , it cant hurt your progress either : its Confusion move will be sufficient to take down the two birds if you keep at it long enough . <p> After beating Falkner ( for the second time ) , you will find yourself issued ( finally ) with your very first gym badge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technical administrative oversight in PokTmon Red ! <h> Until Next Time <p> Once you have performed all of the above tasks , you have effectively fulfilled your end of the bargain with respect to your responsibility to play the game to its absolute limit ; you can not progress further until the next update from Sam and Dan , so sit tight and keep your eyes peeled for the next update , since shortly after I will be recording some helpful tactics and approaches to the new sections of the game in word form and popping them online for all to read . Until then , I wish you the best of new years tidings and a semi-sincere farewell . 
@@121146387 @10146387/ <p> Having exchanged some very mild words and light battle talk with the gym leader ( I have n't seen his name in the game but the reliable source that is the internet internet in general , you begin the battle . Like the battle with the legendary birds , your first Gym Battle actually takes place in the wonderful outdoors , which is a perfect environment for Falkner to show off his extremely high-level flying P=kemon . The reason why I asked you to capture and train two Geodudes to a minimum of level twelve is because Falkners first PokTmon is a level 25 Pidgeotto and his second is a Pigeot at an astounding level 30 ; since I have n't encountered any electric PokTmon thus far I feel that rock PokTmon offer the best level of defence and you can not really argue with the powerful Rock Throw move which will have the battle won in no time at all . <p> Falkner starts with his level 25 Pidgeotto against which you are unlikely to stand a chance with low-level PokTmon that you may or may not have managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your starting PokTmon is unlikely to offer you much of an advantage . As Pidgeotto is released , take a few seconds to drag out your Geodudes into the battle arena ; anywhere will do for now since I just want you to see the arrangement of the active zones in which you can place your PokTmon in order to get a feel for this battle . <p> Pidgeotto appears on the far right of the battle zone which is three squares high and four squares long , hovering in line with the middle square . Its only attack is Gust which you must avoid at all costs if you are to survive the battle with him , let alone Pidgeot who is up next . It is imperative that when you see the miniature tornado that indicates his use of Gust emanating from Pidgeotto , you must move whichever Geodude is in the firing line out of this square and into the other one which ( by process of elimination ) is safe . The tiny tornado moves fairly quickly , meaning you only have a short window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling so that you can move the particular Geodude that is in danger away from the attack , placing him back into attacking range as soon as it is safe . You should be able to continue in this way until Pidgeotto has fainted . <p> The tactic here is to set up your two Geodudes in any two of the three active zones that are in his immediate vicinity and set them to Rock Throw as their only attack . You will find that this chips away at his health fairly quickly and provided that you have managed to avoid Pidgeottos gust manoeuvre , you should have no trouble in making fairly short work of this first avian annoyance . <p> A light yet consistent stream of smaller , low-level Pidgeys will be flying around the battle arena while the action unfolds ; these can be taken out with a single hit from the Rock Throw by quickly positioning one of your Geodudes near them . Once these smaller PokTmon are dealt with , ensure that you return your Geodude to within Pigdeottos vicinity in order to keep chipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pidgeotto faints , leaving only a single Pidgeot at level thirty to content with . <p> After a small period of time in which the low-level Pidgeys swarm in and hover around with a death wish , Pidgeot is released at the opposite ( left ) side of the screen , being positioned in line with the middle square of the three vertical ones yet again . It is now more important than ever to avoid Pidgeots Gust move , because this special attack from such a high-level PokTmon is quite deadly even to your highly-defended and sturdy Geodudes . <p> The procedure here is almost identical to your battle on the right side of the screen ; the only variable is Pidgeots level and the number of gusts which he releases at any one time . Pigdeot releases three gusts simultaneously which travel laterally from left to right , forcing you to move both of your Geodudes out of their path . I recommend that you simply move them one square to the right while the tornados sweep across the nearest attacking zones ; then you can simply place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep chipping away at Pigdeot . Alternatively , you can move them into attacking range of any smaller birds that may be hovering around in order to mop them up before they begin to accumulate , though make sure that if you do this you are sure to keep an eye on Pidgeots gusts : one encounter with this move and you are likely to be dead or very nearly so . <p> Luckily , Pidgeots triple gust travels at a much more relaxed pace than Pigeottos one , effectively giving you more time to pull your active PokTmon out of the danger zone . As long as you are aware of your PokTmons locations throughout the battle , you should encounter very few problems during the whole ordeal . In order to make the battle move a little more swiftly , you can make use of Geodudes Rock Polish move which , when used consecutively or on multiple separate occasions throughout the battle , raises the attack speed of Geodude quite substantially . When all is said and done , this battle is 50% having the right PokTmon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pure , unadulterated patience . Proceed with these above tactics and the battle should be over in no time at all . <p> Pidgeotto proves to be a simple nemesis should you possess two Geodudes with the Rock Throw move ( left ) . Pidgeots triple gust proves more difficult to avoid but is by no means an impossible feat ; constant manoeuvring and consistent attack is the key to victory ( right ) . <p> Having beaten Falkner , you can see why having two Geodudes was such an advantage ; without Rock Throw , the battle would have taken more time in which it is likely that any other P=kemon you had would have been worn down by the smaller PokTmon s attacks . This gym battle is as far as you can progress within the game at this stage of development . More musings on Story Mode strategy will follow Sams next update . 
@@121146388 @10146388/ <h> PTD 2 Walkthrough : 1 vs 1 Mode : Levels 7 , &amp; 8 <h> Level 7 <p> Unfortunately , the only reward for completing level 6 is the sixth Rare Candy , so I recommend you buy this and all the Potions that you can afford with the money you have . Brock is a notorious trainer of rock-type PokTmon , and guess who is super-effective against these ? That 's right , Butterfree is once again the saviour of your quest , and you will find this next battle extremely difficult if you do not possess him . Brock has a Geodude and an Onix , which does n't  sound like a formidable collection , but as you found out with the two Geodudes in level 6 , rock-type PokTmon are tough and usually result in a long and drawn-out battle in which your PokTmon take a battering on all fronts . At this stage , I recommend as a minimum that you have Butterfree , Pikachu and Geodude in your collection , with any other PokTmon being only supplementary in this battle ; such is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brock sends out Geodude as his first contender . As is tradition , send out Butterfree as your first PokTmon and instantly use the Rare Candy 6 on him in order to raise his level by one . Rotate through all of your moves , ensuring Confusion and harden are included in this . You will likely take a significant amount of damage from Geodude and will need to use a Potion to heal ; simply continue as before until Geodude can no longer stand the heat from the metaphorical kitchen . <p> Brocks next PokTmon is an Onix which is at a face-shattering level 13 , proving extremely difficult to beat , even with the devastating Confusion attack from Butterfree . If you have stocked up on enough potions , you should be able to just about get through this battle before Brock defeats you and reduces all the effort that you have put into battling thus far to little more than shameful nothingness ; failing that , you may be experiencing a shattered feeling of deflated hopelessness that only the failure to win a PokTmon battle can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your ( albeit imaginary ) money . If your Butterfree is still standing , then continue as instructed above . If/when Butterfree does faint , you have no choice but to use the remaining PokTmon . Pikachu can be used by yet again cycling through his attacks and causing as much damage and upset as possible before he faints . When he does so , send out Geodude whose attacks are not remarkably effective , but the Defence Curl proves an invaluable tool to prolong your life until you are able to wear Onixs health down to depletion . <p> In the event that your battle just happened to go swimmingly and without too many hitches , then you can stand proud and in the knowledge that you have beaten Brock , your first gym leader opponent and a very difficult one at that . I wont bother with commiserations for those who failed since you did so because you either did n't  take my advice about purchasing Caterpie and subsequently levelling him up and nurturing him into a fearless , flying fight machine or you did n't  take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your PokTmon should falter and fail you in the health department . To the successor of the level 7 battle come the spoils in the form of Rare Candy 7 and one of the starting PokTmon of the much-missed PokTmon red/blue versions ( 1st generation Gameboy for life ) , a leafy , budding Bulbasoar ! <p> Figure 11 : Brock o'clock <p> Figure 12 : Brock beaten <p> Note that Geodude is useless in the next battle since you will be facing a variety of PokTmon that rock-types just simply do n't  get along with . I suggest you discard him from your team in favour of young Bulbasoar , who proves to be moderately effective this battle <h> Level 8 <p> Your next opponent is Youngster 2.0 who appears to be an exact copy of you , but suffixed with a 2.0 indicating that he may be an improved model . He is in possession of a significantly difficult-to-defeat PokTmon team that encompasses a variety of types , high levels and a frustrating tendency to be recalled by Youngster 2.0 and brought back into play later on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that you have won and have one PokTmon left possessing very little health and definitely no potions remaining . <p> Since beating Brock has for some reason increased the generosity of Professor Oak by an astronomical amount and has led to him dishing out one hundred coins as payment for your victory , you can now afford to splash our a little on some new merchandise . Firstly , purchase the newest ( and for now the last ) Rare Candy so that you can watch Butterfree grow up just that little bit more ( shell be learning her first words soon ) in the next battle . Also , I 'll be quite shocked if you have n't already let the warm nostalgia of the original PokTmon games wash over you , compelling you to spend a measly ten PokTpounds on your newly-unlocked Bulbasoar ; make sure you do this because it is a useful PokTmon to have from now on.With the rest of your money , purchase all the potions you can afford and squeeze into your stylish battle-supplies satchel ( you can carry a maximum of six at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I suggest you also purchase some Oran berries , which are about half as effective as potions but you can carry a further six of these items into battle with you and effectively double your chances of success . <p> The PokTmon you face in level 8 are Pidgey , Butterfree , Ekans , Rattata , Pikachu and Bulbasoar . Sadly , I can not guarantee in which order these PokTmon will actually show up because during my particular battle , Pikachu was recalled and used at the very last minute which almost led to my downfall and a disproportionate reaction of frustration ( often the nearest expensive item being thrown an average distance across the room at an accelerated pace ) . This battle is extremely hard if you do not possess Butterfree and so I can not guarantee your safety or success if you have failed to listen to my ongoing advice . Oh , and did I mention about Potions ? Buy lots of potions : buy ALL the potions ( to within the limit set by the game , that is ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since I can not tell you in which order you are likely to face your opponent PokTmon , I obviously can not provide a step-by-step guide on how to run circles around Youngster 2.0 . My suggestion is that you begin with Butterfree and continue with the much-relied-upon tactic of rotating through your attacks . You will find Confusion to be supremely effective against most ( if not all ) of your opponents , even when it is n't actually super-effective against your opponent ; the move is simply that powerful . <p> Make sure you keep on using Harden at every opportunity until the tiny icon next to your PokTmon indicates you have used it six times ( this is the upper limit for how many times you are allowed to use this move ) . This combination of Confusion and Harden will allow you to deal the maximum amount of damage while ensuring you receive a minimum amount of pain from your enemies . Once you have hardened six times , simply concentrate on your offensive attacks and watch your opponents health dwindle . <p> When you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this is why I recommend cycling through all of your moves because Butterfree still knows Tackle from the good old days when she used to be a Metapod or even a lowly Caterpie . Focus on using Tackle against Youngster 2.0s Butterfree ; this should ensure that you do not stall at this hurdle and lose too much health . <p> Do not allow the health of your PokTmon ( again , I am mainly talking about your Butterfree here since he is pretty much the foundation upon which all of your progress and success in 1vs1 mode is based ) go below the green level on the health-bar indicator before you use a Potion/Oran Berry . I say this because if you allow your PokTmons health to venture to these depths , then you may be caught out by a super-effective or critical hit move which will render the potion that you were about to administer completely useless . In most battles , this would not matter too much because the stakes are relatively low , but at this stage and with this many PokTmon to face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again not because you failed to prepare for it in the first place , but because you were too relaxed about administering first aid to your PokTmon . <p> Pikachu appears to be fairly effective against Youngsters Bulbasoar in spite of the sever level deficiency ( in my case , Pikachu was a pathetic level 5 facing Youngsters Bulbasoar that stands at a mighty level 13 ) . Rattata is a an excellent all-round PokTmon which is why I had two in my team , if only to chip away at the opponents health ( Rattata has sadly been the equivalent of an expendable pawn in this game ) before he faints . Do n't  bother wasting your potions on saving most of your other PokTmon ; the most important one to keep alive is Butterfree . <p> Further advice would be stating the obvious such as not using flying PokTmon against Pikachu or rock PokTmon against Bulbasoar because of the super-effectiveness of the latter over the former respectively in each case . You should probably know this information by now but it does n't  always hurt to reiterate these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geodude in level 8 because I already told you to discard him from your team in light of the battle against Youngster 2.0 . <p> The main thing to remember about this battle ( apart from using Butterfrees mighty selection of moves ) is to keep using potions should Butterfrees health dwindle too far into unacceptable lower limits . If you proceed in the above manner , you should almost always find yourself to be the victor of the battle , and indeed of the whole 1vs1 mode as far as it has been taken in its development . <p> If you find yourself the winner in your battle against Youngster then firstly you should breathe a sigh of relief since you have proven yourself to be the conqueror of all PokTmon , or at least all the flash-animated PokTmon within the discrete world of 1vs1 mode in PokTmon Tower Defence 2 pending further development and additions to the game , at least . Secondly , the final PokTmon is bestowed upon you in the form of Jigglypuff , who is an outrageously cute and heart-stoppingly loveable example of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . Prevailing over Youngster 2.0 also wins you the last Rare Candy , which you have no use for in this run , but since you now have a fair bit of money and can start all over again , you may wish to experiment with different combinations of PokTmon at different stages of evolution ; this is probably only for the most avid of all dedicated PokTmon enthusiasts , but is a fun thought and one that warrants entertaining . 
@@121146389 @10146389/ <h> PTD 2 Walkthrough : Cherry Grove , Route 30 &amp; Route 31 <p> You arrive in Cherrygrove City to witness a fair bit of commotion caused entirely by the legendary birds hovering overhead in a rather panicked fashion . Professor Gary is a familiar face here and the mention of Ash should have the PokTmon fan inside you positively gleaming . The challenge that awaits you takes on a village-wide scale ; that is , the battle area consists of the entire village area , with the camera zooming out a little to make this possible . This dramatic scene signifies a significant escalation in difficulty here ; any PokTmon fans will be aware that a battle with even one legendary bird is hard enough , let alone three of them in an agitated state . <p> The format of the battle is the same as your previous encounters with PokTmon , only this one is on a slightly increased scale . Zapdos ( one of the legendary birds ) moves slowly around the area with smaller PokTmon surrounding him as backup . Place your PokTmon in whichever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do not let Zapdos get too close to you since his attack will instantly knock you out . I found it best to place your PokTmon at various positions on the path where you think Zapdos will be wandering next ; as he approaches , simply move your PokTmon a sufficient distance away and continue . Zai ( one of the members of the group that just couldnt wait to face an encounter with the legendary birds ) will heal your PokTmon if you put them close to her , which is pretty useful since this battle will certainly take its toll on your posse . <p> Essentially , the aim is to eliminate all the PokTmon that are n't  legendary birds in order to cater for the slow , bumbling nature of Zapdos , who you should keep away from as much as possible . You can keep healing your PokTmon with Zai , just ensure that all of your PokTmon are n't  defeated or the battle will reach an abrupt conclusion and you will be forced to start again . Once the smaller PokTmon are defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , signifying the end of the battle . After Ash himself makes a welcome cameo appearance , Lugia calms the legendary birds down with some rather frantic flapping of its wings , which seems to do the trick . <p> Your arrival in Cherrygrove City appears to be met with some dramatic happenings between PokTmon and human alike ( left ) . Avoidance of Zapdos deadly attack is essential to surviving the battle for long enough to be able to eliminate the smaller PokTmon ( right ) . <p> Once everything has settled down a little , feel free to talk to the people who stick around ; they do n't  offer any information of substance , however , and the only new place you can go at the moment is to Route 30 , which is to the north of Cherrytown .

Once you find one , approach it like you would a wild PokTmon ; you will become entangled in the web and a battle begins .

There are a total of 17 types of attacks , ranging from normal , to electric , to poison , to flying , to steel and even dark . For the most part , an attack will affect a target and deal a set or normal amount of damage , but in some cases , such as using an electric attack on a water creature , the attack is even more effective and is able to deal double the usual damage . To read this chart , read it as it is . Element comparisons not listed , such as Ice attacks on Electric creatures , are automatically considered to be regular attacks and will deal a normal amount of damage . <p> Normal Attacks - these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half effective against rock and steel types ( since those are tough , and are naturally defended against basic attacks ) , and will deal no damage against ghost type creatures . <p> Fire Attacks - common in creatures that look like they breathe fire , like dragons . Weak when used against fire , water , rock and dragon enemies . At the same time , they deal twice the damage against grass , ice , bugs and steel enemies . <p> Water Attacks - are often used by swimming monsters . These attacks are weak against water , electric , grass and dragon types . But they deal double the damage against fire , ground and rock creatures . <p> Electric Attacks - the likes of Pikachu and other bolt zapping creatures use these . These attacks are resisted by electric , grass , and dragons , while ground units will take no damage at all . When used on water and flying creatures however , the attacks are very effective . <p> Grass Attacks - are when Pokemon utilize long vines , sharp leaves and even seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grass , poison , flying , bug , dragon and steel creatures . You should be able to use them effectively against water , ground and rock enemies . <p> Ice Attacks - when it is all about things that are frosty such as snow , icicles and the like , you consider it an ice attack . These attacks are not useful versus water , ice and steel enemies . But against grass , ground , flying , rock and dragon enemies , they deliver plenty of damage . <p> Fighting Attacks - some Pokemon are adept at using their fists , paws and tails for combat , and the power is so strong it can no longer be part of a normal attack . These attacks are weak against poison , flying , psychic , and bug types - also , they do absolutely no damage to ghosts . On the other hand , they will do double damage to normal , ice , rock , steel and dark type creatures . <p> Poison Attacks - are used by Pokemon who have a bit of venom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , rock , and ghost type creatures . Also , steel takes no damage from poison . Against grass and bugs , they will deal double the damage . <p> Ground Attacks - these attacks use the soil underneath to deal some damage .

They are very strong against fire , electric , poison , rock , and steel creatures . <p> Flying Attacks - are by Pokemon who prefer to take to the sky . They are weak against electric , rock , and steel creatures but strong against grass , fighting , and bug creatures . <p> Psychic Attacks - are used by Pokemon that have strong mental powers . They are weak against steel and other psychic Pokemon while dark types are immune to these attacks . These attacks are best used against fighting and poison Pokemon . <p> Bug Attacks - are used by insect type Pokemon . These attacks are weak against fire , fighting , flying , ghost , and steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dark types . <p> Rock Attacks - are usually made by Pokemon that are made of stone .

They are weak against steel and dark Pokemon . Normal type Pokemon are immune to ghost attacks . When used on psychic and other ghost Pokemon , their effect is doubled . <p> Dragon Attacks - can only be used by dragon type Pokemon . They are not particularly strong against any other type aside from ghost Pokemon . Also , dragons are naturally strong against other dragon attacks . <p> Steel Attacks - these attacks are used by Pokemon that have command of metals . The attacks of this element are weak against fire , water , electric , and other steel Pokemon .

@@121146405 @10146405/ <h> PTD 2 Walkthrough : Story Mode : New Bark Town <p> Beginning in the familiar presence of Professor Oak , the long-serving friend and PokTmon dealer/guru of Ash Catchem , you embark upon story mode with a noticeable wistfulness and the secret wish that you were playing as Ash from the original games . Tough : You play under the name of well , whichever name you choose to enter in a few moments ; whatever name you choose , you are stuck with for the rest of the game , so you must get used to the fact ( as I grudgingly did ) that there will be some inventive deviation from the original PokTmon games . At this point you can do nothing but listen to the Professor as he asks you to enter some of your details ( if you have started a new game ) and provides you with a gently-worded summary of PokTmon and their versatility , being able to act as both companions and weapons of battle : how useful ! After a humorous allusion to Sam , who is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option being to click the next button ; do so , and watch the cut-scene unfold . <p> You are in the presence of three PokTmon ( Chikorita , Cyndaquil and Totodile ) and are talking to them as if they were people with a human consciousness , with all this against a white background . As suddenly as you appeared in this dream world , three shadow PokTmon appear in front of you ; I sense a battle emerging . Continue pressing next to be greeted with a few instructions on how to actually go about the process of battling . It reminds you that in order to battle , you simply have to drag your PokTmon into a free spot on the map ( indicated by a red square ) and click on an individual attack in order to set your PokTmon to use it from then onwards . You may also change your attack with the Z , X and other buttons which correspond to them ; these are listed in small print next to the attacks which they correspond to . Everything is self-explanatory so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that everything remains this easy . Trust me , it does n't  . <p> After the shadow PokTmon appear and you are provided with some light instructional guidance , a battle commences in which you must fight the three shadow PokTmon which have recently appeared in this mysterious place . Since the three PokTmon you now have in your possession are level 7 and your opponents are merely level 4 , you can use your creatures in pretty much any order you wish in order to defeat your shadow-shrouded opponent . Also , due to the fact that this entire sequence turns out to be a dream , you do not have to worry too much about alternating your flock in order to spread the damage of the attacks and therefore preserve the relative health of each of your PokTmon . You may wish to consider this tactic in later battles that take place in the real ( but still fictional ) world . After the battle is over , Professor Oak tells you to visit the laboratory to pick up your first PokTmon . <p> You wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having turned out to be merely a dream and nothing more . The game instructs you on how to walk ( though anyone with a shred of common sense would have already guessed that the arrow keys are the secret to in-game movement ) and as you go downstairs , your mother reminds you that either Z or Spacebar can be used to interact with objects . Exit your house and head towards the building with the circular windows to the left ; enter it and engage in conversational procedures with the professor . <h> I Choose You ! <p> It becomes obvious that , much like in the original PokTmon games , you must make a choice from the three PokTballs on the table of which one you would like to be your starting PokTmon . Again , the choice is between the three PokTmon that you saw in your dream . It is up to you which PokTmon you choose , and since I can not possible write a guide that covers each alternate reality that is created when you choose a different PokTmon , I went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because his name is the most pleasant to pronounce . Go outside and politely follow the action as it unfolds by playing with your PokTmon as the Professor suggested . <p> Things have moved on since Pokemon Red ; instead of Bulbasoar , Charmander or Squirtle , your choice of starting PokTmon are of a different generation . <p> Oh dear : it seems your PokTmon ran away . Try not to worry too much , since it is nothing personal ; it runs away regardless of which PokTmon you pick . I guess this is what happens when humans try and control the natural world around them , and insert conceited statement about nature always prevailing and the destructive tendency of the human race here . Talk to the girl that is just below you ; she will tell you that she has seen your PokTmon and make a comment that is specific to the PokTmon you chose . Walk down and to the right , approaching and interacting with the still , round-headed gentleman . He will tell you where your PokTmon is , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to the left and to the top of the area where you are able to follow the path to the exit above you . <p> You find your PokTmon cavorting about a wooded area , possibly unaware of the dangerous situation that is unfolding around him . Shadow PokTmon have surrounded the other two PokTmon from the laboratory , and it looks like it is up to you to stop this nonsense . You are told that the opponents will be entering from the bottom , and that you must use your PokTmon to defend the apparently defenceless ones from the laboratory . After the Ready and Go warnings appear , you must drag your PokTmon into one of the four squares available to you and get your first taste of the tower defence action . <h> First Blood <p> You can prevail in this battle by putting your PokTmon in a number of places , but the one with maximum potential for a clear line of attack is the bottom right square . Place your PokTmon here and watch it attack as the offenders enter from below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is superior to those of the PokTmon which are attacking . If the shadow PokTmon do manage to get far enough to pilfer yours , then you may reposition them as you see fit in order to squeeze off the highest number of attacks you can . You should have prevailed with ease over the shadow PokTmon : you will be thanked for your bravery . As a result of gaining experience from battling , your PokTmon will also have levelled up ; in the case of Cyndaquil , this results in him learning the Smokescreen move . He will also now be more effective in his attacks in general due to this levelling up . Return to the lab with the professor and receive some more compliments . <p> As you exit the laboratory you are summoned by someone who asks you to come and talk to them in the south east part of the area ; walk in this direction and you will see a red-haired figure in the trees .

While some of the standard type creatures can be caught easily , the rest can be quite a challenge to recruit . Also , catching is not your only concern - you also need to win ! After all , when you have 8 chapters worth of Pokemon to beat , having the right crew for the job is important to your victory . <h> Reviewing the Battle <p> Some battles - particularly the early ones , are quite easy . They take little effort and winning is a simple matter of setting all your Pokemon to attack with their strongest abilities . This is not a bad strategy , in fact , if your Pokemon are high leveled enough - it is all you will need to do . <p> However , as you progress through the game and earn your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start increasing exponentially . More boss type enemies appear ( the ones with blue health bars ) , stages become more complex ( you face challenges where you can only deploy a single Pokemon at a time ) , you encounter stages where you must play as the attacker , and enemies start attacking your towers as well . Chances are , your Pokemon are not over-leveled and you will lose the stage . Worry not , you still keep any experience points you earned as well as the Pokemon Dollars you gained . More importantly , if paid attention to the match , you would be able to identify the different Pokemon that appeared on the stage . <p> Knowing the enemies that spawn in a stage is important so that you will know what kinds of attacks are effective and which ones are not . Of course , this would mean that you are able to identify a Pokemon just by it 's looks alone - if you are not a fan of the series , getting to know any of the 100+ creatures in the game can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely designed , it is actually fun to read up on each one of them .

Knowing the name also means being able to research the Pokemon 's stats ( it is easy to look them up individually online ) . And once you do that , you will be able to identify their strengths and weaknesses against different kinds of attacks . For example , if you were fighting an electric type Pokemon like Pikachu and one of your towers was using 100 damage wind element attack , it would only do half damage . On the other hand , if you had a 40 damage ground attack , it would be doubly effective against the same Pokemon . And this brings us to ... 
@@121146409 @10146409/ <h> PTD : Pokemon Attacks - Strategies <h> Knowing Your Attacks <p> Each Pokemon has two qualities , a type and an attack element . Knowing the balance and correlation between the two stats is very important when it comes to knowing beforehand if your team has what it takes to win . The bottom line here is that it all becomes a numbers game - and knowing all the variables will help make the battles easier . <p> First off , the type - this trait of the Pokemon determines what it is strong against and what it is weak against . There is no single type that is superior to all - though the steel type Pokemon have the most resistances : 11 in total . The Rock type Pokemon on the other hand are weak against 6 types of attacks . In short , this is your first line of defense and also , the first indication of any weaknesses . The type of a Pokemon is inherent to its species ; all Charmanders are fire types and all Bulbasaurs are grass types . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be altered temporarily in battle through certain abilities . Also , a Pokemon is not always limited to having only one type , it can be a combination of two types ( such as flying and fire ) , and as such , it gains the resistances and strengths of both types . On the opposite end of the spectrum , this also allows you to choose what Pokemon to deploy in the attack missions when you have to be the ones defending . <p> The second thing you have to be familiar with , is the element of your pokemon attacks . This is actually very simple and easy : all you need to do is to read the attack details . All attacks will tell you the cooldown time , amount of damage , accuracy , any special effects it has , and also , what element it uses . Obviously , players should combine their knowledge of the target 's type with the attack elements to ensure that each hit deals the most damage possible . This level of effectiveness can easily change the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Pokemon 's type does not limit the kinds of attacks it can perfom - a water type Pokemon may also learn an attack of a different element . While a fire type learning a water element skill is unlikely to happen through leveling up , it is possible by making use of the TMs/HMs option . <p> Here is something that players should remember : a Pokemon using an attack of the same element of it 's type will deal more damage ( a psychic Pokemon using a psychic attack gains a bonus to damage ) . And this is why Pokemon tend to use one 's own element for attacking . But aside from that , there is no penalty for using an attack of the opposite element , so if you want to have a little bit of adaptability , having a Pokemon learn an attack that it normally does not have can be helpful too . <h> Learning New Attacks and Choosing Your Abilities <p> Every Pokemon has four ability slots , these can be filled up with any skill that the Pokemon can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveling up , relearning old skills , or buying new ones . Abilities can either be attacks that deal physical damage , attacks that cause negative status changes , buffs that support the Pokemon or your party , and lastly : any combination of the above . <p> Learning attacks by leveling up is pretty automatic : if you have a blank space in your four slots , the new skill will automatically be placed in the blank position . If you already have four that are assigned , you can choose to overwrite any of the older skills and replace it with a new skill , or you can just click on " done " to have it set into your learned skills set so you may choose to access it later on . The important thing is , when a Pokemon is learning a new skill , you must select " learn skill " . Choosing " do not learn " will not add the skill in your relearn option . <p> Relearning a skill means spending 1000 Pokedollars to buy an old skill and adding it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not hesitate to overwrite a skill , you can always come back to it later on . Also , it is important to open this option on any new Pokemon you have caught . There are occasions when a wild Pokemon will have some nice skills already learned in their list , all you need to do is to assign it to one of the attack slots ( this is pretty common with most Pokemon above level 25 ) . This feature also comes in pretty handy when you need to change the line-up of abilities - like when you need to specialize in certain stages . <p> If the default line of abilities are lacking for your needs , you can spend 10,000 Pokedollars with the TMs/HMs device in order to learn some really nice skills . Here you are able to learn some really strong moves of varying elements and abilities - it is actually a pretty good investment if your Pokemon are a little weak . With this , you can obtain abilities that hit multiple targets , have massive damage or provide really beneficial effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to facing special challenges ( such as beating certain gyms without using certain Pokemon types ) . This is actually pretty easy to circumvent thanks to the TMs/HMs machine since a type is different from an attack element : if a challenge says no lightning Pokemon , equipping lightning attacks on a fire Pokemon will still keep you qualified for the challenge . The only catch here is that skills learned in this mode are not placed in the " relearn " option , which means you will have to buy it at full price if you ever decide to overwrite the skill . <p> On a more general mindset , the ideal thing is to have a good range of attacks - strong ones for stopping enemy waves , weak ones for withering down opponents for capture , and negative status effects that will complement attacks by your other Pokemon . Having these abilities on well rounded Pokemon will keep you ready and prepared for most of the regular maps . Also , they keep you ready enough to take on a wide variety of targets without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support abilities , you will need to change and adapt depending on the stage . In some stages , simply getting your Pokemon to move fast enough to grab the candy is good enough . But in others you will need to either put up some defensive barriers or use some heavy shields to keep the enemy attacks from killing your Pokemon . <h> Choosing Who to Attack <p> One great thing about PTD is that it allows you to determine which targets your pokemon attacks or their priority of attacks . During a battle , clicking on an active Pokemon 's icon will open up the attack menu . This will allow you to level them up in the middle of combat ( if they have earned enough experience points ) , choose which attack to use , and also , determine which targets to prioritize .

You can combine this with a quick attack to easily bring down fast-moving , low HP enemies , or you can combine this with a slow-down spell ( if the spell hits , the Pokemon automatically changes target since the current one is no longer " fastest " ) . Also , there are a few attacks that increase in damage when targeting faster Pokemon . <p> Slowest - the slower Pokemon tend to have higher HP and better defense , and this is a good setting for those towers that you want to be focused on these harder Pokemon .

The last thing you need is a lightning Pokemon tower choosing to attack a ground type instead of the water type .

Basically , this means that your Pokemon will go after any enemy that grabs a candy ( combine this with status effects that makes them drop the candy and you have got a really efficient defensive setup ) . <p> Ignore Candy - you may want your Pokemon to be focused more on the enemies that are attacking as opposed to those that have managed to get some candy .

@@121146413 @10146413/ <h> PTD : Pokemon Experience Points <p> Aside from learning new skills , a Pokemon gains status increases by leveling up - their HP , damage and other stats will rise and make them more effective against other Pokemon . This is why having a level 90 Fearow is better than having a level 50 Spearow . Here are a few tips for getting your Pokemon to increase levels as fast as possible . <p> Pokemon earn experience points when an enemy they attack dies . The exp is then split evenly among the towers that attacked the target . This means that if three towers attack and kill an enemy Pokemon they equally share the exp gain . To earn the most exp , place the Pokemon you want to prioritize in leveling at the closest possible position to the enemy spawn point . This ensures that regardless of who gets to kill the enemy , the primary Pokemon still gets a share of the exp . <p> To make this strategy more effective , it is important that your main Pokemon is able to attack as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ) . One good strategy is to use an attack that hits multiple targets ; try the ice beam attack for starters . If you are in a corner of a path - like in chapter 4 , route 8 , an attack with a radial area of effect is pretty effective . Status effect abilities also apply so try an ability that slows enemies down and prioritize " fastest " targets first . This will allow your Pokemon to target one enemy after another . <p> If the main Pokemon you are leveling is relatively weak ( like a level 1 gained from a trade or a low-tier wild Pokemon ) , it is likely that they would not have any powerful attacks that are able to kill enemies easily . The next Pokemon in the line should have a really powerful attack - possibly one that is able to kill enemies instantly . This is why the next Pokemon should be your most powerful one . The logic here is that this will ensure that the experience points split is reduced as much as possible .

They are used for leveling up Pokemon , purchasing the evolution stones , and supporting skill learning from relearning or through HMs/TMs . These are relatively easy to earn and while it may seem that saving coins seems hard at the start , it is actually pretty easy .

@@121146417 @10146417/ <h> Pokemon White Version 2 Game Reviewed <p> I think its safe to say at this point that PokTmon has a pretty decent following in the world of video gaming entertainment . The first generation of the long-running catch-em-all saga sold upwards of twenty million copies worldwide and fast-forwarding to 2012 , Pokemon Black and Whites total copies sold is a number that approaches fifteen million , and to this very day I can occasionally be caught sneaking in an hour or two of PokTmon Blue on my perfectly-preserved Gameboy Colour . The game possesses a longevity that PokTmon fans simply can not shake , and why would they want to ? With the ( relatively ) recent release of PokTmon White Version 2 , the very specific world of PokTmon fandom can breathe once again after holding its breath for so very long . We now have a game on our hands that claims to be a direct sequel of the previous and asserts that we have a new adventure on our hands . I 've accrued a frankly embarrassing number of gameplay hours on many PokTmon titles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these hours being on White Version 2 , so I feel inclined to pop down a few opinions about the game in word form for your perusal for anyone who is interested ; for those of you who could n't care less , Ive given you a piece of writing that you can make a point of actively ignoring . Either way , everybody wins . Now , let 's talk PokTmon . <p> A familiar sight : the starter PokTmon remain present as expected , being one of the many rocks of the PokTmon genre throughout the generations . <h> Undoubtedly , Unashamedly PokTmon <p> First off , I cant emphasise enough how much PokTmon White Version Version 2 is the most comprehensive and autonomous incarnation/embodiment of PokTmon to date . You will have hopefully realised that I did n't  use the word reincarnation here : my selection of words here was wholly deliberate to highlight the fact that while the game is most definitely the embodiment of PokTmon as we have always known it , it packs enough new features and departures from the previous titles to deserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be set in the Unova region like its predecessor , but it boasts new characters , a new storyline , new areas to explore and some shiny new features to boot . Thankfully , we do n't  have another Crystal or Platinum on our hands here : this game leads us down the rabbit hole into something rather different , and anything which may be familiar to you from the previous games has likely been revamped , re-imagined and has generally received some kind of much-needed makeover . <h> Aesthetics <p> A substantial number of locations and their aesthetics have their origins in PokTmon White Version and have undergone some considerable changes to bring a fresh perspective to the Unova region . The most obvious and dramatic refurbishments have occurred with the design of the gyms : the wonderfully delicate and silk-spun surroundings of Castelia City gym make it look like a giant 99 without the flake , whereas the blustery aeroplane hangar of Mistralton City and the grand dragon statues with the Opleucid City gym are but a few further examples of the wonderfully imaginative aesthetic changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasting some challenging puzzles which must be undertaken before you can even think about taking on the leader , and a face-lift to the aesthetics that even the guys at Changing Rooms would find it difficult to match up to . <p> A gym like no other : the silk-spun surroundings of Castelia Citys gym is indicative of the considerable makeover given to much of the surroundings in the game . <p> Before I even go on to talk about the delightfulness of the gameplay , I 'd better mention a little about the elephant in the room ; I 'm referring to issue of 3D , and specifically , why the games werent made for the 3DS platform . It is n't my place to delve into the pros , cons , rights and wrongs of Nintendos decision , since there are articles available on the internet which offer supporting and opposing views on the whole thing , and even ones which suggest that Nintendos decision not to release the game in 3D will actually hurt the 3DS . As far as I see it , it is n't so much of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointless , elephant-like , ugly decoration that way too many people are overly concerned about . Aside from the fact the game was released last year and that no amount of whining or moaning about the lack of 3D functionality/Nintendos huge mistake on the matter will change the situation in the slightest , PokTmon has always relied on its distinctive artistic style , passing up radical graphics changes in favour of maintaining its idiosyncratic appearance that is so characteristic of PokTmon throughout the years . It maintains the same visual style of White Version and White Version , but hits us up with some subtle 3D ( in the non-3DS sense ) graphics which give a dramatic sense of cinematic grandeur which are by no means delusionary : just look at the pretty screenshot I 've placed over yonder . <p> The streets of Castelia City flare up some of the mild 3D-style surroundings whilst panning across the scenery . Actual 3DS functionality will have to wait until PokTmon X and Y ! <h> Gameplay <p> The embers of the PokTmon fire still crackle with a white-hot glow in PokTmon White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphorical fire is the dependably consistent nature of the gameplay mechanics . The game still boasts the familiar attack and return style of battle that has been the mainstay of PokTmon games from the first generation to that of the present day . Encounters with wild PokTmon , other trainers , gym leaders and the catching of the PokTmon themselves are all performed in an incredibly familiar way , and it is in this resolute consistency that the essence of PokTmon in general comes from . The game proudly carries the torch that has been burning since PokTmon Red and Blue , with changes such as aesthetical alterations and slight functional upgrades to the system being incremental and gradually introduced over time , facilitated by the new and improved hardware and dual-screen functionality that the Nintendo DS has to offer . As clichTd as the phrase may be , the core principles of the gameplay are n't  broken , and it would be a foolish risk of colossal proportions to try to tinker with the very structure on which the unique spirit of PokTmon is based . <p> Further separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and expanded PokTdex incorporating PokTmon from times past as well as the usual suspects of the more recent generations . To facilitate the locating and capturing of this abundant collection of PokTmon , the Habitat list makes its debut in the game , and is one of the advancements in the PokTdex which stood out the most for me . This feature kindly informs you of the particular PokTmon that are native to each area , and whether you already have these PokTmon in your collection . Due to the sheer number of PokTmon available for capture in the Unova region , the Habitat list provides the perfect method of categorisation and furnishes you with essential information about the PokTmon of each of the areas you visit . No longer will you have to rely on dumb luck or a quick delve into one of the many PokTmon fan-sites on the internet to tell you which creatures you still have to catch in Route 13 , for example : the PokTdex will now give you this information . This is good news for pretty much everyone who plays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in the dedicated and not the John Mclane sense of the phrase ) who wishes to undertake the national PokTdex challenge . Catching them all has never been such a convenient ( if a tremendously time-consuming ) task . <p> The changing of the seasons is a feature which follows on from the PokTmon White Version 2 , but is not simply an aesthetical feature that is just pretty to look at and to be occasionally noticed as you pass from one city to the next ; it is a feature that actually trickles into the gameplay very frequently . The season cycle dictate when and where certain people you 've met in the game will be , and whether they will battle you or not . A character called Cynthia is an example of this , since she will battle you every day in the spring , but not in the other seasons . The presence of certain wild PokTmon is also a season-specific feature , with some PokTmon being rare in one season yet abundant in the next . The seasons even affect the accessibility of certain areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , allows you access to an area in Icirrus City which is otherwise inaccessible in any other season . <h> Content to keep you contented <p> The game comes packed with an abundance of new content which , such as PokTstar Studios where you can try your hand at creating a series of short features using your PokTmon as actors . In a similar vein , the PokTmon musical let 's you branch out into more theatrical ventures . Fame and notoriety are the spoils of these secondary tasks , and of course , a large statue made of bronze should you find your movies a success . Join Avenue acts as a meeting ground for other players to set up shops and establishments in ; rewards and prizes such as rare candies , Ultra Balls and even a Master Ball . The Battle Subway lays in wait for those who feel that movies and musicals are little too pacifistic for their liking ; hop on whichever train takes your fancy for single , double , and multi-battles , as well as the opportunity to battle over Wi-Fi with fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just one example of the fantastic use of the Nintendo DSs functions , allowing PokTmon games to include more diverse and interactive content with each release , bringing PokTmon fans in the world closer together and truly connecting the expanding community . <p> Perhaps the most notable and undoubtedly the most entertaining of the games supplementary activities is the PokTmon World Tournament . Acting as an outlet for your PokTmon-related frustrations in which you can repeatedly battle to your hearts content , the PokTmon World Tournament is brand new feature which allows you to ( for battle points , not experience points ) face-off against some of the iconic names from the frankly massive world of the PokTmon past . Going up against characters of previous-game fame allows the life-long PokTmon fanatic ( of which there are many , including me ) to relive some of the most memorable battles of their own past , as well as giving the player an idea of just how broad PokTmons history truly is . <p> All of the extra content in the game runs parallel to the main story , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your main game progress , or if you only have eyes for gym badges and the elite four , the secondary content can be ignored entirely . The abundance of content within PokTmon White Version 2 means that the player is unlikely to run out of things to do for the foreseeable future , and makes the entire game a more well-rounded experience , eliminating the danger of the entire affair becoming an endless cycle of battling and catching with no reprieve from the action . <h> PokTmon Through and Through <p> Sceptics of the PokTmon franchise can scatter immediately , and doubters of White 2 who are fans of the previous titles can rest assured that PokTmon White 2 maintains PokTmons style whilst injecting some badly-needed fresh content into the game . There are advocates of change out there that oppose sprite-based battle animations and the general main-story format of taking on gyms and battling the elite four : I feel that this system works to the games advantage , allowing absolute consistency throughout the series and providing a foundation around which new content can be built . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing the magic that is has consistently retained year after year . Undoubtedly a sequel as opposed to a simple augmentation of the previous title , PokTmon White Version 2 received my full support and admiration . I have no time for nay-sayers here .

It had graphics that brought out all the love and nostalgia that fans of Pokemon had for the series . The music was loyal to the source , making every player feel as if they were enjoying a game that was part of the canon series . The gameplay was simple , yet unbelievably clever , showing us all a new way to play and enjoy Pokemon . <p> If that was not enough , the game also integrated a massive database of Pokemon to collect and a very active community of players with whom you can interact , and more importantly , trade with . This gave the original PTD game an immense replay value that could only be matched by the most successful of integrated social games . <p> Now the geniuses behind Sam and Dan games are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all new PTD game that goes beyond what the original gave us . And from the little samplers that they have put up , we have been left craving more . <h> Just a Teaser , for Now <p> For those of you who are already fans of the original PTD , calm down . If you head over to the official SND site , the only thing available is a proof of concept demo . Pokemon Tower Defense 2 is still a work in progress and the official release date for it has yet to be announced . Yes , anyone hoping to get their hands on a fully functional game will be sorely disappointed because we are still a long way from that . <p> Still , there is plenty to be learned from the demo ; little details that hint at all the big features that will be implemented later on are present . All you have to do ( to see what PTD2 is about ) is play what is currently available . <h> Existing Accounts are Active <p> The first thing that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for a login . New fans of the series will have to sign up for an account , but existing SND users will be happy to see this ever-familiar screen . Pokemon Tower Defense 2 will recognize your existing account and will host your save file online ( the same with the first game ) . However , data from your PTD game will not have any effect on the demo . <p> This is great news for existing players since this raises hopes for everyone that achievements and earnings from the first game may be carried over to the second . Of course , it is entirely up to the devs to decide on how that will be implemented , but the fact that it uses a singular account per user makes us keen to believe that some sort of data carry over will be implemented . <p> It has to be pointed out that in the official Pokemon games , carrying over data from an old generation game to a new generation game is not a simple matter you must literally finish the newer game before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is done to help players appreciate the new Pokemon that are available ( as opposed to relying on older Pokemon that have been strengthened in the previous game ) . It is quite possible that a similar rule may be implemented with PTD2 in order for players to appreciate the level of challenge that the story mode offers . <p> In any case , the fact that the login is still present maintains the fact that a trading and community system will be implemented for PTD2 . The only question is if content from the older game will be carried over to this new one . <h> Story Mode is Back <p> While trading seems to be the main feature of PTD , having a coherent story mode has been one of our favorite aspects of the game . In the original game , you follow the misadventures of an SND original character , Joey , in an alternate future timeline of the Pokemon World ( just enough years for Ash/Red to be a full grown adult ) . <p> PTD2s demo story mode puts you in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream sequence meeting with the three starter Pokemon for Heartgold and Soulsilver . As you converse with the three Pokemon , you will be hounded by their duplicates . The match that follows is pretty straightforward : you get to bring out one Pokemon at a time and it will automatically attack the target before it . <p> This feels a little different from the traditional Tower Defense mode that is prevalent in the original games . In fact , the new one-on-one combat makes PTD2s demo seem like a completely different title altogether . Fans of the TD system need not worry though . Apparently , the point of the teaser is to introduce fans to a new game mode , but this does not mean that the TD system has been thrown out the window . <p> Once again , plenty of emphasis is placed on selecting the right Pokemon for the right enemy . Each of the three Pokemon available has their own elemental strengths and weaknesses and selecting which one is the most advantageous against the enemy before it is the key to victory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock-paper-scissors factor as an essential part of the series . <p> After defeating all three duplicates , the new hero wakes from his dream sequence and the story demo ends . While short , this bite-sized teaser brings out many new features that players will certainly appreciate about the game . <h> New Game Modes <p> While it has yet to be announced what extra game modes are going to be available , the devs have decided to let us all in on one mini-game : a special one-on-one match against various trainers of different generations . <p> The mini-game starts off with its own side story : Joey is sent by Professor Oak into the PokeMatrix in order to help him increase his skills as a Pokemon Trainer . In this virtual world , Joey must make use of a limited range of Pokemon against various enemies . <p> The game will recognize and automatically save your progress in the battles . However , if you lose , you will have to start from the beginning . The only benefit is that more Pokemon will be made available the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a pretty common event as there is no way that a Caterpie or a Weedle could possibly do well against higher tier Pokemon you will have to start from the beginning with a better Pokemon as your initial pick . <p> This mode is made even more fun by the fact that each battle is pretty unique one that stands out the most is when Joey faces off against a virtual simulation of the young Ash/Red . In this stage , the graphics are done in 8-bit black and white reminiscent of the original Gameboy graphics . The graphics shift serves a stark contrast to the new 32-bit style sprites and animations that are used in PTD2 . <h> Visual Improvements <p> With any sequel ( and for that matter , any new game release ) , there is plenty of emphasis put on how much the graphics have improved , and with PTD2 , the verdict on this category is still up in the air . <p> Currently , the games main visuals are a whole lot better playing more to the style of the crisp sprites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later releases of Pokemon for the Nintendo DS . Fans will certainly appreciate the eye-candy , but the real change is in the user interface . <p> UI is a major factor in PTD because all the other game content is based off Nintendos official releases . The in-game menus on the other hand , all come from the folks at SND . The original PTD game had very functional and easy to use menus for organizing your Pokemon roster and controlling your units in combat . With PTD2 , these menus seem to be lined up for a massive revamp but just how far is something we have yet to find out . <p> At the moment , the biggest change we have seen is with the attack controls for your Pokemon . Clicking on a Pokemon in combat no longer brings up a status menu that allows you to choose your next attack carefully . You must click on one of the four available attacks per Pokemon to change their behavior . This is all done in real time so it is to the players advantage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menus . <p> Speaking of changing the game speed , the menus for that and for the volume controls have also been enhanced . They look smaller and are less obtrusive , though this may be an issue since new players may end up completely unaware that they are there at all . <h> The Waiting Game <p> It will still be quite some time before this game gets its much deserved launch . With no news of a closed beta test at all , it is hard to determine how far along the assembly line PTD2 truly is . Regardless of that variable , you can expect that there will be plenty of fans to play this game when it finally comes out and you can count us among that ever-growing crowd .

Perhaps the PokTmon you desire had the audacity to faint just before you could swipe your mouse across to your bag in order to grab the PokTball in order to capture it ; maybe you used a move that was all too much for the opposing PokTmon ; the battle might have even gone completely your way yet your PokTmon remain at the level they have been for what seems like an actual eternity . All these are common problems in the PokTmon universe in general , and are not issues that are simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may seem frustrating , these issues are actually very easy to overcome , and I will start where the whole process begins : the capturing of wild PokTmon . <p> Capturing PokTmon in the game is actually a far easier task than it is in the original PokTmon games for the Gameboy ; the way to do so in the tower defence version is simply to wear down the opposing PokTmons health until it reaches a critical level ( indicated by its health bar turning red ) , and when it does so , you are able to pop one of your unlimited supply of PokTballs out of your backpack and capture the reeling creature . This is a simple process , but because things tend to go most wrongly at the time you need this to happen the least , unforeseen events often occur and the PokTmon ends up escaping or fainting ; both are undesirable and render the PokTmon completely useless to you . <p> To enter a wild battle , simply wander around and the map and look for the little creatures hopping up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the wild ; this can be witnessed in the picture below . Unfortunately for them , their time experiencing the freedom of their natural environment is about to come to an abrupt end . Once you bump into the PokTmon you wish to capture , a battle will begin . More often than not , these battles will yield multiple PokTmon of the type you wish to capture , moving one after the other in single file from the left hand side of the screen to the right . <p> Wild Pokemon doing what they do best : wandering around and waiting to be challenged ( above ) . <p> Once you are in the battle , the next step is obviously to deploy your PokTmon in order to attack the ones that are scurrying past , attacking you as they go . Since your intent is to capture , then I recommend summoning only one or two of your PokTmon , depending on how high their level is . Most wild PokTmon ( at this stage of the games development , anyhow ) are likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are in . The PokTmon in battles against other trainers are usually of higher level than this , but we wont be capturing these , so going into detail about them is all but pointless at this stage . As a final note , be wary of the type of PokTmon you are facing compared to the type which you are pitting against it ; if your PokTmon is super-effective against the opposing one , then you are likely to knock it out before you get the chance to capture it . <p> The trick to successfully capturing wild Pokemon is firstly to identify the passing PokTmons level , then to focus your attacks on one or two of them by positioning your PokTmon nearer to them as they move . Using a PokTmon of similar level ( if you have any ) to the one you wish to capture can help reduce the risk of your opponent fainting prematurely , but if this is not possible , then simply keep an eye on their health bar closely . This is where the second trick comes into play : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply press P to pause the game . Since you can rifle through the items in your rucksack and even use them when the game is paused , simply switch you your PokTball while the game is paused , click and drag it over the PokTmon with critical health until it opens up and then release the mouse button . Congratulations , you have now completed the first stage of the PokTmon process . <p> A certain percentage of wild battles will take place against a single opponent , removing the need to worry about multiple opponents and allowing you to concentrate on the single PokTmon in front of you . If your intent is to capture , then simply go about this kind of battle as you would a battle against multiple opponents , but rub your hands together with glee at the relative ease of facing a single PokTmon . These 1vs1 wild battles also yield proportionally more experience points for the PokTmon who deals the majority of the damage and also the defeating blow , but this aspect is covered in more detail below where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sweet nectar of experience points . <p> You can not play a PokTmon game in any context without being entirely reliant on the functional feature of experience points ; from PokTmon Red on the original ( old-school Black and White ) GameBoy to the marvellous internet-based world of PokTmon Tower Defence , experience points matter because aside from Rare Candies , they are your only ticket to a stronger PokTmon who advances in an upwards fashion through the levels , gaining attribute points for their HP , attack , defence , and various other categories along the way . Levelling up is the main way to increase the effectiveness of your PokTmon against others who may be stronger than you , and the following paragraphs bring together little more detail on the matter , while the rest of the guide will furnish you with further particulars and tips on the matter . <p> In the most basic of terms , experience points are earned by your PokTmon during all types of battle when your PokTmon kills an opponent . The number of points earned shows up in blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( +20 , +40 etc. ) and also appears over the information card of your particular PokTmon across the bottom in the event that you get confused about where the points are going and/or are watching ridiculously closely or in super-slow motion . Experience points are even earned by PokTmon that do n't  quite manage to finish the job and have to be assisted by the next creature in your roster of active PokTmon to polish them off once and for all . <p> When the number of your PokTmon that are active in any particular battle exceeds one , the experience points are shared equally between these PokTmon . Because it is fairly unlikely that you will possess any one PokTmon that is strong enough to fend for itself as the only active PokTmon in a battle , the sharing/splitting of experience points amongst your battle-present PokTmon is going to be the principal way in which you will be earning experience points in the game , at least for the majority of the game as it stands thus far . <p> As is mentioned in further detail in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to place the PokTmon that you wish to be the benefactor of the most experience points in the position that is closest to the point from which the line of PokTmon will enter . This way , the PokTmon will have a clear shot at all passing enemies and will not simply be waiting in a futile fashion as he would be if you placed him on the opposite side for a shot at whichever enemy PokTmon may or may not be left standing . Simply put , the PokTmon closest to the enemies point of origin will rake in the most experience <p> However , the previous statement only holds to be entirely true if the PokTmon it initially attacks actually goes on to be killed by another of your PokTmon , or indeed if you enter into the tedious , time-confusing and altogether inefficient practice of constantly moving the same PokTmon to different locations throughout the battle . The way to receive obscene quantities of signed , sealed and delivered ( they 're yours ) experience points from a battle is to ensure a stronger PokTmon is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTmon ; the experience points will be shared between the participating parties accordingly . <p> Deployment of a single , low-level PokTmon yields no advantage whatsoever ; his moves are simply not strong enough in his youth to do anything more than gently tickle the passing PokTmon , an activity which bears no fruit . And by fruit , I mean experience points . <p> Since you will most likely be spending most of your time training up weaker PokTmon with the above strategy , it simply is n't an effective approach to deploy your weaker PokTmon at a point that is away from all the action , or to deploy him singularly in a battle and simply hope for the best ; the respective likely outcomes are that you will receive minimal experience points and that you will be killed before you can do any real damage . Weaker PokTmon that are freshly caught or that have been received in a trade/mystery gift will benefit from the help of a stronger PokTmon to assist them . It makes the process incredibly more efficient if this stronger PokTmon possesses a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily ) such as Confusion or Ember ( depending on the kind PokTmon you own and the types you are up against ; see I 'd Love to But Shes Just Not My Type ) <p> The pairing of the weak ( Shiny Shinx , leftmost PokTmon ) with the strong ( Shiny Jirachi , the only other of my PokTmon to be deployed ) is a sure-fire way to deliciously blue-tinted experience points ; Jirachis powerful Confusion move ensures the demise of almost all who pass him whereas Shinx gets the lions share due to his proximity to the enemy spawn point . <p> Now that you have managed to get the hang of capturing wild PokTmon without letting them faint or taunt you in a demeaning way as they make their escape , you will find yourself in possession of an increasing number of PokTmon at distinctly mediocre or quite frankly poor levels of growth . The only way to combat the unfortunate condition of being at a lowly level 2 is to do what a PokTmon trainer does best : battle the hell out of your PokTmon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the experience points will simply roll in effortlessly would be to grossly mislead you and embellish the harsh truth of the PokTmon universe . That is , if you want to own high-level PokTmon that will strike fear and envy into the collection of atria and ventricles that make up the heart of your victims , then you are going to have to put in the work to get them there . This means battling , and quite a lot of it . <p> Now , you have two options for which kinds of battles you can enter your PokTmon battles into : trainer battles ( if you can find any ) and wild battles , which are in plentiful supply and are by far the easiest to find . The first of the option I will be covering in this section is your basic , run-of-the-mill wild battle because you cant really go anywhere in PokTmon Tower Defence 2 without running into a grassy area where PokTmon are freely roaming and behaving in their own unique ways . Thus far in the game , wild PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the area accessible to the north of Route 29 , in the Rock cave , and also area that surrounds said cave . As you can see , if your intent is to train your PokTmon on a steady diet of fighting , then wild battles are going to be the staple meal . <p> Begin by approaching any wild PokTmon that takes your fancy ; once you bump into the PokTmon in question , the battle will start . The most likely battle scenario is that of multiple opponents of the same PokTmon type , such as a passing parade Caterpies for example ; each one is available to attack and to capture ( should you not already own the PokTmon ) , but since your intention is to use the battle to gain the maximum number of experience points in the most efficient way possible , you will be attempting to defeat each of the PokTmon that pass by . Escaped PokTmon equate to a missed opportunity in grabbing some valuable experience points . <p> Now , regardless of the type of your PokTmon ( type advantages/disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are battling against , I recommend that you place your strongest PokTmon to the most extreme left position of all of the battle zones and that you place the lower-level PokTmon that you wish to be trained up to the right of the strongest . This will ensure two things : firstly , that the weaker PokTmon does not suffer the brunt of the attacks from the oncoming conveyor belt of attacking PokTmon entering from the left , since your stronger PokTmon is now first in the line of fire ( do n't  worry , it can take it ) . Secondly , this tactic ensures that your weaker PokTmon , while avoiding many of the attacks , will still get the chance to deal some damage to the passing PokTmon which have already been weakened by your strongest offering . In effect , your strongest PokTmon is simply chipping away at the opponents while your weaker one still gets a chance to be involved in the battle without being immediately defeated . This way , your weaker PokTmon gets a heftier share of the experience points . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be making unsatisfactory progress , or if many of the PokTmon that you are fighting simply appear to be getting away ( and therefore are n't  being defeated and getting you the resulting experience points ) , then you can involve a third/fourth/fifth PokTmon in order to mop up the stragglers should your other PokTmon fail at getting the job done . <p> Accumulating experience points by sharing them with a stronger , more able PokTmon is the key to levelling up your weaker PokTmon at an accelerated pace ( above ) . <p> As you can see in the picture above , I have recruited my level 18 Geodude ( capped at level 10 in most wild battles , but this is a development ceiling of the game as it stands currently ) in order to stand guard and watch for any PokTmon which manage to make it through the attacks from my Shadow Pidgeotto ( the strongest of all my PokTmon and Zubat ( the PokTmon which I am attempting to train to a higher level ) . <p> Since more experience points are gained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to merely attacking them a few times and allowing them to pass , use of the above technique means that my Zubat is guaranteed the maximum number of points with ( hopefully ) the least amount of damage . You can see the experience points being shared between Pidgeotto and Zubat in the above picture , which incidentally is a perfect visual demonstration of the strong/weak/strong formation of PokTmon that has been discussed . The technique engineers a pretty much win-win situation for your PokTmon , and to top it off nicely , the Geodude on the right will gain some experience points from any of the PokTmon which make it through the first two . <p> Small tip : Because of the often slow and arduous nature of training up PokTmon , entering into consecutive wild battles and seeing them through to the final wave of PokTmon can be tiring and monotonous . In order to make things move at a faster and at a pace which is less taxing on your patience , simply increase the speed of the action ( wait until you have placed your PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clicking the + icon next to the Speed setting in the top-right of the screen , just to the left of the Menu button . Everything will play out as it would have at regular speed , but this way you can whizz through the wild battles and watch the experience points accrue as you rub your hands/lick your lips with delight <p> You may be of the school of thought that was so common in the original ( non tower-defence ) PokTmon games in which you send out the PokTmon you wish to train into battle regardless of its weakness contrasting so significantly with the opponents strength . Simply put , this technique does n't  quite apply to PokTmon Tower Defence 2 . In contrast , simply sending Zubat out as the only attacking PokTmon would result in either him fainting fairly quickly or in most of the passers by simply walking off relatively unharmed ; neither of these outcomes are beneficial to your PokTmon , particularly if your intention is to gain as many experience points as is possible . <p> I mentioned above that the battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common , but what about when this is n't the case ? The other kind of wild battle involves a classic 1vs1 format whereby there is only one instance of the opposing PokTmon and also one single active battle zone for you to place a solitary PokTmon into . These kinds of battles are n't  as common as the others but they happen at a frequency which is predetermined by the games programming . While this kind of battle may not be as beneficial to your team as a whole when compared to the multiple-enemy battles , these solo exploits will propagate an increased number of experience points for whichever PokTmon you choose to fight and finish the job . <p> A solo PokTmon battle commences under cover of darkness ( left ) . The experience points for one on one battles are rained upon the victorious PokTmon as if it were on your proverbial parade ( right ) . <p> These battles do not require team tactics and cycling through your creatures or allowing each of them a shot at the PokTmon will offer little reward . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle is which PokTmon is in need of the highest number of experience points . Provided your PokTmon is a minimum of one level the opponents senior , then you should be able to come away victorious ( as long as their attacks are not super effective against you ) . The main thing to take away from the solo battle is that they mean a chunk of experience points for a PokTmon of your choosing , whoever that may be . Use this to your advantage by entering the PokTmon that you determine is in most need of experience points from the battle . <p> The other kinds of PokTmon battle that tend to occur fairly infrequently in PokTmon Tower Defence 2 but which are an integral part in Story Mode , are the battles against other people ( trainer/gym battles ) or boss battles ( often including battles against PokTmon significantly more powerful than you ) . In contrast to the light-hearted wild battles , battling other people/boss battles are sometimes a stressful affair in which the correct tactics must be employed in order to prevail . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss battles that have been included in the game so far . What I am going to she 'd light on however , is the useful tendency of these battles to offer a large amount of experience points for the PokTmon in your collection which feature most heavily within the battle . <p> Recognising that there is some benefit to fighting in battles with other PokTmon trainers is part of the process of training your PokTmon up through their different levels . While repeatedly entering into wild PokTmon battles is beneficial and will form the backbone of your training efforts , encountering trainers can see the reward of experience points for each defeated PokTmon shoot up dramatically . The first trainer you encounter in the game is Silver , your rival , and the most recent trainer is also the first Gym Boss of the game named Falkner . <p> NB . Fighting against PokTmon trainers or in the Boss Battles of PokTmon Tower Defence 2 requires that your PokTmon are at an adequate level in the first place ; I do not recommend swaggering confidently into battle with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that since you are taking on the boss battles/trainers that you are aware of roughly the level you need to be at in order to prevail . <p> I have found that battling against Falkner ( located in Route 31 at the gate to Violet City ) is a way to yield a substantial quantity of experience points , provided that you avoid the gusts of Falkners Pidgeys , his Pidgeotto and his Pidgeot , which are often fatal should you encounter them in any way , shape or form . In order to actually beat Falkner , you need two fairly high-level Geodudes that know the Rock Throw move ; luckily , this technique does n't  involve beating him , it simply requires that you enter into the battle and face the smaller/weaker Pidgeys in order to siphon some hot , steaming experience points from them while avoiding the frighteningly powerful Pidgeotto and Pidgeot that appear on either side of the screen . <p> In its purely distilled , filtered and bottled form , the idea is to defeat the level 7 Pidgeys that wander around the arena amidst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous amount of experience points from them . The only snag is that you have to keep moving whichever PokTmon you choose to train up because of the constantly-passing ( and usually fatal ) gusts from Pidgeotto and Pidgeot . But with so many battle squares to choose from , you should have no problem evading the gust attacks and focusing your energy on the small Pidgeys . All you have to do is keep in mind the locations of the mini tornados whilst positioning your PokTmon to within the attack range of the passing Pidgeys . <p> The active battle-zones of the Falkner fight are shown clearly here ( left ) ; you can utilise any one of these points to evade the attacks from Pidgeotto and Pidgeot whilst making sure to defeat the smaller Pidgeys that appear in great number . The rewards for this moderately difficult task are obvious ( right ) . <p> Do n't  be too put off if the PokTmon that you intend to train up faints as a result of the powerful gust attacks ; it takes a little practice to become comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to take full advantage of the battle and its generous awarding of experience points . If you happen to faint , you can simply start the battle again and proceed as above . You can also opt out of the battle at any time by clicking into the menu in the top-right hand corner and exiting the fight ; that is , if you can stand the smugness of Falkners victory by default over you . <p> So far , you have been made aware of some pretty useful tactics which should help you in your quest to capture and train your PokTmon to be the best damn creatures that they can be ( to within the currently-existing level limit set by Sam , the games developer ) . The methods by which you can achieve a relatively quick growing up of your PokTmon do not end here , however . When training my PokTmon , a great deal of the experience points that went into levelling up the majority of my collection were derived from Route 29 . Ok , so I did n't  just turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile of XP ; this much is certain . What I did do , though , was to take full and purposeful advantage of the distressed state of the furiously-pacing girl named Zai , who can be located simply by entering Route 29 from New Bark Town and continuing left : she should be worriedly walking up and down , pondering her apparently terrible situation . Upon talking to her , you find out that the cause of her agitation is surprisingly not the current tense political climate surrounding the Izrael-Gaza crisis , but is in fact due to her inability to defend and keep hold of the Oran Berries which apparently exist at the centre of her universe . <p> Pictured above is the Oran Berry Girl who can be found pacing furiously next to some trees of little relevance in the middle of Route 29 ; talking to her begins a battle which can yield some useful experience points for your PokTmon as well as the chance to catch a shadow Pidgey ( day ) or shadow sentret ( night ) . <p> As the main character in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tower defence game , you get the feeling that if something needs defending , it is probably you that is going to have to step up and be the defender . In this case , the defence takes the format of a multiple-enemy battle but with the enemies moving vertically from below towards the Oran Berries at the top ; their aim is to sneak past you and the girl in order to deceitfully swipe the berries and exit by retracing their steps to the bottom of the screen . <p> The battle should be treated like any other wild battle , but depending on whether your aim is to capture the offending PokTmon or whether to simply defeat them all for the purpose of collecting the precious experience points as a reward , you should adjust your tactics accordingly . Capturing your PokTmon has been previously discussed along with the best methods of gaining experience points . The reason that the defending of the Oran Berries is so advantageous is because of the ability of the girl to heal your PokTmon , which has the effect of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation and letting you focus on attacking only . <p> You should place your weaker PokTmon that are in need of experience points at the bottom in so it becomes impossible for a PokTmon to pass without them squeezing out a few attacking moves in their direction . Stronger PokTmon can be placed above your weaker ones in order to finish the job ; this battle formation facilitates the weakening and demise of the offending creatures , resulting in a nice portion of experience points for your weaker PokTmon . Should any of your creatures be a little hard-up in the health department at any point in the battle , simply place them in one of the three zones in front of the girl and she will somehow give your PokTmon a complimentary nursing back to full health so that they may fight without fear of fainting . <p> Arrangement of PokTmon in the ' Battle of the Oran Berries ' where the weaker PokTmon are placed either side of the arena at the bottom and the stronger PokTmon situated above them ( left ) . The healing powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amassing experience points with minimal risk of your PokTmon fainting ( right ) . <p> As with any of the advice in this guide , whether you decide to enter into this battle is entirely up to you . While the battle yields no physical reward such as Potions or Oran Berries ( even though you just bravely defended a bunch of hers ) , it does serve as a useful tool that is available at your disposal in order to gain some valuable experience points for your weaker PokTmon , or even to help level up your stronger ones . Since you can repeatedly talk to the girl and keep entering the battles endlessly , the Battle of the Oran Berries will always be there for you to use in order to gain more experience points than you would in normal encounter with wild PokTmon . <p> Having covered various methods on how to go about gaining considerable amounts of experience points from wild battles , boss fights and trainer battles , it feels like its about time that I move on to the more technical side of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Im surprised that I have n't dipped my feet into these choppy waters of technical detail already , but I felt it necessary to first cover some general tactics , giving you the advantage of perfecting your fighting techniques and your PokTmon before troubling yourself with the actually types of PokTmon you are fighting with . <p> Now , I 'm not referring to the kindof PokTmon , i.e its actual name ( Bulbasoar , Blastoise , Wartortle etc. ) but its specific species/type such as water , fire , leaf , poison and many , many more types that give such rich diversity to the complex paradise that is the PokTmon world . When it comes down to it , PokTmon of certain a certain species and type will have a tactical advantage over other certain types of PokTmon during battle . The most applicable of examples would be that Squirtle , a turtle/water PokTmon , has a distinct advantage if he is fighting Charmander , who is a flame PokTmon . Just as the trusty principles of physics will apply when water douses a flame in this non-fictional world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moves being super-effective against your opponent . Conversely , if you are on the receiving end of a water-based move as a flame-species PokTmon , your day is about to take a turn for the absolute worst . <p> I wont persist in the practise of continuing to force endless numbers of examples upon you ; I simply want to stress that it is this exact principle of differing PokTmon types which applies directly to any battle you undertake in Story Mode . I do not claim to have in-depth knowledge of every available PokTmon within the game , or indeed the individual types of these available PokTmon ; I simply wish to remind you of some of the types encountered so far and how this knowledge can help you during battle The idea of PokTmon type is something you can take into every single battle that you encounter , and it is an idea that can give you the advantage over your opponent , or indeed mean the difference between sweet , sweet victory and bitter , difficult-to-swallow defeat . <p> Your very first decision of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outset is a perfect embodiment of the importance of PokTmon type when battling in PokTmon Tower Defence 2 . The choice is between a fire , a water and a plant PokTmon ; different combinations of these are super effective against each of the others , and this is reflected in the first battle of the game ( even though it turns out to be a dream , the Pokemon rules still apply ) . <p> The trademark of all PokTmon games to date involves the choosing of a starter PokTmon from three very different types ; Plant , Fire or Water ( left ) . The imaginary first battle of the game is reflective of the importance of PokTmon type , with the photo showing Flame-type Cyndaquil attacking the leafy Chikorita , with devastating results ( right ) . <p> The PokTmon I chose was Cyndaquil , a fire PokTmon which happens to an excellent PokTmon of choice when battling against plant PokTmon , which are fairly commonplace in the wild . It is pretty difficult to wander through the Route X areas in the game without running into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , and owning a fire-type PokTmon proves incredibly useful . Choosing Chikorita would have put me at a distinct disadvantage should I go up against any fire PokTmon , but on the other hand , facing Rock-type PokTmon would have been a breeze , and it just so happens that Geodudes are encountered in the Rock Cave and at the entrance area to Mountain Road . Flying PokTmon are extremely susceptible to attacks from electric PokTmon , though I have n't yet managed to spot an electric-type PokTmon wandering around in the wild . <p> Fire-type moves prove to be extremely effective against plant-type PokTmon ; needless to say , my Shiny Shinx and Shadow Pidgeotto did n't get to see much of the action in the wake of Quilava 's Ember move . <p> I feel like I should point out that just because you may own a fire PokTmon for example , it does n't  mean that it will instantly be super-effective against a leaf/plant-based opponent . In fact , it is n't until your PokTmon actually learns a fire-type move that you will begin to reap the rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begins with normal-type moves such as tackle and leer , and will not learn fire-type moves like Ember until you raise it to a certain level . This is usually true of most of the PokTmon encountered in PokTmon Tower Defence 2 ; you really have to put in the time to train your creatures so that they level up and learn more and more specialist moves that are characteristic of their particular PokTmon type . <p> It works slightly differently in terms of defence : if , to use another example , you own a Geodude ( rock type ) and you go up against a Pikachu ( electric type ) , then you may not be super-effective against it , but defensively , you are laughing all the way to the metaphorical bank because electric-type attacks are extremely ineffective against rock PokTmon . Simply put , the type of your PokTmon can effectively be as much an advantage for your defensive capabilities as it can for your offensive game . It all comes down to a little experimentation ; that and a great big chart that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions ( the credit for which goes to PokTmon Database ) . <p> This chart is a handy device which readily displays the advantages/disadvantages that all the different types of PokTmon possess when facing each other . <p> Some of the more unusual types of PokTmon in the game also exhibit traits that are advantageous in nature . Apart from their fabulously sparkly appearance , the other property which Shiny PokTmon possess is the ability to gain up to fifty percent more experience points than their counterparts of regular complexion . Sadly , the chances of catching a shiny PokTmon in the wild are slim to absolute zero ; the only reliable way to go about securing yourself one of these kinds of PokTmon is to take advantage of the weekly mystery gift ( discussed below ) . <p> Shadow PokTmon are also available for capture in the game . Their appearance is identical to that of regular PokTmon but they are shrouded in a purple hue that gives them an ominous appearance . As far as I can determine , these PokTmon do not exhibit any advantages over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn shadow-type moves . These PokTmon are not often found wandering in the wild but can be seen in some battles such as when you help Zai with her Oran Berry problem ; shadow PokTmon do not appear every time but when they do , it is announced by the game so that you can be ready to wear down its health and capture it . <p> As possibly one of the ultimate examples of the wonderful interactivity and constantly-evolving nature of Pokemon Tower Defence 2 , the weekly Mystery Gift is a useful tool that offers you the chance to receive a new PokTmon each week , and is quite frankly a novelty that never gets old . Located on the main menu and accessed exclusively from the Play Tower Defence Games website , the Mystery Gift function requires that you enter a code that can only be obtained by solving a number of clues ( related to tower defence games and/or Sam &amp; Dan games ) that are also located on the website mentioned in the previous sentence . <p> Enter the weekly Mystery Gift Code to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confines of Story Mode . <p> Of course , what kind of guide would this be if it did not offer you an easier way around this task ( which quite frankly sounds a little tiring for those who are not accustomed to putting in large amounts of effort into their flash game strategy ) . The code can be easily be obtained by either searching the internet , or you can also witness its unveiling on a weekly basis on thePokTmon Tower Defence 2 Wiki . YouTube is also a good source of PokTmon Tower Defence 2 information in general , with PokTmon Tower Defence 2 fans across the world posting the mystery gift code on a weekly basis for all to use . <p> Sadly , each code expires when the next is made active , so you can not use any of the previous codes once they have expired a week after their release . Do not fear ; you can still obtain all future Mystery Gift PokTmon by simply obtaining the next code and entering it . The PokTmon that are given away as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are therefore worth adding to your collection . Though they may begin at a feeble level one , their tendency to rake in relatively larger quantities of experience points from their participation in battle means that it wont be long before your shiny PokTmon grows into a high-level creature that you can be proud of . <p> A significant number of the strongest PokTmon in my team are shiny ones which I managed to obtain as part of the weekly Mystery Gift . Shiny PokTmon are well worth some serious consideration as future members of your posse of PokTmon ; they level up at a significantly faster rate than regular PokTmon , the moves they tend to learn can often be pretty powerful , and finally , they 're more sparkly than Christmas , and twice as heavy on the giving . Its like having a delicate-looking decorative PokTmon that packs significantly more punch than its appearance would lead you to believe . In fact , such is the extent of the effectiveness of the shiny PokTmon , I managed to train up my recently-acquired and satisfyingly sparkly Jirachi from level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spanned no more than twenty minutes . I felt pretty smug about the whole thing until I rememberd that flash-game success does not equate to real-life achievement . Still , my level 18 Jirachi brought a quantity of happiness to my silly face that perhaps a flash-game should n't be able to provide . <p> Due to Jirachi 's ability to rapidly acquire experience points , as well as his devastating ' Confusion ' manoeuvre and his delightfully merry shine , he stands at level 18 a mere twenty minutes after joining my collection . <p> I will concede that it is a little irritating that your mystery-gift PokTmon arrive with their standard factory settings . In fact , when you collect your shiny PokTmon , they arrive in your collection at a measly level 1 as standard but it is most definitely worth the effort to train them up to a higher level , if only for the fact that they grow up at an impressive speed that will leave your other PokTmon with a bad case of level envy . <p> One of the distinguishing features of PokTmon Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you are travelling through the Route areas in the game , time ticks away and is indicated at the top of the screen . The transition from light to dark is n't simply superficial in nature , however ; the availability of some wild PokTmon is actually determined by the time of day in which you hunt for them . <p> While a majority of the PokTmon within the game can indeed be found wandering around during the day , some are found exclusively under the cover of dusk and darkness . These dark-loving PokTmon include Hoothoot , Shadow Hoppip , Spinarak and Gastly , with more PokTmon certain to be included in future updates from Sam of the Sam and Dan duo . Phanphy is a PokTmon which can only be obtained in the morning from Route 46 ( north of Route 29 ) , while Jigglypuff can only be found in this area during the day . <p> The availability of some PokTmon is dependent on the time of day ; Spinarak and Hoothoot are prime examples of these , and keep your eyes peeled for the elusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your PokTmon for the purpose of gaining experience points , there are most definitely some PokTmon that have a distinct advantage over others due to the powerful moves which they go on to learn should you persevere with their training . It pays to know that due to the devastating power of these moves , you will be able to enter into wild battles with the knowledge that your PokTmon will be able defeat your opponents with these moves with a relatively small number of hits . Because you will be unlikely to require the assistance your other PokTmon to defeat the transient creatures , this advantage results in the ability to acquire a large number of experience points from wild battles and therefore an accelerated levelling-up process . <p> By including this section in the guide , I am by no means suggesting that owning these PokTmon with excessively powerful moves is essential to your progress in the game ; I am also not making the assertion that I am in possession of some kind of closely-guarded secret or specialist knowledge about the game . After all , training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over your opponents is an entirely logical tactic , and is quite frankly the whole point of PokTmon in general . I have included this section in the guide for the purpose of informing anyone who may not be aware of the information included within it ; by using the following PokTmon , I have managed to increase their levels relatively quickly by concentrating on using their most powerful move during battles . <p> The first of the PokTmon within the game that will provide you with a distinct advantage over others because of the moves they posses ( or will eventually learn ) is Geodude . Aside from his incredibly inflated defensive capability which comes as standard , he also has the ability to use Defence Curl in order to increase his resistance to damage from other PokTmon . The main reason I have singled Geodude out in this rundown of PokTmon of considerable power is that training Geodude up to level 11 will allow him to learn the Rock Throw move . This rock-type move is noticeably more powerful than using Tackle and is the move that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of this move , you can enter Geodude into battles with wild PokTmon and simply sit back and watch the experience points roll in . The best news is that the type of PokTmon you face rarely matters ; Rock Throw is so powerful that it can be used against most PokTmon types and the results will still be overwhelming across the board . <p> Geodude 's Rock Throw move makes quite the stir during wild battles , enabling you to defeat PokTmon with only a few uses of the move and allowing him to mop up experience points by the barrel . <p> Available for a limited time only , Shiny Jirachi is one of the PokTmon obtainable only by redeeming him from the Mystery Gift section of the game . After a lot of searching and riddle-solving that is a requirement of the Mystery Gift giveaway ( also known as Googling the answer ) , I picked up Shiny Jirachi at level 1 ( as with all Mystery Gift PokTmon ) and was very close to being blown away by the speed at which he gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw my attention away from the gleaming shine that defines his appearance , I began to realise that using his Confusion move became an increasingly effective technique for defeating wild PokTmon with only one or two hits . This cycle of increased power due to levelling up , and accelerated pace of levelling up due to his increased power makes Shiny Jirachi a formidable PokTmon to have on your team ; just use his Confusion move and you will not be disappointed by the results . <p> Use of Confusion by Jirachi almost seems like an unfair advantage during wild battles ; the extent of his effectiveness means that using other PokTmon to mop up the survivors becomes almost unnecessary as a primary tactic . <p> The above two PokTmon are n't  the only ones which can deal out a world of pain with a single move ; there are plenty of Pokemon that can be captured in the game which , when trained up to a level that is sufficient to learn their specialist moves that are of the same type as the PokTmon , can take down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your PokTmons type in a battle is essential , and can mean the difference between flying the flag of victory and eating the dirt of defeat . Using a PokTmon whose moves are super-effective against that of your opponent means a hasty victory and therefore more experience points for your attacking PokTmon . The following is a list of just a few PokTmon and the opponents against which they are likely to be victorious , seeing you through to almost certain victory in most of your battles . <p> Regardless of whether you chose Chikorita , Cyndoquil or Totodile as your starting PokTmon , you will eventually have an advantage over some of your opponents due to their specific type . Cyndoquils Ember manoeuvre will make short work of Plant PokTmon such as Bellsprout and Bug PokTmon such as Caterpie . Chikoritas grass-type nature means it will learn Razor Leaf at level 6 which will make short work of rock-types like Geodude ( it is also effective against water PokTmon , though there are no opportunities to encounter these in the wild as of yet ) . Totodile will put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a ground , fire or rock-type background . In all , I have found Cyndoquil to be the most useful of all the starting PokTmon ; Ember seems to prevail during many wild battles , and is moderately effective against most PokTmon , regardless of type . With PokTmon being such a diverse game , however , there are many other PokTmon available to you that can take advantage of these type-advantages . <p> Whether you fancy capturing a few Geodudes or simply ruining the days of rock , ground or water PokTmon , Bellsprout is an essential weapon in your PokTmon arsenal . Its Vine Whip is one of the few moves that are super effective against rock PokTmon , particularly if you have chosen Cyndoquil as your starting PokTmon , who is quite the useless appendage when battling against rock types . Additionally , with its ability to learn Sleep Powder at level thirteen , Bellsprout can provide a tactical advantage if it is included in your team ; using Bellsprout to inflict status afflictions on passing PokTmon in order to halt their movement during a battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour . <p> While this ghost-type PokTmon wont be winning any awards for its shattering attacking moves , it certainly knows how to hold its own in terms of defence . With its special ability known as Levitate , it is resistant to all ground-type moves and takes minimal damage from other types , if any whatsoever . Its imperviousness to attacks from all but Ghost , Poison and Bug PokTmon makes it a sensible choice to have in your collection to be called upon should the situation arise . <p> Such formidable defensive ability is certain to make up for its lack of sufficiently powerful attacking moves ; these are sure to be added when the soft cap in the game is lifted ( the soft cap is explained in the blog as being the level at which PokTmon cease to learn moves by levelling up ) . Though the soft cap is currently set to level 12 , it is due to be raised to 14 in the near future ; when the wondrous day arrives that the level cap is raised to 20 , Gastly will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly would have something to fear . <p> Once upon a time I entered the weekly Mystery Gift code and made my way to the online PokTcenter in order to receive the spoils of my efforts ( which involved googling the code and clicking on the relevant results ; it was a busy day for me ) ; I was greeted with none other than a Shiny Shinx , which I then collected , sent to my profile and in my naive foolishness , left to gather dust in the PokTstorage section of my game profile . <p> It was n't until today that I realised what a catastrophic error in judgement I had made ; after dusting him off and entering him into my collection at an infantile level 1 , he now stands at level 20 ( after quashing his multiple attempts to evolve ) and at the head of my PokTmon team . I am not issuing these complimentary words merely because he is shiny ; I enjoy a shiny object as much as the next man lacking in an attention span , but these words of flattery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that I should offer these words in order to prevent anyone reading this from making the same mistake as I did . In contrast to being sniffed at and discarded , Shinx should be a PokTmon that is treasured , admired and dare I say it , worshipped . Perhaps that latter display of appreciation is a little too extreme ( I am treading through dangerous territory by suggesting that fictional creatures should be worshipped as if it were a deity or supreme being ) , but it is only because of Shinxs extremely useful properties and fearsome battling attributes that I am being so extravagant with my use of excessively superlative imagery in the first place . <p> An electric type PokTmon that looks as cute as the fluffiest of buttons , Shinx ( who is only comes in Shiny form in PokTmon Tower Defence 2 ) is a PokTmon that aside from its ability to level up at an accelerated pace - initially does n't  stand out from the crowd . Before level 13 , it only possesses normal-type moves such as Tackle and Leer , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a electrical move that at this early stage simply charges Shinx up for an electrical attacking manoeuvre that it does n't  yet possess . At level 13 , however , Shinx learns Spark : this milestone is where my opinion of the little fellow changed dramatically . <p> The abundance of Pidgeys in Route 29 and Route 30 allows you to use Shinxs super-effectiveness against flying PokTmon in wild battles : you will be surprised at how quickly he will gain experience points by being deployed as the sole PokTmon in these battles . Using Charge to increase the power of his Spark move allows you to take down flying PokTmon in one hit , occasionally requiring two just to be sure . <p> Perhaps the most gleaming testament to Shinxs effectiveness is his ability to single-handedly defeat Falkner without the help of another PokTmon , and all this achieved in less time than it took two Geodudes to take him down by attacking him simultaneously . By using his Charge move before using any attacking manoeuvres , the effectiveness of his Spark move is increased substantially , thereby becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can take on a level 25 Pidgeotto and a Level 30 Pidgeot single-handedly . The likelihood of electrically-induced paralysis in his victims also reduces the frequency at which his opponents are able to perform any moves ( this phenomenon is most obvious observed when battling against Falkner ) , which effectively blunts the attacking power of both his Pidgeotto and Pidgeot to such an extent that the battle becomes easy to the point of ridiculousness . <p> Shinx makes light work of Pidgeotto with a combination of the Leer , Charge and Spark moves ; the same techniques are applied to Pidgeot whose frequent paralysis as a result of the electrical attacks cause Falkner to watch in nothing less than horror as his swathes of PokTmon are taken apart by a single , sparkly foe . So much for his pre-battle smack talk . <p> Shinxs passive abilities also add to his overwhelming effectiveness in battles against flying PokTmon , as well as his considerable capabilities in handling pretty much all wild PokTmon battles you are likely to come across ( with the exception of battles against ground-type PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking stats by one , effectively making impotent their attacking power against you , whereas Rivalry will deal more damage to an opponent of the same gender . Using these abilities ( Intimidate in particular is an effective one ) will see that a majority of your opponents simply wont stand a chance against you . <p> Use Shinx as a secondary soldier in your efforts to level up a weaker/more vulnerable PokTmon : Wild battles against the plentiful Pidgeys in Routes 29 and 30 can become a nutritious ( even delicious ) source of experience points for your lower-level PokTmon . Simply deploy your weaker PokTmon to the far left and Shinx to the right of this one ; this way , your weaker PokTmon can squeeze off a few moves while Shinx finishes them off as they pass , creating an unstoppable duo of devastation with a knack for levelling up . <p> Shinx has been instrumental in the speedy levelling up of my PokTmon team : Spearow gets first dibs on the passing victims while the shiny , high-voltage feline mops up the survivors . The ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had my way , I would continue this already-lengthy soliloquy regarding my thoughts and feelings about Shinx as a PokTmon and indeed as a distracting , shiny object that catches your eye like the reflection from a raindrop atop an increasingly auburn leaf in the autumn . Sadly , I shall end my praises here , but leave you with one last reminder that with Shinx in your possession , you have the potential to create an almost unbeatable PokTmon team . <p> Now , before you become agitated and raise your imaginary hand to grab my attention and point out to me that Spearow is n't by any means a fearsome , difficult-to-defeat and all-powerful PokTmon that belongs in any lists of the Top X PokTmon kind , I would like to say that this is not the inference that I am making by including him in this list . His presence here is simply because of the delightful assortment of moves he goes on to learn as he grows , the different type of the moves that he acquires and more importantly the effectiveness of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starting with a modest collection of moves consisting of Peck and Growl , Spearow will go on to learn Leer ( level 5 ) , Fury Attack ( level 9 ) and the dark-type move Pursuit at level 13 . This set of move proves to be an extremely useful combination to wear down PokTmon of various types . I made sure to replace Growl with Leer when he came to learn it because it is an altogether more useful move . <p> Being of the flying-persuasion , Spearow is extremely effective against Grass , Fighting and Bug-type Pokemon ; this can be witnessed when using Peck and simply watching the Caterpies and Bellsprouts reel accordingly . Fury attack is a normal-type move but deals out a fair bit of damage as well ; Pursuit is a dark-type move , is super-effective against Psychic and Ghost PokTmon ( bad news for Gastly ) and serves to inflict double damage on PokTmon of any kind as long as their speed stats are inferior to yours . Add Leer into the mix as a way of lowering your opponents defences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list is perfectly justified . <p> Now I know for a fact that there will be opinions that fall on directly the opposite side of the Pro-Rattata fence , and this is understandable . After all , there is n't all that much that is special about Rattata , and his moves are rarely super-effective against most of the PokTmon that can be found thus far in the game . It cant hurt to have a Rattata at your disposal , however , since he is another PokTmon that is similar to Spearow in this respect in that he possesses largely normal-type moves but goes on to learn Bite which is another attack of the dark variety . Occasionally opponents will flinch at this attack and as a result will neglect to take their turn in attacking you . His combination of Quick Attack , Bite , and tackle make for an effective combination of moves against most types of foe , while Focus Energy ( learnt at level 7 ) increases the likelihood of a critical hit . <p> This combination of moves makes Rattata a solid , all-round PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiting game for the soft cap in the game to be raised to level 16 and he will be able to learn Hyper Fang ; PokTmon will soon cower in the face of this tiny rodent as a result and it will be well worth the wait . <p> Obtained during the daytime from the Battle of the Oran Berries with Zai ( the Dark Pidgey will appear a small percentage of the time at the end of the battle when all the other PokTmon have been defeated ) , this PokTmon does n't  really have any overwhelming advantage over many of the foes that have been encountered thus far during PokTmon Tower Defence 2 . In light of this , you may question why I have singled this PokTmon out from the crowd with no less than multiple-space separation from the main body of text and bold typeface . I had no hesitation including Dark Pidgey because he has formed a significant part of my attacking team and has continued to remain there , standing shoulder to shoulder with my Shiny Shinx and Jirachi in its attacking capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with overwhelming battle-confidence , Dark Pidgeotto is as formidable an opponent as you will come across ( at least in PokTmon Tower Defence 2 , anyhow ) , and its choice of three abilities will give you extra advantages along the way . <p> Pidgey does not offer the fantastically damaging attacking power of Shiny Shinx or Shiny Jirachi , however . In fact , its moves are fairly unremarkable , starting with Tackle , learning sand attack at level 5 , Gust at level 9 and Quick Attack at level 13 ; it is simply a case of training him up through the levels and watching his power grow . I allowed him to evolve into Pidgeotto and he is currently at level 21 ( though bear in mind the area-dependant level caps within the game ) In most wild battles , he can act as the PokTmon who mops up the survivors on the extreme right of the screen , or he can take on most PokTmon alone with the combination of Quick Attack , Gust and Tackle ; just pop him into the battle and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday party of a disappointed child . <p> Though I have already craftily included a section that covers the starting PokTmon , I feel that Cyndaquil and his evolved form of Quileva deserve singling out because of the effectiveness of fire PokTmon against Bug and Plant-types . This reasoning may seem like a Duh , Obviously ! statement of the blindingly apparent to most PokTmon fans , but this does not detract from the fact that quite a few wild PokTmon you face in the wild ( the defeat of which will gain you experience points in order to level up your precious little creatures ) will be of the Bug/Plant/Grass type such as Caterpie/Weedle ( depending on whether you are playing Gold or Silver version ) , Metapod/Kakuna ( again , version- dependent ) and Bellsprout . <p> You will find that your battles against these Bug , Grass and Plant types will run much more smoothly with Cyndaquil/Quileva using his Ember attack , which is super effective against these types and may also lead to your opponents suffering from a repeatedly-damaging burn , a status ailment that repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be burned . <p> Ok , so Caterpie does n't  exactly look like a fearsome PokTmon , and in all fairness , his moves are also lacking the qualities of an effective attacking PokTmon as well . I 'm talking qualities such as power , speed , and generally the ability to be able to have any kind of lasting impact on a battle whatsoever . Train Caterpie up a few levels , however , and you will begin to see his potential : after evolving into his transitional and infinitely-useless Metapod stage at level 7 , you will learn Harden ( this is a defence-strengthening move that you should definitely hold on to ) and perhaps think nothing more of him . Further pursuit of his training up to level 10 will yield favourable results that make your investment of time and effort into Caterpie a worthwhile endeavour . <p> Your choice of moves may vary but Butterfree has the potential to be the possessor of moves of the Psychic , Normal and Grass type-set ; it 's a long way from the poor excuse for a PokTmon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confusion ( the move which makes Butterfree such an effective PokTmon to possess ) , and through levels 12 , 13 and 14 you will have the opportunity to learn Poison Powder , Stun Spore and Sleep Power ; the choice is up to you , but regardless of your selection , Butterfree is now a PokTmon that can pretty much devastate all who should fall into his attack range . <p> With his combination of Harden ( to be used for defensive purposes ) and Confusion ( a powerful attack which can deal considerable damage to PokTmon of most types ) , Butterfree can be used in all battles to inflict damage , give backup to your weaker PokTmon or simply deployed and set to Confusion in order to collect large numbers of experience points . My personal favourite attacking formation is the combination of Butterfree and Jirachi ; with both PokTmon set to attack with Confusion , the PokTmon caught in their wake begin to regret waking up that morning since for them , it was definitely on the wrong side of the PokTball . <p> Wild PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Butterfree and Shiny Jirachi ; doubling up with ' Confusion ' may seem excessive , but it makes for a speedy system of training and a whole lot of success in your battling enterprise . <p> If the tough life of a Pokemon trainer does n't  appeal to you , then you always have the option of getting involved with a little bit of insider trading . Now , I am not referring to the act of trading stocks and bonds facilitated by the possession of privileged information , since this would make absolutely no sense in the context of PokTmon ; I am in fact referring to the practice of entering your PokTmon into the trading section of the PokTcenter in order to swap said PokTmon for one that another player is equally as willing to relinquish , should one of yours catch his or her eye that is . The system also works in the opposite direction whereby you can facilitate a trade if you see a PokTmon out there that you simply must have in your collection . <p> There are several advantages to finagling yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can set the parameters of the search for your trade by selecting which PokTmon you desire along with a range of filters such as its gender and type . Far from the tedious process of wandering about in the wild and catching a weak version of the PokTmon you desire , trading is a relatively simple affair if you happen to own a PokTmon that someone else desires ; you simply enter your trade request in the PokTcenter trading section and wait for a response . You can also obtain a code upon making one of your PokTmon available for a trade ; this allows you to direct your trade to a particular person , or indeed makes it possible to post onto the boards of your favourite PokTmon forum . As you can see , your options are very much open . <p> Should your trade be met with a positive response from a willing swapping enthusiast then proceedings can do what they do best and proceed ; your PokTmon will be dropped off into your profile for you to collect . You can also browse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request trade link . <p> As well as being much more convenient than wandering around looking for PokTmon to catch in the wild , the trading system gives you the opportunity to trade for a PokTmon of a relatively high level , cutting out the long and often arduous process of repeatedly entering into an exhaustive number of wild battles in an attempt to acquire enough experience points to grow your PokTmon into an acceptably buff fighting machine . Why not cut out the middle man and swap an unwanted PokTmon for one that is already a veteran of PokTCombat ? This option is sure to attract a number of players who wish to expand their PokTmon collection without spending countless hours wandering the routes of the game in search of wild battles . <p> Trading is also gives you a chance to acquire PokTmon that are otherwise unobtainable to you . A prime example of this is the PokTmon that are given away on a weekly basis as part of the Mystery Gift section of the game . There are few things more frustrating to a fan of PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day late in the hunt for the most recent shiny PokTmon to become available . Due to the transient nature of the availability of these gift PokTmon coupled with the desirable nature of those that form part of the weekly giveaway , the trading function can be a saving grace for anyone who may have been a little slow on the uptake when keeping up to date with the worlds best ( and only ) PokTmon tower defence game sequel . <p> Missed your week-long window for the previous Mystery Gift PokTmon ? Wipe the tears from your face and for heaven ' sake stop crying since you can still obtain PokTmon whose gift codes are long expired ; simply enter into the practice of trading your PokTmon to ensure that your PokTmon collection is n't suffering from a lack of variety or missing last week 's shiny giveaway ! <p> If the already-rich selection of PokTmon available to you in the Gold and Silver versions of PokTmon Tower Defence 2 still does n't  satisfy your need for flash-based pocket monsters , or perhaps your craving for rare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to satiate then you always have the option of engaging in a spot of PokTmon adoption . That is n't to say that there are hundreds of hungry , neglected or endangered PokTmon out there in the flash-based world that are looking forlornly into the camera being voiced over by a serious-sounding narrator and all with a backing of heart-wrenching music . The concept is much simpler than this ; simply navigate to the PokTcentre and direct yourself to the adoption centre . <p> The time-consuming endeavour of earning experience points for your weaker PokTmon can be helped along with the strategic use of moves which inflict Status Ailments on your enemies . While these ( usually ) non-damaging moves alone do not inflict actual damage and therefore do not yield experience points if used as the sole method of attack , they can be incredibly useful in the manipulation of the speed of the passing enemies to your advantage . Moves such as Stun Spore , and Jigglypuffs Sing hinder the progress of the passing foes and result in your other PokTmon being able to take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass ; more attacks can be dealt to the hampered passers-by in the same amount of time , thus increasing the advantage that you PokTmon have over the enemy . This is just one example of how moves which effect the status of your enemy can be used to give you the advantage in a battle . <p> Using moves which inflict status ailments on opposing PokTmon has the effect of slowing the passing PokTmon , or stopping them altogether ( in the case of Jigglypuff 's Sing manoeuvre ) ; these damaged specimens are thusly opened up to a whole world of pain as you use this opportunity to fire off more moves in their direction . <p> Making full use of the battling functions that are available to you in Pokemon Tower Defence 2 is what being a strategist is all about . One of the features of the game that is often overlooked and most definitely underused ( at least by me , anyhow ) is the handy Targeting Options tab . Accessed by double-clicking any one of your active PokTmons move-list cards at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function allows you to effectively prioritise your attacks on passing PokTmon according to the various criteria that is available to you . You can choose to set your individual PokTmon towers to target fast and slow-moving PokTmon , those with the least or most health , PokTmon against which your moves will be super-effective , even targeting only those whose health bar is on red . This function can be used to your advantage in battle , depending on your mixture of PokTmon and your intentions when battling . <p> They can be used for various other purposes , not least in conjunction with your status ailment attacks ; setting your more powerful/higher level PokTmon to pick off the fastest-moving targets as your weaker PokTmon is set to catch the ones which are paralysed/slow-moving allows your selective targeting of your enemies instead of letting them slip by . Targeting your enemies in this way allows for more efficient collection of experience points , and is simply a good habit to get into which can be used in more difficult battles where even your stronger PokTmon may struggle to prosper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game is a way to direct your attacks to the opposing PokTmon that you feel are most relevant . The variety of options gives you the opportunity to maximise the potential of your active team . <p> Since I have imparted pretty much all the knowledge I have accumulated so far that I have gained from playing PokTmon Tower Defence 2 at great length and at the expense of much of my time , this guide concludes here . Be sure to continue returning to Pokemontowerdefense.net for all your PokTmon Tower Defense needs and look out for updates and other guides for the games . <p> If there are any issues or strategies I have not covered in this guide that you would like help with or any questions you have , why not post a comment below and I will endeavour to answer them .

" By every PokTmon fan I of course mean me , since it is unlikely that devotees to the pocket monsters franchise have ever felt the need for an PokTmon substitute , and if they did , they would probably consider themselves defectors and equate their decision to turning their back on their beloved games to Anakin Skywalkers decision to turn to the dark side . For those with more open minds , or indeed for those who have become a little disillusioned with the PokTmon franchise over the years ( die-hard traditionalists/PokTmon purists do exist ; I call them the original 151-ers ) , Mighty Monsters has got you covered . A brilliantly constructed RPG adventure title for the mobile gaming market , Mighty Monsters takes the turn-based battling mechanic of PokTmon and gives it a whole new ( and copyright-sound ) context , and a whole lot of unique creatures while they 're at it . 
@@121146421 @10146421/ <h> PTD : General Tips <h> Keeping Track of the Battle <p> While it is so easy to expedite combat by pressing on the 4x speed up key , you will not be able to keep track of the battle this way . After all , you also need to see which attacks are effective , which need changing , and more importantly , if an enemy can be caught in your Pokeball . When leveling up your troops , changing their attack behaviors and choosing positions ( like when you decide to change your strategy ) , it is best to slow the game down . <p> Speeding up the game is great when you are already sure of your defensive plan . Whether you are just farming credits or blindly leaving your Pokemon to level up , maxing the speed is a great way to lessen the time you need to spend . However , do note that if a Pokemon does level up , you should spend the necessary credits to raise their levels - they will not gain further experience points until you do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you need to keep an eye on the enemy target - which is usually candy , but in some cases , containers and even PokeBall . The goal of these Pokemon are to take and steal these things . This means that for the most part , you have a chance of beating them either on their way to the candy , or when they try to carry it out . <p> Letting the enemy grab some candies is not a good thing , but sometimes it can work to your advantage , you just need to know how . The thing about enemies is that once they grab a candy , they will move towards their exit . If the candies ( or any other target ) are placed in a hard to defend location , you can let the enemies get to them , have the key items dragged out and when the enemies are near a better defended location , you defeat them there and the candies will be dropped down . Note that this strategy is only good for moving the target items , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still charge towards the original location of the candies . <h> Attacking : The Other Side of the Game <p> Pokemon Tower Defense is entirely all about fending off other Pokemon , there are also some stages where the goal is for you to charge in and attack . In these stages , a set number of enemy Pokemon will be standing guard waiting for your troops - and this is where all those defensive abilities will come in handy . Now , if you have overwritten all the defensive skills , worry not . You can spend 1000 credits to change their skills by using the relearn feature . This will enable you to access any old skill that you did not include in their 4 active abilities . Naturally , abilities that increase defense , evasion , movement speed , nullify attacks and reflect abilities are very important ( yes , even skills like Teleport become really handy at this point ) . <p> The important thing to remember when you are attacking is that the movement of the Pokemon vary . So if you want Raichu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nidoking ( who moves a bit slower ) , you will have to summon Nidoking first , let him gain a bit of headstart , then follow up with Raichu who will easily overtake him . If you send Raichu out first , the distance between the two will be so far that you might as well have sent them out separately . This slow and fast combination is a good idea for getting towers to attack your slower , tougher Pokemon while a faster one sneaks past them all . Also , it is not always a great idea to clump Pokemon together . Be wary that some towers will use area of effect attacks that will damage several of your Pokemon in a single hit .

@@121146422 @10146422/ <h> Pokemon Ultimate Handbook Reviewed <p> When playing PokTmon games of any description , whether these games are the hand-held console games or browser-based games inspired by and based on the wildly successful Nintendo franchise , I find myself occasionally coming up short in the knowledge department . I try not to think of this of evidence of my own stupidity ( since I have vast quantities of other more compelling proof to that effect ) , instead putting it down to the undeniably overwhelming number of PokTmon in the fictional PokTmon world , as well as the fact that there have been no less than five generations of games , each sporting their own collection of main-series titles and spin-offs running parallel to these . The world of PokTmon is nothing short of astounding in its capacity for creativity , depth , and most of all , continuing to confuse the living Johto out of me with its seemingly endless supply of impressive yet difficult-to-remember creatures of staggering creed and quantity . I had hoped that taking on what is easily the best browser-based PokTmon game in existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , but as Morgan Freeman taught me as Red in the Shawshank Redemption , hope is a dangerous thing , and would n't you know it , the creatures kept on rolling . I broke the glass of my PokTmon emergency kit , and pulled out the Ultimate PokTmon Handbook to ease my worries : the following is what I discovered . <h> Encyclopaedia PokTmonica <p> TheUltimate PokTmon Handbook is a fairly comprehensive text that focuses on giving you the rundown on the attributes of all the pre-Unova PokTmon ; information which is essential to pretty much any fan of PokTmon trying to make their way in the world . Of PokTmon . While I found the information featured in the book to be too much of a toe in the PokTmon Ocean in a situation which actually requires full-body immersion ( or another clumsy metaphor of your choosing ) , the books tidy summation of each PokTmons vital stats is something that any PokTmon Tower Defense fan would benefit from greatly in their quest to become the tower defence master . Of PokTmon . <p> Listing each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTdex number ; a referencing dream , if you ask me ) , the PokTmon Ultimate Handbook has most of the information that the casual fan of PokTmon Tower Defense will ever need about their creatures : possible moves it can potentially learn ( as well as the order in which they will be learned ) , the nature/temperament of the PokTmon , its species , and perhaps most importantly its type . It also contains other information that the more hardcore , underground fans of PokTmon will enjoy such as the definitively correct pronunciation of the PokTmon names and their physical dimensions of height and weight ( facilitating the invention of the are you heavier than PokTmon game ) . <h> Put Some Power in your Tower ( Defence ) <p> No , I 'm not great at thinking up slick , relevant titles that simultaneously act as a witty play on words , but in all seriousness , the Ultimate PokTmon Handbook contains a good quantity of information relevant to the PokTmon Tower Defence experience . Even as someone whose dedication to PokTmon is such that I own the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plastic presentation wallets ( shinies included ) , I found myself lacking in sufficient knowledge about some of the newer PokTmon which appear in both Pokemon Tower Defence and PokTmon Tower Defence : Generations . This gap in knowledge led me to constantly immerse myself in the more questionable avenues of the internet and into some fan-sites which felt more dingy than the pure mathematics section in the basement of a library . The Ultimate Handbook allows for speedy location of the PokTmon in question , and spares you the sometimes unpleasant experience of attempting to cross-reference any partial or sporadic data that can be found online . <p> Since PokTmon in general ( and indeed the tower defence games of PokTmon flavour ) is based upon a purely mathematical system of return-based battle mechanics , it pays to know the particular type of PokTmon which you are in possession of , the possible moves it will go on to learn and which PokTmon it may eventually evolve into . Since the damage that your PokTmon will inflict and have inflicted upon it is based on both its level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct advantage in battle if you know exactly which creatures you PokTmon are likely to be vulnerable to , and which ones can be taken on with ease . Knowing the evolutionary forms of the PokTmon allows you to make an informed decision on whether to let it evolve or whether to allow it to remain in its primary form . Deciding which moves to let the PokTmon learn can mean all the difference between a powerful PokTmon and a lame duck . The Ultimate PokTmon Handbook takes much of the mystery out of the equation and let 's you decide which moves to allow the PokTmon to learn and which ones it simply does n't  need : knowing which move comes next is quite a bit part of development of a useful , well-rounded PokTmon . <h> Ultimate is such a Strong Word <p> Ok , so the book does have its limitations in the context of PokTmon Tower Defence . For one thing , it does n't  contain the levels at which the PokTmon evolve and/or learn their different moves . Now , this is more of a purposeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves and the levels at which they are learnt by between the different generations of PokTmon . Yes , the inclusion of these levels would make for a more complicated affair , but the fact remains that this information is extremely useful and yet it is absent from the book . <p> The handbook also only covers PokTmon from the Kanto , Johnto , Hoenn and Sinnoh regions , since its date of release predates that of the worldwide proliferation of the Uniova-region PokTmon in 2011 . Of course , the author/s of the book can not be to blame , but unchanged is the fact that PokTmon Tower Defence 2 : Generations is beginning to introduce more and more PokTmon from generation five , and with the notable absence of these PokTmon from the handbook , the text becomes a less relevant source in this respect . <p> Finally , in spite of the inclusion of each PokTmons individual type , there appears to be a distinct lack of information on the particular advantages and disadvantages of pitting these types against each other . Since the mechanics of PokTmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems odd that a chart has n't  been included in the book for reference . Many of these charts exists on the internet , which is exactly the kind of exploration I was hoping to avoid by owning this book . Oh well , no biggie ; the information contained in the book is still ample for the majority of PokTmon Tower Defence Players . <h> Paired Perfection ? <p> In a game of such numerous variables , the man who owns the book which explains and lists a significant number of these variables in alphabetical order for your convenience is king . This is a quote from no one , and it neither rolls of the tongue nor is it pithy , but the fact remains that the more you know about the creatures you catch in PokTmon Tower Defence , the more of an advantage you will have . The PokTmon Ultimate Handbook conveniently lists the pre-Unova PokTmon , their moves , evolution progressions and some other not-so-vital statistics that while superfluous , give you almost all the information that the average PokTmon Tower Defence Player is ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTmon Tower Defense and the PokTmon Ultimate Handbook an example of pairing perfection ? It does n't  quite stand that highly in my opinion , since the really vital info just is n't there . If another book is going to be released which is to act as a complete PokTmon retrospective to date , one would hope that it offered a little more information at least regarding the levels at which each PokTmon evolve , as well as which levels they learn their moves . Only then could the Ultimate Pokemon Handbook begin to live up to its own description of being Ultimate in any way . Oh and we could do with a PokTmon type-matchup chart that shows the particular weaknesses and strengths of each PokTmon type in grid form . Everyone loves a good chart , and a lovely grid is the perfect accompaniment after all .

@@121146425 @10146425/ <h> Pokemon Black Version 2 Game Reviewed <p> Its a well known fact that PokTmon is like the gaming equivalent to marmite ; you either adore it or abhor it ( though PokTmon does n't  spread quite so well on toast ) . Many people simply love to hate the long-running series of role playing games while those who enjoy them will spend simply hours on end with their Nintendo DS in hand , a look of ferocious concentration on their face and a catch-em-all desire in their hearts . As one of the old-school lovers of PokTmon who owns the entire first generation of games for the original game boy , I approach all generations of PokTmon games that followed with a healthy scepticism and guarded temperament , usually in the hope that I will instantly dislike any titles which followed my precious first generation of games which filled me with such joy and sense of accomplishment in my youth . It couldnt have been more than half an hour before PokTmon Black Version 2 , however , until my guard was lifted and the dying embers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame . That 's right , people , PokTmon Black Version 2 could very well be the best one yet . PokTmon nay-sayers : get out now ; this review simply is n't for you . PokTmon fans : proceed to the next paragraph at your leisure . <p> Titularly Speaking : The Dual-Screen functionality of the DS has never been so taken advantage of . <h> To Put it Simply <p> Should you be a little light on your PokTmon knowledge , PokTmon Black Version 2 is one half of the two newly-born babies of the PokTmon series of games . Twinned with PokTmon White Version 2 , it stands proudly in the fifth generation of PokTmon games and takes place in the Unova region of the Pokemon universe , which possesses its very own collection of PokTmon as well as incorporating many of the creatures from the previous generations of games to create a diverse and challenging collection of creatures for PokTmon fans to aim their PokTballs at . Catching them all wont be easy , but the game makes sure that you will have shed loads of fun whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly successful wandering RPG format that has formed the basis of every single PokTmon game to date : the catching , training and battling of your PokTmon remains integral to the gameplay , while the task of taking on gym leaders and facing off with the misguided protagonists of Team Plasma gives your adventure the direction and purpose that every game needs . Wandering the land and putting the role into Role-Playing Game , you are given the opportunity to name and take charge of your main character and guide him through the Unova region as you enter into encounters with wild PokTmon , take on a multitude of challenging trainer battles in a variety of different formats and attempt to expose and overcome the mischievous shenanigans of the comically persistent Team Plasma . It is a very successful format that has formed the basis the PokTmon series since its conception , and it is one which makes entertainment for hours on end inevitability . <p> If , like me , your scepticism about this most recent title of the PokTmon series stems from the relative lack of interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing to fear : prior knowledge is not a requirement of the game , since the introduction confidently lays down the missing pieces from two year gap between the games while everything else you need to know is explained to you by various helpful characters that you encounter in the game . PokTmon Black Version 2 is for all intents and purposes a largely self-contained unit which rarely requires the player to possess an in-depth knowledge of previous events , which will set extremely well with newcomers to the game , and will simply mean some dismissive skimming over text for those who are already familiar with the whole affair . <h> Gameplay <p> It is safe to say that the fantastic ladies and gentleman that are responsible for the creation of PokTmon are pretty steadfast in their PokTmon ways : if one were to put PokTmon Red ( from the first generation of games ) directly next to this title for some comparative viewing , then you would most certainly be able to point out more similarities than differences between the two . Now , for most games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but PokTmon seems to manage to exist outside of the plane of normality in terms of expectations from one game to the next . Rather than messing with a formula that is well over a decade old and still going strong , the PokTmon games seem to evolve with a gracefully unapologetic steadiness , and a self-awareness that the whole magic of the PokTmon series relies on this very consistency that has been displayed over the years . Catch , battle , and repeat . <p> Past and Present : PokTmon has clearly held steadfastly to its root <p> Apart from the obvious differences to the graphics which are afforded by the perpetual advancement of gaming hardware , what it involves to actually play PokTmon has scarcely changed : battles still take place in the same way , you must still venture through the region to win gym badges and battle an elite four , and you will inevitably encounter the meddlesome Team Plasma with increasing frequency and ferocity as you progress through your journey . You still receive a choice of three elemental starter PokTmon at the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how they have always been . You can still use your bike to get around , and your rival will continue to challenge you to battles as your teams of PokTmon become stronger and stronger . As you can see , consistency abounds within the PokTmon universe , and far from being a limitation of the game , it makes for a sense of continuity and highlights the recognition that this formula simply works . After all , five generations of games that span sixteen years is a kind of longevity that many games can only dream of achieving . <h> Were not in Pallet Town Anymore <p> So what exactly gives PokTmon Black Version 2 a right to call itself a direct sequel to the title that precede it ? Well , firstly , there are a significant number of aesthetical changes to the game , such as the redesigning of the Unova Gyms and the including of entirely new locations in the region such as your starting location of Aspertia City and others such as Floccesy Town , Lentimas Town and Humilau City . New characters like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will keep your interactions throughout the game fresh and varied while redesigns of previous character and locations will provide some echoes from the past for long-standing fans . I was even excited about the redesign of the battle menu and the mid-battle organising of your possessions into relevant categories such as HP/PP Restore and Status Restore ( apparently the small things in life really are the most pleasing ) . <p> Dual-wielding : The incredibly useful multi-screen battle menu has had a re-vamp <p> Expansion of the Unova PokTdex to include more PokTmon from previous generations will have the avid PokTmon collector simply giddy with joy , and more importantly creates a stronger inter-generational link between the collections of PokTmon , as well as significantly expanding the sheer size of the collection itself . As someone who will never quite get over the greatness of Generation I , the past beckons to me when I encounter PokTmon such as Magmar and Psyduck frolicking alongside later-generation offerings like Klink and Audino . The integration and expansion of the Unova PokTdex is a feature which stands out in the game , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past for the PokTmon veteran . <p> Perhaps the most significant feature to make its debut in the game is the innovative Habitat List . This expansion to the long-running PokTdex allows the player to identify all of the PokTmon in their current area of exploration , listing them conveniently in order , and even telling you whether or not you have yet encountered/captured them . Considering the fact that the very essence of the game is the amassing of PokTmon , I am surprise that this tiny stroke of almost-genius was not included in previous games . <h> Secondary Adventures and Sideshows Galore <p> Those who find themselves awash with apathy about the collecting of gym badges and battling of the elite four to become the PokTmon champion will bathe in the glorious selection of secondary activities that branch off from the main stem of gameplay . Perhaps the most significant of these features is the PokTmon World Tournament , which makes it debut in PokTmon Black Version 2 and allows the player to systematically encounter the gym leaders of yesteryear ( i.e the previous four generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inconsequential to new players , but to those who were there from the beginning ( and those who know what I mean when I say Missingno ) , this feature allows you to encounter gym leaders that you were convinced you had left behind in previous games . <p> Further peripheral delights can be found in the pursuit of a PokTmon-based movie career in PokTstar Studios . Fame and adoration await if you successfully shoot all the possible scene combinations with the various endings and positive reviews from viewers ( try and avoid a Christian Bale-esque meltdown , though ) . However , I think we can all agree that the more important prize here is the giant bronze statue of yourself upon fulfilling all parameters of the challenge . If you wish to branch out into the aural arts , then why not try your hand at creating ( from a list of predetermined options ) your very own PokTmon Musical in Nimbasa City ? Dressing up your PokTmon has never been less creepy ! <p> And ... Action ! Even PokTmon could do a better job at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Battle Subway is exactly how it sounds , where outrageously disruptive PokTmon battles are actively encouraged on the carriages of the trains within . Battle points are the spoils of this activity , and they can be used to purchase various items of differing value at the main kiosk . Thanks to the Battle Subway , you will be unlikely to ever experience commuters boredom again ( and in spite of the mid-journey battles , the service is still better than Virgin ) . <p> One of the most inviting features of these extra-curricular pursuits is that participation in them is not compulsory , with the general idea being that you can dip in and out of these adventures whenever you please ; their completion is neither compulsory nor essential to the progress of the main adventure . They simply exist as a series frolicking adventures that are supplementary to the main game , and that 's exactly how I like it . <h> Conclusion <p> Armed with some good-natured gameplay , the starting PokTmon of your choice and the long-burning fame of PokTmon spirit directly at its heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan and show them that it is a game which offers both warm familiarity for the player who is resistant to change , as well as the introduction of some refreshing alterations to the gameplay for those who are partial to a spot of deviation from the norm in their sequels . It boasts a more expansive collection of PokTmon that is more numerous than ever before , dishes out a serious helping of secondary adventures that should satiate your ravenous hunger for alternative activities and most importantly , stays true to the catch em all mentality that has made the PokTmon series of games such a wild success . Far from the incremental differences that ( barely ) set apart the games of previous generations , PokTmon Black Version 2 manages to usher in enough deviation from the previous titles to justify its salutation as a true sequel , while managing to maintain the aspects of the game which make PokTmon , PokTmon.

Although in essence you can spend months waiting for those elusive rare monsters , the faster and more efficient way to catch them all is to trade with other , dedicated Pokemon Trainers like yourself . This truly makes the game come alive in terms of immersing you into the growing community and putting you up to the task of being an ace trainer . <h> Getting Started <p> Understanding the system itself is like a walk in the Pokepark . If you are currently playing Pokemon Tower Defense , you will need to click on the " Trading " button to visit the Pokemon Center . Remember that you can not trade in the Pokemon Center and play the game at the same time because you may lose your progress . At any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use for trading . Upon doing so , several options open up for you . <h> Creating a Trade <p> In the Create Trade section , all the Pokemon in your Tower Defense account will be displayed for you to choose from . This works much like a Buy and Sell listing , only with the possibility of instant exchanges . From here , clicking on one of your monsters takes you to another page where in you can set up your Pokemon Requests . <p> Pokemon Requests are basically the conditions you want for a trade to take place . For people to be able to instantly exchange their Pokemon with yours , they will have to meet all of the parameters you set . Otherwise , if you do not set any requests or if someone still wants to try to trade for your monster , they will still have the option to offer their Pokemon to you . In that case , you will have notification in the Your Trade Request section of the Pokemon Center and you will have the chance to accept or decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want , you may declare up to six particular Pokemon you want people to trade in return for a single one of yours . Furthermore , you also get to set the Pokemon type ( Regular , Shiny or Shadow ) as well as its level . You are also allowed to declare a " Trade for Any " condition in those categories if you have no specifics in mind . After you put in your specific requirements , a Trade I 'd will be assigned to your advertised Pokemon . <h> Asking Too Much <p> Remember that it is not always in your best interest if you declare the maximum amount of Pokemon Requests . Trading a Pidgey for a Snorlax , three Legendary Pokemon , a Mew and a Victini do not make much sense even to new players . The trick here is to keep your trades reasonable . The sheer amount of listings make it tough for people to find any kind of trade as it is . There are just so many unbalanced trade requests that just end up buried and forgotten . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic . Do not expect that a Shiny Pokemon , readily available during the first few Challenge Maps , will get you a monster that has 0.1% spawn rate . Sure , flukes do exist but you will definitely spend too much time looking for something that may not exist . <h> Managing Your Trades <p> Whenever you make your Pokemon available for trade , it will be confined to the Pokemon Center and will not be usable in-game . Do not worry if you ever change your mind , you can always check your listing in the Your Trade Request page . Click on " Call Pokemon Back To Profile " and your Pokemon will be back in your game instantly . <p> The Your Trade Request section is broken down into two parts . All of the monsters you stored in Pokemon Center are listed by kind . Beside its basic stats , there is a " View Request " link which will display the number of offers you have received for each Pokemon . The second part displays the trades which you have requested for so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been accepted . <h> Time to Go Shopping ! <p> If you are the one doing the Pokemon shopping , you can visit the Search Trades page . In reverse , you will be able to look for a specific Pokemon , with the type and level you want . If you wish to trade with a friend , you may search for his Trainer Account Name to display his advertised Pokemon . If you already know the Trade I 'd , you may input that as well . Once you find what you are looking for and if the given specifics are acceptable to you , you may choose the Pokemon that meets the trade criteria from your available listings . If every criteria is met , your Pokemon is automatically swapped with theirs . You may then transfer the new monster to your in-game account by choosing " Send to Profile " from the Pokemon Center 's main page . <p> Though the Search function is not elegant in any way , it does what it is supposed to do . Remember that some parameters are prioritized over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an option , leave it untouched and only specify terms for that particular search . <p> In cases where you want your Pokemon to sell fast , you can always do your homework in the Search Trades page . Want to know if your Shiny Vulpix is highly sought after ? There is an " Or Search for which Pokemon other trainers want " option which allows you to check what other people are willing to give up for one of your beloved Pokemon . Of course , this does not mean that everything listed is an instant swap . As long as that particular Pokemon is listed as a Trade Request , it will be displayed , regardless if the player is looking for five other monsters as well . <h> Things to Remember About the Trading System <p> There are a few quirks you have to keep in mind when trading in the Pokemon Center . Sometimes when accepting offers , there is a delay in delivering new monsters . Often at times it is nothing too problematic and will simply resolve itself in a matter of minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original owners so you may just opt to initiate the trade once again . <p> Another thing to take note of is trade evolution . Since there are a few Pokemon which change form through trade , be careful when acquiring new ones which exhibit the trait . First , check if the trade evolving Pokemon meets the level requirements and decide on offers appropriately . For example , if you are vying for a Kadabra , you may want to get an Abra and evolve it yourself . Abra evolve in Kadabra at level 16 . When placed into the trading system and retrieved , they automatically evolve into Alakazam . So , if you chance upon a listing for a Kadabra , you will most certainly end up with an Alakazam once you transfer that to your account . <p> While trading to catch all Pokemon , you will inevitably come across Hacked Pokemon . Just like the name implies , these are monsters which have been altered by other players to have certain advantages over regular ones . While it sounds like a good thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do tend to exhibit traits that are game breaking . Due to the number of hacked monsters , you will have to keep a close eye on the listings . Hacked Pokemon are labeled appropriately so you can easily steer clear of them . <h> Everything Takes Time <p> Due to the sheer number of variants , the trick to getting the most coveted of Pokemon is to have a lot of patience . Unless you have been playing from the start , you may encounter some difficulty in getting event exclusive monsters . These are definitely going to be highly sought after and hard to come by but once in a while , a fair trade will come along . Perhaps from a veteran player who wants to give a chance to new fans or maybe from someone who is looking for a monster you have in excess . Regardless , be patient . Play the game and take part in the trading community , who knows what rarities you may come across . <p> You should also keep an eye out for easy trades . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but may be for monsters that are more in demand . Keep an eye out for available Pokemon that rank higher in terms of popularity or be rarer than what you have at hand . Like in real life , trading up is the key to exchanging a low level Pokemon for better ones . <p> While it may not be for everyone , trading is truly an important aspect of Pokemon Tower Defense . It is single handedly the fastest way to collect all of your beloved pets . Aside from giving you new monsters to raise , it also immerses you into the ever active Pokemon Tower Defense community . Just keep your wits about you and aim to be a fair trader to stay on top of the game . <h> Why Trade Matters <p> It should also be said that the game is completely playable without you ever having to trade Pokemon with other people . The question is , why ? One of the best aspects of Pokemon is enjoying the great many types that are available , and chances are , you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary types unless you do a bit of trading .

@@121146456 @10146456/ <h> PTD : Status Effects <p> While the general strategy of a tower defense game is to " dish out so much damage that the enemies can not get deep into the stage " , there are some occasions where inflicting a status effect may be more effective than dealing damage . In Pokemon Tower Defense , you will have a maximum of 6 creatures playing as towers at any single time . This means that there is a limit to exactly how much damage you can dish out in a single run . So it is important that players also try to make use of the different kinds of status effects that Pokemon are able to deliver . <p> Poison and any other status effect that make enemies linger around - this is a pretty good and simple combination attack that will have your enemies standing around taking damage while they do not advance through the stage .

Perhaps I need to get my priorities straight here , but what topped everything off for me was the outrageous popularity of the PokTmon franchise . Sure , Digimon had a feeble go at the whole idea , Duel Masters tried unsuccessfully to have a slice of the PokTmon pie , and I do n't  even know what on earth Yu-Gi-Oh was trying to achieve ( answers on a postcard for this one , I 'm still baffled by it ) , but PokTmon has always had the monopoly on the genre of epic adventure RPG involving turn-based battles and the amassing of battle-hungry creatures . The mobile-device platform has played host to a narrow selection of similar titles , and it was Mino Monsters that most recently caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaming purposes . Turn-based battle antics and some adorably styled monsters at the ready , Mino Monsters graced my screen and caused some thoughts to surface from the depths of my brain . <p> Pleasing : The unique visual style of Mino Monsters made has instant appeal <h> Mino-ature monsters <p> Ok , so we 've got the obvious comparison to PokTmon to fall back on here , but in actual fact , the game is n't all that reminiscent of its officially-licensed Nintendo counterpart . The action is based around the idea of a shipwrecked captain whose safety is threatened by the presence of a variety of monsters that seem bent on showing their faces . The aim is to make your way through each of the four island-adjacent areas , battling and collecting ( officially called taming ) the adorable little creatures along the way . Your creatures become stronger along the way since you are given the opportunity to level up the monsters by collecting stars that burst from the enemy with every blow you deliver . Other items such as health and energy are also obtained during battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarding than its PokTmon-shaped colleague . <p> A familiar scene : We 're just 3 PokTballs away from a lawsuit , here <h> A Shortage of Shortages <p> Mino Monsters is n't a game of shortages : whether it be levels to play or the gradual training and development of your monsters , it has quite a bit for you to get stuck into . The levels for you to explore are separated into three distinct islands that are divided further into regions of each island . In addition , it has an Arena where you can battle friends over the internet , and a Mystery island where you can purchase an area to explore with mino credits , which seem to be the in-game currency that can sometimes end up restricting the gameplay should you be in short supply . <p> The development of the strength of your monsters as well as their arsenal of moves is one of the main cruxes of the game . Your monsters can be levelled up by spending stars , and can be evolved through grinding through the levels or spending some mino credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be learned as your monster levels up , which are essentially the equivalent of the moves that your monster is able to perform . These moves in turn can be upgraded to improve their effectiveness , which also costs you a fair few stars each time . If it sounds simple , that 's because it is , and Mino Monsters is entirely unashamed of this simplicity since this is what makes it so fun to play in the first place . <h> Looks Good , Feels Good <p> Almost immediately after the first battle , I was more impressed with this title over any other Pokemon-esque offering available for the mobile gaming platform because of the way it looks and the way it feels to play . The unique artistic style is coloured so vibrantly you 'd be forgiven for resting your eyes every ten minutes or so due to some mild ocular distress , and the battles themselves , while simple and fairly basic in nature , are fully animated , with your creature running up to the opposition and performing his attack in real time . In this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original PokTmon , which uses fairly basic sprites and static creature models and has done since its creation . I was quite impressed when my fire-type Blazel rushed forth to actually perform his flaming uppercut in its entirety and scurry back to his original position .

The multiplayer aspect of the game is extremely flimsy as well , with nothing much being gained from it whatsoever beside a little shallow battling action that seems to be of little consequence to the main game whatsoever . In spite of its drawbacks , however , Mino Monsters by Minomonsters , inc. is a beautifully designed game with an art style like no other , and is short enough for you to be motivated by the light at the end of the tunnel , but perhaps a little too short for a game that encourages in-app purchases for furthering of your in-game progress .

@@121146477 @10146477/ <h> Super Pokemon Rumble 2 Game Discussion <p> Whenever embarking upon a journey through a PokTmon game in general , I firstly ask myself whether or not it is a main-title game . If the answer is yes , then I unequivocally know that I 'm in for quite the entertaining adventure . If the game is a spin-off , I always find myself struggling to accept what the game is offering me . Luckily , Super PokTmon Rumble is a title that hails from the better side of the fence that sits smack in the middle of the good/bad divide of PokTmon spin-offs . It is n't a remarkably pretty title , and it did n't  compel me to perform cartwheels of joy in the street in celebration of my feelings towards it , but the game is based on a playful premise and alternate battle format and I quite enjoyed the whole thing . This enjoyment is to such an extent that I quite look forward to a sequel of the game , and I would n't mind getting out in the open air some thoughts and ideas on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold . The open air in this case is the internet , and it is up to you whether you breathe it in or not : this is a metaphor for reading what Ive written . <h> Better Graphics <p> Even though the general idea is that ( within the confines of this game , at least ) the PokTmon exist as a lovely , collectable set of wind-up toys in order to be amassed and replaced with ones which are of more benefit to your battling efforts , the models simply are n't  that great to look at . I mentioned in the opening paragraph that the original game is n't pretty , and the graphical representations of the PokTmon in the game are my motivation for making this comment , and I do n't  think I can be blamed for thinking so . After all , the PokTmon you encounter in the game do n't  look to be anything more than a collection of polygons of various colours that have undergone a very brief makeover to make them look kind of similar to the PokTmon they are representing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists impression of PokTmon as we know them , with the artist being a young child whose drawings belong wedged under a series of financial paperwork attached to the fridge . <p> Too basic : PokTmon models are lacking in aesthetic appeal <p> We could definitely do with some higher-quality models of each PokTmon that look about as nice as the hardware limits will allow . Super PokTmon Rumble 2 would benefit greatly from taking a leaf from the book of the PokTdex 3D Pro , whose relatively beautiful 3D representations of each of the creatures does the PokTmon world considerably more justice , at least in the visual sense . Judging by the pitiful malformations of Super PokTmon Rumble , they should forget the leaf and take the entire book from the PokTdex 3D Pro , since one of the most intriguing aspects of PokTmon in general is the astounding number of creatures available , as well as the individual nuances and characteristics of each of these creatures . Perhaps if there were some impressive battle animations specific to each move which took advantage of the 3D platform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatively plain nature of the graphics in general . <p> It almost made me sad to see the graphics of Super PokTmon Rumble reduce the PokTmon ( as well as their surroundings ) to a collection of plain , poorly-represented shapes , which is apparently justified by the context of the game in which they are referred to as toys . Sticking the occasional wind-up key animation in before boss battles and telling us that this is a toy PokTmon world does not justify the frankly terrible aesthetics of each PokTmon . I look forward to better representations of these poor creatures , as well as some lovely new move-specific animations in the sequel . <h> Return to traditional PokTmon Values <p> Though some of the core principles of PokTmon are present in the game such as the inclusion of almost an entire PokTdexs worth of creatures , as well as the requirement of collecting them up for the purposes of assembling a team of them for your own battling purposes , the heart of the PokTmon main games really just is n't there . My reasoning for this statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on the PokTmon that are given to you in each area as opposed to the traditional PokTmon procedure of being able to pick and choose which ones to catch , train and nurture into your very own well-crafted battle battalion . Essentially , skilled selection and training has been replaced by luck-of-the-draw scavenging for PokTmon in order to fit the parameters of being a more simplistic , spin-off title . <p> The PokTmon magic does n't  have to be lost forever , however ! Super PokTmon Rumble 2 could easily become a title that would excited the PokTmon strategist if only more emphasis were to be placed on building up a team of creatures that you kept for longer and invested more effort into developing . While the constant acquisition of higher-level PokTmon does n't  necessarily have to be scrapped , a system could run in parallel to this in which instead of acquiring new versions of PokTmon you already own when you pick up their toy form on the ground , you simply collect experience points/power points from these toys instead . These power points could work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being accumulated over time and raising your PokTmons level occasionally . This way , more emphasis would be placed on strategy and development of your own personalised team instead of merely having to rely on the PokTmon that are handed to you occasionally . <h> Sorry , were all out of Complexity <p> Though the pick-up-an-play simplicity of Super PokTmon Rumble is one of its more attractive features , the satisfaction derived from the instantaneous action - which is initially quite rewarding soon fades and stands quivering in the shadow of its own simplicity . While fast-paced action is desirable in any game , it soon becomes monotonous if the action follows too much of a linear pattern : it effectively becomes a victim of its own straightforwardness , and this game suffers quite badly as a result . After a few cycles of entering a new section , exploring the PokTmon-containing areas in each and facing off with a larger version of the regular-sized PokTmon that is the boss , you soon realise that the whole thing is the gaming equivalent of copy-and-paste . This linear gameplay needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this than in the sequel ? <p> Repeatedly exploring similar areas becomes monotonous <p> One of the most obvious ways to shake up the gameplay in a Super PokTmon Rumble 2 would be to include a selection of mini-games or activities that either branch off from the main " storyline or perhaps even run in parallel to the repetitive , explorative procedure of the main game . In a similar vein to the supplementary/secondary activities of PokTmon White and Black Version 2 such as the PokTmon World Tournament and PokTstar studios , Super PokTmon Rumble 2 could include some mini-games which incorporate the real-time battle format of the game with activities such as PokTmon outbreaks ( where rare PokTmon can be found ) or mini trainer battles in which items such as TMs or HMs could be won , giving the PokTmon a chance to learn moves that they otherwise would n't have been able to acquire . <p> Having criticised the games aloofness from the sentiment of PokTmon in general , why not kill two Pidgeys with one stone and have us revisit the PokTmon gyms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyline is already fairly shaky at best ; therefore it would n't take a huge leap of gaming-logic to incorporate some gym leaders from PokTmons past . PokTmon Stadium had Gym Leader Castle , which afforded the player an opportunity to take a break from the main stadium-based gameplay in order to go up against eight Kanto gym leaders . A sideshow of this nature in Super PokTmon Rumble 2 would be a huge step towards making the gameplay a little more varied and complex for the player while simultaneously weaving in some familiar characters to establish a more definite link with the main series of games . <h> Mechanical Failure <p> One of the largest failings of Super PokTmon Rumble is in its overly-simplistic battle mechanics : the PokTmon are only able to learn two moves , with no provision for any truly special attacks , or any super-powered or interesting movements besides the regular-pace dodging afforded to you by means of the D-pad . A sequel to the game would most definitely hold considerably more appeal if the mechanics were changed up a little , with PokTmon having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time into training it , and the movement of the PokTmon themselves being given more variety than the simple directional shuffles which they are currently limited to .

For those with more open minds , or indeed for those who have become a little disillusioned with the PokTmon franchise over the years ( die-hard traditionalists/PokTmon purists do exist ; I call them the original 151-ers ) , Mighty Monsters has got you covered . A brilliantly constructed RPG adventure title for the mobile gaming market , Mighty Monsters takes the turn-based battling mechanic of PokTmon and gives it a whole new ( and copyright-sound ) context , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Snatch em All <p> I do hate to describe games in terms of ones that they are most similar to , but since the concept , gameplay and general ideas of both PokTmon and Mighty Monsters are so intrinsically linked ( and in many ways , virtually identical ) , its going to prove very difficult to refrain from drawing comparisons between the two . Playing Mighty Monsters feels akin to how PokTmon may have developed somewhere else in another parallel universe where actual Pikachu is red and PokTballs are oval in shape : the basic idea is that you roam around a variety of discrete regions set out for you by the game with the intention of capturing the creatures that roam wild within them . The beginning of your adventure is marked by the choosing of a starter PokTmon that belongs to one of the three elements of Fire , Water , or Grass , with your quest then taking the shape of travelling across a variety of territories while building your collection of monsters , strengthening them through battle ( both wild and against other trainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best trainer out there <p> Like Pokemon Yet Different <p> The capture , training , battling and levelling up of your creatures is what makes the game so ridiculously addictive , and its no coincidence that this is the same sentiment that the PokTmon is based on .

Wiping the metaphorical tear away with the figurative tissue of Mighty Monsters , however , allowed me to see that this game is highly aware of how snugly it fits into the footsteps of its peer , and it boldly does away with the mythology that PokTmon is based on . I violently applaud the get-up-and-go nature of the game and the no-nonsense brushing over of any complex storyline elements ; there 's no time for any of that here , so the game just let 's you get struck straight in to the fun stuff . <p> Comprehensive menus and all the functions of PokTmon <p> The battles are remarkably fun , with the types being the main factor in your likelihood of success : water drowns fire , fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The game is very open and up-front about the different advantages and weaknesses of the monsters , assigning them categories such as common , rare , ultra and Legendary .

@@121146510 @10146510/ <h> Super Pokemon Rumble Game Reviewed <p> The land of PokTmon has always been awash with a river of games , ranging from the popular main-series titles which follow the classic battle-and-catch format we have always known , to spin offs of various formats and levels of success : some of the spin offs are quite the lovely bit of entertainment , whereas many are n't  far enough from being ashamed of their very existence , such is their lack of entertainment value that they provide ( the lacklustre PokTmon Dash comes to mind , and greatly saddens me as it does so ) . None of these spin-offs have intrigued me quite so much as Super PokTmon Rumble ( entitled PokTmon Rumble Blast in the more star-spangled territories ) , the first PokTmon title to hit us up with some stereoscopic 3D action of the PokTmon kind for the 3DS . A title of the more light-hearted kind , Super PokTmon Rumble takes some elements of the PokTmon battle and leaves the rest , resulting in a free-roaming adventure where you control the PokTmon themselves and face-off against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed to battle freely . Plus all the PokTmon come in toy form , making this title a little different from the usual spinoffs seen on the market . <h> Premise <p> Maintaining the catch-em-all sentiment but in a slightly altered format , Super PokTmon Rumble allows you to take control of your very own toy PokTmon with view to wandering the surrounding environments , facing wave after wave of wild PokTmon which seem to be flagrantly loitering at every opportunity . Deviating from the usually strict adherence to the format of turn-based battle which is usually seen in the main-series games , this game puts you amidst a multitude of freely-roaming PokTmon , allowing you to face dozens of them at any one time in some challenging encounters that take place in real time . The format relies on the player exploring several discrete PokTmon-containing areas one section at a time , encountering increasingly difficult PokTmon and facing a boss-like PokTmon at the end of each stage that are larger in size and more difficult to defeat . The catch-em-all sentiment so typical of PokTmon remains , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakest whereby new PokTmon materialise after battles to be collected at your leisure . All this is tied together with an admittedly weak storyline which involves some very mean PokTmon stealing the healing Glowdrops from Toy Towns fountain . <h> More Details Please <p> Super PokTmon Rumble boasts over 600 PokTmon , excluding only a few that werent yet revealed at the time of the games release , so there is n't any shortage of variety in the game when it comes to being a PokTmon collector . Instead of investing your time into a few particular PokTmon ( my PokTmon adventures are always wildly based on favouritism of the few with neglect of the rest ) , you can acquire PokTmon like loose change in seaside arcade , and you can release them just as quickly . In most areas , you can end up picking up several PokTmon at a time , often several identical PokTmon with slightly different moves or varying levels of power . Your PokTmons strength no longer relies on you training it up , but rather on the power level it possesses when you pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you find a superior model , its out with the old and in with the new . Sorry Oshawaott , you 're cute , but you 've been replaced . <p> Got ta list em all : your collection can reach into the thousands <p> Thankfully , type matchups still form the basis of the relative damage you dish out and receive in the battles , which is a feature that has always been integral to PokTmon battles ; without it , you simply could n't comfortably give it the PokTmon label . Fire still devastates grass PokTmon , flying-types still fear electric , and water PokTmon will douse the joy out of a Fire PokTmons day almost instantaneously ; you just ca n't help but feel that in spite of these technical advantages , you 're still just mashing the A button continuously and hoping for the best . In this manner , Super PokTmon Rumble differs in only the most minor of ways to any beat-em-up title out there . <h> Left Wanting <p> Your progression through the game is somewhat of a linear experience , particularly when compared to the main-series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of sorts ) , but I 'm not convinced that what is on offer is enough to keep the player interested for a significant amount of time . Though there is a little variety in the areas that you visit ( including the Lake , Beach , Forest , Tower and Glacier ) , the whole thing is still a relatively straightforward experience in that you simply play through a few mini-areas within each region , battling against various PokTmon , encountering bosses and collecting as many powerful creatures as you can in order to be successful in the Battle Royale , the completion of which will allow you passage to the next area . You can even battle with three PokTmon simultaneously in a Team Battle or send an entire posse of your creatures in a Charge Battle Sure , things get more challenging with PokTmon of increased difficulty ( and occasionally a legendary PokTmon if the catapult transporter you step on is shimmering ) , but things remain altogether too basic and unchallenging to pose any real challenge . <h> Redeeming Feature <p> Perhaps one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its few qualities capable of redeeming its entertainment value in my mind ) is the multiplayer feature where you can enter into wild battles either locally with a friend or via Streetpass . Connecting with a friend via Wi-Fi will allow you to enter into a co-operative venture to battle against the wild PokTmon , and Streetpass allows you to duel against other toys and view their PokTmon . The multiplayer functions simply take the most entertaining part of the game and give it a little bit of two-player spice and connectivity ; they do not save the game entirely , but most definitely serve the purpose of making me view it in a more favourable light . <h> Depth Perception <p> In spite of the moderate amount of fun I derived from roaming around and controlling a variety of PokTmon in an unrestricted environment ( something that the turn-based battles of the main series do n't  allow you to do ) , I still found Super PokTmon rumble lacking in any real depth or substance . Let 's just say the graphics are n't  brilliant , and I find myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 3DS game for the PokTmon series , the creatures look extremely basic and lacking in refinement , with the menus and even the general feel of the game being best described as raw . The storyline is as lacking in substance as the graphics are in depth : the whole thing is based on the idea that the healing Glowdrops are being stolen from the fountains , and merely seems like a platform ( and a shaky one , at that ) for launching various kinds of PokTmon your way . The gameplay itself is somewhat entertaining , and includes virtually every PokTmon in existence ( minus a few ) , but this is barely attractive enough to keep me going for more than half an hour at a time . It therefore feels unlikely that many will even attempt to get close to encountering the whole collection of creatures . <p> Its all a little simple : the graphics , storyline and PokTmon models fall short <h> Not Quite PokTmon <p> In all , most players would get a fair bit of enjoyment out of the game as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you will encounter virtually the entire national PokTdex of PokTmon in a refreshing roaming-battle format where you fight in real time by controlling the movements of your PokTmon to the letter . I cant help but feel that there are too many things that are missing , however . The usual training concept so intrinsic to PokTmon is scrapped , and perhaps it is better kept for the main-series games , but the training element is one of the key foundations of the PokTmon formula whose absence is very much felt in this instance . Taking away the challenge of capturing and training a PokTmon removes the personal aspect of the adventure and makes you feel like your team is simply a collection of expendable , interchangeable , faceless PokTmon as opposed to a carefully-selected team . Yes the type-matchups still apply , yes you get to battle in format that is new for PokTmon ( this games predecessor excluded ) but the graphics do n't  adequately represent the PokTmon , the fighting seems like a rapid-tap cop-out and there simply is n't enough longevity in this game to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the original but does n't  deliver the goods to the kind of standard that I would expect from something with PokTmon in the title . <p> PokT-wonShallow , silly fun <p> Multiplayer <p> Multitude of PokTmon <p> Yu-Gi-No <p> Average graphics and uninspiring presentation <p> Storyline ( or lack of ) <p> Unchallenging , un-engaging , unfit to bear the badge of glory that is implied by the word PokTmon

@@121146541 @10146541/ <h> Pokemon Mobile App Game Ideas <h> Pokemon Mobile Discussion <p> Having embarked upon a Google-led search for even the tiniest hint of a PokTmon game for mobile devices , I found myself drowning in rumours , hypotheticals , and quite frankly an ocean of heavy disappointment as a result of my efforts . Sure , I happened upon some embarrassingly poor attempts at what looked to be an attempt at a mobile game that was PokTmon-like in nature . Ok , so there are plenty of PokTmon-related apps out there which cover things like damage calculation , evolution levels , and general PokTmon statistics but these are merely a virtual and colourfully-illustrated version of reference text ; a glorified app-cyclopedia , if you will . I even stumbled upon a few Java-based efforts , but even the look of these offerings had my eyebrows raised ; not in curiosity , however , but in strong suspicion and overwhelming doubt . Somehow my search for a viable , actual PokTmon mobile game has almost pushed the next best thing out of my head entirely . <p> Ok , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A for effort from PETA <h> Is a PokTmon Mobile Game Necessary ? ( The implied answer is yes ) <p> I think that the absence of a PokTmon Mobile game ( not Java-based , browser-dwelling imposters ; if it does n't  appear in the app store or on google play , it does n't  count ) solely for mobile devices is more than a gap in the market ; its a problem , and is a great , big Pikachu-shaped void in the mobile gaming entertainment industry . If you do n't  like Pikachu , then this metaphorical void can be shaped like whichever PokTmon tickles your fancy ; that 's the beauty of using a metaphor . Joking aside , perhaps the tiny little robots out there that are responsible for the conception , production and development of mobile games are simply dying to make a PokTmon adventure for iOS or Android , but they simply do n't  yet have any ideas to even put onto the drawing board , let alone some solid concepts to transform into a virtual , graphical environment that lives inside each and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without your permission , I would love ( or at least like as a friend ) to float a few basic ideas into the wide , webbed world of the internet and see if these tiny robots of my own ridiculous imagining will be inspired to begin work on the worlds first PokTmon game for a mobile device . <h> Better than a Tamagotchi <p> Ok , so creating a mobile game that mimics the complexity and depth of any of the existing GameBoy/DS-based PokTmon games is something that is beyond the feasible line by quite the distance , but what 's to stop developers from taking certain aspects of a game and focusing their efforts on these ? After all , PokTmon possesses an incredible number of features and which stand side-by-side to create the whole experience . What 's to stop a game being created in which you must catch , battle , train and care for a selection of PokTmon whilst exploring a region and encountering other trainers ? You could go one step further and include a PokTmon breeding feature in which PokTmon can have offspring which inherit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complexity does n't  even need to factor into it , and if PokTmon Tower Defence can manage it , why cant the well-funded PokTmon sympathisers at a notorious games production company manage the same ? <p> The game could be set in a fictional region , or even take place in ones that already exist for our convenience ; this area does n't  have to be huge , and the game does n't  have to be ridiculously complex , but simply needs to be representative of the general idea of PokTmon ( catch , battle , repeat ) . Players could catch , train and generally care for a few PokTmon at a time ( as many as a mobile game could handle ) , focusing on the addictive task of levelling them up whilst exploring the small region in which it is set . This concept could be bigger than the ever-pointless Tamagotchi , and infinitely less irritating to boot . I 'm sure PokTmon fans would perform naked , ineloquent cartwheels in the street if this game also had a Wi-Fi or similar function where you could battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan would already have de-robed by the time the game was announced . <h> To Protect the World From Devastation <p> Ok , so Team Rocket were the bad guys in the first and second generation of games , and Team Plasma went on to carry the flame of menacing and downright not-cricket behaviour in the following titles , but if you really listen to the Team Rocket motto ( aka Double Trouble ; do n't  act like you do n't  already know it word for word and are n't  singing it through in your head right now ) , then you will realise that they were only doing what they thought was right . This feeble defence of the antagonists of the PokTmon world is simply a lead-in for the next idea , whereby a future PokTmon game for mobile devices would feature a Half-Life style reversal of roles and have you playing as Team Rocket or Team Plasma , or at least a member of their organisation . <p> Perhaps another twist on the idea is that you could play as your rival from the different generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be suggesting that a comprehensive , like-for-like account of the console games on a mobile device is possible or even plausible ; I am fully aware of the limits of both the hardware and the production process involved in creating games for mobile devices . Nevertheless , it is n't unreasonable to conceive of a mobile game where you are able to play out some of the more memorable encounters with Team Rocket/Team Plasma , with the storyline , graphics and interface of course built around the limitations of the Android/iOS operating systems . <p> Of course , the game would n't have to follow the exact progression of the evil organisations as they are portrayed in the games , but the idea itself is a refreshing concept , and would give the player a chance to become more involved with the shady goings on of the enemy that make mysterious appearances throughout the games . Perhaps we could be immersed into the headquarters of the organisations , be responsible for training and progressing with the stolen PokTmon and gain a little more insight about the day in the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life : Opposing Force , so why not for PokTmon ? <h> Wireless Fidelity Functionality <p> I 've mentioned Wi-Fi functionality being the basis of battling in previous ramblings , but the creation of a PokTmon Mobile Game dedicated simply to battling anyone else in the world that also happens to be playing seems almost too good of an idea not to have already been done . Is there a licensing concern here , people ? Or is it simply a hardware issue ? I would more than happily pay up to four British pounds for a mobile game that allows me to indulge my very sad self into battles with other trainers across the world . The function is of course already present for the Nintendo DS in with its Wi-Fi battle features , allowing players to engage in battles with pretty much anyone else in the world who wants to do the same . Some online battle simulators have the right idea , but we need this concept to translate to the mobile gaming arena . Gathering of experience points , levelling up PokTmon , learning new moves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute some excellent entertainment . This process is the absolute essence of PokTmon , and a game that focuses upon this idea would be sure to cause a stir among PokTmon fans out there . <p> Just picture the format of Draw Something , but with the content of PokTmon and all that comes with it . With Draw Something and the related online gaming site omgpop going on to be worth in the region of $ 180,000,000 , surely the idea is worth some deliberation . <h> Put Away Your Link Cable <p> In the world of magical , airborne transmission of data through digital signals which take the radio waves train , the long-forgotten era of using cables for connecting media devices is being left increasingly to bite the dust kicked up by the invisible sorcery of Wi-Fi . As much as I love a big steaming cup of nostalgia at any time of the day , link cables are now a thing of the past , but PokTmon trading does n't  have to be ! A trading function would be an excellent augmentation of a PokTmon battling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . <h> Gym Bunny <p> Having battled eight gym leaders per generation , perhaps we could be given the chance to become the owner of our own gym . As with all gym leaders , we would need to select from a choice of two types on which the PokTmon team would be based . To avoid the game being too massive , the levels of the PokTmon could be standardised or restricted ; while this could lead to the PokTmon being stuck with the same moves , this could be overcome by selecting from a batch of identical PokTmon with varying move-sets . If levelling up were possible , it could be achieved through battling against challengers , giving you the chance to train up your PokTmon . Having Red from the first generation and the player characters from each of the generations of games , each sporting their own version-specific starter Pokemon would be a great way to appeal to long-term fans of the game as well as draw in new ones . <h> Blast(oise) From the Past ( oria City ) <p> Ok , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , but my literary shortcomings should n't detract from the fact that if a ( true ) PokTmon mobile game ever graces the hardware of an android/iOS device , it would be a missed opportunity to base the selection of PokTmon , the region and the characters heavily ( or even exclusively ) on the first generation of PokTmon . That 's right , I 'm talking about when there were 151 creatures in total : a time of link cables , battery packs and people playing the colour games on the original GameBoy , a device that entirely lacked colour functionality . I 'm more than convinced that this idea would be met with at least some awkward applause from PokTmon fans , and cries of joy from the Original PokTmon Fan Group on Facebook . <p> I occasionally find myself missing visible pixels : Bring back the original 151 ! <h> Team Rocket Blasting Off Again <p> When it comes down to it , what every true PokTmon fan ( who also happens to own a Samsung Galaxy , Nexus 7 , Ipad , Iphone or insert app-compatible mobile device here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statistical source of reference , an emulator that plays existing PokTmon games , or a damned memory or quiz game that is simply dressed up in PokTmon costume ( I see the latter games as a facade for a distinct lack of imagination ) . Every single app in existence which claims to be a PokTmon game is missing the entire essence of what it is to be a true PokTmon title : the ability to train and develop PokTmon . <p> I 'm not asking for the ability to pursue an adventure on the scale of the console titles , nor am I expecting the ability to catch the 649 creatures which currently comprise the national PokTdex . It simply fails to make sense to me that a **26;58;TOOLONG game even on the smallest , most manageable of scales has n't  yet been conceived of and developed for the mobile gaming market . I would n't claim for a second to be knowledgeable about the requirements of what it takes to build such a game , but I would hope that this article will one day digested visually by someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it feels like to throw a PokTball using the accelerometer in our respective mobile devices .
