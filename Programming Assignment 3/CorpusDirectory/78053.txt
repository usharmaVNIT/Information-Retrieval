Instead , you will have spent 100% more on the item than you otherwise would have . <p> Time and time again I hear people trying to justify their purchases to others by telling them how much they saved . In most cases it sounds as if they are trying to convince themselves more than the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are simply trying to fight off the buyer 's remorse that comes from reacting to sales hype instead of intentionally acting in the best interest of themselves and their families . <p> What most of us fail to realize is that the end value of a purchase is not measured by the amount of money we might have " saved , " but by the impact it will have on our future happiness relative to how else we might have spent ( invested ) the money used for the purchase . <h> What Else Could You Buy With the " Sales Price ? " <p> In my experience , the biggest reason we fall victim to sales hype is because we do n't have a written , prioritized list that contains wants and wishes that we have carefully predetermined to provide us with the greatest emotional return . <p> For example , suppose you had such a list , and #1 on your list was " Find a flexible job that is less stressful and allows for creative self-expression .

And of course , one of the ways to temporarily escape that feeling is to do something nice for yourself -- like buy a new inanimate object . <p> However , because you have a prioritized list , you quickly recognize that , while the new inanimate object might offer a temporary escape from the discomfort created by your present job , it does nothing to eliminate the root cause of the discomfort . Therefore , you say no to the purchase of the inanimate object and direct those time and financial savings toward discovering and pursuing a less stressful , more self-fulfilling career . <p> Unfortunately , most people do n't have such a list , leaving corporate America free to make billions of dollars off of people who are forgoing what would truly make them happy , for the sake of small temporary escapes from what is making them the most unhappy . <h> What Are Your Top Three Financial Life Changers ? <p> If you are having difficulty cutting out wasteful spending I encourage you to take some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe would lead to the greatest net-increase in your day-to-day happiness . Then prioritize the list from most important to least important . <p> If it helps , the top three things on my initial list were as follows : <p> Discover and pursue an income source that allows for creative self-expression . <p> Become debt free . <p> Reduce household expenses so I can accelerate debt payoff and be able to live within whatever means my newfound income source provides . <p> In my case it took 5-years to achieve my number one priority , but once I did the rest began to fall into place almost automatically . After all , once you find a work that you enjoy and that helps others to solve a problem that 's important to you , there 's no longer much need for temporary escapes . <p> With that , let 's use the Percent Off Calculator to calculate the sales price from a markdown percentage , along with the resulting savings . <p> Percent Off Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the original price of the item , the markdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Next , click the " Calculate Discounted Sales Price " button . @qwx194657 <p> Original price row : This row contains the original selling price , the sales tax on the original selling price , and the total of the original price plus the sales tax . <p> Sale price : This row contains the discounted sale price , the sales tax on the discounted sale price , and the total of the discounted sale price plus the sales tax . <p> Discount savings : This row contains the pretax savings , the sales tax savings , and the total of the pretax savings plus the sales tax savings .

" <p> When I was a kid , present value could be easily determined based on whether the gift I received was a toy or an article of clothing . It was n't until my first year of college ( age 24 ) that I learned that present value was actually a time value of money formula used to determine how much a future sum of money is worth today . <p> Since monies received now can immediately be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received now end up being worth more in the future ( the future value of a present amount ) . And conversely , monies to be received at some point in time in the future are worth less money now ( the present value of a future amount ) . <p> Furthermore , because Present Value ( PV ) is the result of interest being deducted or discounted from a future amount ( compounding in reverse ) , present value is also referred to as discounting . Therefore , a discounting interest calculator is virtually the same thing as a present value calculator . <h> What are Present Value Calculations Useful For ? <p> While present value calculations are most often used in business and economics , having a keen understanding of PV , as well as having a means to calculate it , are both critical to a family being able to meet their future financial goals . <p> For example , if you were to receive an inheritance of $50,000 , and one of your goals was to save up enough money to pay for your child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate whether or not investing the $50,000 will be enough to cover the future cost of college . <p> If your child is 2-years old and you estimate the future cost of college will be $120,000 , and you believe you can earn 6% ( compounded annually ) on the $50,000 if you invest it , present value calculations will tell you that you will need to deposit $47,237.55 today in order for your investment to grow to $120,000 over the course of the next 16 years . <p> In other words , $120,000 16-years from now has a PV of $47,237.55 , which means the $50,000 should be enough to cover the future cost of your child 's education . On the other hand , if your inheritance was only $25,000 , you would need to plan to save enough to make up for the shortfall . <p> If it does turn out that the lump sum is not enough to cover the future cost of college , or you do n't expect to ever get a large lump sum of money handed down to you , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside on a periodic basis in order to have the full $120,000 16-years from now . In that case you would need to use a calculator that combines future value of lump sum calculations with a future value of an annuity factor . This type of calculator is sometimes referred to either as an annuity payment calculator , or a savings goal calculator . <p> With that , let 's use the Present Value Calculator for calculating present value of a future amount . <p> Present Value Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the future lump sum you would like to calculate present value for . <p> Next , select either " Months " or " Years " and enter the corresponding number of periods to calculate present value for . <h> Present Value Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Future lump sum : Enter the dollar amount of a future lump sum of money you wish to calculate present value for .

Further suppose that these choices come with different interest rates and compounding intervals . Future value calculations allow you to compare the growth of each option against the growth of all other options . <p> A second , and more important use of future value calculations , is for determining the financial opportunity costs of spending a lump sum of money on a depreciating asset ( value diminishes with time and use ) or on an expendable ( value is expended upon use or purchase ) instead of investing it . <h> Example of Opportunity Cost Using Future Value <p> Suppose you are considering spending $5,000 on a vacation .

That is how much interest earnings you will be giving up by going on vacation . <p> Going one step further , you could also determine how much time off from work you could take after 30 years of earning 6% interest .

@@14740713 @3340713/ <p> Help you to see the weighted-average annual percentage rate you are paying on all of your card balances combined . <p> This free online Credit Card Interest Rate Calculator will calculate the weighted average APR for all of your credit cards that have a current balance . <p> Unlike most credit card interest calculators , this calculator will calculate the current finance charge for each card , and then compute the credit card average APR using a weighted formula . <h> What is a Weighted Average ? <p> A weighted average takes into consideration how much each card 's finance charges represents of the whole -- giving more weight to the interest rates of cards with higher balances . <p> Suppose you have two cards . The first card has a balance of $5,000 with an annual percentage rate of 18% . The second card has a balance of $1,000 with an annual rate of 12% . <p> If you use the common method of calculating the average APR ( known as the " mean " average ) , you would simply add the two rates together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15% ( 18% + 12% = 30% 2 = 15% ) . However , if you calculate the actual finance charge for the two cards , you will see that the numbers do n't add up . <p> Card <p> Balance <p> APR <p> Current MonthFinance Charge <p> Card #1 <p> $5,000 <p> 18% <p> $75.00 <p> Card #2 <p> $1,000 <p> 12% <p> $10.00 <p> Totals <p> $6,000 <p> ? <p> $85.00 <p> If we divide 15% by 12 to get the monthly rate of .0125 ( .15 12 ) and multiply the balance by that result , the total finance charge for the two cards would be $75 . Obviously , that is not correct . <p> In order to get the actual average rate , we need to work backwards . First we take the $85 and divide that by the total balance to get a monthly rate of .0142 ( $85 $6,000 = .0142 rounded ) . Multiplying .0142 by 100 and then by 12 gives us the actual average annual rate of 17% ( .0142 * 100 = 1.42 * 12 = 17% rounded ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15% is because the card with the higher balance has more influence ( weight ) on the average than the card with the lower balance . Hence the term " Weighted Average . " <h> Why is Knowing Average APR Important ? <p> Now that you understand what " weighted average " means , you should now have a clear idea of how to prioritize your efforts to get your interest rates lowered . Since it 's the weighted average that determines how much interest you will pay on all of your cards , you will want to focus all of your efforts on lowering the rates of your highest rate , highest balance cards ... because they carry the most weight . <p> With that , let 's use the following credit card interest rate calculator to calculate the credit card average APR for all of your cards that have balances on them . <p> Calculate Credit Card Average APR <p> Instructions : For each credit card you have , enter the name , current balance , and annual interest rate , then click the " Calculate Credit Card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rate Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Card Name entry column : Optional : Enter the name of each credit card if you would like to keep track of which cards you have entered . <p> Statement Balance entry column : The current principal balance of each credit card .

" <p> An annuity is defined as a series of equal cash amounts ( cash flows , payments , deposits , etc ) . For example , if I were to promise to pay you $100 per year for the next 3 years , that arrangement could be considered to be an annuity . <p> From your perspective , the periodic amounts represent deposits , as in , you can deposit the amounts into an interest earning account as you receive them . From my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must remove the amounts from an interest earning account in order to pay them to you . This explains why annuity amounts ( cash flows ) can be referred to as deposits and payments at the same time . <h> What is Future Value of An Annuity ? <p> Using the above example , if you were to invest each of the $100 annual payments at a compounding interest rate ( earning interest on interest paid ) , the future value of that series of cash inflows would grow with each passing compounding and payment interval . The total amount this series of equal amounts would grow to after three years would be the future value of the annuity . So what would be the future value amount ? That depends on the agreed upon interest rate and on whether or not we agreed to an ordinary annuity or to an annuity due . <h> Annuity Due Vs . Ordinary Annuity <p> Continuing with our example , if I agreed to make the $100 annual payments at the beginning of each year , our arrangement would be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I made the payments to you at the end of each year , our arrangement would be considered to be an ordinary annuity . <p> So which is better ? From your perspective , an annuity due would be better since you could earn interest on the first year 's payment for the entire year . From my perspective , an ordinary annuity would be better since I could earn interest on the $100 for a full year before I made the payment to you . <p> So in your case , if you were earning an annual interest rate of 6% on the deposited $100 payments , the future value of an annuity due arrangement would be $337.46 , whereas the future value of an ordinary annuity arrangement would be $318.36 ( $19.10 less ) . <h> Why is Future Value of An Annuity Important for You to Understand ? <p> The understanding of future value , both for lump sums and for annuities , is absolutely critical to making financial decisions that will serve to maximize the emotional returns on the money you earn . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions that result in more good feelings that bad feelings ) , you need to be aware of , and be able to accurately forecast , what you are giving up in return for what you are getting . <p> In terms of spending money , what you give up is referred to as financial opportunity costs , and future value calculations are what helps you to determine the financial opportunity costs of choosing one alternative financial decision over another . And of those alternatives , the ones that tend to have the biggest effects on your emotional profitability , are those that involve spending money for non-essential expenditures that lose their value with time and/or use . <h> Example of Opportunity Cost Using Future Value Calculations <p> Suppose you are considering entering into a data plan for your smart phone that will cost you $35 per month . In order to make an informed decision , you need to be aware of and give equal weight to the financial opportunity costs that will come with a monthly expenditure of $35.00 for a non-essential expendable . <p> If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could earn 6% on the $35 payments if you invested them , future value calculations will tell you that the financial opportunity cost of paying for a data plan for the next 30-years will be $22,733.82 ( future value of $35,333.82 less $12,000.00 , or 360-$35 payments ) . That is how much interest earnings you will be giving up by paying for the data plan for the next 30-years ( of course , your loss will be the data plan company 's gain ) . <p> And that 's only considering just one of the possible hundreds of the non-essential expenditures you likely make on a regular basis . After all , if you spend more for an essential than the bare minimum necessary ( buying non-generic , paying finance charges on purchases , paying inflated prices , etc. ) , then these excess essential expenditures should be considered to be non-essentials as well . <p> With that , let 's use the Future Value Annuity Calculator for calculating future value and financial opportunity costs for either ordinary annuities or annuities due . <p> Future Value Annuity Calculator <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment/deposit frequency and enter the payment/deposit amount that corresponds to the selected frequency . <p> Next , enter the number of years to calculate future value for , enter the annual interest rate , and then click the " Calculate Future Value of an Annuity " button . @qwx194657 <p> Number of years to calculate future value for : Enter the number of years you would like to calculate future value for . <p> Annual interest rate : Enter the annual interest rate to be used for the future value calculations .

To calculate the mean of set of numbers , you add all of the numbers together and then divide that sum by the number of elements within the set . <h> How Do You Calculate the Median ? <p> The median is the middle number in a data set after sorting the data set from smallest to largest . To calculate the median of a data set , you count the number of elements and then sort the elements from smallest to largest . Next , for an odd number of elements , you add 1 to the number of elements and then divide by 2 to get position of the middle number . From our example data set , the median is the 7th number in the sorted list , which is the number 17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find the average of the two middle numbers . The first middle position would be equal to number of elements divided by 2 less 1 . The second middle position would be the first middle position plus 1 . You then add the two middle numbers together and divide by 2 to find the average . From our revised example data set , this gives you a medium of 16 -- which is the average of the 6th and 7th elements ( 15 and 17 ) . <p> Even numbered data set : 36 , 3 , 8 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 22 , 34 , 8 , 25 , 17 , 13 <p> Number of elements in set is 12 <p> 1st Middle Position = ( count 2 ) - 1 <p> 1st Middle Position = ( 12 2 ) - 1 = 6 <p> 1st Middle Number = 15 <p> 2nd Middle Position = 1st Middle Position + 1 <p> 2nd Middle Position = 6 + 1 = 7 <p> 2nd Middle Number = 17 <p> Average of Middle Numbers = ( 15 + @ @ <p> 11 <p> 12 <p> Data Set <p> 3 <p> 8 <p> 8 <p> 12 <p> 13 <p> 15 <p> 17 <p> 18 <p> 22 <p> 25 <p> 34 <p> 36 <p> Median = 16 ( average of 15 and 17 ) <h> How Do You Calculate the Mode ? <p> The mode is the number in a data set that is repeated the most often within the set . To find the mode , you simply count the number of times each unique number appears within the data set . The number that appears most often is the mode . In our example data set , the number that appears the most often is 8 , therefore the mode of the data set is 8 . <p> Example data set : 36 , 3 , 8 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 22 , 34 , 8 , 25 , 17 , 13 , 23 <p> Sorted Data Set <p> 3 <p> 8 <p> 8 <p> 12 <p> 13 <p> 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 34 <p> 36 <p> Mode = 8 ( 8 appears the most often ) <p> Note that a data set can have more than 1 mode . For example , if the above data set included another 3 , then the set would have two modes : 3 and 8 . A data set having two modes is referred to as a bimodal set , whereas a data set having more than two modes is referred to as a multimodal set . <h> How Do You Calculate the Range ? <p> The range is the difference between the largest number within the set and the smallest number in the set . To find the range , you sort the range from smallest to largest to determine the minimum and maximum values . You then subtract the minimum value from the maximum value to find the range . In our example set the minimum is 3 and the maximum is 36 , which would result in a range of 33 ( 36 - 3 ) . <p> Example data set : 36 , 3 , 8 , 12 , 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 17 , 13 , 23 <p> Sorted Data Set <p> 3 <p> 8 <p> 8 <p> 12 <p> 13 <p> 15 <p> 17 <p> 18 <p> 22 <p> 23 <p> 25 <p> 34 <p> 36 <p> Range = 33 ( difference between maximum of 36 and minimum of 3 ) <p> With that , let 's use the Statistical Average Calculator to calculate the mean , median , mode , and range for a set of data . <p> Statistical Average Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter each number in the data set separated by a comma , a space , a line return , or any combination of the three ( you can also paste a set of numbers into the data set field as long as they are separated by one of the mentioned delimiters ) . <p> Note that you can also enter multiples of the same number by entering the number , followed by a lower case " x " , followed by the multiplier ( no spaces before or after the x ) .

They are the PITI to income ratio and the debt to income ratio . In case you 're not familiar with how these ratios are arrived at , or how they impact your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> PITI to Income Ratio <p> The PITI to income ratio is one of two common formulas used to determine how much a lender is willing to borrow to a home buyer . PITI stands for Principal , Interest , Tax , and Insurance , which are the four parts that makes up the typical mortgage payment . A fifth part , Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) may also be included in the PITI figure where it applies ( down payment is less than 20% of the home price ) . <p> The PITI to income ratio is calculated by dividing the total mortgage payment ( PITI and PMI ) by your gross monthly income . Since most home lenders only allow a maximum PITI to income ratio of 28% ( though some lenders may go as high as 40% ) , you can determine your maximum PITI mortgage payment by multiplying your gross monthly household income by 28% . So if your gross monthly household income is $4,000 , the most your monthly PITI mortgage payment can be is $1,120 ( 4,000 X .28 ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is basically the same as PITI to Income ratio , except that it also includes all non-mortgage monthly debt payments . So to calculate your debt to income ratio you would add up all of your monthly non-mortgage payments ( car payments , credit card payments , loan payments , etc. ) and then add that result to your PITI mortgage payment . You then divide your total monthly mortgage and debt payments by your gross monthly household income to arrive at your maximum combined debt and mortgage payment . <p> Since most prudent home lenders allow a maximum debt to income ratio of 36% ( though some money-hungry lenders may go as high as 48% ) , you can determine your maximum combined debt and mortgage payment by multiplying your gross monthly household income by 36% . So if your gross monthly household income is $4,000 , the most your monthly combined debt and mortgage payment can be is $1,440 ( 4,000 X .36 ) . <h> The Lesser of Two " Ratios " <p> Once the home lender has determined your maximum mortgage payment and your maximum combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the maximum home loan amount for each . The lesser of these two loan amounts is then used to determine the maximum home loan you will qualify for .

@@14740726 @3340726/ <h> What is Scientific Notation ? <p> Scientific notation ( SN ) , also referred to as exponential notation , is a system developed to abbreviate numbers having an extreme number of digits and or decimal places . <p> In fact , you can think of SN as a short-hand method for expressing numbers . <p> To illustrate the usefulness of abbreviating numbers , suppose you need to communicate the following number to a number of interested parties : <p> 123000000000000 <p> Scientific notation allows you to abbreviate the above number to the following ( note that the " E " or " e " simply stands for " power of 10 exponent " ) : <p> 1.23 x 1014 , which might also be expressed as 1.23E14 or 1.23e14 <p> Can you see how the chances of the miscounting the number of zeros while the number is being passed around is eliminated with the use of SN ? <p> Or , if you are communicating a very small number , like the following : <p> 0.0000000000123 <p> Then , scientific notation allows you to abbreviate the above decimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might also be expressed as 1.23E-11 or 1.23e-11 <p> Again , SN eliminates the chance of the exact number getting lost in translation . <h> How to Convert a Decimal Number to Scientific Notation <p> Without getting into the underlying math used to convert Decimals to SN , the conversion process is simply to move the decimal point left or right until the number becomes a number between 1 and 10 . <p> The number of places you must move the decimal point to cause the number to fall between 1 and 10 becomes the power of 10 exponent . <p> If you need to move the decimal point to the left , the power of 10 exponent is positive . Otherwise , if you moved the decimal point to the right , the power of 10 exponent is negative . <p> So in the example above , to convert 123000000000000 to a scientific notation you simply move the decimal point to the left until the number to the left of the decimal point ( coefficient ) is a number from 1 to 9 , which in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notation 1.23 <p> 2 <p> 1 <p> Or , to convert 0.0000000000123 to a scientific notation you simply move the decimal point to the right until the number to the left of the decimal point ( coefficient ) is a number from 1 to 9 , which in this case is 11 places . <p> 0.0000000000123 converts to the scientific notation 9 <p> 10 <p> 11 <h> How to Convert Scientific Notation to a Decimal Number <p> To convert SN to a decimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multiplication sign ( or " E " ) and move the decimal point right ( if positive exponent ) or left ( if negative exponent ) the number of places indicated by the power of ten exponent . <p> As you move the decimal point simply add zeros for placeholders as needed . <p> So to convert the scientific notation 1.23 x 1014 to regular notation you simply move the decimal point 14 places to the right , as indicated by the exponent 14 . <p> 1.23 x 1014 converts <p> 13 <p> 14 <p> Or , to convert the scientific notation 1.23 x 10-11 to regular notation you simply move the decimal point 11 places to the left , as indicated by the exponent -11 . <p> 1.23 x @ @ @ <p> 2 <p> 1 <p> Finally , you might find it interesting to know that in building this converter I actually had to write the code so that the entered notations are converted to text strings because the scripting language I use to create calculators automatically returns large and small numbers in ... you guessed it ... scientific notation ! <p> Of course , since I ca n't test the manipulation of text strings for all possible numbers , be sure to let me know the number you entered if it appears the converted result is " NaN " ( Not a Number ) or otherwise appears incorrect . <p> With that , let 's use the Scientific Notation Converter to convert to and from a decimal number ( also referred to as regular notation ) . <p> Scientific Notation Converter <p> Instructions : Enter either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Convert Scientific Notation To/From Decimal Number " button . <p> Note that if you enter a scientific notation , it must be entered in one of the following formats : 123 x 104 , 123E4 , or 123e4 .

And since 1.12 100000 = 0.0000112 , the scientific notation 1.12 x 10-5 is equal to 0.0000112 ( or , you can achieve the same result simply by moving the decimal point 5 places to the left ) . 
@@14740727 @3340727/ <h> Mutual Fund Calculator For Cost/YieldMutual Fund Comparison <p> Explains what mutual funds are and how they work , and helps you forecast a fund 's growth and equivalent annual yield . <p> This free online Mutual Fund Calculator will calculate a fund 's after-expense growth and equivalent annual yield . You can then print out the results , including an annual growth chart , that can then be used for mutual fund comparison . <p> If you do n't know the answer to " What are mutual funds ? " , or you 're not sure how mutual funds work , or you do n't know when and how to buy mutual funds , it may be well worth your while to read the following basic definition and explanations to help you better understand mutual funds before using the mutual fund calculator . <h> What Are Mutual Funds ? <p> The basic definition of mutual funds : A big pool of investment money created by a large number of small investors who combine their funds to gain the advantages that are normally reserved for big investors . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets paid based on the amount of money they manage ( some also get paid based on the fund 's performance ) . And finally , each fund is geared toward a specialized kind of security ( index , growth , income , sector , etc . ) . This means you can choose the type of fund based on your own investment goals and risk tolerance -- with the assurance that the fund will maintain its focus on securities that fall within that pre-defined type . <h> Main Advantages of Investing in Mutual Funds <p> A wealthy investor can afford to purchase a diverse portfolio of securities ( stocks , bonds , short-term money market instruments , etc. ) -- thereby reducing the risk of losing money if a segment of the economy moves in the wrong direction . <p> With mutual funds , small investors can afford to do the same thing by taking a small amount of money ( as little as $500 or less ) and investing in a mutual fund that in turn invests the large pool of money into a diverse selection of securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many advantages of investing in mutual funds is that you can sell or add to your shares at any time . Plus , you can also switch from one type of fund within a fund family ( different types of funds managed by the same company ) to another type of fund at no cost -- and with just a phone call . <h> Disadvantages of Investing in Mutual Funds <p> While mutual funds offer many advantages it 's also important to realize that mutual funds are not federally insured -- even if you purchase them through a bank . Also be aware that management fees are charged by all mutual funds regardless of whether or not your mutual fund investment is gaining money or losing money . <p> For me personally , the biggest drawback to purchasing mutual funds ( namely stock , or equity funds ) is that I can not control which funds make up the fund 's portfolio . I personally do n't like the thought of being a part owner of companies that I feel are detrimental to the health and well-being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gambling companies , etc . ) . After all , where the money goes , so goes the power to influence ( lobby ) . Like it or not , believe it or not , your vote with your money counts more than your vote on a ballot . <h> How Do Mutual Funds Work ? <p> Basically , when you invest in a mutual fund you transfer money to the fund in an amount greater than the minimum required ( varies from one fund to another ) . If the fund has a sales charge ( front-end load ) , the fund deducts the charge from your initial payment and then issues the number of shares equal to the remaining balance divided by the NAV per share ( Net Asset Value per share ) . <p> The Net Asset Value ( NAV ) is the fund 's assets minus its liabilities . The NAV per share is calculated by dividing Net Asset Value by the number of shares outstanding . So , as a simple example , suppose a fund 's assets were $150,000 , its liabilities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that case , the NAV would be $100,000 ( $150,000 - $50,000 ) and the NAV per share would be $10.00 ( $100,000 10,000 ) . <p> Continuing with the example , if you transferred $1,000 to the fund that had a 3% sales charge , you would be issued 97 shares of the fund ( $1,000 - $30 sales charge = $970 , $10 NAV per share = 97 shares ) . From there you can see that if the NAV rises ( assets increase by a greater margin than any increase in liabilities ) , so does the NAV per share . So if the fund 's NAV per share were to increase to say $12 , this means you could sell your 97 shares back to the fund for $1,164 ( 97 x $12 NAV per share ) -- leaving you with a gain of $194.00 ( $1,164 - $970 ) -- less any deferred sales charges ( back-end load ) and annual operating costs . <p> Since it costs money to run a fund , all mutual funds charge an annual operating expense fee equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your shares . Some funds may also charge for sales and marketing ( referred to as " 12b-1 " fees ) , management , and " other " expenses . The amount of these charges and fees can be found in the prospectus that mutual fund companies are required to provide you with . Of course , all of these fees will serve to lower your rate of return , so it 's important to shop and compare the fees charged . <h> When and How to Buy Mutual Funds <p> Before investing in mutual funds , or any other type of risk-bearing investment , you should have 3-6 months of income saved up in an emergency fund and have no outstanding high-interest debt . <p> If you do n't have a fully-funded emergency fund I suggest you allocate all investment funds to creating that all important financial safety net . <p> Or if you do have a fully-funded emergency fund , but you have unpaid high-interest debt , I suggest you invest in your debt before you consider purchasing risk-bearing mutual funds that ca n't match the safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with accelerated debt payoff . <p> If you do have a fully-funded emergency fund and you have managed to pay off all of your high interest debt , and you are ready to start investing in mutual funds , you have one of two primary ways of purchasing shares : <p> You can buy mutual fund shares directly from a fund . These are typically referred to as " no-load " funds -- meaning there is no sales charge for purchasing the shares since they do n't use a commissioned sales force to sell their shares . In this case you will need to do your own research in choosing which fund to invest in . <p> You can buy mutual fund shares through brokers , banks , financial planners , and insurance companies . These are typically referred to as " load " funds -- meaning there is a sales charge since they need to compensate those that are selling shares on their behalf . In this case you can get recommendations from the seller as to which funds to buy . Just be aware that they may recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware that you will need to earn a higher rate of return in order to offset the sales charges . <h> Best Place to Begin to Learn About Mutual Funds <p> You should now have a rough understanding of what mutual funds are , how they work , and when and how to buy them . For more in-depth study I suggest you begin by visiting the Securities and Exchange Commission 's ( SEC ) section on Mutual Funds . <p> With that , let 's use the Mutual Fund Calculator to calculate the after-expense growth and equivalent annual yield of an individual mutual fund for the purpose of comparing mutual funds with different fee schedules ( before using the mutual fund calculator , be sure to have the mutual fund 's prospectus at your disposal to insure you enter the correct sales charge and fee percentages ) . <p> Mutual Fund Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the dollar amount to invest , the number of years you plan to hold the fund , the expected rate of return , and the percentages for sales charges and annual operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversion year ( if applicable ) , and then click the " Calculate Results for Mutual Fund Comparison " button . @qwx194657 <h> Mutual Fund Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Dollar amount of investment : The total dollar amount of the funds you are considering investing in the mutual fund . <p> Number of years you plan to hold the investment : The number of years you plan to leave the funds invested in the mutual fund . <p> Anticipated rate of return : The percentage return on investment you expect to earn on the mutual fund .

To explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each use . But first let 's make sure you aware of the conversion concepts you need to know in order to solve for unknown percentage variables . <h> Percent Conversions <p> The first thing you need to be aware of when calculating percentages is that a percentage ( p ) can be rewritten as the fraction p/100 . In other words , 25% can be rewritten as 25/100 . And since 25 100 is equal to .25 , you can see that a percentage can either be converted to a fraction or a decimal . The actual conversion you will need to make will depend on whether you are using the shortcut method or the proportion method . <h> Number Conversions <p> The second thing you need to be aware of when calculating percentages , is that the numbers needed to calculate percentages ( n and d ) can also be rewritten as the fraction n/d , where n is a relationship or ratio to d . For example , if you are trying to find out what percentage 5 is of the number 20 , this can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can see that the numbers themselves can be expressed as either a fraction or a decimal . Again , the actual conversion you will need to make depends on the method you use to solve for the unknown variable . <p> Keeping those conversion concepts in mind , let 's take a look at each method to show you how to calculate percentages from number , and then how to calculate an unknown number from a number and a percentage . <h> How to Calculate a Percentage from Two Numbers <p> To find what percentage a first number is of a second number , the shortcut method is to simply divide the first number ( numerator ) by the second number ( denominator ) . This will yield a decimal number , which can then be converted into a percentage . <p> To convert a decimal into a percentage you can either multiply the decimal by 100 , or simply move the decimal point two places to the right . <p> The following is an example of how you would calculate what percent 45 is of 180 using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percentage <p> p <p> = <p> 45 <p> 180 <p> p = .25 <p> Convert decimal to percent : <p> p = .25 * 100 <p> p = 25% <p> Or , you can formulate the problem into a proportion and then solve for the missing percentage . Here is how you would solve for the above example using the proportion method : <p> Formulate a Proportion and Solve for Percentage <p> 45 <p> = <p> p <p> 180 <p> 100 <p> Cross multiply : <p> 45 * 100 = 180 * p <p> 4500 = 180p <p> Divide both sides by 180 <p> 4500 <p> = <p> 180p <p> 180 <p> 180 <p> 25 = p <p> 25/100 = .25 or 25% <h> How to Calculate a Number from a Percentage and a Number <p> If you know the percentage and one of the needed numbers , you can find the unknown number using either the shortcut method or the proportion method . Since n/d ( 45/180 in our example ) represents the two numbers needed to find a percentage , I 'll refer to n as the numerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formula to find a number from a percentage and a number depends on whether or not you are trying to find the first number ( n or numerator ) or the second number ( d or denominator ) , I 'll explain each formula separately . <h> How to Calculate the Numerator Given the Percentage and the Denominator <p> If you are trying to find the first number ( numerator ) , the shortcut method is to convert the percentage into a decimal and then multiply that decimal by the second number ( denominator ) . <p> The following is an example of how you would calculate what number ( n ) is 25% of 180 using the shortcut method : <p> Shortcut Method to Solve for Numerator <p> n <p> = <p> 25% <p> 180 <p> Convert percent to decimal : <p> 25% = .25 <p> Multiply decimal by denominator : <p> n = .25 * 180 : <p> n = 45 <p> Or , you can formulate a proportion and use cross multiplication to solve for the numerator .

This is where the APY formula ( shown below ) can be used to translate each stated rate into rates that can be compared ( apples to apples ) . <p> APY = ( 1 + r/n ) n 1 where r is the quoted annual interest rate and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year . <p> Of course , it will be much easier to skip the manual calculation and simply use the APY Calculator on this page . Easier yet will be to simply ask the savings institution to give you the annual percentage yield -- which they are required by law ( Truth in Savings Law ) to provide you with . <h> An Alternate APY Formula <p> Another method of calculating APY can be used in cases where you know the actual interest earned during the term of the principal . In this case the following APY formula can be used : <p> APY = 100 ( 1 + Interest/Principal ) 365/Days 1 where Principal is the amount of funds on deposit , Interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal , and Days is the number of days during which the interest was earned . <p> The above formula is the one used by other saving and investing calculators in this section , such as the CD Rate and CD Savings Comparison calculators . <h> APY Vs . APR <p> APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate and is normally associated to mortgage loans that come with closing costs and origination fees . So whereas APR is typically used to translate different mortgage loan costs into comparable rates , APY is normally used to translate different compounding intervals of savings rates into comparable rates . It 's important to note that APR is often used interchangeably when referring to non-mortgage interest rates as well , such as in place of nominal rate or annual interest rate . <p> I know all of this jargon can be confusing ( much to the pleasure of the savings and loan industry ) , but all you really need to remember is that when looking at two different advertised interest rates , if the rates are n't followed by the same label ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed to make sure you are comparing apples to apples . <p> With that , let 's use the APY Calculator to calculate the Annual Percent Yield ( or Effective Annual Rate ) of a stated nominal or annual interest rate , and a given compounding frequency . <p> Compounding frequency : The compounding frequency that applies to the investment . Compounding frequency refers to the number of times per year that the interest is calculated on an investment . For example if the interest is compounded monthly , the decimal equivalent of the interest rate is divided by 12 and then multiplied by the month-end balance of the account . Whereas for daily compounding , the decimal equivalent of the interest rate is divided by 365 and then multiplied by the balance at the end of the day . In all cases , the interest is then added to the balance in time to be included in the next compounding . That 's where the power of compound interest comes in -- because you are earning interest on interest earned . <p> Annual Percent Yield or Effective Annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or annual interest rate and the selected compounding frequency , this is the calculated Annual Percent Yield ( APY ) , which is also referred to as the Effective Annual Rate .

If you were looking to sell your 7% bond , your bond is obviously worth more than bonds paying only 6% . In this case , using the bond valuation formula that 's built into the bond value calculator , we can see that an investor should be willing to purchase your $1,000 bond for $1,042.12 , as that price would still net the investor the same total return as the one paying 6% . <p> Those two examples should help to explain why interest rates have an inverse relationship with bond prices .

This is because the interest rate risk ( risk of missing out on higher interest rates ) decreases the closer bonds get to their maturity dates . <p> With that , let 's use the Bond Value Calculator to calculate the price of a bond given its face value , coupon rate , market rate , and years-to-maturity . <h> Bond Value Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Par value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , both of which refer to the amount the bond issuer promises to pay the bond holder on the maturity date . <p> Coupon rate : The coupon rate is the annual interest the bond pays . If a bond with a par value of $1,000 is paying you $80 per year , then the coupon rate would be 8% ( 80 1000 = .08 , or 8% ) . <p> Coupon rate compounding interval : Select the compounding frequency of the coupon rate . Typically , the shorter the compounding interval , the more interest you will earn with all other factors remaining the same . While the effects of compounding are fairly insignificant for small investments , the effects can be very significant when investing a large sum of money . <p> Current market rate : The current market rate that similar bonds are selling for . If the current market rate is below the coupon rate , then the bond should be trading at a premium ( price greater than the par value ) . Conversely , if the current market rate is above the coupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount ( price less than par value ) . <p> Years to maturity : The number of years remaining before the bond reaches its maturity date . The maturity of a bond is the year the par or face value of the bond is returned to the bond holder . <p> Bond value : Given the face value , coupon rate , coupon compounding interval , years to maturity , and the current market rate , this is the price the bond should be trading at .

So not only will the car 's value drop by the amount of the dealer 's profit margin , but it will also plummet by the drop in the perceived value ( " used " is far less appealing than " new " ) . All together , this warp-speed depreciation that occurs the moment you drive a " new " car off the lot can run in the 10-30% range .

Typically bonds are issued with par values of $1,000 and can be purchased for close to their par value on the day they are issued . <h> What is Maturity Date ? <p> The maturity date is the date the issuer promises to pay the holder of the bond an amount equal to the par value . Bonds can have maturity dates that range anywhere from 1 day up to 30 years , or more . Generally , the longer out the maturity date , the higher the interest rate the bond will pay . That 's because longer maturities expose the bond holder to more risk than bonds with shorter maturities . <h> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual interest rate the issuer will pay on the amount borrowed . For example , if a bond has a par value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 8% , then you will receive annual coupon ( interest ) payments of $80 ( 1000 X .08 = $80 ) until the bond 's maturity date . Most bonds make coupon payments semi-annually , so you would likely receive a $40 coupon payment two times each year . <h> What Makes Bond Yield Comparisons Difficult ? <p> What makes comparing bond yields difficult , is that bonds are often bought and sold in between their maturity dates -- with the prices of the bonds constantly changing due to changing interest rates and the demand for borrowing money . In other words , you could buy a newly issued $1,000 bond today at close to face value , but a month from now the bond might be selling for more or less than what you paid for it . <p> Generally , if interest rates rise , the prices of bonds fall . And if interest rates fall , the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and rates move in opposite directions , please visit the Bond Value Calculator page for a simple explanation . In any case , the important thing to realize is that bonds are rarely bought and sold at par value . <p> This means that if you are looking to invest in bonds , you will likely be purchasing bonds at prices that are higher or lower than their par value . And it 's this price-to-par-value variance that makes it difficult to compare yields on bonds with different maturities , prices and coupon rates . <p> If you were to purchase a bond at a par value of $1,000 and held it until maturity , the yield would be roughly equal to the annual coupon rate . However , if you purchase a $1,000 bond for $900 ( purchased at a discount ) with a coupon rate of 6% , how would you know how the actual yield will compare to a $1,000 bond selling for $1,100 ( purchased at a premium ) , but that has a coupon rate of 7% ? <h> Enter the Yield to Maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather complex return on investment calculation that accounts for both coupon payments and the gain or loss of principal that occurs when bonds are purchased for less than or greater than the par value . But in your case , all you need to do is to enter 4 variables for each bond and the yield to maturity calculator will do all of the complex calculations for you . <p> Please keep in mind that while the yield to maturity calculator can help you compare total returns on bonds , it can not predict the future . Bonds , while considered to be safer than equities ( stocks ) , do carry a risk that the issuer may default on the repayment . Of course , this risk is less when it comes to U.S. government bonds and Municipal bonds , and more when it comes to corporate bonds .

In other words , how much would you have to pay to purchase the bond today ? Note that selling prices are typically listed in the " Bid Price " column of a bond table . This bid price is usually stated as a percentage of the bond 's par value . For example , if a $1,000 par value bond has a bid price of " 99.59 " , it means someone is willing to purchase it for $995.90 ( $1,000 X .9959 = $995.90 ) .

@@14740740 @3340740/ <p> Their mortgage lenders said that making extra payments would not save the borrowers any money or pay off their mortgage any sooner . <p> What ? ! <p> Instead , mortgage lenders sometimes offer to recast the borrower 's mortgage , but the borrower needs to make a large principal payment in order to qualify for the recast . <p> Now , I do n't know the exact wording of the fine print included in the mortgage papers these borrowers have signed , but I can only assume the fine print read something like this : <p> You can make all the extra payments you want , but it wo n't reduce the interest cost or the length of the payoff because we ( the mortgage lender ) secretly sold your mortgage to an investor for a lump sum of money , so we will simply put your extra and overpayments into escrow and then apply them to the loan at the end of the payment term . <p> If that 's true , does it sound like the mortgage lender genuinely cares about their customers ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next question you might be asking is , what the heck do lenders mean when they tell borrowers they can recast their mortgage ? <h> What is a Mortgage Recast ? <p> Based on my understanding of the term , recasting ( also referred to as , re-amortization ) is the lender saying to the borrower , " No , I wo n't let you pay off your loan early or reduce your interest rate , but I will let you lower your monthly payment if you make a minimum , one-time principal reduction ... for a fee . " <p> In other words , recasting your mortgage will reduce the balance you owe , but since recasts typically do n't include a shortening of the term or a lower interest rate , the net effect is simply a lower monthly mortgage payment . <p> Of course , since your monthly mortgage payment is reduced while everything else stays the same , this does result in interest savings . However , it 's usually less than the level of savings you could achieve if all of your extra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time they are made . <h> Savings Comparison <p> The following example is based on a current balance of $100,000 , a monthly payment of $1,073.65 , and a 5% interest rate ( all results are rounded to nearest dollar ) . From this example you can get a good idea of the savings difference between a mortgage recast and what would happen if your mortgage lender would reduce your principal while keeping the same amortization schedule ( Optimal terms ) . <p> Terms <p> Lump SumPrincipalPayment <p> Balance <p> MonthlyPayment <p> Pmts Left <p> Interest&amp; Fees <p> Savings <p> Current <p> $0 <p> $100,000 <p> $1,074 <p> 119 <p> $26,824 <p> $0 <p> Recast <p> $10,000 <p> $90,000 <p> $961 <p> 119 <p> $24,532 <p> $2,292 <p> Optimal <p> $10,000 <p> $90,000 <p> $1,074 <p> 104 <p> $20,947 <p> $5,877 <p> In the above example , making a lump sum principal reduction while continuing to make the original payment amount would save $3,585 more in interest charges than recasting , and you would pay off your mortgage 15 months sooner . <h> Is Recasting a Good or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in numerous places throughout this site , if you have higher interest debt and/or you do n't have 3-6 months of income saved up in an emergency fund , you would likely benefit more from using any lump sum of cash for paying down high interest debt and building an emergency fund instead of paying down a mortgage balance ( mortgages usually have the lowest interest rates , plus the interest payments may be tax deductible ) . <p> Secondly , if your mortgage lender allows principal prepayments and credits them to your balance as they are made , and you can continue to make the original monthly payment amount , you would save more money just prepaying your principal instead of doing a formal recast . <p> On the other hand , if you have a fully funded emergency fund and no higher interest debt to pay off , and your lender wo n't credit principal prepayments as they are made , then recasting your mortgage might be a good idea -- especially in cases where refinancing is either not an option or does n't offer any significant savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things to keep in mind if you 're considering checking into a re-amortization to lower your payment : <p> Most lenders charge a fee for recasting ( $150-$500 ) and most require a minimum principal payment ( $1,000 - $10,000 , or in some cases 10% of the balance owed ) . <p> Not all mortgages qualify for recasting . <p> Most lenders do n't advertise that they offer recasting ( they would rather make a lot of free money from refinancing or from keeping you on your existing mortgage terms ) .

So for me , the risk of losing my savings in the stock market would also put me at risk of being forced out of what I love doing and into something I have to do . Therefore I choose to reinvest a portion of the profits back into my own business , and then invest the rest in minimum risk investments ( namely CD Laddering ) . <h> How is Your Company Doing ? <p> What 's that ?

The lower your bills and expenses , and the less debt you have , the more freedom you will have to discover and a pursue a work that you love and can believe in . <p> Throughout this site I have been divulging bits and pieces of the steps I took to go from being trapped by debt in a job I hated , to having the financial freedom to work at something I truly love , and in the time and place of my own choosing ( you can read my story here ) .

If you 're making minimum payments on 18% credit card debt , then it makes no sense to me as to why you would want to risk losing your hard earned money in exchange for the remote chance to earn a mere 10% return -- so invest in your debt first . <p> With that , let 's use the Stock Calculator to calculate the return on a stock investment in terms of current yield and annualized holding period yield . <p> Stock Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the purchase price per share , the number of shares purchased , the total or per share commission paid to purchase the shares , and the number of months/days owned . <p> Next enter the price per share when sold and the total or per share commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calculate Return on Stock " button . @qwx194657 <p> Commission paid at purchase : The total or per share commission paid to purchase the shares .

By opposite , I mean " Money is time . " <p> The amount of money you have in your possession represents the time you 've invested in serving employers or customers . For example , if you have a $100 bill and if you take home $10 per hour from your work , then that $100 bill represents 10 hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question is , will your investment of time generate a net-profit or a net-loss ? <h> Money DOES NOT Equal Profit <p> What most of us fail to realize , is that the money we collect for the time we invest serving others has very little to do with whether or not we actually profit from our labors . How so ? Because to actually profit from an investment of our time , the emotional revenues we receive from the money we are paid must exceed any emotional expenses we experience while investing our time . <p> If there is something you would rather do with your time than spend it at work , then your work -- no matter how much you like it -- is generating emotional expenses . And the more you dislike your work , the higher those expenses will be . <p> This means that in order to profit from our work , we must make sure that we only spend our net wages on things that will yield emotional revenues in excess of the expenses we incurred earning them . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not impossible , to find things to spend your money on that will return more than your work is costing you . <p> This explains why it 's so important to choose your work based on how well it 's suited to your talents , abilities , values , and genuine interests , rather than just on how much money it pays . <h> Hate Your Work ? Then What ? <p> It 's true , we all have to work in order to feed , clothe , and shelter ourselves and our families . And it 's also true that most of us ca n't be too choosy as to which jobs we take when we find ourselves without an income . However , if you find yourself in a job you hate , the worst thing you can do is to attempt to immediately offset its emotional expenses by spending your wages on short-lived emotional " highs . " <p> Short lived emotional highs , otherwise known as " instant gratifications " , include activities like expensive entertainment , shopping , buying on credit , gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . And sure , these activities can generate high emotional returns up front , but they almost always end in an emotional net-loss ( hangover pain exceeds the party high ) -- thereby serving only to add to the emotional losses you are experiencing at work , not offset them . <p> If your work is costing you a fortune in emotional expenses , then your primary focus should be on finding and pursing a work that will be less emotionally expensive , i.e. , a work that fulfills your need for creative self-expression . Here are the basic steps I took to go from working at a job I hated to a work that fulfills my need for creative self-expression . <p> 1 . Stop spending your money ( time receipts ) on instant gratifications . These only result in emotional net-losses , which in turn increases the need for even more instant gratification . If left unchecked , this viscous cycle can lead to emotional bankruptcy . <p> 2 . Work to lower your cost of living . The lower your cost of living , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well it suits you ( talents , abilities , values , and genuine interests ) instead of on how much it pays . <p> 3 . Use the savings from #1 and #2 to first pay off high-interest debt , and then to increase your savings . As the time value calculator on this page will show you , saving small portions of your money ( time ) now , can greatly increase the amount of discretionary time you have in the future . <p> 4 . Invest a significant portion of your discretionary time in discovering and learning a different , more self-fulfilling work . Use your past experiences as a guide to create a blueprint for what you believe to be your perfect work , and then begin to pursue that work on a volunteer and/or " pay as you go " basis .

" , or you would like to calculate straight line depreciation , please visit the SLD Calculator . <p> Or , if you would like calculate or learn about the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System ( MACRS ) method , please visit the MACRS Calculator . <h> What is Double Declining Balance Method ? <p> The Double Declining Balance ( DDB ) Method is a system designed to accelerate the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most assets depreciate faster in their early years of service , and slower in their later years of service . The DDB method addresses that notion . <p> In fact , as the name suggests , the DDB method results in a first-year depreciation expense of double the amount that could be expensed using the straight line method . <p> However , due to the way its calculated , the DDB method of depreciating an asset rarely fully depreciates the asset by the end of the recovery period . Therefore most companies switch to the straight-line method during the final year(s) of the recover period in order to fully depreciate the asset . <p> Another thing to keep in mind , is that unlike the straight-line method , the DDB method ignores the salvage value in its calculations -- unless taking the full DDB depreciation for a given year would cause the book value to drop below the salvage value . In that case , only the excess of the depreciable base may be expensed for that year . <h> How to Calculate DDB <p> To calculate DDB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage based on the acquisition cost ( adjusted basis ) of the asset -- while ignoring the salvage value -- and then double that percentage to arrive at the DDB percentage . <p> For example , if you purchased a machine costing $10,000 , with a salvage value of $1,000 and a useful life of 5 years , the SLD rate would be equal to 100% divided by 5 , or 20% . Next , double the SLD rate to get the DDB rate , which in this case would be 40% . <p> Therefore , the first year depreciation expense for the $10,000 machine would be equal to $4,000 ( .40 X 10,000 ) -- provided the asset was placed in service on January 1 , of that year . <p> For all remaining years the DDB depreciation expense would be calculated by multiplying the book value ( acquisition cost minus accumulated depreciation ) by the 40% rate -- except in the case where that result would cause the book value to drop below the salvage value . <h> Example of How to Calculate Double Declining Depreciation <p> Referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect the $10,000 machine to last for 5 years , with a salvage value of $1,000.00 , and you place the machine in service in July of 2012 , here is how you would calculate the double declining depreciation expense for the applicable years . <p> Here is the depreciation schedule for the above example , as generated by the double declining balance calculator found lower down on this page : <p> Machine DDB Depreciation Schedule <p> # <p> Year <p> BeginningValue <p> % <p> DepreciationExpense <p> AccumulatedDepreciation <p> EndingValue <p> 1 <p> 2012 <p> $10,000 <p> 20.00% <p> $2,000 <p> $2,000 <p> $8,000 <p> 2 <p> 2013 <p> $8,000 <p> 40.00% <p> $3,200 <p> $5,200 <p> $4,800 <p> 3 <p> 2014 <p> $4,800 <p> 40.00% <p> $1,920 <p> $7,120 <p> $2,880 <p> 4 <p> 2015 <p> $2,880 <p> 40.00% <p> $1,152 <p> $8,272 <p> $1,728 <p> 5 <p> 2016 <p> $1,728 <p> 40.00% <p> $691 <p> $8,963 <p> $1,037 <p> 6 <p> 2017 <p> $1,037 <p> 3.55% <p> $37 <p> $9,000 <p> $1,000 <p> In the last line of the above depreciation schedule you will note that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine beyond its salvage value . <h> MACRS Depreciation <p> Please note that both the Straight-Line Depreciation Calculator and the Double Declining Balance Calculator are basically included here as learning tools and do not necessarily calculate depreciation in accordance with the IRS 's Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System ( MACRS ) methodology .

I hope you enjoy your work . <h> The Price Tag is Only the Tip of the Car Cost Iceberg <p> When you are looking to buy a car do you only consider the monthly payment when deciding whether or not you can afford to purchase the car ? If so , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting the same fate as the Titanic . <p> The moment you sign on the dotted line of an automobile title , you immediately obligate yourself to a host of costs that come attached to the price tag . Let 's briefly discuss each cost before we use the car buying calculator to expose and size up the costs that are located beneath the surface of an auto purchase . <h> Tax , Fees , License , Extended Warranty Costs <p> In addition to the purchase price of the car , you can also expect to be charged sales tax ( if applicable ) as well as your initial title transfer and license fees . Sadly , many people simply add these costs to the financing package , meaning they will be paying interest on these upfront fees for years to come . <h> Depreciation Costs <p> This is the most important , yet most overlooked and least understood of all costs associated to buying and owning a vehicle -- or any other depreciable asset for that matter . <p> In case you do n't know what " depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which an asset wears out ( or progresses toward becoming obsolete ) for a given period of time . <p> Or to put it another way , depreciation is the drop in resale value ( what you can sell the asset for ) for a given period of time . Typically an asset depreciates at a faster rate when it 's newer , and at a slower rate as it becomes older . <p> As it relates to an auto purchase , the value of the monthly depreciation of a vehicle is equal to the amount you should be setting aside in order to replace the vehicle once it has reached the end of its useful life . <p> If you 're not setting aside a vehicle 's depreciation as it occurs ( which is over above any auto loan payment you 're already making ) , guess what you will have to do when it 's time to replace the vehicle ? Yep , you 're going to have to continue to pad the huge bonus checks being paid to the lending institution executives . <p> But wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must also understand the difference between two types of depreciation . In addition to normal depreciation that occurs as an asset wears out or becomes obsolete , there is also a type of depreciation I refer to as Warp Speed Depreciation . <p> Warp speed depreciation is the type of depreciation that occurs the moment something goes from being " new " to being " used . " The instant you sign the papers to become the proud owner of a brand new car , the brand new car becomes a " used " car and the resale value plummets by as much as 20% of the purchase price ! <p> This means that the absolute worst thing you can do is to buy a brand new vehicle every 1-2 years . That 's because your average annual cost of depreciation will likely run in the 20% range , whereas buying a new car every ten years , or a used car every two years , may lower your average annual cost of depreciation to under 10% . <p> If you want to see for yourself just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future wealth , be sure to experiment with various new and used car buying scenarios using the Car Depreciation Calculator . <h> Finance Costs <p> If you finance a car purchase , you will increase the cost of the car by the amount of the interest charges that will be tacked on to the principal borrowed . <h> Insurance Costs <p> Of course you will also need to make insurance premiums on your car . Typically the more expensive and more sporty the car the higher your insurance premiums will be . Even higher if you are forced to purchase full coverage in order to qualify for financing . <h> Fuel Costs <p> The more you drive your car , the more it will cost you to fuel the vehicle . If you want to calculate MPG and compare car gas mileage expenses , be sure to try out the Fuel Mileage Calculator . <h> Maintenance &amp; Repair Costs <p> On average you can expect to pay 3% of the purchase price per year to repair and maintain your car ( less in early years , more in later later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , the cost would be what your time is worth if you used that time to earn an income . <h> Storage Costs <p> If you park your car in a garage , any utilities attributable to the garage -- along with the depreciation of the garage structure and fixtures -- is all part of the cost of owning the automobile . <h> Ownership Cost Meter Needed <p> Everything you own that can wear out or become obsolete , is doing so at this very moment . If it were possible to install a cost of ownership meter on your life , you would be shocked at how much value the whole of your possessions lose on a daily basis . Unfortunately these costs accrue without a meter to track them , and only come into light as each asset needs replacing . <p> When it comes to buying and owning assets that wear out or become obsolete , the bottom line is that if you are not setting aside money to replace these items as they wear out , your financial net worth is likely losing ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully aware of the costs associated to buying and owning depreciable assets , you also need to realize that in order to pay for these costs , you must trade free time for work time .

As you will soon see , the interest charges you are paying on your debts is only the tip of the " cost of debt " iceberg . <h> What Are Opportunity Costs ? <p> If you 're not familiar with the term " opportunity cost , " then shame on our public educational system . Why ? Because an acute understanding and awareness of that term is critical to the amount of financial happiness you will experience in your lifetime . <p> If you do n't know what they are , opportunity costs are the values of what you give up by choosing one course of action over all other alternative actions , and can be tangible , intangible , or both . Let 's first discuss the tangible opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Credit <p> First of all , if you decide to spend a given amount of money on a non-appreciating good or service , you are simultaneously giving up the right to spend that specific allotment of money on anything else that money could have purchased .

Of course not . <h> Intangible Opportunity Costs of Buying on Credit <p> In the course of borrowing money for non-essential , non-appreciating products and services , other opportunity costs arise that can not be quantified -- and therefore can not be used to calculate the cost of debt . Here are a few of the most common intangible opportunity costs of buying on credit . <p> Inefficient Decision Making : Having easy access to credit gives you the false impression that you can have it all .

However , because you can not know what the future holds , for all you know you might be repaying the debt on half the income you are making now after being forced to work at a job you hate .

Due to compounding interest , the amount you owe can not be arrived at by simply multiplying your payment amount by the number of payments remaining . You may need to call your lender to find out the exact amount you owe . <p> Annual interest rate : The annual interest rate you are being charged for the debt . The actual dollar amount you are being charged also depends on your current balance and on how often your lender compounds the interest charges ( most credit card companies compound interest on a daily basis , i.e. , annual rate 365 X average daily balance ) . <p> Fixed or declining minimum payments : Choose whether your monthly payment is a Fixed amount , or a Declining minimum payment amount .

To calculate cost of debt , the calculator will use this rate to determine how much interest you could be earning on the interest charges you are paying . <p> Months to pay off debt : Based on your entries , this is the number of payments ( months ) you will need to make in order to pay off this debt . <p> Total interest cost : Based on your entries , this is the total interest charges you will pay between now and when you pay off this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have paid cash for what this debt was used to purchase , and instead chose to invest the avoided interest charges , this is what your investment would be worth for the same time period you would have been making payments on your debt . <p> Difference between borrowing and saving : This is the difference between what you will pay in interest charges on this debt and what you could have earned with the interest savings if you had not created this debt in the first place .

@@14740759 @3340759/ <h> How Do You Compare Fractions ? <p> The answer to that question depends on whether you are comparing fractions with same denominators or if you are comparing fractions with different denominators . <h> Comparing Fractions with Same Denominators <p> Comparing fractions with the same denominators ( bottom number ) is easy . All you do is compare the numerators to see which fraction is greater , like this : <p> Comparison with Same Denominators <p> 4 <p> &gt; <p> 3 <p> 5 <p> 5 <h> Comparing Fractions with Different Denominators <p> Comparing fractions with different denominators requires a little more work ( unless you use the compare fractions calculator on this page ) , because in order to compare the fractions you must first turn their different denominators into the same denominators . You do that by finding the least common multiple ( LCM ) of the denominators . <p> To illustrate how you use LCM to turn different denominators into same denominators , let 's suppose you want to compare the fraction 2/3 to the fraction 3/4 to see which is greater . <p> The first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 will divide into evenly ( the LCM ) . According to my calculations , the LCM of the two denominators ( 3 &amp; 4 ) is 12 . <p> Once we have found the LCM for the two denominators , the next step is to multiply the top and bottom of each fraction by the number of times each fraction 's denominator goes into the LCM . <p> Since 3 goes into 12 a total of 4 times , you would multiply the top and bottom of 2/3 by 4 , which results in 8/12 . <p> Next , since 4 goes into 12 a total of 3 times , you would multiply the top and bottom of 3/4 by 3 , which results in 9/12 . <p> Finally , since both denominators are now the same , you compare the numerators ( 8 and 9 ) to determine which fraction is greater . Since 9 is greater than 8 , 9/12 is greater than 8/12 -- therefore 3/4 is greater than 2/3 . Here is how our example of comparing fractions with different denominators might appear on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 2 x 4 <p> Vs <p> 3 x 3 <p> = <p> 8 <p> Vs <p> 9 <p> 3 x 4 <p> 4 x 3 <p> 12 <p> 12 <p> Step #2 : <p> 8 <p> &lt; <p> 9 <p> 12 <p> 12 <p> With that , let 's use the Compare Fractions Calculator to determine which fraction or mixed number is greater than another fraction or mixed number . <p> Compare Fractions Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the whole number , numerator ( top ) and the denominator ( bottom ) of the 1st entry . <p> Next , enter the whole number , numerator and denominator of the 2nd entry , and then click the " Compare Fractions " button . <p> Note that for the first or the second entry you can either enter a whole number only , a mixed number , or a fraction only . @qwx194657 <h> Compare Fractions Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Least Common Multiple ( LCM ) : The process used by the compare fractions calculator to find the smallest number that the denominators of two or more fractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adding , subtracting , or comparing fractions with different denominators . <p> 1st Entry : If the 1st entry is a whole number only , leave the numerator and denominator blank .

@@14740766 @3340766/ <h> NPV Calculator to CalculateDiscounted Cash Flows <p> The NPV Calculator on this page will help you to determine the desireability of an investment by instantly calculating its net present value . <p> This calculator will help you to determine what net impact a prospective investment will have on future cash flows when accounting for the time value of money -- without having to deal with time-consuming present value tables . <p> And not only will the calculator instantly calculate the net present value of a prospective investment , but it will also generate a discounted cash flows chart showing how it arrived at its answer . <p> Plus , if you are doing sensitivity analysis ( what-if scenarios ) , the calculator will provide you with a printer friendly report that you can print out and use for your comparisons . <h> What is NPV ? <p> The term NPV stands for Net Present Value , which is a Discounted Cash Flow ( DCF ) method used in forecasting the long run desirability of an investment ( capital outlay ) . <p> Specifically , net present value discounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected or minimum rate of return . This expected rate of return is known as the Discount Rate , or Cost of Capital . <p> If the net present value of a prospective investment is a positive number , the investment is deemed to be desirable . On the other hand , if the net present value turns out to be a negative number , then the investment is deemed to be undesirable . <p> Furthermore , net present value analysis can also be used to determine which of two or more alternative desirable investments is the most desirable . <h> What is a Discounting ? <p> Think of discounting as the opposite of compounding . In compounding you take a present amount ( principal ) and compound the interest earnings into the future . Whereas discounting takes a future value and discounts it back to the present ( principal ) . <p> To illustrate the difference between compounding and discounting , if you were to invest $100 today in an investment that paid a 10% annual return , and you wanted to know how much your investment would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest by multiplying the principal by 1 plus the rate ( 100 x 1.10 = $110 ) . <p> Conversely , if you wanted to know how much you would need to deposit today in order for your investment to grow to $110 in 1 year , you would discount the future value by dividing it by 1 plus the rate ( 110 1.10 = $100 ) . <h> What is the Discounted Cash Flow ( DCF ) Method ? <p> In the case of net present value analysis , the DCF method takes each future cash flow and reduces the amount by how much of that cash flow represents interest earned if its principal portion were invested at the time investment originated . <p> Then , once all future cash flows have been discounted , to arrive at the net present value you then sum all discounted cash flows and subtract that amount from the original amount invested . <h> How is the Discount Rate Determined ? <p> Typically , when deciding what rate to use when discounting cash flows , the rate used is equal to the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if you know of two other alternative investments ( A &amp; B ) and if you know with a fair amount of certainty that you could earn 6% in alternative A and alternative B would earn 5% , then use alternative A as the rate for discounting cash flows . <h> Why is NPV Important ? <p> In order to demonstrate the importance of net present value analysis , suppose I ask you for $1,000 today , and in exchange I promise to pay you $200 per year for five years , and then give you an extra $100 in year six , as shown in the following cash flow chart : <p> Year <p> You Give Me(Outflows) <p> I Pay You ( Inflows ) <p> Now <p> $1,000.00 <p> 1 <p> $200.00 <p> 2 <p> $200.00 <p> 3 <p> $200.00 <p> 4 <p> $200.00 <p> 5 <p> $200.00 <p> 6 <p> $100.00 <p> Totals <p> $1,000.00 <p> $1,100.00 <p> Now , if you were unaware of the effects of the time value of money on my proposal , you might say , " Wow !

Please do n't be them ! ! <p> The declining minimum payment method is what credit card companies use to calculate your monthly payments -- which is designed so that your payments get smaller as your balance-owed gets lower . The two most common formulas used to employ the method are explained below . <h> Minimum Percentage Formula <p> Typically these payments are calculated by multiplying the balance you owe by a small percentage , usually between 2% and 5% . If the percentage causes the payment to fall below the stated minimum dollar amount ( usually $10 to $15 ) , the minimum dollar amount is used . <p> For example , if you have a $2,000 balance on card carrying an 18% APR with a minimum payment percentage of 2% , and a minimum dollar amount of $15 , then your minimum payment would be $40 ( 2000 x .02 ) . You can calculate your own minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your interest charge for the month would be $30 ( 0.18 APR 12 months x 2000 ) , which means that only $10 of your $40 payment is going to reduce what you owe . Ouch ! <h> 1% Formula <p> More and more credit card companies are adopting this method , which simply calculates 1% of your balance and adds it to the current month 's interest charges . <p> In this case , referring back to the earlier example , your minimum payment would be equal to $30 interest plus $20 ( .01 x 2000 ) for a total payment of $50 . <h> A Perpetual Windfall for Credit Card Companies <p> Regardless of which minimum payment formula they use , credit card companies make a fortune from luring their spendthrift customers into making only the minimum monthly payments on their revolving charge accounts -- which usually just barely covers the current month 's interest charges . <p> And because so little of your payments go toward paying down what you owe ( the principal ) , these payments can easily last for 10 , 20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wasted interest charges . <p> And guess what ?

So as you can see , the primary reason we use hexadecimals instead of other number systems is simply because they are more compact and therefore more convenient to write and communicate . <h> How to Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal <p> If the hexadecimal number you are converting is less than 16 , then you can simply use the following hex to decimal conversion chart : <p> Conversion Chart for Hexadecimals Less <p> 14 <p> 15 <p> On the other hand , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it helps to use a conversion method that identifies and sums place values -- a method you are already familiar with for identifying place values in the decimal number system . <p> So , in order to help you to understand how to convert hexadecimal to decimal , it may help to recall how we translate the value of a decimal number . Let 's use the decimal number 1357 ( 135710 , or one-thousand , three-hundred and fifty-seven ) as an example : <p> Translating the Value of a Decimal ( base 10 ) Number <p> A <p> Power of 10 : <p> 103 <p> 102 <p> 101 <p> 100 <p> B <p> Place value ( A result ) : <p> 1000 <p> 100 <p> 10 <p> 1 <p> C <p> Entered decimal digit : <p> 1 <p> 3 <p> 5 <p> 7 <p> D <p> Product of B * C : <p> 1000 <p> 300 <p> 50 <p> 7 <p> E <p> Cumulative total of D : <p> 1000 <p> 1300 <p> 1350 <p> 1357 <p> Multiplying the values in row B by their corresponding values in row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5(10) + 7 -- which calculates out to 1357 . <p> With the above base 10 translation in mind , here is how you would convert the base 16 number 12CA ( 12CA16 or one-two-C-A ) into a base 10 number : <p> Converting a Hexadecimal ( base 16 ) to a Decimal ( base 10 ) <p> A <p> Power of 16 : <p> 163 <p> 162 <p> 161 <p> 160 <p> B <p> Place value ( A result ) : <p> 4096 <p> 256 <p> 16 <p> 1 <p> C <p> Entered hex digit : <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> C <p> A <p> D <p> Product of B * C : <p> 4096 <p> 512 <p> 192 <p> 10 <p> E <p> Cumulative total of D : <p> 4096 <p> 4608 <p> 4800 <p> 4810 <p> Adding the values of line D we get the base 10 number of 4810 .

" <p> One of the concepts that is central to working with fractions in math is that as long as you perform the same operation on both the numerator ( top ) and denominator ( bottom ) , you wo n't change the underlying value of the fraction . <p> For example , if you begin the fraction 1/2 , and multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by , say 5 , you will not change the underlying value of the fraction no matter how many times you repeat the multiplication . <p> 1 <p> = <p> 1 x 5 <p> = <p> 5 <p> = <p> 5 x 5 <p> = <p> 25 <p> = <p> 25 x 5 <p> = <p> 125 <p> 2 <p> 2 x 5 <p> 10 <p> 10 x 5 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = .50 = 1/2 <p> Now , since 125/250 is the same as 1/2 , 1/2 would be the simplified version of 125/250 ( or 500/1000 , 2500/5000 , etc . ) . And since working with smaller numbers is easier that working with larger numbers , it always makes sense to reduce fractions to their simplest form before working with them . <h> How To Simply Fractions <p> The easiest way to simplify fractions is to use the fraction reducer calculator on this page . Otherwise , if you would like to simplify fractions manually , there are a couple of different ways : <h> The Trial and Error Method <p> To use the trial and error method of simplifying fractions you just start by attempting to divide the numerator and denominator by a small number that you believe to a common factor to both ( usually 2 ) and then continue to work your way up . After each successful reduction , you then need to repeat the process until the numerator and denominator have no other factors in common . <p> 8 <p> = <p> 8 &amp;divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 <p> = <p> 2 <p> 12 <p> 12 &amp;divide 2 <p> 6 <p> 6 &amp;divide 2 <p> 3 <h> The Greatest Common Factor Method <p> To use the greatest common factor method of simplifying fractions you first need to find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator . Next you simply divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor . <p> Using the fraction 8/12 from above , we find that the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator is 4 . <p> 8 <p> = <p> 8 &amp;divide 4 <p> = <p> 2 <p> 12 <p> 12 &amp;divide 4 <p> 3 <p> Regardless of which manual method you choose , using them to reduce fractions can be extremely tedious and time consuming . Therefore I would suggest you bookmark the fraction reducer calculator and use it any time you are working with fractions . <h> The Final Step : Converting Improper Fractions <p> An improper fraction is a fraction that has a numerator that is greater than its denominator . Typically , when you are asked to simplify fractions , and a simplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need one final step before the simplification was considered complete . And that would be to convert the improper fraction to a mixed number ( a b/c ) . <p> To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number ( the fraction reducer calculator does for you ) , you first divide the numerator by the denominator . The number of full times the denominator goes into the numerator becomes the whole number , the remainder becomes the numerator , and the denominator remains unchanged . <p> Here is how you would convert the improper fraction 5/3 into a mixed number . <p> 5 <p> &gt;&gt;&gt; <p> 5 &amp;divide 3 = 1 with remainder of 2 <p> &gt;&gt;&gt; <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 3 <p> With that , let 's use the Fraction Reducer to reduce a fraction to simplest form and/or to convert an improper fraction into a mixed number . <h> Fraction Reducer Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Simplifying fractions : The process of finding common factors for the numerator and denominator of a fraction , and then restating the fraction as quotients of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more factors common to the numerator and denominator .

Instead I simply tell them that I value our relationship too much to put something so dangerous between us , and then come up with other ways I might be of assistance . <p> On the other hand , if I do give a friend or relative a sum of money , and that person is moved to pay me back , they know its only because they want to and not because I was expecting it . In that light , the repayment is simply gift back to me . <p> Of course , if you 're familiar with my stance on borrowing , you 'll know that I always try to talk friends and family into managing their incomes in such a way that it reduces the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , this keeps many of them from bringing up the subject in the first place ... to avoid the lectures and I told you so's. ; - ) <h> US Rule vs . Normal , or Negative Amortization <p> US Rule : Unpaid interest and late fees are escrowed , or banked , and added to the end of the loan . <p> Normal : Unpaid interest and late fees are added to the loan 's principal balance in the payment period they occur . This results in charging interest on unpaid interest and fees , which is commonly referred to as Negative Amortization . <p> From the borrower 's perspective , negative amortization can be very costly -- especially if the missed payment occurs early on in the repayment schedule .

For example , if you were to exchange $10,000 cash for a machine valued at $10,000 , theoretically you could immediately sell the machine for $10,000 without any loss . <p> However , if you were to use the machine in your business for a period of years before reselling , obviously the amount you could sell the machine for ( salvage value ) would be less than what you paid for it . And it 's this difference ( drop in value ) between what you paid for the machine and what you end up selling it for that is the machine 's actual depreciation expense . <p> Of course , since the machine 's depreciation expense occurs over the span of two or more tax years , you need a systematic way to expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the machine is in service . <h> Straight Line Depreciation Method <p> While there are numerous methods for distributing an asset 's depreciation expense over the course of its useful life , one of the most popular methods is called the Straight Line Depreciation Method ( SLD ) -- which , as the name implies , distributes the expense equally for each year of an asset 's useful life . <p> To calculate an asset 's straight line depreciation expense , you first take the asset 's acquisition cost and subtract the amount you think you could sell the asset for at the end of its useful life ( salvage or residual value ) . The result is what is referred to as the asset 's depreciable base . <p> Next , you divide the asset 's depreciable base by the number of years you expect the asset to last . The result is the asset 's annual depreciation expense . <p> The exception to the above is if the asset is first placed in service at any other time than at the beginning of the year . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depreciation expense is prorated based on what percentage of the year the asset was in service . Then , the remainder of the first year 's partial depreciation expense is assigned to the final year of the assets useful life -- as shown in the example below . <h> Example of How to Calculate Straight Line Depreciation <p> Referring to back to the machine example discussed earlier , if you expect the $10,000 machine to last for 9 years , with a salvage value of $1,000.00 , and you place the machine in service in April of the 2012 , here is how you would calculate the straight line depreciation expense for the applicable years . <p> Here is the straight line depreciation schedule for the above example , as generated by the straight line depreciation calculator found lower down on this page : <p> Machine Depreciation Schedule <p> # <p> Year <p> BeginningValue <p> DepreciationExpense <p> AccumulatedDepreciation <p> EndingValue <p> 1 <p> 2012 <p> $10,000 <p> $750 <p> $750 <p> $9,250 <p> 2 <p> 2013 <p> $9,250 <p> $1,000 <p> $1,750 <p> $8,250 <p> 3 <p> 2014 <p> $8,250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> $7,250 <p> $1,000 <p> $3,750 <p> $6,250 <p> 5 <p> 2016 <p> $6,250 <p> $1,000 <p> $4,750 <p> $5,250 <p> 6 <p> 2017 <p> $5,250 <p> $1,000 <p> $5,750 <p> $4,250 <p> 7 <p> 2018 <p> $4,250 <p> $1,000 <p> $6,750 <p> $3,250 <p> 8 <p> 2019 <p> $3,250 <p> $1,000 <p> $7,750 <p> $2,250 <p> 9 <p> 2020 <p> $2,250 <p> $1,000 <p> $8,750 <p> $1,250 <p> 10 <p> 2021 <p> $1,250 <p> $250 <p> $9,000 <p> $1,000 <p> In the last line of the depreciation schedule you will note that the accumulated depreciation ( $9,000 ) and the salvage value ( $1,000 ) add up to the original cost of the machine . <h> Small Business Owners Beware ! <p> In my 30-plus years of being a small business owner I have seen a lot of small business start-ups fail simply because the small business owners had no formal knowledge of accrual based accounting . In turn , this caused the owners to mistake excess cash as being spendable profit . <p> Of course , if a small business owner continues to spend profits that do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital and fails . <p> And one of the most common causes for a small business running out of operating capital , is the failure to set aside depreciation expenses as they accrue . <p> Using the $10,000 machine example , just because you are not writing a $1,000 check for the machine 's depreciation on an annual basis , does not mean you have an extra $1,000 to spend . It means that you should be setting $1,000 aside each year so you can replace the machine at the end of its useful life -- without dipping into your operating capital . <p> With that , let 's use the Straight Line Depreciation Calculator to calculate an asset 's depreciable base and first , final , and mid-years expense amounts . <p> Straight Line Depreciation Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the asset 's acquisition cost or adjusted basis , the estimated salvage value , and the estimated number of years you expect the asset to last for ( useful life ) . <p> Next , enter the number of months that were remaining in the tax year when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the year the asset was placed in service ( optional ) and select whether or not you would like a depreciation schedule included in the results , and then click the " Calculate Depreciation " button . @qwx194657 <h> Straight Line Depreciation Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Asset name : Optional : If you would like the name of the asset , or General Asset Account ( GAA ) included in the title of the depreciation schedule , enter the name in this field . <p> Purchase or acquisition cost : Enter the total cost to acquire the asset , or the adjusted basis , whichever is the lesser amount .

In fact , ignoring the concepts brought to light in this calculator could end up costing you a vast fortune in potential future wealth ! <p> Specifically , this free online Time Value Money Calculator will calculate the time and financial opportunity costs of buying and owning goods for which the value declines with time and use , and which often come with one or many ongoing costs of ownership . These goods are often referred to as depreciable or depreciating assets . <p> The time value money calculator will also translate the monetary opportunity costs into the opportunity cost of time , as in , how many hours could you take take off from work at some point in future if you invested the cost of buying and owning instead of repeatedly buying and owning new versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculating opportunity costs for purchases for which the value lasts less than one year , and that do not come with ongoing ownership costs , please visit the TVM for Consumables Calculator -- which also includes the answer to " What is Time Value of Money ? " as well as an eye-opening explanation of the little-thought-of concept I refer to as , The Money Value of Your Time . <p> Or , if you are interested in using a calculator specific to one of the 4 primary time value of money concepts , please choose from the following calculating options : <h> What Are Depreciable Assets ? <p> As they relate to personal finance , depreciable assets are physical goods that maintain at least a portion of their value for longer than one year , but for which the value declines with use and/or the passage of time . For our purposes , the term value refers to resale value , as in , how much money will a buyer be willing to pay for the asset at a given point in time . <h> The Price Tag on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ocean <p> In my experience the typical consumer only uses two factors when deciding whether or not to purchase a depreciable asset . First , how much does it cost ? And second , can I afford the monthly payment ? In fact I would venture to guess that many consumers only consider the latter of the two . <p> In either case , using only these one or two factors to decide on whether or not to buy a depreciable asset is comparable to a shift taking place between two plates on the ocean floor of your financial future . The wave the poor decision creates may appear small while it 's still far from your future , but when the tsunami arrives on the shore of your financial future it may arrive with such destructive force that no amount of your potential wealth will be left standing . <p> What most people fail to realize when considering the purchase of a depreciable asset , is that the amount printed on the asset 's price tag often represents only a small fraction of eventual cost to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount printed on price tag , the mere act of buying a depreciable asset often inflates the cost . I call these point-of-sale increases , " Purchase Costs . " These purchase costs include costs such as sales tax , extended warranties , shipping and handling fees , loan costs , finance charges , and so on . And speaking of purchase costs , here 's something to gnaw on . What use would these purchase costs serve if purchased without the asset ? <p> Second , in addition to the base price and purchase costs , many depreciable assets come with one or more ongoing ownership costs . These ongoing ownership costs include expenses such as energy ( gas , fuel oil , electricity , propane , etc. ) , insurance , storage , maintenance , repairs , depreciation ( loss of value due to time and/ or use ) , and so on . <p> But wait , even if you were to take the time to calculate the total cost of buying and owning a depreciable asset ( such as an automobile ) , for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still just a small wave in the ocean of your financial future . <h> The Opportunity Cost Tsunami <p> Throughout this website I 've been like Paul Revere riding my web-horse through the streets while screaming , " The opportunity costs are coming ! The opportunity costs are coming ! " Well , if you 've ignored my warnings in the past , I hope for the sake of the survival of your potential future wealth that you will pay very close attention here . <p> To illustrate the tsunami effect of the cost of buying and owning a major depreciable asset , let 's suppose you just purchased a new automobile with a price tag of $25,000 and you plan to keep it for 5-years -- at which point you figure you could sell it for $10,000 . Further suppose that you paid a 7% sales tax , purchased a $700 extended warranty , and you paid $5,000 down on the vehicle -- financing the rest at 8% for 60 months . Finally , you estimate that your annual ownership costs will include $2,400 for gas , $700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $130 for licensing . <p> If you plug the above variables into the time value money calculator , you will see that the average annual cost of buying and owning the car for 5-years would amount to $8,052.46 -- for a total 5-year cost of $40,262.30 . But that only covers 5-years of your need for an automobile . What about the rest of the time you will need a vehicle ? <p> If you expect to repeat this car buying scenario every five years for the next thirty years , the time value money calculator reports a total 30-year cost of $241,573.80 . In other words , the cost to buy and own a $25,000 car for 30-years will add up to nearly a quarter of a million dollars . Actually ... it will cost you a lot more than that ! <p> If you found a way to go without buying and owning this vehicle , and instead invested the $8,052.46 annual ownership costs into an investment earning 6% per year , the time value money calculator calculates that at the end of 30-year period your investment would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $241,573.80 spent , plus $395,039.08 in lost interest earnings ) . That , my friend , is the true cost of buying and owning a $25,000 car for 30-years . <p> But wait ! Do you know what the actual difference is between having spent $241,573.80 and having $636,612.88 in your possession ? It 's a difference of $878,186.68 ( $636,612.88 - -$241,573.80 = $878,186.68 ) . Shut the door ! <p> And remember , that 's only one example of one depreciable asset ! Imagine what the opportunity costs will add up to for all of the depreciable assets you will buy and own during the course of your lifetime . Can you now see the ever-growing size of the wave that 's bearing down on your financial future ? <h> How to Earn Hundreds of Dollars Per Hour <p> Sure , you may not be able to get by without owning a car , but if you play around with the time value money calculator you will see that even small reductions in price , purchase and ownerships costs for large-ticket assets can add up to tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . <p> In effect , this means that the time you spend researching the best deal for an essential , large-ticket depreciable asset can translate into an hourly wage equaling hundreds of dollars ( a penny saved is a penny earned ) . <p> Referring back to the car buying example , I can virtually guarantee you that your friendly neighborhood car salesman -- you know , the one that claims to care about you so much -- will never point out the true cost of buying and owning what he is selling you . But not because he is intentionally withholding this sales-killing information just to make the sale , but because he 's likely not aware of these costs himself . <p> You see , what 's even more shocking than the size of the powerful opportunity cost tsunami that 's bearing down on the financial futures of the majority of consumers is the fact that most of us managed to go through 13-years of public education without ever hearing the term " opportunity cost . " We were shown how to dissect a frog , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might keep us from building our financial futures on the shores of a major fault line . <p> I guess you could say that the failure of our k-12 educational system to teach us the concept of " opportunity cost " left most of us to go through life walking around with our heads up our assets . <p> With that , let 's use the Time Value Money Calculator to calculate the time and financial opportunity costs of buying and owning a specific depreciable asset . <p> Time Value of Money Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter annual interest rate you expect to earn on your investments , your hourly wage ( to convert annual salary to hourly wage ) , and the number of years you would like to calculate opportunity cost for . <p> Next , fill in all applicable blank fields in the Asset Purchase Variables , Financing Variables , and Annualized Ownership Costs sections .

This reduction in value during the ownership period is referred to as depreciation . The time value money calculator will divide the total depreciation by the years of ownership in order to arrive at the annual cost of depreciation . In reality , most assets depreciate at a much faster rate in the early years of ownership as compared to the later years of ownership . This is why buying a new version of depreciable asset every one or two years will cost you a fortune in depreciation costs when compared to buying a new version every 10 years . <p> Sales tax percentage , if applicable : If sales tax will be charged on the base price of the asset , enter the percentage here ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculator will calculate the sales tax dollar amount by multiplying the sales tax percentage by the base price entered earlier . <p> Extended warranty , shipping , appraisal , title fees : Enter the total of any miscellaneous fees and charges that would be considered useless if purchased without the asset .

The time value money calculator will require an entry in this field before it will calculate the monthly payment . <p> Repayment term in number of months : Enter the number monthly payments you will make before the financed portion of the purchase is paid off . The time value money calculator will require an entry in this field before it will calculate the monthly payment . <p> Loan costs : Enter the total of any loan costs that serve to increase the amount to finance , but that would be worthless without the asset ( origination fees , etc . ) . Note that the time value money calculator will not be roll these costs into the loan amount for calculating payments , but will include them in the average annual loan costs . <p> Monthly payment : This is the calculated monthly payment derived from the amount to finance , the finance rate , and the number of monthly payments .

While most people do not consider buildings to be depreciable assets , unless they are made of an indestructible alloy , father time will see to it that they will eventually need to be replaced . Sure , your property as a whole may increase in value ( or may drop in value ) , but all buildings come with ongoing costs of ownership which serve to nullify any appreciation in property values that may occur ( plus , property value increases also result in higher taxes ) .

Please note that if you have high interest debt that could be reduced or paid off with money saved by eliminating this depreciable asset from your buying habits , then the financial opportunity cost of repeating this buying scenario is actually much greater than the time value money calculator is reporting . <p> Time opportunity cost : Based on your entries , this is the total number of hours you could take off from work if you invested the cost of buying and owning the depreciable -- after the entered number of opportunity cost years have passed . So if there is something you would rather do with the time you spend at work , then the financial opportunity costs would further lead to personal opportunity costs ( good times lost ) .

Meanwhile , people who limited their investing to low-risk or government insured investments ( such as CD investing and debt investment ) , certainly experience a marked reduction in their return on investment , but they did n't lose a single dollar of their principal . And since people like that tend to have little or no debt payments , a reduction in income is far less of a concern for them . <h> Who Should You Listen To For Investment Advice ? <p> The bottom line when it comes to who you should listen to when it comes to deciding where to invest money , is listen to your own gut feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best interests over their own ?

@@14740793 @3340793/ <h> CD Laddering Calculator to Calculatea Certificate of Deposit Ladder <p> Explains what a CD Ladder is , and helps you to build a ladder based on your ability to fund it and on your comfort level . <p> This free online CD Laddering Calculator will calculate a certificate of deposit ladder based on the amount of funds you have available for CD investing , as well as the length of time you are comfortable with not having access to your cash . <p> Plus , unlike some online certificate of deposit calculators , the CD laddering calculator on this page allows you to incorporate minimum deposit requirements into the calculations , and builds a CD ladder based on common certificate of deposit terms . After all , what good is a CD ladder full of CDs with terms that are hard to find , or with deposit amounts that are below the minimums required ? <h> What is a CD Ladder ? <p> A CD ladder is a method of purchasing certificates of deposit in such as way as to earn a higher interest rate while still having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frequency you can be comfortable with . <p> More specifically , a CD ladder is the process of splitting a lump sum into numerous CDs , each with a longer maturity than the previous . This allows you to earn the higher rates of the longer terms while still having maturities coming due on a short-term basis . <h> How Does a CD Ladder Work ? <p> To illustrate how a CD ladder works , suppose you had $10,000 available for CD investing , but you 're afraid to tie up your cash for any longer than 6-months . Therefore , you elect to purchase a $10,000 6-month certificate of deposit that pays you , say 1% interest . The downside of this certificate of deposit investment is that if you purchased a 36-month certificate of deposit you might have been able to earn 2.25% on your money -- thereby more than doubling your interest earnings . <p> With CD laddering , you can achieve a happy medium . <p> Using the above example , instead of investing $10,000 in a single 6-month certificate of deposit earning only 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deposit -- each with a term that is 6-months longer than the others . In this case you would put 1/6th into a 6-month CD , 1/6th into a 12-month CD , 1/6th into an 18-month CD , and so on . <p> Next , as each of your original CDs reach maturity , you roll them over into a certificate of deposit having the longest term -- which in our example is 36 months . <p> The beauty of CD laddering , is that eventually all of your money will be earning the higher interest rate ( 2.25% in our example ) , but you will still have access to 1/6th of your cash every six months . Cool ! <h> When Should You Consider CD Laddering ? <p> CD laddering , or CD investing in general , should only be considered if you have a fully funded emergency fund ( 3-6 months of your take-home pay , preferably stored in a money market account ) , and you have paid off all of your high interest debt . <p> If you do n't have a fully funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings into an account where emergency withdrawals will wipe out your interest earnings -- or worse , incur early withdrawal penalties . <p> Or , if you have outstanding high interest debt , then it does n't make any sense to earn 1-3% in a certificate of deposit when you can earn 18% by using the cash to invest in your debt . <p> With that , let 's use the CD Laddering Calculator to build and calculate a certificate of deposit ladder based on the total you have available for CD investing , and on your comfort level . <p> CD Laddering Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the amount you have available for CD investing and the minimum deposit requirement ( optional ) . <p> Next select the longest maturity you would feel comfortable with and select the applicable compounding interval . <p> Next , edit the certificate of deposit interest rates as you see fit , and then click the " Calculate a Certificate of Deposit Ladder " button . @qwx194657 <p> Longest your are willing to wait between maturities : Select the longest number of months you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cash tied up in CDs .

Typically , the more frequent the compounding , the more interest you will earn in the same amount of time .

Business owners have the ability to make company decisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions you wo n't have a say in , is whether or not the MLM company decides to go out of business . <p> Imagine spending months or years to build an MLM organization and a respectable income , only get a notice from the company owner stating they 've decided to go out of business . It happens all the time . <h> MLM is NOT Easy <p> Like any other business , you can expect to put in many hours of work before you see any profits . It takes the average business two years of long hours and hard work before they start seeing profits , and another year or two before the owners can claim they 're making more money working for themselves than they could working for someone else . <h> Commission Checks Are NOT Profits <p> If you decide to become a commissioned sales person for a MLM company , be sure to keep track of every hour of time you spend learning and working on building your commission check . Also keep track of every expense you incur along the way . Expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marketing material , demo products , advertising , long distance calls , gas and wear and tear on your automobile , and so on . <p> Why keep track of all the time and expense ? Because you wo n't be able to claim you 've made a profit until your cumulative commission checks total up to more than what it cost you to build the commission checks . And that includes an amount for what your time is worth ( you could have earned a wage with those hours ) . <h> Five Do NOT get Five <p> What causes the average , otherwise shy person to suddenly think they can be a wealth-generating salesman ? Because someone showed them " the math . " I 'm sure you 've heard it . All you have to do is find 5 people to join , and those 5 will find five , and those five will get five , and 6 months later you will have 20,000 people working for you , and you 'll be earning $10,000 per month . Really ? <p> Here 's the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 5 people you will need to start with a list of 125 prospects . Why ? Because of the 125 prospects only 20% ( 25 ) will agree to hear your sales presentation . And of those 25 only 5 ( 20% ) will join . But wait , did you know the average MLM associate quits after just 4 months ? That means that you will need to recruit 5 new people ( another 125 prospects ) every 4 months just to keep from going backwards . And guess what , this applies to your entire organization ! ( The MLM Income Calculator will alert you to 80/20 numbers when you click the " Show Summary " button . ) <p> Do n't get me wrong . I 'm not trying to discourage you or tell you it ca n't be done . I just want you to know what the MLMs sales-presentation is n't going to tell you . The truth is , all sales-presentations are manipulative and misleading , because they exaggerate and emphasize the positive aspects of buying , while downplaying and ignoring the negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales-presentations are n't telling you ( the negative ) so that hopefully you can make more informed decisions . <h> Friends and Family Are NOT Prospects <p> The minute you approach a friend or family member with a business proposition , an element of trust is lost that may never be reclaimed . It 's a no win situation . Your friend or family member will always feel guilty for either turning you down , or for not working as hard as you think they should be . Sure , your friend or family member might beat the odds and actually end up thanking you for showing them the opportunity . But do you really want to take the chance they wo n't ? <h> Have You Dreamed of the Day You Could Sell This Product ? <p> In my experience , what separates happy , successful people from unhappy , not-so-successful people , is successful people tend to choose to pursue a work they are truly and genuinely passionate about -- irrespective of what that work might pay . They do n't need to be told to study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those things on their own because there 's nothing else they would rather do ! <p> One of the primary problems with MLM opportunities , is that you end up with an organization full of people that constantly need to be motivated ... because selling your product is not what they 've dreamed about doing with their lives . In other words , they did n't choose to be part of your organization because they were truly and genuinely passionate about selling your product . The only reason they chose to sign up , other than perhaps not being able to say " no " to pressure , was for the money . Unfortunately , they quickly learn ( usually within 4 months ) that it 's going to take a lot of unenjoyable time and effort before they see any significant amount of money . <p> The next time you are being presented an income opportunity , I encourage you to ask yourself this question . If money were no object , would I agree to volunteer to perform this work full time , free of charge ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further investigation . If the answer is no , I suggest you keep looking . <p> With that , let 's use the MLM Income calculator to estimate your monthly income based on your recruiting and sales projections .

Next , on the first line ( you ) , enter your commission percentage on your own personal sales and enter your personal monthly sales volume . <p> Then , for each applicable level beneath yours , enter your commission percent for that level and the number of associates you expect to have on that level . @qwx194657 <h> MLM Income Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Average monthly sales volume per associate : The total monthly sales volume of all associates in an MLM organization , divided by the number of associates . Typically average sales volume runs between $45 and $65 per month per associate . <p> Auto Fill : This is optional , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the # Assoc. column for you , enter the percentage you feel others in your organization will duplicate your efforts ( probably only about 20% ) , enter the number of associates you will personally recruit , enter the number of levels to fill ( max of 10 ) , and then click the Auto Fill button .

Keep in mind that the average person will quit after 4-months , so you will need to continually motivate your organization to never stop recruiting . Clicking the " Show Summary " button at the bottom of the MLM Income Calculator will translate what the drop-out rate might mean to your organization . <p> Monthly Volume : The first line ( you ) is where you can enter your own monthly sales volume .

And while the house may grow in value over time ( pure speculation ) , the money you pay out for interest charges represents a value that is lost forever . <p> In order to determine the opportunity cost of the interest charges you will pay on a home loan , you first need to determine how much these interest charges will add up to over the course of the home loan repayment term ( the monthly house payment calculator on this page will help you to do just that ) . <p> Once you have totaled up the home mortgage interest charges , the next step is to ask yourself , " What else could I spend that money on if I chose not to borrow money to purchase a home ? " <p> If you 're like most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may not have occurred to you is , " time off from work . " <h> The Opportunity Cost of Lost Time Off From Work <p> Every dollar you spend on home loan interest charges is money that could have been used to meet your other financial obligations . This means that if your cost of living averages out to $100 per day , then every $100 you spend on interest charges represents one day that you could have taken off from work had you paid cash for a home rather than borrowed the money to purchase it . The monthly house payment calculator on this page will estimate how many 40-hour work weeks it will take you just to pay the interest charges on your home loan . <p> Sure , we all need somewhere to live . But we do have a choice as to whether we satisfy that need with a $30,000 mobile home or with a $3,000,000 ocean-front mansion . <p> Unfortunately most of us have been brainwashed into believing that we are entitled to the instant gratification we can get from purchasing a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the reason no one is trying to convince us to do otherwise is because no one stands to get rich from promoting the concept of saving up and paying cash for the things we desire . <p> In fact , the reason you wo n't likely find another monthly house payment calculator on the web that calculates the opportunity cost of taking out a home mortgage is because all of the other calculators are created for mortgage and real estate companies . And the last thing they want you to do is to become aware of the drawbacks to following their advice . <p> I know this may be difficult for you to comprehend , but it is possible to purchase a home with cash -- thereby preserving a mountain of your free time for other things besides working to pay the interest on your mortgage .

Also include any money you will save in home ownership costs ( insurance , utilities , maintenance , repairs , property taxes , etc. ) from buying or renting a much smaller residence . <p> Once your savings has grown to the point that you can afford to pay cash for a larger residence , pay cash for the larger residence but continue to deposit the previous amount into your home buying savings account . <p> Repeat step #4 as often as you deem necessary . <p> If you follow the Grow Slow , Pay As You Go home buying method , three things will happen . <p> First , you will fully appreciate every dwelling upgrade .

This is due to all of the interest you will earn on the invested mortgage payments you wo n't have to make , combined with all of the mortgage interest charges you will save by not having a mortgage . <p> And finally , the third thing that will happen is that at some point you can choose to stop buying larger homes and instead simply use your investments to supplement your income -- meaning you can take more time off from work to spend time doing things that are most important to you . <p> If you opt for the popular instant gratification home buying plan ( Grow Fast , Pay Later ) , all of the interest charges you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home 's mortgage company will have more time to do what is important to them . <p> With that , let 's use the Monthly House Payment Calculator to calculate the monthly payment , total interest cost , and required work hours associated to repaying an amount of money borrowed to purchase a home . <p> Calculate House Payment and Interest Cost <p> Instructions : Enter the home loan amount , the annual percentage rate ( APR ) , the home loan term in months , and your real hourly wage ( optional ) , then click the " Calculate House Payment " button . @qwx194657 <h> Monthly House Payment Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Home loan amount : The dollar amount of the home loan ( principal amount ) .

Equity is the difference between what you owe on the home and what the home is expected to sell for . So if you currently owed $125,000 on a home that would sell for $150,000 , you would have $25,000 in equity . <p> Of course the lending institutions view the equity in your home as a potential revenue source .

That 's because the holder of the first house loan gets paid first when the home is sold in foreclosure , and if the proceeds are n't enough to cover the equity loan , you are left holding the bill -- even though you no longer own the home . <p> Higher Rates : Since the lender holding the equity loan is more at risk than the primary lender , interest rates for second mortgages are typically higher than rates for first mortgages . Therefore , if you are considering an equity loan , you might be better off by refinancing your first mortgage with a " cash-out " option .

If you own a farm , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 100+ non-typical types of businesses , and want to know exactly what your depreciation expense is , you may need to either hire a tax lawyer , or spend a week studying the Publication 946 -- depending on what type of business you are engaged in and on whether or not you have an infallible , photographic memory . <h> How To Figure MACRS Depreciation <p> In order to calculate MACRS depreciation you will need to determine five different variables that make up the formula . I will try to summarize each as they relate to the typical business . <h> Basis <p> Basis is the cost to acquire the property ( price , sales tax , etc. ) , less any land that was included in the acquisition cost , less the percentage the property will be used for personal use . Note that since MACRS fully depreciates property , salvage value is not used to adjust the basis . <h> Property Classification <p> A property 's classification determines which depreciation method you can use , as well as its allowable cost recovery period . <p> At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of property . However , before you can make a final decision as to your property 's recovery period , you must first read through more than 120 different activity classifications listed in Table B-2 to see if the activity the property is used for overrides the recovery period as stated in Table B-1 . <h> Allowable Recovery Period <p> While there are 9 different recovery periods ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 27.5 , and 39 years ) , most businesses property falls into the 5 , 7 , 27.5 , or 39 year recovery period . The allowable recovery period for a specific property depends on which classification you decide it belongs in . <h> Depreciation Method <p> Depending on what type of property you are depreciating , you may have the option of choosing either the declining balance method or the straight line method . If you are depreciating real property you have no choice but to use the straight line method . <p> Furthermore , if using a declining balance method , at the point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the straight-line method , the depreciation schedule switches to the straight-line method for the remainder of the recovery period . After all , if you never switched to the straight-line method you would never be able to fully depreciate the property . <h> Convention <p> Convention is the term used by the IRS to describe what percentage of the property cost can be recovered the first year an asset is placed in service . This percentage depends on which of the three following conventions the property falls into : <p> Mid-Month : Usually applies to real property . Regardless of what day of the month the property is placed in service , 1/2 month depreciation is added to the full in-service months to determine the prorated percentage . <p> Mid-Quarter : If the mid-month convention does not apply , but 40% or more of your total annual depreciable property was placed in service in the last quarter of the year , this convention is used . Regardless of what day in a quarter the property is placed in service , 1/2 quarter depreciation is added to the full in-service quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither the mid-month or the mid-quarter convention applies , this convention is used . In this case , no matter what date the property is placed in service , 1/2 year depreciation is used ( 50% of the full , 1-year depreciation expense ) . <p> That is just a brief summary of the five variables that need to be determined in order to calculate depreciation using the MACRS method . <h> MACRS Depreciation Tables <p> Once you have solved for the 5 dependent variables , the next step in figuring a property 's allowable depreciation expense is to use Charts 1-3 ( Appendix A in IRS Publication 946 ) to determine which percentage table to refer to in order to look up the percentage needed for the applicable recovery year . <p> Next , once you know which percentage table to use , you then find that table and cross-reference the recovery year ( left-hand column ) with the recovery period ( top row ) . The table cell where the intersection of the cross reference occurs will list the percentage figure needed to calculate the property 's depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you multiply the property 's basis by the percentage figure to arrive at the property 's depreciation expense for the year . <h> Example of How to Calculate Depreciation Using the MACRS Tables <p> To illustrate how to figure depreciation using the MACRS depreciation method and tables , suppose you purchased an office desk at a total cost of $800.00 and placed the desk in service on April 15th of 2014 . <p> Further suppose you want to calculate the desk 's depreciation expense for the 2015 tax year . Here are the steps to arriving at the answer : <p> Determine basis : You see in your records that the total cost to purchase the desk was $800.00 and you determine the desk is used 100% for business activity . <p> Determine property class : Referring the Table B-1 in Appendix A of Pub 946 , we see that a desk falls within the asset class 00.11 ( Office Furniture , Fixtures , and Equipment ) , which lists a 7-year recovery period . <p> Determine depreciation method : Since a desk is not real property , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . We will choose the 200% declining balance method since we want to recover the cost as quickly as possible . <p> Determine convention : The desk is not real property so mid-month is not an option . You determine that the property placed in service in the last quarter of 2014 was less than 40% of the total for the year , therefore mid-quarter is not an option . This means the convention for the desk is the half-year convention . <p> Determine appropriate percentage table : Referring to Chart 1 in Appendix A of Pub 946 we see that a 7-year property using the 200% method with a half-year convention points us to table A-1 . <p> Look up percentage : Referring to Table A-1 in Appendix A of Pub 946 we see that the intersection of Year #2 in the left-hand column and the 7-year recovery period in the heading row lists the percentage 24.49% . <p> Multiply basis by percentage : Multiplying the $800.00 ( desk basis ) by .2449 ( 24.49% ) tells us that our depreciation expense for the desk for the 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here is the depreciation schedule for the above example , as generated by the MACRS Depreciation Calculator located on this page : <p> Desk Depreciation Schedule <p> # <p> Year <p> Basis <p> % <p> DepreciationExpense <p> AccumulatedDepreciation <p> EndingBook Value <p> M <p> 1 <p> 2014 <p> $800 <p> 14.286% <p> $114 <p> $114 <p> $686 <p> DB <p> 2 <p> 2015 <p> $800 <p> 24.490% <p> $196 <p> $310 <p> $490 <p> DB <p> 3 <p> 2016 <p> $800 <p> 17.493% <p> $140 <p> $450 <p> $350 <p> DB <p> 4 <p> 2017 <p> $800 <p> 12.495% <p> $100 <p> $550 <p> $250 <p> DB <p> 5 <p> 2018 <p> $800 <p> 8.925% <p> $71 <p> $622 <p> $178 <p> SL <p> 6 <p> 2019 <p> $800 <p> 8.925% <p> $71 <p> $693 <p> $107 <p> SL <p> 7 <p> 2020 <p> $800 <p> 8.925% <p> $71 <p> $764 <p> $36 <p> SL <p> 8 <p> 2021 <p> $800 <p> 4.462% <p> $36 <p> $800 <p> $0 <p> SL <p> Note that since the declining balance ( DB ) depreciation for year 2018 ( $71 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SL ) depreciation ( $71 ) , straight line depreciation is used for year 2018 as well as the remainder of the recovery period -- as indicated in the " M " ( Method ) column . <h> Verify The Results ! <p> Due to the complex and ever-changing nature of depreciation tax laws , please consider the results of the MACRS Depreciation Calculator to be for illustrative purposes only . <p> In other words , be sure to consult a qualified tax professional and/or IRS Publication 946 before completing your depreciation-related tax forms . <p> With that , let 's use the MACRS Depreciation Calculator to calculate a property 's depreciation rate and expense for a given tax year based on Chapter 4 of IRS Publication 946 . <p> MACRS Depreciation Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the personal or real property acquisition cost or unadjusted basis , enter the percentage the property is used for business purposes , and select the cost recovery period from the list based on the property 's MACRS classification . <p> Next , select the applicable depreciation method and convention , and select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in service . <p> Finally , enter the year you want to calculate depreciation expense for and select whether or not you would like a depreciation schedule included in the results , and then click the " Calculate MACRS Depreciation " button . @qwx194657 <h> MACRS Depreciation Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Asset name : If you would like the name of the asset , or General Asset Account ( GAA ) included in the title of the MACRS depreciation schedule , enter the name in this field . <p> Basis : Enter the total cost to acquire the property ( unadjusted basis ) .

If you 're spending 80-hours a week engaged in activities you do n't enjoy , then it 's unlikely the 6-figure income and the few hours of free time will be able to make up for all those hours of misery . <p> Having experienced this phenomenon myself , my answer to anyone who ever asks me whether or not I think they should start a particular business , is to ask themselves this question ... <p> If you had all of the money you could ever spend , would you still open this business just because it would be an enjoyable way to help others solve a problem that 's important to you ? <p> If their answer to that question is a " no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass on that particular business opportunity . <p> If you do n't enjoy the type of work you will be doing day-in and day-out , and/or the problem the business attempts to solve for others is not that dear to you , then any financial profits it generates for you will likely be more than offset by your emotional losses . <h> Small Business Lesson #2 <h> It 's Easier To Go Broke Laying On Your Couch Doing Nothing <p> One of the biggest mistakes I made early on in my entrepreneurial journey -- and one I made more than once -- was falling in love with a business idea so much that I felt a thorough research of its profitability potential was unnecessary . <p> After going through several business failures it finally occurred to me that it 's a lot easier to go broke laying on the couch than it is to work 80-hours a week to go broke . <p> Once I fully embraced that concept I began to approach each subsequent business idea with the mindset that the business idea was destined to fail -- unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove otherwise .

@@14740809 @3340809/ <p> Plus , the adjustable rate mortgage payment calculator ( also called a variable rate mortgage calculator ) on this page will also calculate the total interest charges you will end up paying on the ARM , and will allow you to view and print out a summary and amortization schedule . <h> Definition of Adjustable Rate Mortgage ( ARM ) <p> In case you 're not familiar with the term , an adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) , also referred to as a variable rate mortgage , refers to a type of mortgage ( home loan ) that has a fluctuating annual percentage rate ( APR ) . The amount and direction by which the ARM rate fluctuates is based on a variety of indices ( US Treasury Bills , Cost of Funds Index , etc. ) , with the periodic adjustments occurring at preset intervals ( usually once each year following the time the initial APR is guaranteed for ) . <p> The typical ARM loan has an initial APR that is guaranteed to remain constant for the first 1-15 years of the repayment period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent adjustment period ( usually 12 months , but can be as high as 180 months ) . For example , an ARM loan may have an initial guaranteed APR of 6% for the first 36 months , after which it could increase by a maximum of .25% per year . <p> ARM loans usually come with a rate cap , which is the maximum APR that can be charged . So if an ARM loan has a rate cap of 10% , that will be most the lender can charge you during the repayment period . However , be aware that if you are being charged the maximum APR and the rate later falls to below the maximum , the lender will likely try to recover their losses by not lowering your APR ( referred to as a carryover ) . <p> Of course , as the APR changes on an ARM loan , so do the size of the monthly house payments . As interest rates rise , the monthly payments rise , and visa versa . This can wreak major havoc on even the best of household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARMS : Hybrid ARMs offer a mixture of fixed and adjustable rate terms , and are usually listed as 3/1 , 5/1 , 5/5 , 7/1 , 10/1 , or 15/15 . The number appearing before the slash refers to the number of years the APR will be fixed , while the number after the slash refers to adjustment interval in years . Therefore the APR on a 5/1 ARM will be fixed for 5 years , and may be adjusted once each year for the remainder of the repayment term . The adjustable rate mortgage payment calculator on this page is based on a Hybrid ARM . <p> Interest-Only ARMS : Interest only ARMs allow you to pay only the interest for a specified number of years -- usually for 3 to 10 years . This affords the borrower a low initial monthly payment , but at the expense of a much higher payment once the interest-only term has expired . Keep in mind that the longer the interest-only term , the higher will be the future principal plus interest payment . <p> Payment-Option ARMS : A payment-option ARM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . In this type of an ARM , you may choose to make a principal interest payment ( PI ) , or an interest-only payment , or a minimum payment . If you choose the latter option , be forewarned that it may lead to negative amortization , which means the minimum payment is less than the interest charged , which in turn will cause the principal ( amount you owe ) to increase ( balloon ) . <h> ARM Warnings <p> Be sure to be on the lookout for lenders offering teaser rates , or discounted rates . This is where ARM lenders offer an APR that is below the indexed APR just to get you to sign on the dotted line . Later , when the initial fixed term expires , you could experience a shocking payment increase that you may not be able to afford . <p> A second word of caution has to do with prepayments . Many ARM lenders assess stiff prepayment and conversion penalties if you make any attempt to shift the interest rate risk back on the lender . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if you try to convert the ARM to a fixed rate mortgage , you may be assessed stiff prepayment penalties or conversion fees . <p> While it may be true that ARM borrowers have saved money historically , it 's also important to realize the risk you are assuming before entering into an ARM . Lending institutions are much better equipped to assume the interest rate risk than you are . After all , they do n't face the prospect of losing their job and most of their risk is backed up with assets . You on the other hand , could lose your job or end up upside down in your mortgage ( house is worth more than you owe ) , so please consider those possibilities before you enter into an adjustable rate mortgage . <h> The Bottom Line <p> If you 've spent any time in the financial calculators section of this website , you will know that I 'm of the opinion that if you ca n't afford to pay cash for something , you ca n't afford it ( as in , the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and happiness ) .

In that regard , there are two rules you need to be aware of when attempting to translate the numerals into values : <p> If a letter representing an equal or greater value is placed directly in front of a letter representing an equal or smaller value , the two values are simply added together . For example , " XX " would translate to " 20 " and " XI " would translate to " 11 " . <p> If a letter representing a smaller value is placed directly in front of a letter representing a larger value , the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value . For example , " IX " would translate to " 9 " and " IV " would translate to " 4 " . <p> The following conversion chart shows how you would read the Roman numeral " MMMCDLXII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> How to Read the Roman Numeral " MMMCDLXII " <p> PlaceValue <p> RomanNumerals <p> Addition/Subtraction <p> ArabicNumerals <p> 1000s <p> MMM <p> 1000 + 1000 + 1000 <p> 3000 <p> 100s <p> CD <p> 500 - 100 <p> 400 <p> 10s <p> LX <p> 50 + 10 <p> 60 <p> 1s <p> II <p> 1 + 1 <p> 2 <p> Totals <p> MMMCDLXII <p> = <p> 3462 <p> Notice that in the 100s line , " CD " indicates a subtraction because " C " ( 100 ) is less than the " D " ( 500 ) it precedes . The above is how the Roman Numeral Converter shows its work . <h> How to Write Roman Numerals <p> In addition to the rules you have learned for reading Roman numerals , there are a few more rules you need to know when writing Roman numerals . <p> A letter can not be repeated more than 3 times in succession , and only powers of 10 can be repeated . In other words , " CCCC " is invalid , and " VVV " is invalid ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct way to write 400 , would be " CD " ( 500 - 100 = 400 ) , and the correct way to write 15 would be " XV " ( 10 + 5 = 15 ) . <p> Only powers of 10 ( 1 , 10 , 100 ) can be subtracted from a larger value . Therefore you could not write 5 as " VX " ( 10 - 5 = 5 ) because 5 is not a power of 10 . <p> Only a single smaller value may precede a larger value . This means you could not write 3 as " IIV " ( 5 - 1 - 1 = 3 ) because " II " is placing 2 smaller values in front of a larger value . <p> In the case of a smaller value being subtracted from a larger value , the larger value can not be more than 10 times the smaller value . In other words , you can not write 999 as " IM " ( 1000 - 1 = 999 ) because " M " is more than 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write 999 as " CMXCIX " ( 1000 - 100 ) + ( 100 - 10 ) + ( 10 - 1 ) . Are n't you glad we use Arabic numbers ? <p> In order to write numerals greater than 3999 ( without breaking any rules ) , you would need to place a line above the appropriate letters to indicate the value is a thousand times greater . For example , a " V " with a line above it would indicate 5000 ( 5 * 1000 ) . Note that the Roman numeral converter does not accommodate numbers or numerals greater than 3999 ( MMMCMXCIX ) . <p> With the above rules in mind , here is how you would write the Roman numeral for the Arabic number 2345 : <p> Writing the Roman numeral for " 2345 " <p> Digit <p> PlaceValue <p> Addition/Subtraction <p> RomanNumerals <p> 2 <p> 2000 <p> 1000 + 1000 <p> MM <p> 3 <p> 300 <p> 100 + 100 + 100 <p> CCC <p> 4 <p> 40 <p> 50 - 10 <p> XL <p> 5 <p> 5 <p> 5 <p> V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above is how the Roman Numeral Converter shows its work . <p> With that , let 's use the Roman Numeral Converter to translate to and from Arabic numbers , or to create a custom , printable Roman numeral chart . <p> Roman Numeral Converter <p> Instructions : Enter the an Arabic ( whole ) number or a Roman Numeral you would like to translate , and then click the " Convert Roman Numerals or Arabic Number " button . @qwx194657 <p> Arabic number or Roman numeral entry field : Enter either an Arabic number or a Roman numeral ( leave no spaces before , within , or after numbers or numerals ) .

@@14740821 @3340821/ <h> College GPA Calculator to CalculateAll Aspects of Grade Point Average <p> The College GPA Calculator on this page will calculate your current , cumulative , and target grade point average for any number of grading periods . <p> This free online grade point average calculator will help you to track your present GPA as well as set and meet goals for future grading periods ( semesters or quarters ) . <p> Specifically , this calculator creates individual GPA calculators for any number of grading periods you choose -- each of which recalculates as you type the credit hours and select the letter grades for each class . <p> And unlike most grade point average calculators , this one even allows you to track your major GPA separately from your overall GPA . <p> Plus , the calculator also includes features for tracking and calculating your cumulative GPA , as well as a built-in feature that tells you how many credits you need at 4.0 -- and how many you need at your own realistic grade point average -- to raise your GPA to a desired level . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also includes ... <p> a feature for changing the quality point multipliers for each letter grade . <p> a feature for converting between semester hours and quarter hours . <p> a printer friendly report feature . <h> What is GPA ? <p> GPA is an acronym for Grade Point Average , which is used to track your level of success for each grading period ( semester or quarter ) , as well as for tracking your cumulative measure of success over the course of your college education . <p> Since your GPA is one of the first things potential employers look for in your college transcript , it 's extremely important that you work hard to maintain a high GPA . This is especially true in the early days of your college education , because the more credit hours you accumulate at lower grades , the longer it will take to raise your GPA . <h> How to Calculate GPA for One Grading Period <p> In order to calculate your grade point average for one grading period , you first need to understand the key variables that make up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a number of credit hours assigned to it , which are usually listed in your school 's course catalog . Credit hours per class typically range between 1 and 5 . <p> Quality credit hours : Credit hours earned for classes that are taken for a letter grade versus classes taken on a Pass/No-Pass basis . <p> Quality point multipliers : The number of points awarded for an earned letter grade ( A = 4 points , B = 3 points , etc . ) . The quality point multipliers can vary slightly from school to school , which is why the calculator on this page allows you to edit the default multipliers to match those of your school . <p> Quality points : The product of the earned quality credit hours multiplied by the letter grade 's corresponding quality point multiplier . For example , if you earn an A in a 4-credit-hour class , the quality points earned would be 16 ( 4 credit hours x multiplier of 4 for an A = 16 ) . <p> So now that you understand the terms involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> GPA = <p> Total quality points earned <p> Total quality credit hours earned <p> Here is a screen shot from the printer friendly results generated by the calculator on this page : <p> Notice how the calculated points on each line are the product of the credit hours times the multiplier . The GPA is then figured by adding up the total points and dividing by the total quality credit hours . <h> How to Calculate Cumulative GPA <p> Your cumulative grade point average is calculated basically the same way you calculate GPA for a single grading period , except you will be using your total quality points to-date and total quality credit hours earned to-date . <p> Cumulative GPA = <p> Total quality points earned to date <p> Total quality credit hours earned to date <h> How to Calculate Credits and Grades Needed to Raise GPA <p> To calculate what you need to do to raise your grade point average from your present average to a desired average , you can use one of two methods : the Straight A Method , or the Realistic Grade Method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> The Straight A Method <p> This method calculates how many future credit hours you need to get straight " A " s ( 4.0 ) in to reach your target grade point average . The formula is as follows : <p> Straight A Credits = <p> Cum . GPA Credits x ( Target GPA - Cum . GPA ) <p> 4.0 - Target GPA <p> So if your cumulative grade point average is 2.5 after 60 credits , and you want to see how many future straight A credits you need to reach a target of 3.0 , here is how you would calculate the needed credits : <p> Straight A Credits = <p> 60 x ( 3.0 - 2.5 ) <p> 4.0 - 3.0 <p> Straight A Credits = <p> 60 x ( .5 ) <p> 1.0 <p> Straight A Credits = <p> 30 <p> 1.0 <p> Straight A Credits = <p> 30 <p> So using this method you would need to get straight " A " s in your next 30 quality credit hours in order to raise your grade point average from 2.5 to 3.0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A " s is beyond your time and/or abilities , this method calculates how many future credit hours you need to get at your personal , highest realistic grade point average in order to reach your target grade point average . The formula is as follows : <p> Realistic Credits = <p> Cum . GPA Credits x ( Target GPA - Cum . GPA ) <p> Realistic GPA - Target GPA <p> So if your cumulative grade point average is 2.5 after 60 credits , and you believe the highest grade point average you could realistically achieve for future classes would be 3.5 , here is how you would calculate how many 3.5 credits you need to reach a target of 3.0 : <p> Realistic Credits = <p> 60 x ( 3.0 - 2.5 ) <p> 3.5 - 3.0 <p> Realistic Credits = <p> 60 x ( .5 ) <p> 0.5 <p> Realistic Credits = <p> 30 <p> 0.5 <p> Realistic Credits = <p> 60 <p> So in order to raise your grade point average from 2.5 to 3.0 using a realistic future GPA of 3.5 , you would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How to Convert Between Semester Hours and Quarter Hours <p> If a portion of your earned credit hours are from a school that used different grading periods than your present school , then in order to calculate your cumulative grade point average you will need to convert the unlike credit hours to match the grading period of your present school . <p> Even though the calculator on this page has a built-in credit hour conversion tool , I will list the formulas used by the calculator in case you want to convert the hours manually . <p> Semester Hours = Quarter Hours x 1.5 <p> Quarter Hours = Semester Hours x .667 <p> With that , let 's use the College GPA Calculator to calculate any combination of your present , cumulative , and target grade point average . <p> College GPA Calculator <p> Instructions : Change the quality point multiplier scale if the default scale is different from the scale used by your school . <p> Next , select the grading period applicable to your school . <p> Next , if you would like to calculate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters ) , enter the number of grading periods and the maximum number of classes per grading period ( allow enough lines to cover all grading periods ) . <p> Next , if you would like to calculate your cumulative GPA based on one or more additional grading periods , enter your cumulative quality credit hours and your cumulative GPA . <p> Next , if you would like to see how many credits and at what grade point you will need to raise your GPA , enter your target GPA and your expected future GPA. @qwx194657 <p> Important : Changing any of the fields appearing above the " Create Interactive GPA Calculator " button will clear the dynamic display below the button . <h> College GPA Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Quality points multipliers : If the quality points multiplier ( A = 4.0 , etc. ) for any letter grade is different from those used by your school , change the multipliers here before moving on to the next line .

And they of all people should know what 's best for you , right ? <p> So would you go ahead and jump ? Of course not . <p> Comparatively speaking , this is how most people jump into financial obligations . Because they do n't take the time to track and accurately forecast their income and expenses , they end up relying on commissioned salespeople to advise them on whether or not to jump .

Many of the costs you need to be tracking are accumulating behind the scenes . <p> Everything you own that can wear out IS wearing out at this very moment . These are all assets that will need to be re-purchased at some point in the future . Therefore , when trying to determine how much you can afford to spend on something , it 's not enough to simply track the obvious monthly cash inflows and outflows ( most people do n't even do that much ) . You also need to track the rate at which what you own is wearing out so you can be setting aside funds to replace all of those assets as they need to be replaced . <p> For example , if you own a home you should be setting aside funds to replace all furniture , electronics , fixtures , appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , lawn and garden machines , and the list goes on . <h> How Do You Know How Much You Should Be Setting Aside ? <p> Well , and I know this may sound ridiculous to you , but just like successful businesses do , you need to make a list of everything that will require replacement . <p> Then for each item listed you need to estimate how many months ( years x 12 ) the asset will last and how much it will cost to replace the asset . <p> Next , divide the replacement cost of each asset by the number of months you estimate it will last . <p> Finally , total up all of the monthly replacement estimates to see how much you should be setting aside each month . <p> If you choose NOT to acknowledge or plan for these depreciation expenses , it does n't change the fact that they are accumulating behind the scenes .

Otherwise you would be able to pay cash for the car you are purchasing -- which would likely put an extra $2,000 to $4,000 dollars in your pocket ( or into your investments ) from the interest cost savings . <p> But here 's the real kicker . If you are borrowing money to purchase a car ( an asset that wears out ) , then in order to get ahead you will need to set aside ( deposit to " next car " savings account ) the monthly depreciation expense of the car -- which is an amount roughly equal to the monthly car loan payment you will already be making . <p> In other words , if you are borrowing money to purchase a car , then whatever monthly car payment you think you can afford would need to be cut at least in half before you enter the amount into the car affordability calculator . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be more than you can actually afford if you are not setting aside the monthly depreciation expenses of all of your other depreciable assets . <p> With that , let 's use the Car Affordability Calculator to calculate the size of the loan and purchase price you may be able to afford based on the monthly payment you think you can afford . <p> Calculate How Much Car Can You Afford <p> Instructions : Enter the monthly payment you could afford , the down payment amount you could afford , the trade-in allowance ( if applicable ) , and the amount you still owe on the vehicle you are trading in . <p> Next enter any rebate you will be applying to the purchase , the annual percentage rate , the number of payments , and the applicable sales tax percentage , then click the " Calculate How Much Car I Can Afford " button . @qwx194657 <h> Car Affordability Calculator Glossary of Terms <h> Car Affordability Calculator Entry Fields <p> Monthly payment amount you can afford : The monthly payment you feel you could afford after accounting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle , such as gas , insurance , maintenance , repairs , licensing , sheltering , and so on .

@@14740830 @3340830/ <h> Purchase Receipts Calculator for Easy Personal Expense Tracking <p> Show you an easy system for tracking expenses that works no matter how busy you are or how hectic your life is . <p> This free online Purchase Receipts Calculator will help you to tabulate and categorize your personal expenses from your purchase receipts . <p> After entering your receipts you can then print out a report that includes the time and financial opportunity costs of each expenditure , plus the total opportunity costs for each spending category and sub-category . Knowing these opportunity costs will help you to gain control over your spending . <p> Finally , the calculator 's printed report will provide you with an organized and easy way to enter your personal expenses into your preferred personal finance software . <h> The Importance of Keeping Track of Expenses <p> Living within a budget is a critical part of maximizing the happiness profits earned by you and your family . But the only way you can " live within " a budget is by having a realistic budget to begin with . <p> In my experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their budgets are based on overly optimistic spending forecasts instead of on historical facts . And after several failed attempts to live within these unrealistic budgets , most people just simply give up trying . <p> So if you truly want to maximize the emotional returns on the money you earn , the first step is to build a detailed and accurate record of your past spending . Once you have historical facts from which to base your budget on , the odds of successfully living within your means increases dramatically . <h> Keeping Track of Expenses the Hard Way <p> Most personal finance " experts " will tell you that the key to tracking your spending is to carry a notebook around with you and write down every penny you spend . <p> Well , that advice might have worked 20-30 years ago , but in today 's hectic , fast-paced world , thinking you will stop to write down every expense as they occur is just not a realistic solution for keeping track of expenses . <p> After all , not only do you have multiple sources from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , debit card , credit cards , money market account , etc. ) , but you can also spend money in multiple environments ( online , offline , etc . ) . Plus , where we used to live our lives in 6-hour blocks of time , we now live our lives in 2-hour blocks of time . <p> Add all of these time pressures and financial complexities together and it 's no wonder why so many people give up trying to keep track of their spending . <h> An Easy System for Personal Expense Tracking <p> Did you ever stop to consider that someone is already keeping track of your spending ? It 's true . Nearly every time you spend money the person or business receiving the money keeps a record of what you purchased and when you purchased it . And you , as the consumer , have the right to insist they provide you with a copy of that record ... otherwise known as a receipt ( sales slip ) . <p> In other words , instead of always stopping to write down what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on getting receipt , and then accumulate all of your receipts until you have time to enter them into your spending journal . <p> Of course , if you misplace or throw away those receipts , insisting on getting a receipt for your purchases wo n't do you any good . <h> How to Track Expenses Using Purchase Receipts <p> I have been using the receipt system to successfully track my own spending for years . In fact , the Purchase Receipts Calculator on this page is actually a tool I built for my own use several years ago . If you 've given up on keeping track of your spending , I strongly encourage to give this system a try . Here are the basic steps to using the receipt system . <p> Never , ever leave a spending event without a detailed receipt . In most cases the receipts you get will have the date , a breakdown of what you purchased , and the last four digits of your spending source if purchased with plastic . If the receipt you are handed fails to include these important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at that very moment . <p> Do n't allow a clerk to put your receipts in a bag . One of the things I learned early on in my use of the receipt system , is that shopping bags are like the Bermuda Triangle for receipts . I would see the receipt get put into the bag with my own eyes , yet later discover that the receipt had gone missing . <p> Designate a spot in your purse or wallet to place all receipts . Take my word for it , if you put your receipts in different locations on different occasions ( pocket , purse , glove compartment , etc. ) you will end up losing track of valuable records of your spending . <p> Designate a high-visibility spot on your desk for accumulating receipts . Periodically transfer the receipts from your wallet or purse to a designated , highly visible spot in the area you do your bill paying and money management . <p> Designate a block of time each week for recording receipts . Think of a time each week that you almost always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transfer the important information on your receipts to your preferred personal finance software . Early Sunday mornings have always worked the best for me . <h> Why Use the Purchase Receipts Calculator ? <p> By now you are probably wondering why you would want to enter your receipts into the Purchase Receipts Calculator , only to have to then enter the same information into your personal finance software . Here are a few reasons I use the calculator before entering the information into my own personal finance software . <p> To Stay Fully Aware of the Opportunity Costs of My Spending . On the printed spending report , every itemized expenditure lists the calculated time and financial opportunity costs they created . Just seeing how much you are giving up in return for what you are getting can help to make a significant increase in the emotional returns you are getting from the money you earn . <p> Allocate Sales Tax to Responsible Spending Categories . One of the most time consuming tasks in the receipt system is the process of separating taxable purchases from non-taxable purchases . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items from more than one spending sub-category , and I want to allocate sales tax to the responsible expenditures , I need to first separate the taxable from non-taxable , and then multiply each categorized taxable amount by the sales tax percentage . The calculator does all of the calculating for me . So even if you choose not to enter all of your receipts into the calculator , you might still find it useful for those receipts that cover multiple taxable and non-taxable expense sub-categories . <p> Detailed Hard Copy of Spending Record . If something happens that causes me to lose the data stored in both my expense tracker software and my back-up copy , I will still have a written record to rebuild my data from . Plus , one thing I do n't like about personal finance software is that it stores your information in the background of your life ( out of site out of mind ) . My printed spending and opportunity cost reports sit prominently on my desk ( foreground ) where I ca n't help but notice them . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the calculator , please let me know ( include a reference to " Purchase Receipts Calculator " when submitting the Contact Me form ) . <p> With that , let 's use the Purchase Receipts Calculator to tabulate and categorize your spending from your purchase receipts . <p> Purchase Receipts Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter your current age , the age you plan to retire at , your real hourly wage , the annual interest rate you expect to earn on your investments , and your local sales tax percentage rate . <p> Next , for each receipt , enter the date and a short name of who the receipt is from . Then select the payment source , enter the reference number , and enter the total from the receipt . <p> Next , for each spending sub-category the receipt contains , select the category and subcategory , and then enter a memo and the amount ( if different from the amount that is automatically filled in ) . If a receipt has more than one spending sub-category , and one or more of them are taxable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box checked . Also , regardless of whether it 's taxable , try to always leave the sub-category with the most items on the receipt for the last entry . <p> Once you have allocated the total receipt to various spending sub-categories , click the " Add Receipt to Purchase Receipts Calculator " button . Finally , after adding 5-10 receipts , click the " Create Spending Report " button to view and print your expense breakdown along with their time and financial opportunity costs . @qwx194657 <p> Important The calculator is for entering and printing results only and does not save your entries . If you refresh or leave the page you will lose your data . Therefore you should only enter 5-10 receipts at time , print the report , reset the calculator , and then enter another 5-10 receipts and repeat the process . <h> Purchase Receipts Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Retire age : Enter the age you plan or hope to retire at . The calculator will calculate the number of years till you retire and use that for calculating the opportunity costs of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real hourly wage : Enter your after-tax , after work-related-expense hourly wage . If you 're not sure what your real hourly wage is , please visit the Real Hourly Wage calculator ( opens in a new window ) . The calculator will use your real hourly wage to calculate the amount of time you are spending ( included in printed report ) . <p> Sales tax percentage : Enter your local sales tax percentage . The calculator will use this figure to help you assign sales tax to the sub-categories that you are charged sales tax on . <h> Receipt Entry Row <p> Date : Enter the date printed on the receipt . If you would like to be able to sort the report by Date , be sure to enter the date in a YYYYMMDD format ( August 9 , 2011 would be entered as 20110809 ) . <p> Paid To : Enter the name of the business the receipt is from . To keep the printed report from getting too wide or tall , try to enter a name that is just long enough to recognize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what method of payment was used to make this purchase . This is important for when you go to enter the receipts from the report into your whatever personal finance software you happen to use . <p> Ref # : Optional : Enter a reference number or name that points to the document or account used to make purchase . This could be a check number , the last for digits of the debt or credit card that was used , or the type of card used ( Visa , Mastercard , Discover , etc . ) . <p> Total : Enter the grand total listed on the receipt . In order for the calculator to work properly , this amount must be entered before allocating portions to sub-categories . <h> Receipt Allocation Columns <p> Spending category list : Select a category to display the list of sub-categories available to choose from . To help you to think of your life as a business ( in pursuit of happiness profits , not monetary profits ) I have created these 5 main categories of spending : <p> Entertainment : Non-essential expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attempting to buy the affections of another , keeping up with the Jones ' , feeding unhealthly habits , etc . <p> Personnel : Expenses related to caring , feeding , clothing , and educating you and the members of your household . <p> Residential : Expenses related to housing the members of your household . <p> Transportation : Expenses related to transporting members of your household . <p> Spending sub-category list : Click on the sub-category you want to assign an amount to . The calculator will populate the next available row with the selected sub-category . If you want to change a sub-category already entered , click in the sub-category field you want to change and select the sub-category to replace it with ( you will then need to click in the next blank field to get back on track ) . <p> Tax ? Category column : If you want the calculator to total your sub-categories on the report , be sure to use the selection menus for filling in the sub-category fields . If you enter them manually they will not be tabulated . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be sure to enter the taxable expenditures first and with a check in the sales check boxes . Leave the non-taxable amounts for the last entries . Note that if all items on the receipt are taxable , leave all sales tax check boxes unchecked . <p> Memo column : Optional : Enter a memo you would like to have appear on the report . Again , to keep from stretching the height and width of the report , keep the memo as brief as possible . <p> Amounts : You can enter any number of amounts in this field . Simply enter a plus sign ( + ) between the amounts and the calculator will automatically sum the entries and display the result in the Total column . For example , if your receipt has three Cleaning items and the prices are $3.25 , $5.26 , and $6.27 , simply enter 3.25+5.26+6.27 . This will save you from having to enter every item and amount for every sub-category . <p> Total : This is the calculated total of the amounts entered in adjacent column , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Receipt remainder : This is the difference between the total of the receipt and the combined total of the sub-category amounts . If this amount is negative you will need to adjust your sub-category amounts down until this amount is equal to zero . <p> Add Receipt to Purchase Receipts Calculator button : Click this button to add a receipt to your list . This version has no option for editing or deleting an entered receipt , so you will either need to enter the receipt again and ignore the original on the report , or start over . <p> Receipts List : After clicking the Add Receipt to Purchase Receipts Calculator button the receipt will be added to a list below . Once you have a list you can then sort the list by a specific column by clicking the radio button next to the column title . This sort order will be used to sort the report as well . <p> Create Spending Report button : You can click this button at any time to view and print your spending report . <p> Reset button : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-categories so you can start over from scratch .

" <p> Basically , Net worth is the difference between what you own and what you owe . What you own is referred to as assets , and what you owe is referred to as liabilities . Therefore , your net worth is equal to the total value of your assets minus the total of your liabilities . <p> The report that lists your assets and liabilities , and the difference between the two , is called a statement of net worth -- which is also referred to as a " personal balance sheet . " <p> Typically , assets are broken down into 3 separate categories : <p> Liquid or Current Assets : Cash and assets that can be quickly and easily converted into cash . <p> In order to be realistic , when assigning a value to a personal asset it 's important to use market value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the amount you paid for the asset . Also , since the value of personal assets tends to diminish with time and use , it 's important to adjust their values down as they get older and/or become obsolete . <p> Liabilities are usually broken down into 2 or 3 separate categories : <p> Current Liabilities : Amounts owed that are expected to be paid back within one year ( credit cards , lines of credit , charge accounts , personal loans , notes payable ) . <p> Long-Term Liabilities : Amounts that are owed that will take longer than one year to pay off ( mortgage , home-improvement loans , auto loans ) . <p> Contingent Liabilities : Amounts you may or may not owe depending on future events ( taxes , co-signed loans , pending lawsuits ) . <h> Why is Calculating Net Worth Important ? <p> In order to get where you want to go financially , you first need to know where you are and in which direction you 're heading . By calculating net worth on a regular basis you will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whether you 're heading toward your goals or moving away from them . <p> Unfortunately most people are so afraid of seeing how bad things might be , they avoid calculating net worth altogether . The problem with that is that they have no basis from which to set small , achievable goals . They also miss out on opportunities to celebrate the small victories that come when they manage to meet their bite-sized net worth goals . <h> How Often Should You Calculate Net Worth ? <p> The wise among us who do take the time to calculate net worth on a regular basis , usually do so on an annual basis . Personally , I feel it 's best to create a new personal balance sheet on a quarterly basis . Not only does this allow you to set short term goals , it also affords you the chance to take corrective action instead of waiting a whole year to see if what you 're doing is working . <p> With that , let 's use the Household Net Worth Calculator to create a personal balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worth Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the name you would like to appear on the net worth statement , select whether or not you would like to include past personal balance sheet data and enter the statement dates accordingly . <p> Next , complete the three asset sections and the three liability sections and then click the " Calculate Net Worth " button . <p> If you would like to print out a copy of your completed personal balance sheet , click the " Printable Personal Balance Sheet " button .

@@14740836 @3340836/ <p> If you do n't know the answer to " What is a money market account ? " , or you 're not sure what purpose they are meant to serve , or you do n't know how they differ from money market funds , it may be well worth your while to read the following definition and explanations before using the money market account calculator . <h> What is a Money Market Account ? <p> The basic definition of money market account ( MMA ) : A federally insured savings account that requires you to keep a minimum balance , limits the number of monthly transactions , and for which interest rates are based on market interest rates . And because banks have some assurance that you will maintain the minimum balance , they will usually reward you with a higher interest rate than they offer for a regular savings account -- sometimes as much as 1% higher . <p> The main advantage of money market investing versus keeping funds in a regular savings account is the higher rate of interest . The main disadvantage is if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged a penalty that could offset the gains of the higher interest rate . <p> Also , it 's important to note that money market deposit accounts are not the same as money market funds . Money market funds are products of investment and insurance companies and are therefore not federally insured . This does n't mean that money market funds are not safe investments , it just means they are not as safe a money market deposit accounts . <h> What Are Money Market Accounts Best Suited For ? <p> If you ask an investment advisor what MMAs are best suited for , they will usually tell you they are best for parking cash in between investments . And while that might be true for people who have large sums of money to invest , it does n't mean much to the average working family . <p> If you ask me what MMAs are best suited for , I will tell you that they are my preference when it comes to building and storing personal finance emergency funds . After all , MMAs are insured , they pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent withdrawals , and most come with a checkbook that you can write up to three checks from per month . Perfect ! <p> However , before you can open a MMA for the purpose of building and storing personal finance emergency funds , you will likely need to begin building your fund in a regular savings account until you have saved up enough to meet the minimum deposit requirement ( usually $1,000 or more ) that comes with MMAs . <h> Fully Funded Emergency Fund ? <p> Once you have 3-6 months of income sitting in your money market account , the next step depends on whether or not you have high interest debt . If you do have high interest debt , then your next step should be to begin investing in your debt . Why ? Because it simply does n't make sense to earn 1% on your money when you can earn 18% on your money by paying off high interest debt . <p> If you have managed to pay off all of your high interest debt , since MMAs are normally considered to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Deposit ( CD ) , the next step might be to begin making periodic purchases of certificates of deposit . But here again you will need to accumulate the minimum amount needed to purchase a CD . <p> With that , let 's use the Money Market Account Calculator to calculate the amount of interest you might earn from investing in money market deposit accounts . <p> Money Market Account Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the initial deposit amount , enter the annual interest rate , and enter the number of months or years you would like to calculate MMA interest for . <p> Next , enter the periodic deposit amount for the selected frequency and then click the " Calculate Money Market Account Interest " button . @qwx194657 <h> Money Market Account Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Starting money market account balance : The current balance of your MMA , or the initial deposit that is not part of the periodic deposits .

Note that money market interest rates are based on current market rates , so please enter accordingly . Enter as a percentage ( for .02 , enter 2% ) . <p> Periodic deposit interval : The number of selected periods ( month or years ) you would like the money market account calculator to calculate interest for . Enter integers only ( no decimal points ) . If you would like to calculate interest for partial years , select Months and enter the total months ( example : for 5-1/2 years , enter 66 months ) . <p> Future value of MMA : This how much your MMA will have grown to based on the interest rate you entered , your periodic deposits , and the number of entered months or years . <p> Total MMA deposits : This is the total of your beginning deposit or balance , plus all periodic deposits for the entered number of months or years . <p> Interest earned on MMA : This is the total interest you will earn on your MMA for the entered number of months or years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations are based on monthly compounding and assumes all periodic deposits are made at the end of each month . Most money market accounts calculate interest on a daily basis , but the interest earnings are n't added to your account until the end of the month .

Sadly , with half of all marriages ending in divorce ( many caused by disagreements over those little pieces of paper we refer to as " money " ) , my heart is going out to a lot of people . <p> Sure , it is possible to start a home-based business that would allow a single parent to work from home . However , making that transition is extremely difficult . After all , since it can take several years for a business to become profitable , a single parent would likely have to hold down a full-time job while building their business from home . And what single parent has time for that ? <h> Which is Better ? <p> While there are legitimate arguments from both sides as to whether or not families are be better off with a stay-at-home parent , what bothers me the most is the fact that the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact -- when parents already have children and they are already holding down full time jobs . In other words , very few of us ever make a financial plan for having children ahead of having them . The primary reason ? Because that 's what our parents did , and no one ever taught us any differently . <h> But at Least We Can Bake Cup Cakes <p> In my opinion , Home Economics should be just as important as reading , writing and arithmetic when it comes to educating our children . Unfortunately , at least in the case of my family 's experience , " Home Ec " was little more than a brief lesson in baking cup cakes . That 's outrageous ! Especially when you consider the financial complexities of today 's households . <h> A Society of Pin Balls <p> The truth is , most households today are more financially complex than most small businesses of the past . Yet most households have no business plan , no accountant , no budget , no purchasing manager , and so on . And the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough money we wo n't need to worry about our finances . " The result ? A society full of people bouncing from one higher paying job to the next -- much like a bunch of pin balls on one giant pin ball machine -- without ever stopping long enough to see if what we 're doing even makes sense . <h> What Should Be the Deciding Factor ? <p> When it comes to deciding whether or not it 's feasible for you to quit work to be a stay at home parent , I 'm of the opinion that the most important thing to consider is which choice will result in happier parents . After all , unhappy parents ca n't possibly be good for children . But when I say " happy parents , " I 'm not referring to parents whose happiness depends on the quantity and quality of their inanimate objects ( objects that ca n't love them back ! ) . Instead , I 'm talking about parents who are happy because they are living a balanced life and are engaged in a work they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stay at home parent , or running a fortune 500 company . <h> What Ends Up Being the Deciding Factor ? <p> Unfortunately , since most of were taught that " more money and more things " leads to " more happiness , " and we 've all been given easy access to credit ( allowing us have more things with less upfront money ) the financial aspects of quitting work to stay at home must now be considered . Because regardless of how much happier you and the children might be if you could quit work to be a stay at home parent , that happiness can be easily offset by an onslaught of creditors pounding on your door -- all looking for repayment for all the happiness they fronted you in the past . <p> With that , let 's use the stay at home calculator to estimate the financial net-effects of going from a two income household , down to a one income household . @qwx194657 <p> Important : In order for the " Anticipated Savings " calculations to work properly , you need to first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , if you change the number of entered days you work each week , you will then need to re-enter your savings amounts wherever " per work day " is the selected period .

Sounds good , right ? <p> It is a good deal , but only if you cut up the cards and close the accounts you transfer the balances from . Otherwise , guess what typically happens ?

You 're the proud owner of a brand new Penalty APR ! <h> Post Introductory Period Rate ? <p> Typically the credit card company will state something like , " After that ( introductory period ) , your APR will be 10.99% to 18.99% based on your creditworthiness and will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate . " <p> If you think your post introductory rate will be 10.99% after they just spent 6-months to a year collecting little or no interest from you , then the phone is for you -- it 's reality calling . <h> No Rewards or Grace Periods <p> In the fine print of most offers you will " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no grace period for avoiding interest charges . <h> Friend or Foe ? <p> The balance transfer sales pitches all have that " We 're Your Friend and We 've Come to Your Rescue !

So be sure to run your plans past a qualified financial planner ( one who will not be earning commissions from your investments , and who is not trying to sell you life insurance ) before starting your mortgage prepayment plan . <p> Also be sure to check with your lending institution to make sure you can prepay your mortgage without penalty . Believe it or not there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their forecasted profit margins -- despite the fact that they will still make a ton of money on your home loan . <h> Can You Really Afford to Prepay Your Mortgage ? <p> In my experience most home buyers enter into mortgages based solely on whether or not they can afford to make the monthly payment . And while the monthly payment typically includes property tax and insurance payments , it does not include the other ongoing costs that come with owning a home . <p> Although some people do include the ongoing cost of utilities in their " how much house can I afford ? " equation , what gets most people into trouble is that they assume that everything that comes with the home , or is later added to the home , will all last forever . In other words , they fail to consider " depreciation expenses " when determining whether or not they can afford to buy a particular home . This results in buying more home than they can actually afford . <h> What Causes Mortgage Prepayment Plans to Fail ? <p> Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the land the home sits on will eventually wear out and need replacing . And while the foundation and basic structure of the home may last for generations , nearly everything else will need to be repaired , upgraded , or replaced an average of once every 15 years . <p> The reason I point this out is because failing to account for the repair and replacement of depreciable assets is what causes most mortgage prepayment plans to fail . <p> After all , if you have not made an honest effort to forecast the depreciation expenses of your home 's depreciable assets , and/or you are not setting aside funds to cover those costs as they occur , the " extra " funds you are using to prepay your mortgage are not really " extra " at all . And if that 's the case , all the money you thought you would save by prepaying your mortgage will be wiped out when you are forced to take out a second mortgage in order to replace all of the depreciable assets you failed to budget for . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , the two biggest reasons people fail to achieve their financial dreams are ; not having any financial plan for the future , or following a financial plan that is destined to fail . In my opinion , following a financial plan that is destined to fail is worse than having no plan at all . <p> Why ? Consider this analogy ... <p> If you were lost in the woods , which would would be worse ; having no compass at all , or having a compass only to find out after days of heading " due North " that the compass had been making ever-changing , slight miscalculations as to which direction was North ? <p> I would argue that not having a compass would serve you better than having a faulty compass , because if you had no compass at all you probably would have been a lot more careful in attempting to find your way out ( following the sun , leaving breadcrumb trails , marking trees for walking in a straight line , etc . ) . <p> The same is true of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is unknowingly leading you to walk in financial circles , or walk deeper into the financial woods ( debt ) , you will likely end up more lost and disappointed than if you had no plan at all ... because you will not be proceeding with the same level of cautionary decision-making . <p> If you agree that making plans that are destined to fail will likely result in greater loss and disappointment , and if you are not faithfully setting aside the funds needed to replace your depreciable assets as they wear out , you might consider setting aside your prepayments to cover depreciation expenses instead of using them to " temporarily " prepay your mortgage . <p> With that , let 's use the Prepay Mortgage Calculator to calculate how much time and interest you could save if you added a prepayment amount to your monthly house payment . <p> Calculate Mortgage Payoff With Monthly Prepayment <p> Instructions : Enter the original home loan amount , the annual percentage rate ( APR ) , and the original home loan term in years . <p> Next enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount you can afford to prepay your mortgage , then click the " Calculate Mortgage Prepayment Savings " button . @qwx194657 <h> Prepay Mortgage Calculator Glossary of Terms <h> Prepay Mortgage Calculator Entry Fields <p> Original home loan amount : The dollar amount of the original home loan ( principal borrowed ) . <p> Annual interest rate : The annual percentage rate ( APR ) of the home loan . <p> Original loan term in number of years : The original repayment term of the home loan in number of years . <p> Number of payments already made : The number of monthly house payments you have already made .

@@14740842 @3340842/ <p> Alerts you to lenders ' loose use of the term " refinance savings " and helps you to forecast the unbiased net-consequences of refinancing your home loan . <p> This free online Home Loan Refinance Calculator will calculate the net effect of refinancing your home loan at a lower interest rate , a different term , or both . <p> The calculator includes a cash out option and a built-in feature to help you estimate the refinance mortgage closing costs ( no closing costs , low , medium , and high settings ) . <p> Plus , unlike most other online mortgage refinancing calculators , the home loan refinance calculator on this page will calculate how long you will need to stay in your refinanced mortgage in order for the lower interest rate savings to offset the cost of the new home loan ( break-even point ) . <p> Finally , the calculator will even calculate the effect refinancing will have on your Loan-To-Value ( LTV ) ratio , and then estimate the expected change to your PMI ( Private Mortgage Insurance ) payment . <h> What Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not familiar with the term , Refinance ( Refi for short ) basically means to replace an existing loan with a new loan . The new loan pays off the existing loan , leaving with you with one or more new terms ( principal , interest rate , payment amount , and/or number of payments ) . <p> Sounds simple enough , right ? <p> Well , it would be if it was n't for the fees . <h> Mortgage Refinancing Fees <p> Like most of their other high-profit products , lenders have done everything they can to complicate what would otherwise be a very simple decision . Lenders know consumers are only interested in who offers the lowest rates , so they lower their rates and make up the difference by charging a highly imaginative list of different loan fees ( refer to the full refinance calculator on this page for a list and estimates ) . <p> Making matters worse , no two lenders have the same fee schedule . Not only does this make cost-estimation and rate comparisons anything but simple , but it also prevents me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fees . Instead , all I can offer is an estimation . <h> Average Closing Costs <p> Based on my research , the average refinancing closing costs charged by lenders can run between 3% and 6% of the refinanced loan balance . <p> To help you to put that in perspective , enter the current balance owed on your existing mortgage into the mini calculator below : <p> Average Mortgage Closing Costs Calculator <p> Enter your mortgage balance : <p> Estimate closing costs ( 3%-6% ) : <p> $0 - $0 <p> If added to loan balance ( 30 years at 6% ) : <p> $0 - $0 <p> As you can see from the results , you will need to refinance at a rate low enough to more than offset the cost of the fees in order to realize any actual savings . And when I say " savings " , I 'm talking about real savings , not reduced payment savings . <h> When Are Refinance " Savings " Truly Savings ? <p> If you have used mortgage refinance calculators on other web sites , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing house payment and the refinanced house payment . And if the refinanced house payment is lower , you will often see the calculated difference , followed by the statement , " Monthly Payment Savings . " <p> There 's only one problem . Unless the total cost of refinancing ( interest plus closing costs ) is less than the cost of not refinancing , the term " savings " can not and should not be used in the results . <p> If you refinance at a lower rate , but extend the payoff period out longer than the existing loan term , there 's a good chance that refinancing will actually end up costing you more money , as opposed to " saving " you money . <p> Of course , mortgage lenders will likely tell you the best reason for refinancing is so you can lower your payment amount , so you can have more money to spend on fun things and activities . However , as noted earlier , if you 're not careful , a lower payment now can cause you to have less " fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should I Refinance My House ? <p> In my opinion , you should only refinance if your existing mortgage is fairly recent ( most interest is paid in the early portion of the repayment term ) , and if doing so will save you money in the long run . <p> But what if you ca n't afford the size of your current monthly mortgage payment ? Then you probably bought more house than you could actually afford ( check the House Affordability Calculator to see if that might have been the case . ) <p> Most people I know would be far better off if , instead of refinancing , they sold their over-sized home and purchased a more practical size home -- financed at the lower rate . <p> And by practical size , I mean a less expensive home that has lower property tax , insurance , utility , and maintenance costs . But no one wants to hear that . It seems most would rather live in their dream homes even if it means struggling to pay the nightmare payment and expenses . <p> In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms that will reduce your overall cost of repaying the home loan ( including closing costs ) , I would proceed , but with the utmost caution . Why ? Because ... <h> Loan Officers Do n't Get Bonuses for Saving You Money <p> If you have determined that refinancing your existing mortgage will save you money in the long run , make sure you request a detailed breakdown of all upfront costs , along with an amortization schedule showing principal and interest breakdown and totals . Also be sure to get a copy of the loan agreement , along with a magnifying glass to make sure you can scour every word of the fine print . <p> Be especially watchful for any verbiage related to " prepayment penalties , " as some mortgage companies will offer you low , or no-cost refinancing , but often at the expense of higher interest rates and stiff prepayment penalties that will prevent you from getting a cheaper loan at a later date . <p> Find out your credit score : Lenders will want to know your credit score before they will quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower the interest rate you will qualify for . <p> Shop for the best rate : Start with your current lender as they may be able to offer you discounted closing costs ( no appraisal , etc . ) . Always request a firm estimate of the loan fees from those lender 's offering the best rates ( do so sparingly , as a sudden jump in the number of credit checks might have adverse effects on your credit score ) . This is to insure lower rates or closing costs are n't being offset by higher fees . <p> Gather all data about your current mortgage : Find out your current payoff , principal and interest payment , interest rate , PMI payment , and prepayment penalty ( if any ) , then use the refinance mortgage comparison calculator on this page to see if refinancing will end up saving you money for as long as you plan to stay in your present home . <p> Weigh refinancing against principal prepayment : Use the extra payment mortgage calculator to see if making extra principal payments can achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen lender : If the calculations indicate refinancing will generate savings over and above the costs , contact the lender you decided on during step #3 and tell them you are ready to start the process . <p> With that , let 's use the Home Loan Refinance Calculator to calculate and compare the costs of your existing mortgage versus the costs of a mortgage refinanced at a lower rate . <p> Calculate Home Mortgage Refinancing Comparison <p> Instructions : If you 'd like the calculator to calculate LTV and PMI , enter the current market value of your home , and your current monthly PMI payment amount . <p> If you 've been making the prescribed monthly payments , choose " Original Terms " and enter the original home loan amount , the annual percentage rate ( APR ) , the original home loan term in years , and the number of payments made . <p> Or , if you 've made extra , unscheduled , or intermittent payments , choose " Current Payoff Amount " and enter the current payoff , the current APR , and your current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new refinance rate , new loan term , and any cash-out or cash-in amounts that may apply . <p> Next , either select None , Low , Medium , or High to have the calculator estimate your closing costs , or select None to enter your own closing cost estimates . <p> Finally , choose whether or not you want to include the closing costs in the amount to refinance , and then click the " Calculate Mortgage Refinance Comparison " button . @qwx194657 <h> Home Loan Refinance Calculator Glossary of Terms <h> Home Value and PMI <p> Estimated market value of home : Optional .

Knowing how to convert back and forth will be necessary to understand the operations explained on this page . <h> Scientific Notation Math <p> Since it 's important that you know how to perform scientific notation math without requiring a calculator -- especially if you may be required to show your work -- I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note that each lesson is reflective of the results that will appear in the calculated results . <h> Multiplying Scientific Notation <p> To multiply two SN 's you basically just multiply the coefficients and add the exponents , and then convert that result to proper scientific notation format ( if not already ) . <p> Example multiplication problem : ( 3 x 106 ) x ( 6 x 104 ) <p> Here are the steps to solving the above problem . <p> Multiplication Steps <p> ( 3 x 106 ) x ( 6 x 104 ) <p> Group like terms : <p> = ( 3 x 6 ) x ( 106 x 104 ) <p> Multiply coefficients and add exponents : <p> = ( 18 ) x ( 1010 ) <p> Convert to proper SN : <p> = 1.8 x 1011 <p> The other way to multiply scientific notations is to convert the notations to real numbers , perform the multiplication , and then convert the number back to scientific notation , like the following : <p> Alternative Multiplication Method <p> ( 3 x 106 ) x ( 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x ( 6 x 10000 ) <p> = 3000000 x 60000 <p> = 180000000000 <p> = 1.8 x 1011 <p> Of course , this alternative method can be cumbersome if the numbers you are working with are very large or very small , and may not be possible if the calculator you are using wo n't display the results in regular notation . <h> Dividing Scientific Notation <p> To divide two SN 's you divide the coefficients and subtract the trailing exponent from the leading exponent , and then convert that result to proper scientific notation format ( if not already ) . <p> Example division problem : ( 5 x 108 ) ( 2 x 104 ) <p> Here are the steps to solving the above problem . <p> Division Steps <p> ( 5 x 108 ) ++ ( 2 x 104 ) <p> Group like terms : <p> = ( 5 2 ) x ( 108 104 ) <p> Divide coefficients and Subtract exponents : <p> = ( 2.5 ) x ( 104 ) <p> Convert to proper SN : <p> = 2.5 x 104 <p> The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to real numbers , perform the division , and then convert the number back to scientific notation , like the following : <p> Alternative Division Method <p> ( 5 x 108 ) ( 2 x 104 ) <p> = ( 5 x 100000000 ) ( 2 x 10000 ) <p> = 500000000 20000 <p> = 25000 <p> = 2.5 x 104 <h> Adding Scientific Notation <p> To add two SN 's you factor out one of the powers of 10 , convert the remaining scientific notations to real numbers , add the real numbers , and then convert that result to proper scientific notation format ( if not already ) . <p> Example addition problem : ( 6 x 104 ) + ( 7 x 103 ) <p> Here are the steps I use to solve the above addition problem . <p> Addition Steps <p> ( 6 x 104 ) + ( 7 x 103 ) <p> Factor out 1 of the powers of 10 <p> = ( 6 x 104/104 + 7 x 103/104 ) x 104 <p> Perform division of exponents : <p> = ( 6 x 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to real numbers : <p> = ( 6 + 0.7 ) x 104 <p> Combine real numbers : <p> = ( 6.7 ) x ( 104 ) <p> Convert to proper SN : <p> = 6.7 x 104 <p> There is a second method for solving the above addition problem ( not included in the calculated results ) , which requires converting the numbers to the same power of 10 .

Is that cool , or what ? ! <p> Plus , if you already have traffic and ad revenues , the calculator will even estimate the number of pages or posts your website or blog will need to achieve your goal based on your current revenue per page , and tell you how much each page might be worth over the course of the next ten years . <p> Also , the calculator will accommodate planned sites , existing sites with no ads , and existing sites that are already generating advertising revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also includes a printer friendly results page so you can print just your traffic and revenue forecast . <h> Calculator Built Based on My Own Experience <p> I have been working full-time online from my home since 1997 . I began as a self-taught web developer earning my living by creating interactive calculators for financial websites ( you can read my story here ) . I enjoyed building calculators , but I had grown tired of having to build calculators based on customer specifications instead of based on my own creative self-expression . <p> Luckily , in April of 2010 I happened across a company called SiteBuildIt ! or SBI , whose website was extolling the virtues of becoming an Infopreneur . What a cool concept ! <p> While SBI teaches a host of different ways to make money from a website , the method that appealed to me most was the online advertising revenue model , because it would free me to create my calculators based on my own creative self-expression , instead of based on the rigid and enslaving specifications of others . <p> Thank goodness I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable with telling you how much my website is currently generating in ad revenues , I will tell you that I 'm earning just as much as I was earning back when I was a restaurant owner . And what 's significant about that is that I had to pay $350,000 to purchase the restaurant only to end up working 80 stress-filled hours per week -- which left no time for having a life outside of work . <p> My website and traffic building program , on the other hand , costs me less than my monthly cable bill , and I am now totally free to work at what I want , with whom I want , when I want , and wherever I want . <h> What is the Online Advertising Revenue Model ? <p> Basically , you place small bits of code from an advertising vendor ( Google Adsense , Media.net , Infolinks , etc. ) in various locations on your web pages or blog posts . <p> In turn the ad vendor delivers ads to each page based on the content of the page , thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reaching their target market . <h> How Do You Earn Money From the Ads ? <p> There are basically two general types of website ads . One type generates revenue when a visitor clicks on it ( 1 step ) , and another type that opens a page of links when clicked , which in turn makes you money if the visitor clicks on one of the listed links ( 2 steps , also referred to as " Link Units " ) . And as you might expect , the 1-step ads typically outperform the 2-step ads . <p> How much do you earn when a visitor clicks on an ad or a link ? Well , that depends how much advertisers are willing to pay to get a click from your audience . <p> You see , advertisers bid ( how much they are willing to pay per click , called PPC ) on keywords and key phrases that they feel would best attract their target audience . The amount they bid depends on the potential revenue their business can earn from the sale of their product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay far less for a click that an advertiser selling luxury condominiums , so how much you make per click depends on what niche your website covers . Speculatively speaking , a shoelace ad might pay anywhere from $0.01 to $0.10 per click , where an ad for a luxury condominium ad might pay anywhere from $5 to $15 for the click . <p> But guess what . If you build a site about shoelaces , do n't expect to have the ad vendor send luxury condominium ads to your site . It 's not going to happen . <p> This explains why it is imperative that you fully research the income potential of your website ... before you decide what niche you are going to build it around . <p> The absolute best tool I have ever found for doing website niche research , is a tool called " BrainStormIt ! " -- which is just one of the many invaluable tools that come with the site and traffic building program that SBI offers . <h> Traffic is the Key to Earning a Living from Ad Revenues <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common term used to describe how many people you have to expose your ad to in order to make one sale . For example , if you show your ad to 100 people and 1 person places an order , your ad would be generating 1% conversion rate ( 1/100 = .01 = 1% ) . <p> In the online advertising revenue model , the conversion rate is known as the Click Through Rate ( CTR ) , which refers to how many times an ad is viewed ( number of impressions ) before one of your visitors clicks on the ad . <p> Depending on where the ad is displayed on a web page or blog post , the CTR can range from .0% to 3% or higher . So to see how much traffic you would need to achieve a certain ad revenue goal , you need to estimate the average CPC ( amount you earn per click ) , the average IPV ( Impressions Per visitor ) , and the average CTR ( Click Through Rate ) . <p> Once you have arrived at your estimations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is as follows : <p> Traffic Needed = Revenue Goal CPC CTR IPV <p> So , for example , if you want to earn $100 per day in ad revenue and you estimate a CPC of $0.10 , a CTR of 1% , and an IPV of 1.5 , the estimated visits you would need would be 66,667 daily visits , calculated as follows : <p> Obviously , attracting over 66,000 visitors per day is an unlikely prospect for the average website owner , so again , you want to do your homework up front to insure that you will be able to achieve your $100 per day goal with far less traffic . This is especially true when you consider that in order to net $100 per day , you ca n't spend any money to attract your visitors . <h> " Free " Traffic is Essential to Online Advertising Revenue Model <p> What do I mean by " Free Traffic ?

@@14740851 @3340851/ <p> Helps you to estimate how much you will need to have saved to fund your monthly retirement income goal - with and without inflation . <p> This online calculator will calculate the retirement savings needed in order to withdraw your desired monthly income for the duration of your life expectancy -- with and without accounting for inflation . <p> While I agree that ignoring the effects of inflation in financial forecasting will likely result in a failure to achieve expectations , I also believe that building inflation into financial forecasting tools tends to discourage saving and encourage spending . <p> When people see the difference inflation can make in their future financial condition , I 'm willing to bet that many of them get so discouraged with all added sacrifices they will need to make in order to achieve their future goals , they simply decide to spend their money now -- while it 's still worth something -- rather than saving it for the future when it will be worth much less . <p> Yes , the effects of inflation are discouraging . However , in financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses high . Because even more discouraging than seeing the effects inflation has on future savings , is to arrive at your future with no savings at all . <p> My suggestion is this . Be sure to include inflation in your forecasts , but at the same time recognize that as inflation drives up the costs of goods and services , it also tends to put upward pressure on wages . So while your savings may be losing buying power each year , chances are good that your wages will also increase , which in turn means you should be able to increase the amount you are adding to your savings . If you want to hit the moon , shoot for the stars . <p> With that , let 's use the following planning tool to calculate retirement savings needed by the time you retire in order to meet your monthly income goal . <p> Retirement Income Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter your current age , retirement age , and the amount you would like to withdraw from your account for each month of your retirement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your investments , the number of years you wish to receive the monthly income , the expected inflation rate , and the total of your current savings , then click the " Calculate Retirement Savings Needed " button . @qwx194657 <h> Retirement Income Calculator : Glossary of Terms <p> Annual return on investments ( ROI ) : This is percentage by which you expect your investments to grow -- which is influenced by the frequency that the interest is compounded . The tool on this page bases its projections on monthly compounding . Each month the decimal equivalent of the annual percentage rate is divided by 12 to find the monthly rate . If the annual rate is 12% , or .12 , the monthly rate would be 1% , or .01 . The month-end investment balance is then multiplied by the monthly rate to arrive at the interest earned for the month . The interest earned is then added to the balance . Finally , the withdrawal is subtracted from the balance to arrive at next month 's beginning balance . This same process if repeated for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inflation : Basically , inflation is the rise in the price of goods and services over time . The inflation rate is an attempt to quantify inflation , and is based on the rise of the consumer price index . Theoretically , if the inflation rate is estimated to be 4% , $1 will only be worth 96&amp;cents ; a year from now . Or to put in another way , a product selling for $1 now will likely sell for $1.04 a year from now . Therefore , to make a more realistic retirement plan , inflation should be considered -- though likely not at face value . After all , as prices rise , wages tend to also rise , thereby offsetting at least a portion of the effects of inflation .

If the result is less than the actual combined future values , the function increments the guess by a small fraction of a percentage . And conversely , if the result is greater than the actual future values , the function decrements the guess by a small fraction . <p> Next , in either case , the function recalculates using the new guess .

Review:How SBI ( Solo Build It ! ) Saved My Online Business <p> Hi , my name is Dan Peterson and this is my story of how SBI not only saved my online business , but also helped propel it into one of the top trafficked websites in the world . <h> Smooth Sailing ... Toward Niagara Falls ! <p> It was 2007 , and I had been happily operating a prosperous online business from home since 1997 . <p> I had created a website , webwinder.com , to sell my online calculators to other online business owners . Anyone looking to add calculators to their website could simply add the desired calculators to their shopping cart , checkout , and the paste the purchased calculators into their website . <p> After 10 years of growing the site 's traffic and calculator offerings , the automated calculator sales had grown to the point that we had managed to pay off all of our debts , including our mortgage , and set aside enough to cover more than a year 's worth of living expenses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web host suddenly , and without any warning whatsoever , stopped supporting the " . php3 " file extension . And since all of my website pages ended with " . php3 " , my calculator sales instantly dropped to zero . <p> It took me nearly a year to recover from my web host pulling the rug out from under me . Unfortunately , it was about that same time that the housing market crashed . No big deal , unless your customer base consisted mostly of mortgage brokers and real estate agents . Oops ! <p> But the final nail in the coffin of my online calculator sales , turned out to be the ever-growing use of Wordpress for creating business websites . Why ? <p> Because the hosted version of Wordpress does n't allow my scripting language on their system . <p> Because even seasoned programmers were having a hard time getting my calculators to work on the downloadable version of Wordpress . <p> And over the falls my calculator sales went . <p> As of this writing ( May 17 , 2017 ) , my online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But thankfully , that 's not the end of the story ! <h> SBI To The Rescue ! <p> In early 2010 , while trying to come up with a new online business plan , I stumbled across a website crediting Site Build It ! ( SBI , recently rebranded to Solo Build It ! ) for the success she had achieved in her online business . <p> Curious , I followed the link to the SBI website and began pouring over the information . <p> Everything you need to know to build a profitable e-business is explained in detail in the Action Guide . First you learn , then you do . <p> The Action Guide became even more attractive to me when I learned it came in a video format as well as a written format ( I 'm a visual learner ! ) . <p> But the second feature I came across is the one that sold me on joining SBI . It was a tool called Brainstorm It ! . <p> BI ! let 's you find potential Site Concepts for profitable niches for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of your niche , even if you have no idea , BI ! offers hundreds of possible Site Concepts . Pick the one that 's right for you ( i.e. , according to your passion , knowledge , available time , etc . ) . <p> Having operated an online business for 10 years , I felt I knew enough about the technical aspects of building a website . But I knew very little about how to use keyword research to find a profitable niche . <p> However , following the SBI Action Guide 's steps for finding a profitable niche , I was not able to find enough winnable keywords to build a site around my preferred topic . Looking back , had it not been for SBI 's Brainstorm It ! tool , I most certainly would have started a site that was destined to fail . <h> Formulating A Winnable Site Blueprint All But Guaranteed My Success ! <p> After giving up on my initial site concept for the new online business , I eventually started using Brainstorm It ! to perform keyword researches around what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online calculators . And too my joyous surprise , I was able to find enough winnable keywords related to " online calculator " to go with my passion as my site concept . <p> But this time , instead of building online calculators for other online businesses , I would be publishing the calculators to my own website , and then monetizing them with contextual ads ( A.K.A. , infoprenuer ) . <p> Creating calculators for my own site has been the ultimate freedom . Instead of creating calculators based on customer specifications ( like forcing an artist to paint by the numbers ) , I 'm free to create calculators based on my own creative self-expression ! <p> The cool thing about building a site blueprint that 's made up of winnable keywords ( high search demand with low competition ) , is all you need to do to be successful is to create top notch content pages for each of the keywords in the blueprint . It 's certainly not easy , but it is doable , one page at a time . <p> It took me 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I was done I had a surefire plan for building my online business . All I had to do , was to execute the plan . <p> Did the surefire plan work ? <h> The Results Speak For Themselves <p> Thanks to following SBI 's Action Guide , instead of having to re-enter the workforce when my original online calculator business sank , I 've able to maintain my freedom to serve others performing a work that I love ( creating online calculators ! ) . <p> And not only that , but my business has grown the point I 've been able to grow my " rainy day fund " to a level that will support my freedom to work at what I love for years to come -- regardless of what might happen to my site 's traffic levels . <p> Although , based on the trend of my traffic growth since I started building the site back in September of 2010 , I 'd say there 's a good chance I may never have to tap into the rainy day fund . <p> And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've only tried buying traffic enough to know that I could n't afford to compete with the mega corporations that are bidding on my keywords . <p> So here I am , having only experimented with paying for traffic , yet the traffic to **30;318;TOOLONG now ranks in the top .05% of all websites in the world ! <p> And I owe that success to following the steps as laid out for me in SBI 's powerful Action Guide . <p> Thank goodness my first exposure to SBI was n't a fake review , like those that are now infecting the search engines . <h> Beware of Fake Reviews ! <p> One of the reasons I took time away from the work I love to write this review of SBI , is because I recently learned about a company that is paying its affiliates to write fake reviews of SBI -- all for the sake of promoting its own product as being better than SBI . <p> After all that SBI has done for me , I knew I needed to speak up on their behalf , and yours ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened if I had read a fake review back in 2010 , and ended up not choosing SBI ! <p> My website 's success is real proof that SBI is the best online business building system available for anyone wanting to start an online business -- especially if you do n't have the money it takes to outbid mega corporations for keywords . <p> But do n't just take my word for it . If you are looking for help in starting an online business , take a look at the facts before you decide which company holds the most promise for your success . <p> SBI took the time took the time to create a reproducible , head-to-head study of its product versus the one paying its affiliates to spread the fake reviews : <p> Yet WA pays its ( unsuspecting ? ) affiliates to write reviews showing SBI as being the inferior product , without ever offering any verifiable proof that any of its affiliate 's ever achieve any success ! WT* ! <h> You 'll Find No Affiliate Links On This Review ! <p> Because the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product I love , not to make money , I have not placed any affiliate links in my review of Site Build It . If you would rather be introduced to SBI via my affiliate link , please contact me to let me know . <p> Oh , and by the way , if you do sign up to SBI through my affiliate link ( bottom of my About Me page ) , you would be the 2nd person to do so in 7 years ! <p> That 's because SBI-built online businesses make real money , from real websites , built around their owners ' genuine passions . We simply have no reason to have to try to earn money by writing reviews ( much less , fake reviews ) of online business building tools .

@@14740860 @3340860/ <h> Fraction to Percent Calculatorfor Converting Fractions to Percentages <p> The Fraction to Percent Calculator on this page will reduce fractions to simplest form , convert them into percentages , and show its work . <p> This free online conversion calculator will reduce fractions into simplest form and then convert the simplified fraction into a decimal number , and then into a percentage . <p> Plus , unlike other online conversion calculators , this calculator will show its work -- including the steps it took to reduce the fractions , as well as the long division you would use for converting fractions into percentages manually . <h> Steps for Converting Fractions to Percentages <p> The steps for converting fractions to percentages vary depending on whether you are using a hand-held calculator or you are doing the conversion manually . <h> Using a Hand-held Calculator <p> If you are using a hand-held calculator , you simply divide the top number of the fraction by the bottom number of the fraction to get the decimal equivalent , and then multiply that result by 100 . <p> For example , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug 9 12 into the calculator , which would give the quotient 0.75 . If you then multiply 0.75 by 100 , the result would be equal to 75% . <h> Using a Manual Calculations on Paper <p> On the other hand , if you are doing the conversion manually on a piece of paper or on a worksheet , you can save time by first reducing the fraction into simplest form . <p> Using the fraction used in the previous example , the first step would be to reduce 9/12 to simplest form , like this : <p> Divide Top and Bottom by Greatest Common Factor <p> 9 <p> = <p> 9 3 <p> = <p> 3 <p> 12 <p> 12 3 <p> 4 <p> Once you have reduced the fraction , the next step is to convert the fraction to a decimal using long division , like this : <p> Use Long Division to Convert Fraction to Percent <p> 0 <p> 7 <p> 5 <p> 4 <p> 3 <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> 4 goes into 3 0 times --&gt; <p> 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes into 30 7 times --&gt; <p> 2 <p> 8 <p> 30 minus 28 equal 2 &amp; add zero --&gt; <p> 2 <p> 0 <p> 4 goes into 20 5 times evenly --&gt; <p> 2 <p> 0 <p> Remainder is zero , so you are done --&gt; <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> Continue adding zeros until remainder is zero , or until the desired number of decimal places is reached , then simply move the decimal point 2 places to the right to convert the decimal to a percentage . Note that the red vertical line indicates where the decimal point will initially be inserted , whereas the blue vertical line indicates where you will move the decimal point to in order to complete the fraction to percent conversion . <p> So after simplifying 9/12 to 3/4 , and then using long division on the simplified fraction , we can see that the fraction 9/12 converts to 75% . <p> With that , let 's use the Fraction to Percent Calculator for simplifying and converting fractions to percentages . <p> Fraction to Percent Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the numerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fraction you would like the calculator to convert to a percentage , and then click the " Convert Fraction to Percent " button . @qwx194657 <h> Fraction to Percent Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Greatest Common Factor ( GCF ) : The largest number that will go into two or more different numbers evenly . Finding the GCF is most often used for simplifying fractions . For example , to reduce the fraction 1000/20000 into simplest form , you would divide the top and bottom of the fraction by their greatest common factor , which is 1000 ( 1000 goes into both 1000 and 20000 evenly ) . The result would be 1/20 -- which is much easier to work with than 1000/2000 . <p> Numerator : Enter the top number of the fraction to be converted into a percentage . <p> Denominator : Enter the bottom number of the fraction to be converted into a percentage . <p> Fraction in simplest form : This is the entered fraction after reducing the fraction into simplest form .

If the top has 4 digits you would multiply the top and bottom by 10000 , and so on . <h> With Digits to Left of Decimal Point <p> If there are one or more digits to the left of the decimal point and their value is greater than zero , then the decimal can be restated as a mixed number , and in turn , that mixed number can be converted to a fraction , like this : <p> Restate Decimal as Mixed Number , Then as Fraction <p> 3.625 <p> = <p> 3 <p> 625 <p> 1000 <p> Convert mixed number to fraction : <p> 3 <p> 625 <p> = <p> 1000 * 3 + 625 <p> = <p> 3625 <p> 1000 <p> 1000 <p> 1000 <p> Simply fraction if possible : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> = <p> 3 <p> 5 <p> 1000 <p> 1000 125 <p> 8 <p> 8 <p> With that , let 's use the Decimal to Fraction Calculator for converting decimals into fractions and then simplifying the result . <p> Decimal to Fraction Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter a non-repeating decimal number that you would like to convert into a fraction , and then click the " Convert Decimal to Fraction " button . @qwx194657 <p> Mixed number : The combination of a whole number and a fraction , such as 3 1/8 . A mixed number can be converted into an improper fraction by multiplying the denominator by the whole number and adding the numerator to that product . That result then becomes the new numerator while the denominator remains the same . So 3 1/8 would convert to 25/8 ( 8 * 3 + 1 / 8 ) . <p> Improper fraction : A fraction wherein the numerator is greater than the denominator , such as 25/8 . An improper fraction can be converted to a mixed number . The whole number becomes the number of times the denominator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerator . The denominator remains unchanged . So 25/8 would convert to the mixed number 3 1/8 ( 25 / 8 = 3 with a remainder of 1 ) . <p> Non-repeating decimal number : Enter the non-repeating decimal number you would like to convert into a fraction . <p> Equivalent fraction : This is the fraction equivalent to the entered decimal number .

" <p> Of course , the concept of foregone interest earnings applies to each and every dollar you spend on interest charges ( or anything else that has a dwindling or non-existent resale value ) during the course of your lifetime . These foregone interest earnings can add up to hundreds of thousands , even millions of dollars . <p> The rich , and those who are on their way to becoming rich , understand the principle of foregone interest earnings ( opportunity costs ) , whereas most people who are not rich do not . The latter group just keeps sending their potential future wealth to the rich -- mostly in the form of interest payments . <h> The Tsunami Effect <p> I 'm sure you 've heard the term " ripple effect , " which is a term often used to describe the ever expanding consequences of an event , action , or decision .

A small , almost undetectable underwater shock wave is sent out in all directions . But by the time this shock wave reaches land it can form a huge wave that springs from out of nowhere and hits with devastating force . In this case , the " Ripple Effect " results in a " Tsunami Effect .

The idea is that by making one-half of your mortgage payment every two weeks , you will end up making a total of 13 monthly payments per year . This can save you thousands of dollars in interest charges and allow you to pay off your home loan years ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Beware of Excessively Greedy Mortgage Companies <p> Because making biweekly payments results in the prepayment of principal ahead of the mortgage terms , there are unscrupulous mortgage companies that take offense to you cutting into their future profit margins . While some will simply escrow your prepayment and apply payments as they were scheduled ( thumbing their nose at your early payoff efforts ) , others will go so far as to assess a penalty for prepaying the principal . <p> So before you start making bi-weekly payments , be sure to check with your mortgage company to make sure your principal prepayments will be applied as you make them , free of any prepayment penalties . <h> How to Double Your Bi-weekly Payment Savings <p> As you will discover when using the biweekly mortgage payment calculator , making 1/2 of your payment every two weeks can save thousands of dollars in interest costs and shave years off of the repayment term .

@@14740881 @3340881/ <h> Personal Finance Investing Calculators <p> Welcome to the Personal Finance Investing Calculators section at **30;474;TOOLONG . <p> The investment calculators and tools in this section are dedicated to helping you to discover where to invest your money in order to maximize the emotional rate of return on the investment of your time ( money ) . <p> Unlike other websites that offer free online personal finance investing calculators , I have no vested interest in pretending or claiming to know the best ways to invest money . <p> This means that I am completely free to create personal finance investing calculators that hold your best interests at heart , not the best interests of brokerage firms who are trying to earn commissions and account management fees from your investments . <h> The Real Time Value of Money <p> As I 've said elsewhere on this website , money is simply a receipt for the time you invest serving the wants and needs of others . These receipts can then be exchanged for other people 's time ( the time others invest in serving your wants needs ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that your time is really the only value you have in your life that you can exchange for happiness . <p> Of course , much of your time ( money ) will need to be exchanged for life 's basic necessities , such as food , clothing , health care , and shelter . What 's left after the essentials are covered is what 's known as discretionary income , which is the only portion of your income that should ever be put at risk . <p> If you do a good job of budgeting your income to the point of creating discretionary income , you then have a vast array of choices when it comes to exchanging that income ( time receipts ) for something you consider to be of equal or greater value . Most of these choices can be boiled down to the following four basic types of exchanges . <p> You can exchange the discretionary income for the good feeling that comes from making a charitable contribution to a worthy cause . <p> You can exchange the discretionary income for a non-essential product or service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can exchange the discretionary income for taking time off from work ( purchasing essentials that you wo n't have to earn additional income to pay for ) . <p> You can exchange the discretionary income for something for which the value is expected to grow -- for the purpose of increasing your discretionary income without having to increase your work-hours . <p> Choice #4 is what is commonly referred to as an " investment . " <h> What is an Investment ? <p> In it 's simplest form , an investment is an accepted form of gambling . When you invest money ( time receipts ) you are accepting an element of risk ( odds of losing all or part of the funds you invest ) in exchange for the chance at getting back more than what you put in . <p> Generally speaking , the more risk you accept , the higher the potential return on investment ( ROI ) . Conversely , the lower the risk you accept , the lower the potential return on investment ( ROI ) . Of course , the more discretionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to accept , and visa versa . This is yet another reason why the rich get richer while the poor and middle class get poorer -- because only the rich can afford to accept the high risk that comes with high yield investment opportunities . <h> Common Ways to Invest Your Money ( Time ) <p> The most common types of investments include savings accounts , certificates of deposit , money market funds , mutual funds , real estate , bonds , stocks , and commodities ( I will be writing about each on their respected personal finance investing calculators pages ) . If you were to ask an investment guru which of these types of investments you should choose , you will likely hear something like , " that depends on your financial goals , your current age , your current financial situation , and on your risk tolerence . " <p> Well , considering the average family has no savings and is struggling just to meet their current living expenses and debt payments , I would say that the average person 's risk tolerance is ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their financial goals . And since risk-bearing investments should only be invested in with discretionary income , the average person does not have funds to " invest " in the first place . So does this mean the average person should give up on investing ? No . It simply means that the average person needs to make other types of investments -- for the purpose of creating discretionary income and risk tolerance . <h> So Where Should You Invest Your Money ( Time ) ? <p> If you are among those who have little or no discretionary income ( no money to invest or investing with little money ) , the first order of business is to invest your time ( money ) into activities and actions that will create discretionary income . Here are some suggested methods for creating discretionary income : <p> 1 . Invest cash instead of borrowing time from your future . You must adopt the attitude that if you ca n't afford pay cash for something , you ca n't afford it . Exchanging future income for interest charges is a surefire way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow to pay for today is the opposite of investing ( you become someone else 's investment ) . <p> 2 . Invest time finding ways to lower your living expenses . For most people it 's much easier to create discretionary income by reducing their spending and downsizing their lifestyles than it is to try to increase their take-home pay . Increasing your income usually comes with more stress , higher expectations , and a higher income tax bracket . In other words , the harder you work , the less each additional dollar you earn will contribute to your overall level of happiness and well-being ( the law of diminishing returns ) . <p> 3 . Invest in yourself . If you want to increase your income , then you need to improve the product ( your talents , skills , and abilities ) that you are selling to others . This means you need to look for inexpensive ways to improve your talents , skills and abilities . If you dread the thought of using discretionary time to study your profession , then you are probably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you wo n't need to be prodded into studying . <p> 4 . Invest in your debt . If you have debt , then you really have no discretionary income -- because your income is spoken for and , as seen in 2009 , its full repayment can be demanded at any time . Therefore , if you want a low-risk , tax-free , guaranteed return on investment , and you can only invest small amounts of money , use the rollover method to pay off all of your debts in the shortest time possible . If you are looking for high yield safe investments , paying off high interest debt ahead of schedule is the only safe high yield investment that I 'm aware of . <h> " Outside-the-Box " Ways to Invest Your Money ( Time ) <p> Once you have managed to create discretionary income , the next step is to think outside of the box when it comes to choosing where you will invest your time ( money ) . By " think outside the box , " I mean to stop believing that anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best ways to invest money . Instead , seriously question everything you 're told no matter who it comes from -- myself included -- and realize that if no one is advising you to choose a non-traditional type of investment ( invest in your debt ) , it probably only means that nobody stands to gain from you choosing to invest in it . At the very least , visit the personal finance investing calculators before investing just to get different perspective from the one your brokerage firm is offering you . <p> As for me personally , I prefer investments that allow me to have a direct influence on the return on investment ( especially after 2001 and 2009 ) . This explains why I invest the bulk of my own discretionary income into my own business ventures . This does not guarantee a high return on investment , but at least I know that if I lose money , it was my own short comings that caused me to lose my capital , and not because some cowardly nut jobs decide to take innocent human lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall street morons decide to destroy the lives of innocent working families for the mere sake of their own insatiable greed . <p> Below are the current savings and investment calculators and tools contained in the personal finance investing calculators section , all of which are dedicated to helping you to maximize the emotional return on the investment of your time ( money ) . <h> Current Personal Finance Investing Calculators <p> APY Calculator to Calculate Annual Percentage Yield This free online investing calculator will calculate the Annual Percentage Yield , also known as the Effective Annual Rate ( EAR ) , from a stated nominal or annual interest rate and a given interest compounding frequency .

If you 're not born into wealth , then all you need to do is to spend less than you earn and invest the difference ? So why is n't everyone wealthy or on their way to becoming wealthy ? Two primary reasons . <p> First , most of us were never taught the all-important financial and economic concepts of the time value of money , the opportunity costs of actions and inactions , and the law of diminishing returns . <p> Second , having not been armed with these all-important concepts , we become easy prey for the marketing geniuses employed by the corporate world . <p> As a result , most of us have allowed ourselves to be brainwashed into believing that we can be happier by not having any money at all ( spending everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we earn ( buying on credit ) . In other words , we 've all been given a desirable destination ( financial happiness ) but given a map that leads us in the opposite direction ( financial unhappiness ) . <p> Of course , this has worked out quite well for those who were born into wealth . So are they responsible for keeping personal financial training out of our k-12 education ? Probably not . But there has to be some deviate force at work when we are taught to bake cupcakes in " Home Ec " ( Economics ) , but taught nothing about how to manage our personal finances for the greatest emotional returns . <h> Time to Get Mad <p> One of the keys to reigning in my own spending was to get mad at myself for allowing the corporate world to dupe me into believing that money could buy happiness . For it was that belief that eventually found me trapped by debt in a work that was demoralizing and unfulfilling . <p> If you are carrying around the belief that money can buy happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on what they pay instead of how well they are suited to your talents , abilities , genuine interests , values and personality traits . There 's also a good chance you 're not earning " enough " to make you " happy , " which in turn will cause you to borrow from your future happiness ( create debt ) to subsidize your current unsatisfactory level of happiness ( the definition of happiness taught to you by the corporate world ) . This is how the average person becomes trapped in a job(s) they dread going to . <p> If that 's what 's happened ( or is happening ) to you , then it 's time to get mad enough at yourself to do something about it . And the first step in stopping to act in the best interests of corporate world , and start acting in the best interests of you and your family , is to educate yourself in the science of personal finance .

This section is dedicated to helping you to learn how to plan and save for retirement , to provide you with tools to calculate retirement scenarios , and for sharing my own unique perspective on the concept of retirement . <p> Do you look forward to retirement ? If so , you have my deepest sympathies . You see , it breaks my heart to see people spend their entire adult lives working tiressly in stress-filled jobs , always dreaming of the day the can retire to do what they want , when they want , where they want , and with whom they want . What makes me sad is that it does n't have to be that way . <h> Taught to Live for Retirement <p> From the moment you and I left high school we 've been taught to do whatever it takes to get the highest paying job possible . After all , the more money you make , the nicer house you can live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes you can wear , and the nicer vacations you can take . <p> The problem with that type of thinking is , if you 're spending 40-60 hours per week in a stress-filled job that brings you no joy , allows no creative self-expression , and does n't serve to solve a problem that 's important to you , then is it truly possible to overcome that unhappiness simply by acquiring a multitude of inanimate objects that wear out and become obsolete ? Maybe for you , but not for me . <p> My contention is that the reason people look forward to retirement is because they have painted themselves into a corner with debt and financial obligations . Had they first sought to discover and pursue a work that was well suited to their talents , abilities , values and genuine interests -- instead of buying the American Dream on credit right out of school -- most people would be free to work at what they wanted , when they wanted , where they wanted , and with whom they wanted . <h> Retirement ? I 'll Pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't ever want to retire , much less look forward to it . Why ? Because I enjoy my work so much that I ca n't imagine life without it . In fact , think about all the accomplished people in our history . Famous politicians , scientists , actors , business moguls , and artists , who in spite of having plenty of wealth to retire on , continue to work until they either lose the ability to perform or until they die . It 's because they love what they do , they are good at what they do , they believe in what they are doing , and most importantly , people love , appreciate , and admire them for their work . As a side benefit , people who work past age 65 live an average of three years longer than those who retire at age 65 ( see the Life Expectancy Quiz ) . <p> If you were to list your top ten reasons to retire , I 'd be willing to bet that all of those reasons could be satisfied without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you learn to become an investor of your time and money , rather than what most people are ... spenders of time and money , and commit to discovering and pursuing a work that does n't feel like work at all , you too may find yourself never wanting to retire . <p> In fact , my wish for you is that you eventually discover and pursue a work that causes you to never want to retire either .

After all , they profit greatly from spreading the belief that borrowing money to purchase a home is " good " debt . In fact , they even have a lot of so-called , " financial experts , " on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial experts give as to why a mortgage is a type of " good " debt , is because if for some reason you can no longer afford to make the payments you can pay the loan off simply by giving the home back to the mortgage company . I ca n't help but wonder what those same financial experts are telling clients who are now upside down in their mortgages ( market value of home dropped to well below what they owe on the home ) and have lost their jobs . <h> Borrowing is ... Living Beyond Your Means <p> The truth is , no matter how you slice it , borrowing money to purchase something that does n't generate a payment-offsetting income is an act of living beyond your means ( spending more than you earn ) .

Working Twice as Hard for the Same Result <p> The second negative consequence of taking on financial obligations ( borrowing earnings from your future to live better today ) is that you will have to pay back more money than you borrowed ( principal PLUS interest ) . And the higher the interest rate and longer the repayment term , the more money you will spend to purchase the otherwise fixed-price item . <p> If you buy a $250,000 home using a 30-year , 6% mortgage , by the time you make the final payment you will have paid $540,000 for the $250,000 home .

In other words , you will have already paid income taxes on your contributions based on your tax bracket at the time of each contribution . The earnings from a Roth IRA grow tax-free so qualified distributions ( withdrawals ) are not taxed . The main advantage to a Roth IRA is that once you have kept a contribution for the " seasoning period " ( currently 5-years ) , you can withdraw the contribution without tax ( you already paid the taxes ) or penalties . The main disadvantage of a Roth is that your contributions will not lower your tax liability for the year they are recorded .

A second purpose of a Roth is to enable you to leave your retirement funds for your heirs . This is because a Roth does n't have the minimum distribution requirements imposed by a Traditional IRA . A third potential purpose of a Roth IRA is if you believe you will be in a higher tax bracket after retirement , paying taxes on your contributions now might make more sense . <p> IRA to Roth Conversion Taxes : Since you have not paid taxes on the amount in your Traditional IRA , any contributions to Roth IRAs are not deductible from your income , the amount you convert will increase your taxable income for that year . The danger here , is if that increase results in pushing you into a higher tax bracket , the increased taxes may offset any advantage you hope to gain from converting . <p> Deductible Contribution : A deductible contribution is one that is within the maximum allowable annual contribution ( as of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $6,500 age 50 and older ) . In other words , if your maximum annual allowable contribution is $5,500 , any contributions adding up to less than that amount are considered " deductible , " meaning your contributions are subtracted from your taxable income for that year . <p> Non-Deductible Contribution : A non-deductible contribution is one that extends beyond the maximum allowable contribution . So if your maximum annual allowable contribution is $5,500 , but your total annual contributions add up to $8,000 , then $2,500 of your contributions will be considered " non-deductible , " meaning that portion will not be subtracted from your taxable income for that year . <p> Federal Tax Bracket : These were the latest federal tax brackets as of the last edit of this page ( 02/28/2014 ) .

If you have more than 10 debts to enter , please use the more comprehensive Get Out of Debt Calculator instead . <p> What is the rollover method ? As each smaller debt is paid off , the freed-up payment amount is then applied to ( rolled onto ) the next larger debt , and so on until all debts are paid off . As you are about to see , the rollover method can save you a ton of money in interest charges , and allow you to get out of debt sooner than you ever thought possible . <p> But before you use the rapid debt reduction calculator , please make sure you are fully aware of the biggest reason most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Budgeter Be- " Wear ! " <p> If you 've used rapid debt reduction calculators on other websites , otherwise referred to as " Debt Snowball Calculator , " " Rapid Debt Repayment Calculator , " or " Get Out of Debt Calculator , " you may not have been alerted to the single biggest reason why most people fail to successfully execute their rapid debt payoff plan . What is that reason ? It 's the total disregard of critical budget item called , " Depreciation Expense . " <p> Everything you own that can wear out ( depreciable assets ) , will wear out . For example , if you own a home , nearly everything except the main structure will need to be replaced within the next 15 years ( furniture , appliances , fixtures , roof , paint , flooring , furnace , AC , and so on ) . The question is , are you setting aside the necessary funds to replace all of your depreciable belongings as they wear out ? If not , and if you have no savings earmarked for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one to tell you this , but you are living beyond your means ! <h> Living Beyond Your Means = More Debt ! <p> If you 're not funding an " asset replacement " savings account , and you 're not willing to live without the depreciable assets as they wear out , then taking the time to create a rapid debt reduction plan will be a complete waste of your time . Why ? Because if you 're not faithfully setting aside funds to replace your depreciable assets as they wear out , then guess what 's going to happen to your debt snowball ( reduction ) plan ? That 's right , as everything wears out and needs replacing you 'll end up using credit to replace your assets , thereby increasing your debt -- not reducing it ! <h> Downsizing is Easier and Faster <p> If you ca n't afford to set aside money to replace your belongings as they wear out , then you can not afford your present lifestyle . And if that 's the case , then the only way you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan is to either increase your income , or downsize your lifestyle , or a combination of both . But since you do n't need a four-year degree to downsize your lifestyle , and you do n't pay income taxes on downsizing , it 's usually much easier and faster to become debt free by downsizing your lifestyle versus increasing your income . <h> Sticky Note <p> One question I 'm often asked by users of this calculator , is why I suggest paying off your debts from smallest balance to largest balance instead of from highest interest rate to lowest interest rate . Yes , choosing to pay off higher interest debt first will save you more money in the long run -- that is , if you manage to stick with your plan . <p> The reason I suggest starting with the lowest balance debts is because you will achieve your first successful " payoff " earlier in the plan . And the earlier you start achieving some success , the more likely you will stick with the plan . Conversely , if your first debt wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good chance you will become disappointed and abandon your plan . The defense rests . <p> Finally , once you finish using the rapid debt reduction calculator , be sure to jot down your freedom date and the total amount you will be applying to your debts .

Yet we as a society demand these young adults decide what their lifelong livelihoods will be at age 18 or 19 -- before they 've had a chance to experience the real world on their own . <p> Worse yet , these young adults are not afforded the opportunity to actually work in the field they choose until they have spent 4-6 years of their time and tens of thousands of dollars studying it . <p> In my opinion , internships ( volunteering ) in a chosen field should be a prerequisite to enrolling in college to study the chosen field . At least that way students would know first-hand whether or not they would actually enjoy working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much time and money studying it . <p> Sure , everyone wants to earn what a surgeon earns . But give a young adult the chance to accompany a surgeon when that surgeon has to tell a family that their loved one just died , and the surgeon 's coveted income-level might lose some of its appeal . This type of real world wake-up call could be applied to nearly every field of study . After all , studying a field and working in it are two totally different things . <h> Do College Graduates Really Earn More ? <p> Well , that depends on three things : <p> How much credibility you give to findings that report college graduates earn $1,000,000 more than non-grads over the course of their working lifetimes . <p> Whether or not you factor in the opportunity costs of attending college . <p> Whether or not you factor in the net-effects of higher tax brackets . <p> Now I 'm certainly not suggesting that attending college is a waste of money . What I 'm attempting to point out is that studies can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For example , considering " college graduates " includes multi-billionaires who graduated from college , it only takes a few multi-billionaires to make up the million dollar income difference between grads and non-grads . <p> Furthermore , while it may be true that college graduates earn a million dollars more in income than non-grads , how much of that million dollars is eaten up by a combination of higher marginal tax brackets and the opportunity costs of attending college ? <p> For starters , if earning a million dollars more puts a college graduate into a 25% tax bracket versus a 15% tax bracket of a non-graduate , that means that at least $100,000 of the additional income will be going to just to pay the extra income taxes . <p> And finally , what if a young adult skipped college and instead invested the $100,000 in college costs and student loan interest , along with the 4-6 years of full-time wages they could have earned ? Even figuring lost wages at $60,000 ( $15,000 per year ) , if the non-graduate earned just 5% on their $160,000 investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not-for-college fund would have earned over 1.2 million dollars in interest . <p> And sure , the billionaire-weighted college grads could invest the income difference , but that difference may actually be much less than a million due to higher tax brackets and student loan repayments . <h> The Most Important Question <p> No matter how much credibility you give to the findings that college graduates earn a million dollars more than non-graduates , a question that ca n't be answered by the study is ... <p> How many college graduates truly love their work ? <p> All too often young adults end up choosing a field of study based on the wrong reasons . Reasons such as ... <p> Because of the earning potential of the chosen field . <p> Because of the high demand for workers in the chosen field . <p> Because the chosen field has the easiest curriculum . <p> Because the chosen field is predetermined by the parents . <p> In my experience , even if a student breezes through an easy , parent-prescribed curriculum and gets hired right out of college in a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters if the college graduate spends the next 40-years hating in their work . <p> In my case , once I finally experienced the joy of earning a living performing a work I love and believe in , I began encouraging my children to discover a work they love -- a work well-suited to their talents , abilities , genuine interests , values and personality traits . <p> If it turns out that the work they discover they love requires a college degree , then yes , enroll in college . Otherwise , if the work does n't require a college degree , then they can probably get the training they need without experiencing all of the opportunity costs that come with getting a college degree . <p> Again , I 'm not trying to discourage anyone from attending college .

@@14740898 @3340898/ <h> Cash Budgeting Calculator for Envelope Budgeting System <p> Help you to create a cash spending system that is famous for helping countless others to get their spending under control . <p> This free online Cash Budgeting Calculator will calculate the percentages and distribution amounts for your own hybrid envelope budgeting system . <p> Plus , unlike other online envelope budget calculators , the cash budgeting calculator on this page will even calculate the size and number of the bills you will need in order to make precise cash distributions to your envelopes . Cool ! <h> What is a Cash or Envelope Budgeting System ? <p> In order to explain what an envelope budgeting system is , let 's start with a very basic example . <p> Suppose you get paid once per month and your monthly take-home pay is $1,000 . Further suppose that you only have four expense categories , each with budgeted amounts of $250 per month . This means each category receives 25% of the take-home pay ( 250 1000 = .25 , or 25% ) . Using the envelope budgeting system , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ( $250 ) into each of four envelopes -- each one labeled with one of the four expense categories . <p> Now , as you progress through the month , each time you spend money you withdraw the expenditure from the appropriate envelope . When an envelope is empty , you know you 've reached your budgeted limit for that category . Therein lies the power of an envelope budgeting system . <h> Envelopes Vs . The Budgeting Abyss <p> With other budgeting systems , all of your budget records are hidden within columnar tablets or in local or online budgeting software -- making it difficult to know exactly when you are approaching or exceeding your budget limits . This is made even worse when day-to-day expenditures are made using credit cards , debit cards , and checks -- all of which lead to what I call , " the budgeting abyss . " <p> The budgeting abyss is what happens when your budget is out-of-site , out-of-mind , and your spending occurs from multiple sources , none of which are metered as a whole . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallon rating , and having 5 different leaky gasoline tanks , all with faulty fuel gauges that are located in the trunk of vehicle . A vehicle like that could not be trusted to get you to where you want to go , and neither will a budget that is abysmal . <p> With the envelope budgeting system , you are spending from a single source , you always know exactly how much you have left for each budget category , and an empty envelope is an inescapable indicator that you 've completely exhausted the funds for a given category . It 's also much harder to part with cold hard cash than it is to sign a piece of paper with an amount on it . That being said , with today 's nearly cashless society , there are many instances where paying with cash is neither wise , nor reasonable . <p> For example , you certainly do n't want to send cash through the mail to pay bills . And you probably do n't want to carry an armload of cash into your mortgage holder to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bills online , setting aside cash for them does n't make much sense . However , in spite of these cash limitations , there is still a way to use an envelope budgeting system that can harness its power , yet still accommodate cashless transactions . <h> The Hybrid Envelope Budgeting System <p> If you think about it , there are several areas in your budget where your tendencies to overspend do n't really apply . For example , have you ever blown your budget because you compulsively paid more than the stated amount due on a debt or household bill ? Probably not . So when it comes to regular debt payments and monthly household bills , the cash budgeting system would likely have no real effect anyway . <p> So how might you implement the cash budget system to harness its power ? You would implement a hybrid of the system , applying it only in those expense areas where you tend to overspend . For most people , the tendency to overspend includes one or more of the following expense categories , just to name a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dining out <p> Non-holiday gift giving <p> Holiday gift giving <p> Beauty supplies <p> Interior decorations <p> Hobbies <p> It 's those types of expense categories that are perfect candidates for a hybrid envelope budgeting system . In the hybrid system , you would total up all of your debt payments and bills , and then subtract that total from your monthly take-home pay . Whatever is left , is what you would distribute to your cash envelopes . <h> How to Know How Much to Put in Each Envelope <p> Once you know the total monthly amount of cash you will be distributing to your envelopes , the easiest way to know how much to put in each envelope is to simply use the cash budgeting calculator on this page . However , if you prefer to do the calculations yourself , here are the steps to calculating how much to distribute to each envelope : <p> Determine a monthly amount for each envelope category . <p> Divide each amount in step #1 by your total monthly take-home pay . <p> Total up all of the results from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the result of step #3 . <p> Multiply each result in Step #4 by the amount of cash your are distributing . This should tell you how much cash should go in each envelope each time you go to distribute a new influx of cash . <p> The way this usually works , is each time you get paid you deposit the amount needed to pay the current-period debt payments and bills into your checking account , and the rest you get in cash . You then multiply the amount of the cash by each envelope 's percentage ( Step #4 above ) and put that amount into each envelope . <p> Then , each time you leave the house , take whichever envelopes you think you might need and let the power of the envelope system keep you living within your means and progressing toward your goals . <h> The Most Common Objection to the Envelope System <p> Once I explain the envelope system to someone who is new to the concept , the first objection I usually get has to do with a concern for having unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be misplaced , stolen , lost in a house fire . My response is usually twofold . <p> First , if you are not having problems living within your means and you are progressing toward your financial goals at a satisfactory pace , then you have no use for the envelope budgeting system . <p> Second , I always ask to see what they have to show for the last significant amount of cash they had in their possession . If this question is followed by a blank stare from the person I asked the question to , my response is usually ... <p> Your reserves of cash are probably less at risk if they are susceptible to loss , theft or fire versus being susceptible to your compulsive spending . <p> If you have nothing to show for your past expenditures except for high interest rate credit card balances , then what difference would it really make if an amount of cash was lost , stolen or burned up ? <h> Hybrid Envelope System Great for Allowances ! <p> If you 've spent much time reading the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that regardless of who earns the money , or who earns the most money , every person in the household beyond the age of 6 should be given a monthly allowance to budget as they see fit . The older the family member , the more of their own expenses they become responsible for , and the higher their allowance . <p> Whatever the allowance for each household member turns out to be , the envelope budgeting system is a great tool for all ages . Simply replace " monthly take-home pay " with " monthly allowance , " and let each family member use the cash budgeting calculator to create their own envelope budget based on what is important to them . <p> This is a great way to teach budgeting to kids at a young age , while insuring that everyone in the household has a vested interest in minimizing household expenses and paying off debt -- because it leads to higher allowances for everyone ! <p> With that , let 's use the Cash Budgeting Calculator to calculate percentages and distribution amounts for your hybrid envelope budgeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills you will need in order to distribute the exact amount to each envelope . <p> Cash or Envelope Budget Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter your monthly take-home pay or allowance and the current amount you want to distribute to your envelopes . <p> Next , for each envelope , enter a name and a payment amount , and select the payment frequency . <p> The payment amount will be translated to a monthly amount , an envelope percentage , and an envelope dollar amount .

For example , if you know you spend $100 per week on groceries , enter 100 for the amount , and select Weekly from the Frequency menu . The cash budgeting calculator will automatically calculate the monthly equivalent . <p> Frequency column : For each envelope entered , select the payment frequency that applies to the payment amount you entered in the Amount column . The cash budgeting calculator will multiply the payment amount by the number of payments per year , and then divide by 12 to get the monthly amount . <p> Monthly column : This column contains the calculated monthly amounts based on the entered payment amounts and the selected payment frequencies . The cash budgeting calculator divides each monthly amount by the monthly take-home pay ( or allowance ) to determine the percentage each category represents of the whole . <p> % column : This column contains the calculated percentages that each envelope receives from each cash distribution . These percentages will continually be recalculated as you add to or change your entries . <p> Envelope column : This column contains the calculated dollar amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please note that the last envelope listed will receive whatever is left after distributing the amounts that precede it .

In other words , during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe to the lending institution stays the same as it was before you made your first payment . <p> Of course , after the IO payment term has expired , you will then need to convert the IO loan to a conventional PI mortgage , wherein you actually begin reducing the amount you owe to the mortgage company . And because you will be paying down the principal , the amount of your monthly mortgage payment will increase ( is that something you want to look forward to ? ) . <p> Looking at it another way , an IO home loan is a cleverly-devised home financing method that allows a real estate company to sell you more home than you can afford , while allowing the mortgage company to earn finance charges on higher loan balances that would not exist if home buyers only bought homes they could afford . <p> Ironically , the same mortgage company that accuses you of throwing money away by renting , has no problem at all with you sending them pure finance charge payments that buys you absolutely nothing .

The result will be a house that will be more in line with what you can actually afford -- provided you have accurately forecasted the ongoing costs of owning the house ( insurance , property taxes , utilities , maintenance , repairs , replacement costs , commute costs , etc . ) . <p> By reducing the size of the mortgage to allow you to make PI payments equal to the IO payment , at the end of the IO payment period your mortgage payment will remain unchanged . This results in a monthly savings equal to the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , because you are buying a smaller , more affordable home , you will start saving money immediately in the form of reduced house ownership costs ( insurance , property taxes , utilities , etc . ) . <p> So what can you do with all the money you 'll be saving ? You could apply it to your mortgage to pay it off early . Or , you could use it to pay off high APR debt . Or , you could invest it to earn interest on finance charge savings . Or , you could combine it with the equity you are building and trade-up to a bigger house without having to borrow more money . The possibilities to save ( earn ) money using this idea are endless . <p> With that , let 's use the Interest-Only Home Loan Calculator to calculate the before and after payments and the total cost of an IO mortgage , and then build a numerical case for the money-saving PI alternative I just covered . <p> Interest Only Mortgage Payment Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the home loan amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home loan term in years . <p> Next enter the interest-only period in years and the percentage return you expect to earn on your investments , then click the " Calculate Monthly Mortgage Payments " button . @qwx194657 <p> Monthly IO home loan payment : This how much your monthly IO payment will be . This does not include property tax or insurance payments . <p> Monthly payment after IO period : This is what your monthly payment will increase to once the interest-only payment period has expired . <p> Total IO home loan interest cost : This how much finance charges you will pay on the interest-only house loan after making all payments for the term entered . <p> More affordable principal and interest loan amount : Based on the IO payment amount , this is the size of a conventional PI mortgage you could take out for the same monthly payment . In other words , at this loan amount you would be making the same payment as the IO payment amount , but in this case you will be paying down on the principal balance instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage company . <p> More affordable home loan interest cost : This is how much finance charges you would pay if you purchased a smaller home with the more affordable loan amount and made monthly principal and interest ( PI ) payments . <p> Interest savings over IO home loan : This is how much finance charges you could save from buying a smaller home with a more affordable loan amount and making PI payments versus a larger loan amount with IO payments . <p> Future value of invested interest savings : If you invested the difference between the interest-only payment and the post-interest-only payment , this could be the future value of your investment once the mortgage is paid off .

The average , math-phobic person does n't stand a chance . <p> Now , just imagine if every gas station sold its gasoline in different units of volume . Some stations sell gasoline by the ounce , some sell by the liter , some by the quart , some by the pound , and so on . <p> Now further imagine that every gas station sold gasoline brands that varied in combustibility , meaning each brand would propel a vehicle different distances given equal volumes . <p> If that were true , do you think people would comparison shop for gasoline ? Probably not . It would likely cause the death of gasoline comparison shopping -- a death due to complications . <p> You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to ripping off consumers . They have made their offers so complex and so full of ticking time bombs that the average person has no way of knowing which credit card transfer offer is the best of those that are being offered -- much less which will cause them to become a future soup kitchen patron , and which may not . <p> And while our government has made a minimal effort to force credit card companies to disclose their ticking financial time bombs to consumers , little has been done to educate consumers to the point they can clearly see just how devious and manipulating credit card companies are . <p> If the government has to step in and force a company to disclose the drawbacks of its product , and the company complies by displaying its mandated disclosures in unreadable , fine print , how can anyone trust that company enough to become one of their customers ?

This section is dedicated to helping you to get the greatest financial and emotional returns from your labors , and for sharing my own unique perspective on the concept of income . <p> We 've all heard the phrase " Time is Money , " but have you ever stopped to consider that the opposite is also true ? The opposite being , " Money is Time . " <h> Money IS Time <p> Consider this . When you spend time serving an employer or customer , the employer or customer gives you a receipt for your time in the form of a denomination of money . In other words , money is simply a receipt for time spent serving others , which in turn can be exchanged for other people 's time ( their time spent providing goods and services to you ) . <p> How much are these time receipts worth ? Well , that depends on what you do with them . So before you go blaming your boss , company , or customers for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing the time receipts . <p> If you exchange a denomination of your time receipts for a product or service that loses all of its value within a short time of purchase ( an expendable ) , the return on your time spent serving others is limited to the momentary value provided by the product or service . <p> Or , if you exchange a denomination of your time receipts for a product or service for which the value decreases over time ( a depreciable asset ) , then again , the return on your time spent serving others is limited to the ever-decreasing value of the product or service . <p> Finally , if you exchange a denomination of your time receipts for a product or service for which the value increases over time ( an appreciable asset ) , then the return on your time spent serving others can grow exponentially ( compounding interest ) . In fact , as you exchange more and more of your time receipts for appreciable assets , you will become increasingly free to work at what you want , when you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Time is your ONLY and Most Precious Resource <p> Now , if you agree that Money IS time , then it 's important to also realize that you only have one thing in your life that you can exchange for happiness . It 's your time ( money in your possession is simply banked time ) . And since time is your life 's limited and most precious resource , you should ask yourself this question each an every time you contemplate exchanging a portion of your banked time , or in the case of buying on credit , exchanging your future time for a product or service : <p> Will this exchange of my life 's most precious resource serve to maximize the emotional returns from the time I invested in serving others ? <p> And be sure to keep this in mind as well . One of the things you can exchange banked time for is time off from work , i.e. , time to spend with people who care about you as a person , not just for what you can do for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( how you 're choosing to serve others ) , the less likely you will be able to exchange your time receipts for something that will more than offset the emmotional losses you 're experiencing from work . <p> More on that subject throughout this site .

I work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise by upping the % we contribute to our 401K each year . With " save your raise " being such a common slogan , I would think that a calculator that helped you realize the benefits of doing that would be out there . Would love to see one . -- Trey <p> Of course , the first thing I realized after receiving the email is that I did n't have a 401(k) calculator on the site , much less have one with a " Save Your Raise " feature . <p> Well , after building the calculator and seeing for myself what a huge difference it can make to contribute all ( or even a modest percentage ) of your future raises to your 401(k) , it 's no wonder employers are encouraging their employees to save their raises . <p> Thank you , Trey , for taking the time to submit your valuable and enlightening request . <h> What is a 401k ? <p> A 401k is basically a tax-deferred , retirement savings plan that is sponsored by an employer . <p> In other words , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59-1/2 , you pay no income taxes on the portion of your salary you contribute to your 401k , nor on the interest earned , until you actually withdraw the funds . <p> One of the reasons 401k 's are popular with employees , is because in many cases employers offer to match all or part of their employees ' contributions -- usually up to a certain percentage of their annual salary . However , in most cases you will need to work for your employer a minimum number of years before you become the actual owner of the matching contributions ( also known as becoming " fully vested " ) . <h> How Does a 401k Work ? <p> While there are multiple variations and exceptions , a 401k typically works like this : <p> You choose where you want the funds invested ( usually from a selection offered by your 401k plan ) . <p> You designate an amount or percentage of your wages to contribute to your 401k . <p> Your employer withholds your contributions from your gross wages ( before taxes are taken out ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your 401k . <p> Earnings on your 401k grow on a tax-deferred basis . <p> Once you reach age 59-1/2 ( or age 55 if you officially retire ) you can begin making withdrawals from your 401k without penalty . Prior to that you may be assessed a 10% early withdrawal penalty . In either case , your withdrawals will be subject to income taxes . <h> Contribution Limits <p> Lastly , the tax implications created by 401k plans can be very complex , so please be sure to consult with a qualified tax professional before making any decisions related to your plan . <p> With that , let 's use the 401(k) Retirement Calculator to forecast how much your 401(k) will be worth when you retire , and how much annual retirement income that value might provide . <p> Calculate 401(k) Future Value and Income <p> Instructions : Enter your current age and the age you plan to retire at . <p> Next , enter your current 401(k) balance ( if any ) and the annual rate of return you expect to earn . <p> Next , enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow by each year ( if any ) , and then select your pay frequency . <p> Next , enter the percentage of your salary you plan to contribute to your 401(k) each year .

And if you hope to achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary profitability , then you must track , plan , and monitor your personal finances with the same diligence and attention to detail as they do . <p> Having been in business for myself for most of my adult life , I have seen countless businesses start , but only a handful that manage to survive more than a year or two . And if there 's a common thread between all of the business failings I 've witnessed , it 's that the owners ( now former owners ) lacked a keen understanding of cash flow -- which is the life blood of any business , including yours . <h> Are You Pulling Water Skiers Behind Your Insurance Premium ? <p> Most business failings start the same way . The new business owner suddenly sees a " surplus " in his/her checking account , and the next thing you know they can be seen driving a new pickup towing a new speed boat . But what these owners fail to realize , is that the cash they spent was not at all " surplus , " but was cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accrued expenses ( expenses that were incurred previously , but not billed until a later date ) . <p> In other words , what these owners mistook for being play money , was in fact money that had technically already been spent . For example , if the business was just entering its 3rd operating quarter , and the annual insurance premium of $15,000 was due in December , then at least $7,500 ( $15,000 2 ) of the money spent for the new pickup and boat should have been held in reserve to make the insurance premium when it comes due . But an insurance premium is only one of many types of expenses that accrue over time , but for which the bill does n't come due until some time in the future . <p> Here are a few accruing expenses that might apply to your life business : <p> Holiday and special occasion gift giving <p> School clothing and supplies <p> Car license plates/tabs <p> Car insurance <p> Car maintenance , repairs , and replacement <p> Property taxes <p> Dues and subscriptions <p> Vacations <p> Union dues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement <p> Life insurance <p> Medical , dental , and optical procedures <p> Funeral and burial expenses <p> Tax preparation <p> College tuition <p> Retirement <p> Regardless of whether or not you choose to set money aside for your accruing expenses , they are accruing and the bills will be coming due . If you do n't have the cash available to pay them , you might enter the first stage of going out of business -- negative cash flows . <h> Negative Cash Flows : First Stage of Business Failure <p> The first stage of going out of business occurs when the business is unable , untrained , or unwilling to meet accrued expenses as they come due . This forces the business owner to borrow funds in order to pay those expenses . This increased debt then leads to reduced cash flows ( higher debt payments ) , which then leads to even more debt . This vicious cycle eventually stops when lenders are no longer willing to borrow the owner money . Bye , bye business . <p> Again , your life business is no different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside funds for your accruing expenses , do n't be surprised if one of your accruing expenses turns out to be ... a " retainer fee " for a bankruptcy attorney . <p> Cash to your life business is like gasoline to a gas powered automobile . Without it your life ca n't go anywhere , so I hope you will take the necessary steps to keep your " cash " tank from running on empty .

Because if your child is not certain as what to they want to study to become -- by the time they graduate high school -- you can almost bet that it will take them a year or two longer to get their degree . <p> Or worse , if your child ends up getting a degree for the wrong reasons ( because the field pays well , easiest route to a degree , etc. ) , you could end up paying tens , even hundreds of thousands of dollars for a degree in a field they end up hating . <p> College Financial Planning Waster : When your child spends 4 years getting a degree they never use ! <p> Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree that is never used , your college financial planning should include helping your child to develop a clear and meaningful career path . <h> Help Your Child Discover a Work They Will Enjoy <p> In my opinion , beyond the normal responsibilities that come with raising children , the next most important thing you can do for them is to help them discover a work they will enjoy -- a work that is well suited to their talents , abilities , genuine interests , values , and personality traits . <p> This involves paying very close attention to things like ... <p> What do they seem naturally good at ? <p> What do others most appreciate them for ? <p> What school subjects do they excel at without having to be pushed and prodded ? <p> What types of problems do they most enjoy solving ? <p> What types of magazines or books do they read without being forced ? <p> What do they spend their discretionary money on ? <p> What extra-curricular activities do they enjoy ? <p> Do they have a favorite hobby ? <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service they will most enjoy providing to others , not a career that will make you as the parent happiest or proudest . <h> Form a Solid " Best Livelihood " Hypothesis , Then Help Them Test It <p> The goal should be to form a solid hypothesis as to what type of job or business your child would most enjoy by the time they enter their last year of high school -- preferably sooner . <p> Once a solid hypothesis is reached , the next step is to help them find ways to test that hypothesis in the real world -- without making a long term time or money commitment -- such as after-school jobs , micro-business ventures , or volunteering . <p> If your initial hypothesis proves inconclusive , form another hypothesis and test that one .

" Why not ? Because if the interest rate is higher and/or the repayment term is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest charges than if you did n't combine your debts into a single loan . You see , it 's the total cost ( loan fees and interest charges ) of the consolidation loan that determines if you will actually save any money , NOT the payment amount . <p> Con #2 : Another potential drawback to consolidating your debts , is that most people I know who have consolidated their debts have done so using a home equity loan ( HELOC ) . What 's wrong with that ? Well , nothing ... unless it bothers you that you are probably converting mostly non-secured debts into a secured debt . <p> If you fall behind in your payments on a non-secured debt , about the most that can happen is that you might get harassed by a bill collector . However , if you fall behind on your mortgage payment you could end up living in a homeless shelter .

@@14740910 @3340910/ <h> Car Lease vs Buy Calculator toCalculate Cost Comparison <p> Help you to compare the cost of buying a vehicle with the cost of leasing a new vehicle , and show you the lost interest for both . <p> This free online Car Lease vs Buy Calculator will calculate a total and year-to-year cost comparison for vast array of lease vs buying a car scenarios . <p> And unlike other online auto lease calculators , the car lease vs buy calculator on this page will calculate the buy vs lease cost comparison for the number of years you expect to repeat the auto lease or auto purchase . <h> Leasing Should Always Cost More Than Buying a Car <p> The reason leasing a car should always be the more expensive alternative , is because if you own the purchased vehicle long enough , you open the door to two money-saving opportunities . <p> First money-saving opportunity : The longer you own a purchased vehicle , the lower will be the average annual depreciation rate . So if you lease ( or buy ) a new vehicle every 2 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense may run as high as 20% of the purchase price . On the other hand , if you purchase a new vehicle every 10 years , the average annual depreciation rate may be less than 10% of the purchase price . <p> The following chart shows how the average annual depreciation expense percentage drops the longer you own a purchased vehicle ( be sure to experiment with your entries into the car buy vs lease calculator to see the difference years of ownership can make ) . <p> $20,000 Automobile at 20% Annual Depreciation <p> YearsOwned <p> End of YearMarket Value <p> Depreciation <p> CumulativeDepreciation <p> **25;1106;TOOLONG <p> 1 <p> $16,000 <p> $4,000 <p> $4,000 <p> 20.00% <p> 2 <p> $12,800 <p> $3,200 <p> $7,200 <p> 18.00% <p> 3 <p> $10,240 <p> $2,560 <p> $9,760 <p> 16.27% <p> 4 <p> $8,192 <p> $2,048 <p> $11,808 <p> 14.76% <p> 5 <p> $6,554 <p> $1,638 <p> $13,446 <p> 13.45% <p> 6 <p> $5,243 <p> $1,311 <p> $14,757 <p> 12.30% <p> 7 <p> $4,194 <p> $1,049 <p> $15,806 <p> 11.29% <p> 8 <p> $3,355 <p> $839 <p> $16,645 <p> 10.40% <p> 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> $2,147 <p> $537 <p> $17,853 <p> 8.93% <p> Second money-saving opportunity : If you own a purchased vehicle long enough eventually the auto loan will be paid off -- meaning that for as long as you continue to own the vehicle you will not have a monthly car payment . <p> However , if you lease a new vehicle at the end of every lease term you will always have a monthly lease payment . <p> And take a guess as to what you can do with that monthly car payment that you will no longer have to pay out ? <p> That 's right , you can be depositing that amount to your savings account each month . In turn this means that if you keep the vehicle for twice as long as the loan term , you should be able to pay cash for your next vehicle -- thereby avoiding future interest and lease fees all together . <p> And what can you do with the future lease or interest fees you will be saving ? <h> Cash Versus Buying or Leasing <p> Because , since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can assign the proper value to that denomination of cash . Whereas if you borrow the money to purchase a vehicle , or borrow the value of the vehicle ( lease ) , you have no idea what you will have to do to earn the money needed to repay the value you borrowed -- meaning you wo n't be able to assign a proper future value to it . <p> What do I mean by " assigning the proper value " to cash or future value ? <p> Think of it this way . Would $100 a month be more valuable to you if you were earning minimum wage than if you were earning $100 per hour ? <p> Or , would $100 a month mean more to you if you were digging trenches by hand in bitter cold weather instead of performing a work you loved in a comfortable environment ? <p> Or , does $100 mean as much to Bill Gates ( billionaire ) as it means to you ? <p> You see , it 's not the denomination of cash that determines its ultimate value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And since you do n't have a crystal ball , you really have no idea of what you will have to do to earn future denominations of money . Therefore it is absolutely impossible to make wise financial decisions with money you have n't yet earned . <p> What if you lose your job and find yourself making half as much as you used to ? Will you be willing to work twice as many hours to make the monthly loan or lease payments ? <p> What if you discover a dream job that perfectly suits your talents , abilities , and genuine interests , but it would require you to take a cut in pay ? Would you still consider the auto purchase or auto lease to have been a wise decision if you ca n't afford to take the dream job due to these high payment obligations ? <p> You see , paying cash for a car is the only way you can make a car buying decision that will serve your best interests now and in the future . <h> Could You Afford Your Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash needed to purchase a car now , then it 's likely you could n't " afford " the last vehicle you purchased . <p> The only way to determine what price you can afford to pay for a vehicle , is to determine what price range will allow you to set aside the depreciation expense each month . This is an amount that is over and above any lease or loan payments you are making , saved for the purpose of paying cash for your next vehicle -- cash that you can assign a proper value to . <p> So if you ca n't afford to pay cash for a car , you ca n't afford the car . Yes , you may need the car even though you ca n't afford it . But this only means you will need work twice as hard to save up enough cash so that you can make a wise financial decision when it comes time to buy your next vehicle . <p> With that , let 's use the Car Lease vs Buy Calculator to calculate the total and year-to-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of years you expect to repeat the leasing or buying process . <h> Car Lease vs Buy Calculator Glossary of Terms <h> Car Lease vs Buy Calculator Mutual Entries <p> Purchase price : The purchase price of the car less any dealer rebates or cash incentives . The car lease vs buy calculator will use this price for both buying and leasing scenarios . <p> Down payment : The amount of cash you plan to pay up front . For leasing , the amount is referred to as a " Capitalized Cost Reduction , " as in the prepayment of depreciation . For buying , this amount is referred to as a down payment , which effectively lowers the amount of money you need to borrow for the purchase . <p> Sales tax rate : The combined total percentage of all applicable tax rates ( state , local , etc . ) .

The car buy vs lease calculator will generate a new lease at the end of each lease , and a new car purchase at the end of each ownership term . <h> Car Lease vs Buy Calculator Lease Entries <p> Lease months : The lease term in number of months . The typical lease term is 24 months . Lease terms over 36 months will usually offset any benefits to be gained by leasing . <p> Interest rate : The annual interest rate of the lease . If the lease terms state a Money Factor , multiply the money factor by 2,400 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate as a percentage ( for .09 , enter 9% ) . <p> Fees : The total of any upfront fees that will be due at signing ( acquisition fees , etc . ) . Do not include the down payment as it has its own entry field at the top of the car lease vs buy calculator . <p> Residual % : The expected residual value percentage ( RV% ) . The residual value percentage estimates the market value of the car at the end of the lease . So if the RV% is 55% , the car is expected to be worth 55% of its original purchase price at the end of the lease . As a reference point , the RV% is usually 50%-58% for a 36 month lease . <p> Security dep : The amount of any security deposit that may be required at the beginning of the lease .

Do not include the down payment as it has its own entry field at the top of the car lease vs buy calculator . <p> Ann Deprec % : The annual depreciation percentage of the vehicle . If you expect the car to depreciate quickly , enter 20% . For average rate of depreciation , enter 15% . For a car that holds its value for a longer period of time ( typically high-end vehicles ) , enter 10% . <p> Own years : The number of years you plan to own the car for before trading it in on a new car .

This amount may change during the number of years you indicated you would like the car buy vs lease calculator to calculate a comparison for .

Note that the only portion of a monthly car loan payment that is an actual expense , is the interest portion of the payment . The other actual expense occurs as the market value of the car drops ( depreciates ) . The specific amount of the depreciation expense can not be determined until the car is actually sold , traded-in , or scrapped . Therefore all depreciation expenses are merely estimates based on the annual depreciation rate you entered . <p> Lost interest : This is the estimated amount of interest earnings you would lose if you chose to buy at the terms you entered instead of lease at the terms you entered -- for the number of years you indicated you wanted to scenario to be played out for .

Why not ? Because if you continue to borrow money to pay for your family vacations you will have less and less money available for future vacations . And the more financial stress you experience as a result of the ever-increasing monthly debt payments , the more you will feel you need an escape ( vacation ) from the added stress , and the more you will have to borrow to escape . It 's a vicious cycle that can lead to financial and emotional bankruptcy . <h> Budget Travel Tip #2 : Travel On a Budget <p> If you want to avoid jeopardizing future vacations , it is imperative that you create a realistic budget for your trip and then stick to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards is safer than traveling with cash . But unlike an empty wallet , a credit card does not provide a clear indication you 've exceeded the amount you budgeted for a given expense category . Therefore , in order to make sure you stay within your travel budget limits , it 's important that you keep a running tab of all of your travel spending as it occurs . <p> One of the best ways I have found to keep a running tab of your travel spending is to use a blank checkbook register . Simply allocate a few pages of the register for each trip expense category , and then record the budgeted amount as the starting balance for each series of pages . Next , record each expenditure as they occur into the appropriate section of the checkbook register and deduct the amount from the balance just as you would when writing a check . When the balance of a category reaches zero you know you have exhausted the funds budgeted for that category . Spending any more for a zero-balance category means you will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . <h> Budget Travel Tip #3 : Give Equal Focus to the Post Vacation <p> In order to successfully plan a budget family vacation , it 's important to use your imagination for more than just imagining how much fun you will have . You also need to give equal focus to imagining how you will feel about the vacation after it has occurred . You can do that by honestly answering the following types of questions . <p> Will the memories , souvenirs , and photos be as exciting to you as looking forward to the vacation ? <p> Will you spend the next year partially depressed because you dearly miss laying on the beach , hearing the ocean waves crash onto shore , and being waited on hand and foot ? <p> Will you spend several weeks working harder than normal just to catch up on everything you fell behind on while away ? <p> How many hours did you have to work at your job in order to earn the after-tax , **26;1133;TOOLONG income to pay for the vacation ? <p> After calculating the lost interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vacation , will you still see the vacation as being a good investment ? <p> Is there anything else you could have bought with the cost of the vacation that the family could have enjoyed for a longer period of time than the length of your vacation ? <p> After returning home from your vacation do you think you will feel like you could have gotten by with less of a vacation ? <p> The bottom line is , do n't be like most people who only use their imaginations to envision how much they will enjoy the " party " aspect of their actions , while failing to use their imaginations to envision the " hangover " aspect of their actions . <p> With that , let 's use the Travel Budget Calculator to create a self-calculating , custom or sample travel budget worksheet to enable you to travel on a budget . <p> If you would like to have the travel budget calculator populate the categories and category expense fields with sample travel budget descriptions , click the " Load Sample travel Budget Descriptions " button . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions .

But if he/she insists on a $150 pair of designer jeans , the other $120 should come out of his/her allowance . <p> After all , he/she is the sole beneficiary of the amount spent over and above the cost of a basic pair of blue jeans . <p> The neat thing is , when the household is only expected to provide the bare essentials , this allows the household budget to be lowered to make room for allowances . <p> In turn , these allowances will help to insure that each family member gets their fare share of the surplus to spend and save as they so choose -- without being persecuted for infringing on the rights of others to get what they want . <h> Allowance for Chores ? <p> Personally , I do n't believe in paying allowances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expected tradeoff for the basic essentials the household is providing to its occupants . <p> The older the child , the more they should be giving back to the household by way of doing chores . <p> If a child is not performing the chores that have been assigned to them , it 's likely because the parent(s) is not giving the child what she/he so desperately desires . <h> Give Your Kids What They Want Without Taking Away What They Need <p> Kids are no different than adults . What they truly desire is to be loved , appreciated and admired . <p> So if you 're not delivering the love , appreciation , and admiration your children crave , do n't be surprised if they rebel against your wishes . <p> Sure , you do need to set and enforce the rules and chore responsibilities . And yes , it is difficult to find a balance between being an enforcer and a nurturer . But if you do n't give your children what they desire most , you will likely end up with a mutiny on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be paying them . <p> If you are one of those parents who comes home from work all stressed out from a job that you hate but that you have financially trapped yourself in , and your first order of business is always to escape the presence of all things human , then the only way your child is going to get any attention at all from you is if they act out or fail to properly perform their chores . <p> If we want our kids to perform their chores , then ... <p> We need to spend quality time with them ( love ) and always take the time to notice and offer praise whenever they meet or exceed our expectations ( appreciation and admiration ) . <p> Reducing kids ' allowance as a form of punishment only serves to complicate the allowance system and will do nothing to address the root cause of the problem . <p> Children are not equipped to connect long-term consequences with present-term behavior . <p> Your children will lose out on the opportunity to learn how to maximize the emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critical to Their Financial Education <p> The biggest reason I believe that paying a child a steady , dependable allowance is important is because it provides parents with the opportunity to teach their children how to manage their money . <p> Over time you can teach them how to track , plan , spend , and save their allowance in a way that brings them the highest and most lasting emotional returns . <p> This hands-on training helps your children to learn from their own mistakes while the consequences are less costly , instead of forcing them to learn from their mistakes as adults -- when the consequences are much more serious and ever-lasting . <p> The thing to be aware of is that someone will teach your children how to manage their money ( someone other than the public education system that is , who are graduating our children without an ounce of meaningful financial training ) . <p> The question is , do you want to be the teacher of your children ? Or do you want self-serving sellers and expert marketers to be their teachers ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So if you are a compulsive spender and a poor money manager , then they are getting bad teaching from all sides . <h> How Much Allowance ? <p> So how much allowance should you pay your children ? Well , the rule of thumb is to pay each child $1 per week for every 1-year of age . <p> In other words , if your child is 8-years-old , then you would pay the child $8 per week for their allowance . <p> However , this is only a rule of thumb and should not be implemented if doing so will jeopardize the household 's financial stability . <h> Budget Surplus Percentage Method <p> The best method for determining the allowances for family members is to first create a household budget that provides for basic household essentials -- including all non-monthly bills and expenses that are accruing behind the scenes . <p> Once you have allocated funds for all basic essentials , whatever is left ( budget surplus ) is the amount to be used to pay out allowances to all family members based on a system of percentages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are the source of the income in the first place , they should receive the largest share of the surplus , with each child receiving a percentage of the remaining surplus based on their age and level of responsibility . <p> The older the child , the more they are expected to pay for their own needs and wants , and therefore the higher percentage of the children share they receive . <p> The beauty of the budget surplus percentage method of paying allowances , is that ... <p> Everyone in the household gets their own money to spend as they see fit , and .... <p> Everyone has a vested interest in reducing household bills and expenses because it leads to higher and higher allowances . <p> Think of it as a " profit sharing " reward program for the household . <p> With that , let 's use the Family Allowance Budget Calculator to create an equitable profit sharing plan for you household . <p> Family Allowance Budget Calculator <p> Instructions : Select the period the budget surplus applies to and then enter the surplus amount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of parents in the household . <p> Next enter the name and age of each of the children in the household ( also enter percentages if you want to set them yourself ) , and then click the " Calculate Allowance for Kids and Adults " button . <p> Once you are satisfied with the results , click the " Create Printable Family Budget Worksheet " button to open the results in a printer friendly window . @qwx194657 <h> Family Allowance Budget Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Household budget surplus : Select the period the budget surplus applies to and then enter the surplus amount .

This makes the solver especially useful for checking the answers you derive from solving the equations manually . <h> What is a Linear Equation ? <p> A linear equation is an expression that can be written in the form ax+b=0 , where a and b are constants and x represents an unknown variable that , once found , will make the expression true . The following are some basic examples of linear equations having one variable : <p> 7x + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 4 = 4 ( y - 3 ) <p> 16.5a + .25a = 25.1a <p> 1 <p> x <p> + <p> 3 <p> = <p> 2 <p> x <p> - <p> 4 <p> 2 <p> 4 <p> 5 <h> How to Solve Linear Equations <p> Solving linear equations is a process aimed at getting the variable by itself on one side of an equal sign and everything else on the other side . In order to explain how to solve linear equations , I will use an example equation that contains all 4 types of terms that can be handled by the linear equation solver . <p> Example equation : <p> 3(x-1)+1/2=.25+4 <p> First use the distributive property to get rid of the parenthesis : <p> 3(x-1) = 3x-3 <p> After removing parenthesis we are left with : <p> 3x-3+1/2=.25+4 <p> Remove the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 ( least common multiple of all denominators in equation ) : <p> 2(3x-3+1/2)=2(.25+4) <p> After multiplying both sides by 2 we are left with : <p> 6x-6+1=0.5+8 <p> Remove decimals by multiplying both sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides by 100 we are left with : <p> 600x-600+100=50+800 <p> Combine the like terms : <p> -600 + 100 = -500 and 50 + 800 = 850 <p> After combining like terms we are left with : <p> 600x-500=+850 <p> Add 500 to both sides of the above equation to get constants on right side : <p> -500 + 500 = 0 and 850 + 500 = 1350 <p> After adding 500 to both sides we are left with : <p> 600x=1350 <p> Get the variable by itself by dividing both sides by 600 : <p> 600x <p> = <p> 1350 <p> 600 <p> 600 <p> After dividing both sides by 600 we are left with : <p> x <p> = <p> 1350 <p> 600 <p> Simplify the result : <p> x <p> = <p> 1350 <p> = <p> 1350 &amp;divide 150 <p> = <p> 9 <p> or <p> 2 <p> 1 <p> 600 <p> 600 &amp;divide 150 <p> 4 <p> 4 <h> Always Check to Make Sure Your Answer is a Solution <p> Regardless of which method or tool you use to solve linear equations , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable and seeing if the resulting equation proves to be true .

You can include up to 12 categories , each with up to 15 expense items . This budgeting tool even has built-in multipliers for calculating the total cost of an expense from a unit cost . Cool ! <p> Plus , unlike other online budget calculators , the wedding budget calculator on this page will give you the option of printing out a customized blank budget worksheet and/or a completed budget spread sheet . You can even choose whether or not you want blank lines to appear on the printed worksheet . <p> If you would like to budget for your honeymoon separately , be sure to visit the Travel Budget Calculator once you are done budgeting for getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wedding Costs " <p> While doing the research for this calculator I was amazed at how many websites included the average cost of a wedding in their calculations . Some sites reported an average wedding cost of $29,000 , and most even went so far as to base the calculated wedding costs breakdown on budgeting percentages for the various categories . It 's no wonder so many couples are spending so much money on their weddings . <p> I can just hear the typical spouse-to-be , " Look honey , our budget is only $25,000 . That means we are saving $4,000 dollars ! " . Well , I hate to be the one to break it to them , but " saving money " is not applicable to weddings . <p> In order to actually save money , a reduction must occur in the cost of an expenditure that is NOT optional . So given the fact that costs for weddings are optional expenses of getting married ( except for the cost of the marriage license ) , this disqualifies them from being a source of any savings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being totally insignificant to the average couple who is budgeting for a wedding . In my opinion there is only one number that should dictate how much a couple should spend to get married ... the amount they have saved up to pay for the marriage . After all , if they truly want their marriage to last , then one of the worst things they can do is to start out their marriage under the stress and pressure of debt . <h> Financial Problems Are an All-Too-Common Reason for Divorce <p> Depending on who you ask , somewhere around 1/2 of all marriages end in divorce ( less for first marriages and more for each additional marriage ) . And among those divorces , a recent study concluded that in 57% of the cases , disagreements over money was listed as the primary reason for the divorce . The question is , what causes these disagreements over money ? The answer , a lack of money . Or more specifically , a lack of discretionary money . <p> Disagreements over money typically arise when there 's not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the primary reason there 's not enough money to go around is because couples typically spend a large chunk of their future discretionary income right out of the gate . They borrow for lavish weddings , dream honeymoons , and cover of Better Homes &amp; Garden houses -- all before the ink dries on their marriage certificate . Then , seven years later when the newness of the relationships and the newness of the dream homes are gone , and the memories of the lavish weddings and dream honeymoons have faded , along comes the future from which they have already spent all of their discretionary income . Talk about bad timing . <h> The Wedding IS for YOU ! <p> If you visit a website that 's trying to sell you something related to weddings , you will no doubt read the phrase , " Weddings are not for you , they are for others . " Really ? Here 's what I say , if the " others " genuinely cared about you and your spouse-to-be , they would NEVER expect you to do anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " others " will be so busy running their own lives they will hardly give a fleeting thought to how your marriage is doing . Your wedding day affects only one day of their lives , whereas that day will effect the rest of yours . You are the one that 's going to have to deal with the opportunity costs of going into debt for the sake of having a lavish wedding on behalf of others . Opportunity costs ? You bet . <h> The Real Average Wedding Cost : $300,000 <p> If you listen to the wedding industry who is telling you that the average cost of a wedding is $29,000 -- which is just an excuse for you to spend that much -- you should also realize that when you spend that $29,000 you are also giving up the right to earn interest on that money ... for the rest of your life . <p> If two 25-year-olds were to invest the $29,000 rather than spend it on getting married , and only averaged a 6% return , by the time they reach retirement age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown to $298,285.82 . That 's the real " average wedding cost " -- all spent for a single day . <p> But even worse than spending that money instead of investing it , is if you put the entire cost of getting married on an 18% credit card and make only the 3% minimum payments . If you did that you would end up spending an additional $28,698.27 in credit card interest charges ( see the credit card minimum payment calculator ) . And guess what you could have done with those interest charges ? That 's right , you could have invested that money as well . And I 'd be willing to bet that you will never be alerted to these opportunity costs from companies who stand to gain from your expensive wedding . <h> Save the Ticker Tape Parade for Important Victories <p> Have you ever witnessed a ticker tape parade for a professional sports team that took place before their season even started ? Of course not . That 's because there wo n't be any cause for celebration until the team wins a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " season " even begins ? It 's because we 've been taught to believe that the more we spend on a wedding , the better our marriage will be . Too bad all of the rich and famous celebrities keep proving that theory wrong . <p> The bottom line is this , no amount of money spent on your wedding will insure that it will stand the test of time . But you can be sure that going into debt for a lavish wedding will put your marriage at a higher risk of failing . And for that matter , asking others to go into debt on your behalf may put their marriages at risk as well . <p> But , you say , we only have $300 saved up ? Then I say , for the sake of the success of your marriage , you have one of two choices . Either get married in the courthouse , or postpone the marriage until you 've managed to save up enough to pay for the wedding that you feel you must have . If you ca n't save up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save enough to pay for all of the other important costs of being married ( buying a house , having children , college educations , retirement , etc . ) ? <p> Now I do n't mean to say that weddings are a bad thing , or that nothing good can come from spending a small fortune on them . My only intent is to offer an alternative perspective that I hope will help to offset some of the hype being thrown at you by those who stand to gain from your decisions . My only concern is that your marriage manages to last until death do you part instead of till debt do you part . <p> With that , let 's use the Wedding Budget Calculator to create a self-calculating , custom or sample wedding budget worksheet to assist you in budgeting for a wedding . <p> Wedding Budget Calculator <p> Instructions : Enter the total amount of money you have available for budgeting for a wedding . <p> Next enter the optional numbers for each type of participant/guest ( used for quick calculations for variable expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding budget calculator populate the categories and items with a sample wedding budget , click the " Load Sample Wedding Budget " button .

Here are some of the keys that have helped me to keep that from happening . <h> Spend Within Your Means No Matter What <p> The more you spend beyond your means the more your joy from giving stands to be offset by the stress that comes with not being able to pay your bills . <p> The way I see it , the people who genuinely care about you would NEVER want you to put yourself or your family in financial difficulty just to buy them a gift . And those that feel otherwise either have their priorities mixed up , or they do n't care about you enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Leave Some Room for Unexpected Gifts <p> If we spend our entire gift buying budget to buy Christmas gifts , this will reduce the amount we can spend on giving surprise gifts on no special occasion . Gifts that totally surprise the recipient tend to bring more joy to the recipient , and therefore more joy to the giver . <h> Do n't Buy Into the Hype <p> The stress caused by financial problems is one of the leading causes in the breakdown of relationships , yet marketing experts have convinced many of us that our love for our loved ones is directly proportional to the amount of money we spend on the gifts . <p> That , of course , is total hogwash and should be viewed as an insult to your intelligence ! <p> So to avoid getting caught up in the hype , be sure to continually remind yourself and your family members that the job of marketing experts is to make profits for their employers , not to strengthen your relationships . <p> Thoughtful and unselfish acts of kindness express your love for your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Do n't Spend All of Your Quality Time <p> The more you attempt to show how much you love your loved ones by spending large amounts of money on their gifts , the more time you will need to allocate to working to earn the gift money . In turn this leaves less time for what your loved ones really want , which is for you to spend more quality time with them . <h> Become Your Own Credit Card Company <p> Instead of putting your gift purchases on high-interest credit cards , open a separate savings or Christmas Club account , apply for a debit card assigned to that account , and then begin making periodic deposits into that account . <p> This way , when it 's time to start your Christmas shopping you can use your debit card to make purchases , which will totally remove the financial stress and buyer 's remorse that might otherwise ruin your holiday spirit . <p> Plus , by paying back your own gift account instead paying back a high-interest credit card , the interest you will save will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount you are saving . Super cool ! <p> And of course , if you want to relieve the financial stress from other gift giving occasions , fund your gift account with enough to cover all gift-buying occasions ( birthdays , anniversaries , graduations , etc . ) . <h> Act Now to Preserve and Strengthen Your Christmas Joy <p> If the gift-buying aspect of Christmas is any way diminishing your Christmas joy -- and/or creating post-Christmas spending remorse -- call an emergency family meeting now and hash out a plan for eliminating the causes . <p> With that , let 's use the Christmas Budget Calculator to create an interactive budget worksheet to help keep your gift spending in check and to plan and save for next year 's gift buying . <p> Christmas Budget Calculator <p> Instructions : Choose if you would like to enter a budget amount per person on your Christmas shopping list , or if you would like to enter a budget amount for your total Christmas gift budget , then enter the corresponding budget amount . <p> Next , either enter the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of each person you are buying for ( along with an optional spending level number for each name , in the format name.number ) . <p> Then , if you would like to begin budgeting for next year 's gift buying , select the percentage you wish to expand your budget by next year , select whether you will be making weekly or monthly deposits , and select the span of months you plan to make deposits . <p> Finally , click the " Calculate Christmas Budget " button to create your person-by-person budget list wherein you can change the budget amounts for each person before printing out your customized Christmas budget . @qwx194657 <h> Christmas Budget Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Amount to budget for list : Select whether you want to enter a budget amount for each person on your shopping list , or if you want to enter the total budget amount for all of your Christmas gift buying , and the enter then corresponding budget amount . <p> Number of people you plan to buy for : If you want to print out a blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget for in this field .

" <p> It 's a great place to raise a family and has a low cost of living , but living-wage jobs are scarce and the winters are long and bitter cold . <p> Not the ideal place for a couple who loves to play golf , but we could never imagine moving away from all of our family and friends . <p> That 's why it 's important that we continue to live debt-free and below our means so we can afford to get away for our annual 10-day winter golfing ( and romance rekindling ) trip to Cozumel , Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest charges we no longer pay to lending institutions . <p> In our opinion there is no better place in the tropics to stay and play golf in the winter than the Playa Azul Hotel -- one of the founding hotels of the Jack Nicklaus designed Cozumel Country Club . <p> Javelina on Cozumel golf course <p> Sunset from Playa Azul Hotel <p> One of our other favorite winter activities was watching our two youngest sons play ice hockey . I say " was " , because all of our 8 children are now out on their own . So we 're hoping one or more of our 9 ( soon to be 10 ) grandchildren will take up the sport to help make the winters more enjoyable . <p> Jake , Age 17 ( white jersey ) <p> Taylor , Age 16 ( white jersey ) <p> We also enjoy cheering for the Minnesota Vikings , the Minnesota Wild , and our hometown high school and college hockey and football teams . <p> During the summer we try to get out to the golf course as often as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer games . Thankfully I built the website and run the golf league for a local golf club in exchange for an annual family membership , so our favorite form of exercise is far from being cost-prohibitive . <p> I even built and maintain a 30-yard by 200-yard golf practice range right next to the house -- complete with a tee box and a raised target green . This is where I spend my lunch breaks in the summer . <p> Two-tier tee box with uneven lie station <p> Raised target green <p> In the fall I enjoy deer hunting with our family , as well as the annual process of building a backyard hockey rink for them to skate on . <p> Our favorite way to shop for meat <p> Our backyard skating rink <p> Finally , when it comes to working , I absolutely love creating calculators for this website . <p> I 'm also on a mission to try to convince others to not make the same mistake I made during the first half of my working life . What was the mistake ? <p> Chasing after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-suited to my natural talents , genuine interests , personal values , and personality traits , and then learning to live within whatever means that work provides . <p> In my own defense , I did exactly as I 'd been taught . The mistake was never questioning what I was being taught . <h> My Work-Life Story in a Nutshell <p> When I was just 10 years old ( 1969 ) my mother bought me an 8 " x 8 " , gray , spiral notebook for the purpose of keeping track of the money I was earning from my newspaper route . <p> Opening to the first page , she used a straight-edge to create 5 columns . Then , from left to right she labeled the columns : Date , Description , In , Out , and Balance . <p> Mom then explained how to use the columns to keep track of how much money I made and where I spent it . I can vividly remember thinking , " Wow ! What a cool and fun activity ! " <p> And for the 23 years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did generating them . <p> You see , upon leaving high school I , like many others , chose to put money and income ahead of passion and creative self-expression . So instead of pursuing my passion of working with numbers , I pursued income . <h> The Money Chase <p> Believing more money was the key to more happiness , I took every job or business opportunity that promised to pay me more than my current job or business -- without giving a second thought to whether or not it was suited to who I am . These included : <p> Short Order Cook <p> Security Guard <p> Janitor <p> Limber on a Logging Crew <p> Mall Maintenance Chief <p> Funeral Insurance Salesman <p> Cleaning Business Owner <p> Restaurant Manager <p> Restaurant Owner <p> And of course , like most everyone else , I subsidized my never-enough income level by borrowing as much money as lenders would allow . <p> As a result , at age 30 I found myself trapped by financial obligations in a restaurant business I hated . I was working 80-hours a week in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creating delicious meals , but instead turned out to be the business of hiring , training , and firing . <p> Three years later , after 5-years of 80-hour weeks , trying to at least build up equity I could later cash in , an Indian Gaming Casino -- complete with a loss-leader restaurant -- opened its doors just down the road . My restaurant business did n't stand a chance . <p> So there I was , 33-years-old , having spent 15-years chasing after wealth , and all I had to show for it was no income and a mountain of debt . <p> But the emotional losses from the restaurant failure paled in comparison to what happened in July of that year ( 1993 ) . I held the hand of my beloved , 55-year-young mother as she lost her battle with ovarian cancer . <p> Kneeling next to Mom 's bed , with tears clouding my vision of her face , holding her lifeless hand , it finally became painfully clear to me what was really important in life . <p> It was n't money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cars , clothing , furniture or vacations . It 's the people that love and appreciate us for who we are , not for what we have or what we are poised to gain . <p> And now the most important person in the world to me , the person who had spent years trying to get me to take time off from my money-quest to spend more time with her , was gone forever . <p> Turns out the map I had been duped into following had led me away from happiness , not towards it . <h> Enter " Your Money or Your Life " <p> Following my beloved Mother 's death , I spent several months searching for answers as to how I ended up broke and unhappy -- in spite of having read a library full of books written by business and personal finance experts . <p> Thankfully , my search for answers led me to the discovery of a book that would forever change my life . <p> Suffice it to say , reading that book blew both lenses out of my rose colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> A New Map and a Happier Life <p> After reading , studying , and absorbing the 9 steps in Your Money or Your Life , I spent several weeks creating what I 've come to call , the Blueprint for My Perfect Day -- which basically included a daily schedule of what I refer to as Labors of Love ( either labors I enjoy that cause others to love , appreciate , or admire me , or labors I engage in simply because I love the benefactor ) . <p> Once I completed the Blueprint for My Perfect Day , I set out to make it my day-to-day reality . <p> What followed was a 4-year , hard-fought journey to debt freedom and a work that I love -- a work that I could schedule around the most important people and events in my life . <p> Of course , the work I discovered that I loved was creating online calculators . So in 1997 I built www.webwinder.com to promote my calculator scripting services . <p> Providing affordable , ready-made and custom calculators for websites since 1997 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then -- as demand for my ready-made and custom calculators grew -- I began to charge a fee . The higher the demand rose , the higher the fee I needed to charge in order to avoid having more clients than I could handle . <p> Eventually I found myself earning a very nice living working from home -- free to schedule my work around all of the important people and events in my life . And for at least the first couple of years , I could n't have been happier . <p> However , something began to happen that I never expected ... <p> The work I once loved started losing its appeal . <p> I can remember thinking , " What the heck happened ? ! I used to love creating online calculators , so what has changed ? " <h> 4 Steps to Turning a Work You Love Into ... a Work You No Longer Love <p> After questioning the loss of passion for my work for some time , I eventually realized that four distinct things had changed . I now call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work you once loved . <p> Step #1 : Give up creative self-expression . I was now creating more and more calculators based on customers ' specifications instead of based on how I wanted to create them . <p> Comparatively speaking , this is like asking an artist to paint by the numbers . <p> Step #2 : Work with people who ca n't make up their minds . In the case of a large majority of the custom calculator projects I took on , the customer would keep changing their mind as to how they wanted the calculator to look and operate .

However , it was better than no app at all so I continued to use the score tracker for the remainder of the season . <p> This year ( 2015 ) , as the baseball season approached , I noticed that my scorekeeping app quit functioning all together . So I thought , now is a good time to attempt to make my own scorekeeper application . <p> The baseball scorekeeper on this page is my first attempt at the laptop/notebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mobile version of the site ) . <h> Three Levels of Tracking <p> The baseball scorekeeper was designed to accommodate several levels of tracking . You can either : <p> Simply track the score . <p> Track the inning , runs , hits , errors , outs , ball , and strikes . <p> Track all of the above , plus the individual batting and pitching stats for players on both teams . <h> Local Storage Feature <p> During the scorekeeper 's planning stages I knew I needed to come up with a way of backing up the game 's stats and results as the game progressed . Otherwise , if I accidentally closed the web browser window , the game 's stats and results would be lost , and it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to recall all of the lost data . <p> Luckily , the latest versions of most web browsers ( Firefox , Safari , Chrome , Internet Explorer , etc. ) all support a feature called , " Local Storage .

" <p> If you hate your job and/or you hate spending time away from your loved ones , then what you get in return for spending your money needs to be high enough to offset the emotional losses you are experiencing from spending time at your job . Otherwise , if the emotional loss from working to pay for the item is greater than the emotional gain from the purchased item , you will have suffered an emotional net-loss ( poor investment ) from your " expenditure . " Suffer enough of these emotional net-losses , and you could find yourself in emotional bankruptcy . <p> If you are suffering constant emotional net-losses from your " spending , " I would suggest investing your money in investments that will allow you to spend less time at a work you enjoy more ( education , vocational training , career change , invest in your debt , etc . ) . <p> With that , let 's use the Free Personal Budgeting Calculator to formulate a realistic budget by calculating and becoming fully aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Instructions : Enter your average number of workdays per week , your real hourly wage , the percentage return you expect to earn on your investments , and the number of years you would like the calculator to use for estimating future value . <p> Next , select your preferred budgeting time period , enter your income sources and amounts , followed by your living expenses , payments and savings . <p> Once you are satisfied with your budgeting form entries , click the " Printable Personal Budget Worksheet " button .

Or to put in another way , a product selling for $1 now will likely sell for $1.04 a year from now . Therefore , to make a more realistic retirement plan , inflation should be considered -- though likely not at face value . After all , as prices rise , wages tend to also rise , thereby offsetting at least a portion of the effects of inflation . <p> Inflated Need : When inflation is factored into planning for retirement , the desired income goal must be annually adjusted upward by the inflation rate so that by the time you retire your income will buy the same amount of goods and services as they would today . <p> Net Present Value ( NPV ) : NPV is the sum of the present values ( PVs ) of the individual cash flows .

Or , you can leave the entire planning worksheet blank and simply print out blank weekly calendar pages to be filled in later . <p> Also , the weekly planning tool even allows you to choose which hours of the day are included in the planner -- making this tool just as valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or who begin work in the wee hours of the morning . <p> And finally , if you are using the latest version of your web browser software ( Safari , Firefox , Chrome , etc. ) , the planner creator now offers the ability to save your entries within your web browser ( using Local Storage ) between visits . <h> Use the 80 20 Rule to Maximize the ROI of Your Time <p> In case you 're not familiar with it , the 80 20 rule or 80/20 principle is a mathematical formula that was formulated and used by Vilfredo Pareto ( 1848-1923 ) to predict the distribution of wealth within a society . <p> Specifically , Pareto 's law of distribution stated that 80% of a society 's wealth was possessed by 20% of the population . However , Pareto also discovered that his 80 20 rule applied to many other types of measurable circumstances as well -- wherein 20% of the inputs yielded 80% of the outputs . <p> As it applies to time management , the 80 20 rule basically means that 20% ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or more ) of the returns on your time . <p> This means that the key to maximizing the return on your time is to identify the 20% of your time-consuming activities that are responsible for 80% of the returns , and then replace ( delegate , outsource , eliminate , etc. ) the lower returning activities ( the 80% ) with the higher returning activities ( the 20% ) . <p> This explains why I have included the color-coded time blocks with corresponding hour and percentage totals in the free printable weekly planner creator . Thanks to those features you can name up to seven types of activities and then track what percentage of your time you are planning to allocate to each type . <p> In my own case , one of the 20% activities that is largely responsible for 80% of my financial returns is creating unique and valuable content for this website . Therefore when using the time management tool on this page I use the color of money to represent " Content Creation " and then make sure my weekly calendar pages contain mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert them haphazardly . <h> Reserve Peak Productivity Time Slots for " 20% " Time Blocks <p> It 's not enough to haphazardly add time blocks of 20% activities to your week planner . After all , if you add them in weekly day-time slots where you are easily distracted and/or often interrupted , the returns from your 20% activities could sink to the depths of those yielded by the 80% activities . <p> For me , my most productive day-time slots are Monday - Friday between the hours of 7:00am ( when the kids leave for school ) and 12:30pm ( when I get hungry and need a break ) . Therefore , not only do I fill those hours with 20% activities , but I also do whatever I can to shut myself off from " 80% " interruptions ( do n't check my email , leave phone calls to my answering machine , etc . ) . <p> The bottom line is , we all get 168 hours per week . But if you take the time to carefully plan and prioritize how you will spend your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule -- you may just find yourself among the 20% that possesses 80% of the wealth . <p> With that , let 's use the free template creator to create a printable weekly planner that will help you get more of what you want from the time you invest . <p> Printable Weekly Planner Template Creator <p> Instructions : You can either add color-coded blocks of time , or edit the individual day-hour time slots individually , or print out a blank weekly calendar template . <p> To add color-coded blocks of time , enter a brief title of the activity or event , select the " to " and " from " times , select the appropriate colored radio button ( you can also change the time block text ) , and then click the " Add Block of Time to Week Planner " button . <p> To add a color-coded individual day-hour activity or event , simply select the appropriate colored radio button , click in the applicable day-hour field , and then type a brief description . <p> Any time you wish to see how your finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creator , select the " to " and " from " hours you would like included in the template , and then click the " Display Printable Weekly Planner " button .

In both cases you can choose to create the report in a detailed form or in a summary form . <p> If you would prefer to create a budget based on average monthly income and expenses , as well as see what your spending is costing you in terms of work time and lost interest earnings , please visit the Free Personal Budgeting Calculator . <h> Budgeting Made Easy ? Do n't Believe It ! <p> The primary reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to believe that it should be easy , and therefore should not require any significant commitment of time and energy . Well , I 'm here to tell you that nothing could be further from the truth . The truth is , budgeting is NOT simple , nor can it be " made easy . " <p> Believing budgeting is easy , instead of meticulously tracking their spending so they can more accurately predict future surpluses or shortages , most people quickly throw together a simplistic and unrealistic budget based on grossly-optimistic speculation , and then give up on budgeting altogether when their pathetic attempt fails to produce any results . <p> And the reason budgeting is difficult ( NOT easy ) , is because it 's not easy to deny yourself the lifestyle that most Americans feel they are simply entitled to . Instead of being taught to grow slow , paying as we go , we are taught that upon leaving school we are entitled to a luxurious home , a fancy car , extravagant vacations , and the latest release of every electronic gadget known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that this notion of material entitlement is what causes most Americans to lose the most important of all First Amendment rights ... their freedom . <p> Instead of being financially free to spend to their time serving others based on how much they enjoy their work and to what extent that work serves to solve a problem that 's important to them , most Americans enslave themselves in a mountain of debt right out of school . This forces most to choose jobs based on whatever higher paying job comes along next , rather than on how well the jobs are suited to their talents , abilities , genuine interests , and personal and family values . <p> If someone tries to tell you that budgeting is easy , I suspect it 's because they are trying to sell you a product or service that claims to do just that . So do your own budget a big favor by declining to purchase whatever they are trying to sell you . You do n't need a computer , fancy budget software , or even a monthly budget calculator to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil , some paper , the ability to add and subtract , and one more thing that I will get to in a moment . <h> The Importance of Budgeting <p> If you do n't care how you spend the time you have left on this earth , then I would tell you that budgeting is of little importance to you . <p> On the other hand , if you desire to spend your days serving others by performing a work that you enjoy and believe in , and you long for the freedom to spend more quality time with your loved ones , then I would tell you that budgeting is absolutely crucial to achieving those desires . <p> Take if from someone who 's been down that road , going from being trapped in an un-fulfilling job to discovering and pursuing a self-fulfilling work requires an ever increasing degree of freedom from financial obligations . And the only way you can free yourself from financial obligation is to create a realistic budget that is based on your past spending habits , and then to work hard at trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop increasing your debt , and later accelerate the repayment of your debt . None of this is easy , but it is doable . <h> Budgeting Skill Is Not The Key To Success <p> Since I personally know accountants and loan officers that have dug themselves into financial slavery , I 'm quite certain that it 's not your level of budgeting skill that will determine whether you succeed or fail at budgeting . Instead , I believe the key to successful budgeting is having the right motivation . In other words , if you do n't know exactly why you are making sacrifices and denying yourself pleasures , then you will not have the motivation you need to create and live within a budget -- regardless of your budgeting skill level . <p> For me , the right motivation came in 1993 . That was the year I stopped mindlessly believing what others had been telling me would make me happy ( most of whom were trying to sell me something ) , and instead started thinking for myself . <p> After several months of self-analysis and countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took everything I had gleaned from my soul-searching and used it to create a blueprint for what I considered to be my perfect day ( doing what I truly love for people and causes that are dear to me ) . That blueprint proved to be the exact carrot I needed to start giving personal money management the priority it had always deserved . While this did not make it easy to forgo instant gratification for the sake of achieving meaningful , long-term desires , I knew exactly why I was making the sacrifices and exactly what was in it for me . <p> Once you have the right motivation for creating and living with a budget you too will be able to forgo instant gratification in exchange for meaningful long-term gratification -- which is the ultimate key to successful budgeting . <p> With that , let 's use the Monthly Budget Calculator to create a monthly budget spread sheet for all of your income and spending categories and accounts , for each of the twelve months of the year . <p> Monthly Budget Calculator <p> Instructions : Change or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each category to display a scrollable budget spread sheet in the lower section of the calculator . <p> Within each category , change or enter the name of each account and enter the monthly budget for each month of each account . <h> Monthly Budget Calculator Glossary of Terms <p> Load Example Categories and Accounts button : If you would like to clear all suggested titles , for the purpose of entering your own , click the Remove Examples button on this row .

If shortages are left unchecked , the result will be an increase in your debt ( a reduction of your freedom ) . No minus sign indicates a surplus ( more income than outgo ) . A surplus can be used for reducing your debt ( an increase in your freedom ) . <p> Account column : This column will display the 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category radio button in the top section of the calculator .

@@14740946 @3340946/ <h> Workout Log Sheet Maker:Organize and Track Your Workouts <p> Helps you to design and print your own weight lifting workout log sheet that shows your strength gains at a glance . <p> This online workout schedule maker will create either a printable blank exercise log sheet , a custom log sheet based on your own categories and exercises , or a log sheet based on my own weight lifting workout schedule . <p> Over the years of working out at the gym during the winter months ( when the golf courses are closed ) , I 've come up with a system of planning and tracking my workouts that has become very popular with my friends and family . <p> In fact , the reason I decided to add the workout log sheet maker to the website is because one of my daughters is moving out of the area and asked if there was a way I could set up something where she could design and print her own gym workout chart online . <p> I will attempt to explain the log sheet system I use and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to try the system yourself . <p> The workout log sheets I designed for my own use help me to ... <p> Know where to start each new workout season . <p> Know which exercises to do when , even if I miss a few days . <p> Know how much weight to use and when it 's time to bump up the weight . <p> Instantly see my strength improvement over time . <p> Workout any number of days per week while still giving muscle groups adequate recovery time . <p> Keep my workouts short and simple , while still hitting all basic muscle groups . <h> Log Sheet Categories <p> Here is an example of a muscle-group category ( chest and laterals ) made up of five exercises . Each exercise has fields to record the weight and reps for three sets , and each row in the chart represents a single day . <p> Note that categories can be labeled as muscle groups , days of the week , or whatever you deem appropriate for your own workout plan . <h> Log Sheet Exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights and reps for each exercise : <p> I start the season doing 1 set of each exercise , and then gradually increase to 3 sets . <p> Once I get to 3 sets , I start using a weight that allows me to do sets of 20 , 15 , and 12 reps . <p> Each time I repeat the exercise , I try to increase the 2nd and 3rd sets by at least 1 rep each . <p> Once I am doing 3 sets of 20 reps , I bump up the weight . <h> Log Sheet Clipboard <p> I rig up a clipboard with a mechanical pencil and some velcro like this : <h> My Workout Routine <p> I start each workout session with 10-minutes of stretching . <p> Next , I do a 20-minute cardio using either an elliptical machine , stair stepper , treadmill , or jump rope ( my favorite ) . Whichever cardio method I decide to use for a particular day , I just try to maintain my target heart rate for the full 20 minutes . <p> Next , I complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day ( 1 row on the sheet ) , with 60-90 seconds of rest between each set . <p> Finally , I finish the workout with three core exercises .

But I do mix it up with other core exercises , such as crunches , med ball throws , cable machine twists , and more . <p> The total workout typically takes an hour and fifteen minutes . <h> Same Muscle Groups , Different Exercises <p> Since your muscles can become impervious to a given exercise after a period of time ( at least in my opinion ) , I recommend creating and printing sheets that have the same muscle groups , but with a different method for each exercise . You then simply rotate your workout sheets on a periodic basis . <p> Each muscle group has numerous exercise variations for targeting the group .

The new calculator was also added to the Ad-Free Member Version if you wish to save your entries in between visits . <h> Sep 5 , New ! **25;1643;TOOLONG Calculator ! <p> Mon , Sep 5 , 2016 <p> New ! **25;1670;TOOLONG Calculator ! <p> Not sure if this calculator will be useful for anyone else , but after receiving the following from a site visitor I just could n't pass up the challenge of making one that would accommodate the visitor 's needs . <p> I want the 24 combinations for the numbers 9567 . I would like the numbers in a list collated with the lowest to the highest . Hope you can direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This new combinations calculator will accept any combination of up to 6 numbers , letters , or a combination of both ( 123456 , ABCDEF , or 1A2B3C ) , and then generate a list of all possible combinations -- sorted to your preference . <p> Why limit the characters to 6 ? Because any more than 6 characters generates a result with more than 5,000 possible combinations . <p> Any guess as to how many combinations there are in a 12-character string ? If you guessed 479,001,600 ... congratulations ! <p> As always , please use the expandable feedback form beneath the calculator to let me know if you discover any issues and/or have any suggestions for improvements . <p> Thank you ! <p> -Dan <p> P.S.

What ? ! <p> I 'm sorry , but I ca n't even begin to imagine why a phone maker would leave a decimal point out of their numeric keypad . All I can say is , thank goodness the responsible decision-maker does n't work in a nuclear weapons factory . ; - ) <p> In any case , since this is not the fault of the Android phone owners , I decided to take the time to create and install a custom keypad to all numeric fields in all 236 mobile calculators . <p> The project took a full two weeks to complete , so I hope everyone now has the ability to enter a decimal point into a numeric field ( tap the grid icon next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decimal point ) . <p> Please let me know if you discover any issues with the new keypads , or if failed to include a decimal point in a field that you feel should have one . <p> Thank you ! <p> -Dan <p> P.S. If you visit a mobile calculator that you 've visited in the past , I suggest you refresh/reload the page to make sure you are using the updated version instead of an older version that may be stored in your web browser software . <h> Oct 20 , New ! Biweekly Extra Mortgage Payment Calculator <p> This new calculator is the result of receiving numerous requests for being able to add an extra amount ( over-payment ) to each biweekly payment . <p> Specifically , this calculator will estimate how much time and interest you will save if you switch from making monthly mortgage payments , to making 1/2 of your payment -- plus an extra amount -- every two weeks . <p> This results in making the equivalent of 13 monthly payments per year , plus 26 principal prepayments .

Some have asked about just saving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entries for multiple employees . <p> Up until recently , the only option was to set up a database and log-in system for the website -- which is not something I could include without having to charge for its use ( very time consuming to set up and maintain ) . <p> However , recent advancements in web browser software has now made it possible to store data on the user 's device . It 's not an ideal solution ( data can only be accessed from the device and web browser that saved it , and it only works on newer web browser versions ) , but it 's a solution I can provide without having to charge a fee . <p> I have now added a new " Save " feature to all time sheet/card calculators , and will add it to other applicable calculators ( and their mobile counterparts ) after I 've received sufficient feedback on this first trial . <p> If you are using the latest release of your web browser ( Firefox , Safari , Chrome , Internet Explorer , etc. ) , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data storage feature worked for you . <h> Apr 6 , New ! Online Hangman Game <p> Mon , Apr 6 , 2015 <p> New ! Online Hangman Game <p> While most people I know bring along a book to read while on vacation , I bring my laptop so I can " work " ( toy around ) on new web apps . <p> The first draft of this new web app was created during the 4-hour flight home last week . However , it took another week to add the features I wanted it to have , and to create the companion mobile web app . I would have been done sooner but I kept get getting caught up in playing the game ( I was reminded of how much fun we had playing the game as kids ) . <p> This new online hangman game includes options for 1 or 2 player games , keeps a running score , and provides three separate methods for determining the words for the game . <p> Add your own list of hangman words ( fun way to learn the spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ randomly select words from its built-in list of over 750 words . <p> If playing a 2 player game you and your opponent can take turns adding and hiding words ( or short phrases ) for each other . <p> Please let me know if you discover any issues or have any suggestions for improving the game . <h> Mar 12 , New ! Baseball Scorekeeper ( Beta ) <p> I basically designed this baseball scorekeeper for parents/grandparents of baseball and softball players who travel to fields that lack working scoreboards ( like I do ) . <p> I tried purchasing various scoreboard apps , but the ones I tried either did n't live up to my expectations or failed to work the following season ( usually due to a system software upgrade ) . So this year ( 2015 ) I decided to attempt to make my own . <p> I created both a phone and a laptop/tablet version ( which one you see depends on what device you access the web-app with ) . <p> The reason I 'm calling this the Beta version is because I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow melts and the local season gets underway ( I live in Northern Minnesota ) . <p> Once I actually get a chance to use the scorekeeper myself I will fix any issues I discover . <p> As always , if you discover any issues be sure to let me know the title of the calculator and the entries that generated the issue . <p> Thank you ! <p> -Dan <p> P.S. I also added a new section to the site to house the new scorekeeper , called the Sports , Games , and Fun Calculators section .

Workout Log Sheet Maker <p> One of my daughters recently asked me if I could create an online widget she could use to design and print her own gym workout chart . She is moving out of the area and likes the system I developed for organizing and tracking our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my sons , have been meeting at the gym 3-4 days each week , and they both seem to like using the workout log sheets I made for them . <p> Of course , what dad can say " no " to their daughter ? So I created a new widget for the site that will allow her to either : <p> Print out a blank workout log sheet . <p> Print out an example log sheet ( our workout ) . <p> Print out a custom log sheet based on her own categories and exercises . <p> This weight-lifting schedule maker includes adjustable number of sets and rows ( days ) and the tracking system allows you to see your strength gains at a glance . <p> I have also included a short tutorial with images on the page in case you too would be interested in using the system . <p> Now if you 'll excuse me , I need to go have a good cry over my daughter moving out of the area . <p> -Dan <p> P.S. I also added a web-app version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan 13 , New ! Slope Calculator <p> This new calculator will find the slope , angle , and y-intercept of a straight line given two points . <p> Plus , the calculator will also calculate the distance between the two points , and formulate the line 's equation . <p> And finally , the calculator will also attempt to create a graph displaying the points and the line that runs through them . <p> This is my first attempt at including a dynamic graph in the results of a calculator , so please let me know if you discover any issues , and if so , what entered points caused the issue . <p> Thank you ! <p> -Dan <p> P.S. I also added a web-app version of the slope calculator to the mobile site .

I also just finished adding the 219th mobile web-app to the mobile version of the site ( only 6 to go ! ) . <h> Aug 15 , Update : Lender Loan Balance Calculator <p> Fri , Aug 15 , 2014 <p> Update : Lender Loan Balance Calculator <p> Added a feature that allows you to choose either the US Rule amortization method or the Normal amortization method . <p> For payment periods where the payment is not enough to cover the interest charge , selecting the US Rule method will escrow unpaid interest whereas selecting the Normal method will add unpaid interest to the principal as it occurs ( causes negative amortization , which is illegal in most states ) . <p> Please let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Thank you ! <p> -Dan <p> P.S.

In either case , the fees are now added to interest cost row in the Refinance column . <p> Added a new Difference column to the Refinance Comparison Chart , which lists the principal , rate , payment , number of payments , and interest cost differences ( + or - ) between your current auto loan and a refinanced auto loan . <p> Please let me know if you have any suggestions for other improvements to the calculator . <p> Thank you ! <p> -Dan <p> P.S. I have also just added a web-app version of the Refinance Auto Loan Calculator to the mobile site . This was the 126th mobile calculator added to the mobile version of the site ( 97 to go ! ) . <p> Along with changing how the Budgeting Percentages Average Calculator works , I also just finished updating it with the results from the latest Consumer Expenditure Survey ( 2012 ) . <p> Just enter your household 's annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You will instantly see how much other households in your income bracket are spending on goods and services -- broken down into as many as 97 different budget categories . Cool ! <p> In addition to changing the detail level and reporting period , you can even print out a budget worksheet based on your income bracket . <h> Mar 1 , Update : Stay-At-Home Calculator <p> Sat , Mar 1 , 2014 <p> Update : Stay-At-Home Calculator <p> While creating a mobile version of this calculator I also added a Printer Friendly Window button to the results .
