@@61116279 @1116279/ <h> Ten English Accent Rules <p> Most teachers are unfamiliar with the role that pronunciation plays in orthography ( the study of spelling rules ) . Key to proper pronunciation is the accent . The accent is the stress placed in varying degrees upon the vowel sounds in syllables . The primary accent refers to the vowel sound with the greatest " punch " or " stress . " A good way to teach accents is to have students clap on the accented syllable and snap on the unaccented syllables . Teachers may choose to add on secondary accents ; however , these have minimal influences on pronunciation and spelling . Check out How to Teach Syllabication after you skim through this helpful list of accent rules. - The Ten English Accent Rules are important to understand and apply to be able to correctly pronounce and spell English words . <p> Accent Rule #2 : A long word may have more than one accent . The vowel that is stressed more or most is called the primary accent . The primary accent is key to many of the spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent. - For example , c+n-ver-s+-tion . Very long words can have even more stressed vowel sounds , but only one primary accent . <p> Accent Rule #4 : Unaccented vowel sounds frequently have the soft /uh/ schwa sound , especially when there is only one letter in the syllable . All vowels can have the schwa sound . For example , the a in a-bo+t . <p> Accent Rule #5 : The primary accent is usually on the first syllable in two-syllable words . For example , p+y-ment . <p> Accent Rule #6 : The primary accent is usually on the second syllable of two-syllable words that have a prefix in the first syllable and a root in the second syllable . For example , dis-tr+ct . <p> Accent Rule #7 : For two-syllable words that act as both nouns and verbs , the primary accent is usually on the prefix ( first syllable ) of the noun and on the root ( second syllable ) of the verb . For example , pr+-duce as a noun ; pro-d+ce as a verb . <p> Accent Rule #8 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , if that syllable is a root .

I would like to know if there are more rules in regard the Rule #7 , I mean , what would happen if we have verbs nouns with more than two syllables ? Thanks a lots before hand . <p> Hello , I was hoping you could tell me if single syllable words have accents or not and if yes , than when and when do they not ? I can not for the life of me find a simple answer to this question . But I am referring to words such as : I , A , We , It , No , Yes , Hold , Past , Year , To , The Im sure you understand what I 'm asking but , Does it have to do with long and or short vowel sounds in one syllable words ? Say if the word " The " is it the TH sound first and then the soft E with the /uh/ sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the E sound ? And to accompany that , is there a rule that follows , like , " The " and " This " " That " Than " " Then " at any rate do we rely on the short vowel sounds or the long vowel sounds ? <p> Actually an excellent question . All single syllable words are accented . This is important to know to apply spelling rules . For example , stop is accented on the vowel and ends in a vowel then consonant . If the suffix begins with a vowel , the finally consonant " p " is doubled to form stopping .

Reader Interest : If the student is not interested in the genre , subject matter , author , book title , or book jacket , its the wrong book . Students have their own literary tastes , but also like what their peers like . Adults can expose students to new tastes , but can not make a seventh grader like- Pride and Prejudice . Choice is important , but within certain common sense limitations : - Word Recognition Level : - On the technical side , books are made up of words .

@@61116290 @1116290/ <h> Ten English Accent Rules <p> Most teachers are unfamiliar with the role that pronunciation plays in orthography ( the study of spelling rules ) . Key to proper pronunciation is the accent . The accent is the stress placed in varying degrees upon the vowel sounds in syllables . The primary accent refers to the vowel sound with the greatest " punch " or " stress . " A good way to teach accents is to have students clap on the accented syllable and snap on the unaccented syllables . Teachers may choose to add on secondary accents ; however , these have minimal influences on pronunciation and spelling . Check out How to Teach Syllabication after you skim through this helpful list of accent rules. - The Ten English Accent Rules are important to understand and apply to be able to correctly pronounce and spell English words . <p> Accent Rule #2 : A long word may have more than one accent . The vowel that is stressed more or most is called the primary accent . The primary accent is key to many of the spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent. - For example , c+n-ver-s+-tion . Very long words can have even more stressed vowel sounds , but only one primary accent . <p> Accent Rule #4 : Unaccented vowel sounds frequently have the soft /uh/ schwa sound , especially when there is only one letter in the syllable . All vowels can have the schwa sound . For example , the a in a-bo+t . <p> Accent Rule #5 : The primary accent is usually on the first syllable in two-syllable words . For example , p+y-ment . <p> Accent Rule #6 : The primary accent is usually on the second syllable of two-syllable words that have a prefix in the first syllable and a root in the second syllable . For example , dis-tr+ct . <p> Accent Rule #7 : For two-syllable words that act as both nouns and verbs , the primary accent is usually on the prefix ( first syllable ) of the noun and on the root ( second syllable ) of the verb . For example , pr+-duce as a noun ; pro-d+ce as a verb . <p> Accent Rule #8 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , if that syllable is a root . For example , ch+r-ac-ter. 187937 @qwx597937 187938 @qwx597938 <p> Great work in summing up these rules ! I would like to know if there are more rules in regard the Rule #7 , I mean , what would happen if we have verbs nouns with more than two syllables ? Thanks a lots before hand . <p> Hello , I was hoping you could tell me if single syllable words have accents or not and if yes , than when and when do they not ? I can not for the life of me find a simple answer to this question . But I am referring to words such as : I , A , We , It , No , Yes , Hold , Past , Year , To , The Im sure you understand what I 'm asking but , Does it have to do with long and or short vowel sounds in one syllable words ? Say if the word " The " is it the TH sound first and then the soft E with the /uh/ sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the E sound ? And to accompany that , is there a rule that follows , like , " The " and " This " " That " Than " " Then " at any rate do we rely on the short vowel sounds or the long vowel sounds ? <p> Actually an excellent question . All single syllable words are accented . This is important to know to apply spelling rules . For example , stop is accented on the vowel and ends in a vowel then consonant . If the suffix begins with a vowel , the finally consonant " p " is doubled to form stopping .

I frequently joke that I wish I had had the foresight to develop an AR-style program years ago . I 'd be living in my castle in the Loire Valley fending off critics when not visiting my offshore tax haven in the Cayman Islands . But I 'd feel a bit guilty knowing that schools could implement their own independent reading program for free ( relatively speaking ) . <p> However , I 'm pretty sure that the effectiveness of my AR-style program would not have been- judged as following : <p> " Accelerated Reader was found to have no discernible effects on reading fluency , mixed effects on comprehension , and potentially positive effects on general reading achievement .

There is little evidence for or against B , but suggestive evidence that it may be harmful in the long run . A drug company produces AB , more expensive than A alone , and justifies it by providing studies showing that AB tends to be effective .

Reader Interest : If the student is not interested in the genre , subject matter , author , book title , or book jacket , its the wrong book . Students have their own literary tastes , but also like what their peers like . Adults can expose students to new tastes , but can not make a seventh grader like- Pride and Prejudice .

@@61116326 @1116326/ <h> How to Improve Your Writing Style with Grammatical Sentence Openers <p> One of the best ways to improve your writing style is to improve the variety of your sentence structures . Professional writers vary the subject-verb-object pattern with other grammatical sentence structures . A simple guideline for good sentence variety would be 50% subject-verb-object sentence openers and 50% other grammatical sentence opener forms . <p> Prepositional Phrase <p> Start with a phrase beginning with one of these common prepositions to improve writing style : <p> Place a comma after a prepositional phrase sentence opener when a noun or pronoun follows . <p> Example : <p> Behind the cabinet , he found the missing watch . <p> Adjective <p> Start with a word or phrase that describes a proper noun , common noun , or pronoun with How Many ? Which One ? or What Kind ? to improve writing style . Place a comma after an adjective or adjective phrase sentence opener . <p> Examples : <p> Angry , the neighbor refused to leave . <p> Happy as always , the child played in the park . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How ? When ? Where ? or What Degree ? to improve writing style . Many adverbs end in ly . Usually place a comma after an adverb sentence opener if the adverb is emphasized . <p> Example : <p> Everywhere , the flowers were blooming ; quickly , the winter turned to spring . <p> Adverbial Clause <p> Start a dependent clause ( a noun and verb that does not express a complete thought ) with one of the following subordinating conjunctions to improve writing style : <p> after , although , as , as if , as long as , as much as , as soon as , as though , because , before , even if , even though , how , if , in order that , once , since , so that , than , that , though , unless , until , when , whenever , where , wherever , whether , or while . <p> Place a comma after an adverbial clause that begins a sentence . <p> Example : <p> Although better known for its winter activities , Lake Tahoe offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t , or en Participial Verb Forms <p> Start with a ed , d , t , or en verb , acting as an adjective , and/or add additional words to form a participial phrase . Usually place a comma after the sentence opener . <p> Examples : <p> Frightened , I sat up straight in my bed . Told to stop , the child finally did so . <p> Burnt to a crisp , the toast was horrible . Taken quickly , the pill did not dissolve for minutes . <p> To + Verb <p> Start with To and then add the base form of a verb to improve writing style . Add related words to create a phrase . Place a comma after the sentence opener , if a noun follows . <p> Examples : <p> To smile takes great effort . <p> To play the game , Mark had to sign a contract . <p> ing Verbs and Nouns <p> Start a phrase with an ing word that acts as an adjective to improve writing style . Usually place a comma after the sentence opener . Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noun .

Homeschooling advocates- have long favored learning portfolios and have been particularly engaged in the INB movement . Additionally , the exponential influence and use of Pinterest in education has propelled publication of many INBs on sites such as Teachers Pay Teachers. - Whether you are an INB inquirer or practitioner , its its useful- to analyze the pros and cons as to whether INBs should be used- in your home or classroom . To provide fodder for a balanced discussion , I have written- 10 Reasons Not to Use Interactive Notebooks . <p> My own experience with INBs ? I used INBs in middle school ELA for years before developing and using- a more traditional grammar , usage , mechanics , spelling and vocabulary program ( See product promotion- at end of article ) . I also taught with- the Teachers Curriculum Institute ( TCI ) Interactive Student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just completed- a Teaching Grammar and Mechanics Interactive Notebook series . Click HEREto check it out . If you do , I 'm sure you will see why this classroom-tested INB is the best one available for your students . <p> Although teachers have valid reasons not to use INBs ( 1 . Excessive class time 2 . Too much prep 3 . Too much correcting 4 . Too messy 5 . Not enough rigor and little critical thinking 6 . Too teacher-centered and little focus on individual student needs 7 . Not assessment-based instruction 8 . Too supplemental and reductive ( little focus on reading and writing ) - 9 . Not real-world , career-based instruction - 10 . Some students dislike INBs ) , many teachers do see value in using interactive notebooks . To get past- my own biases , I studied- dozens of INBs and INB templates ( most INBs use 3D graphic organizers such as pop-outs , flip pages , and foldables ) in quite a few- subject areas . I examined individual- lessons found on Pinterest , teacher blogs , and Facebook . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , I purchased the two best-selling INB programs : - Erin Cobbs- Interactive Grammar Notebook for Common Core Grades 4-8- ( over 30,000 sold with over 6,000- product reviews ) and Nicole Shelbys grades 2-5- Interactive Language Notebooks ( 14,531 product reviews at the time of this writing ) . Of course , its always good for writers to check out the best of the competition when developing their own alternative products =- Both are great programs and certainly worth every penny . <p> So , here 's the list of reasons to consider using INBs . But do n't  take my word on it , check out the teacher comments as well . <p> 10 Reasons to Use Interactive Notebooks <p> 1 . Interactive notebooks personalize learning. - Teachers know that relevance matters . When students perceive content and skills as important to their " now and then " ( immediate and future needs ) , they are more willing and capable of engaging in learning new content and skills . Education is a two-way process . Certainly students need input , but they also filter that input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that input . INBs provide students with the connections- they need between the outer world of ideas and their inner worlds of how they make sense of those ideas . When students- own their interactive notebook lessons with learning goals , " I Can " statements , comments , opinions , and questions , they learn content and skills at a deeper level- and retain more knowledge . <p> 2 . Interactive notebooks balance input , processing , and output. - Teachers know the importance of direct instruction . Whether teachers initiate the learning as in a traditional classroom , or guide the learning as in a flipped classroom , we do serve as the " keepers of the keys " to learning . We know the Standards ; we know what students know and do n't  yet know ; we know how students learn best . However , we do n't  always provide the time or teach the process of learning . INBs provide the mechanisms teachers and students need to process new content and skills . To borrow Stephen Krashens expression : comprehensible input . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students add to or highlight key ideas in lecture notes , take marginal annotations on short INB articles , and summarize learning in 3D graphic organizers , they are processing information . We all know how much learning is lost when it is not immediately reinforced . Practice using the content and skills in the INB immediately after the lecture provides that reinforcement . The INBs stop the- forgetting cycle and imprint learning into long-term memories . <p> 3 . Interactive notebooks help students learn and study at the same time. - One real benefit of the INB is the focus on " killing two birds with one stone . " A key feature of INBs is test preparation . When a student cuts out a matchbook style foldable of M. A.I.N. ( the main causes of World War IMilitarism , Alliances , Imperialism , and Nationalism ) , they are not only synthesizing information from lecture notes ; they are also creating a study guide or essay pre-write for the upcoming unit test. - Many teachers permit students to use their INBs on quizzes and tests to motivate proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a learning end in of itself as a performance-based assessment . <p> 4 . Interactive notebooks are a cross-curricular approach to instruction and learning. - More and more schools have adopted INBs as the learning approach in all content-based and skill-based subject areas or classes : reading , science , math , history/social studies , language arts , art , and foreign language study . The authors of the Common Core emphasize the important of cross-curricular , interdependent instruction in the- College and Career Readiness- and Anchor Standards . Secondary schools in particular have embraced schoolwide- AVID ( Advancement Via Individual Determination ) strategies such as Cornell Notes in their INB classrooms . INBs truly can serve the purpose of providing a similar user-friendly language of instruction , organization , and philosophy of learning . BTW , my recently completed INB provides both student and teacher lessons in Cornell Notes format . <p> 5 . Interactive notebooks make sense of lecture and note-taking. - The Common Core State Standards are indeed rigorous and require more , not less , input . The world knowledge base is compounding . Well-planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both elementary and secondary classrooms . Rather than slowing the pace of instruction and causing day-dream boredom with elongated " interactive lectures , " INBs provide the interactivity within the notebooks themselves . Gone are the days of fifty minute didactic lecture-speeches with only a few question-answer interruptions . Teachers find that shorter 20 minute lectures with connected- INB activities for the remaining 30 minutes get better results . <p> 6 . Interactive notebooks de-emphasize isolated practice. - All too often in many classrooms , practice has been unrelated to instruction or student needs . INB teachers- find that connected practice in the notebook serves students better than isolated- drill and kill worksheets . Of course , targeted worksheets tied to an INB lecture or activity can certainly be added into the notebook itself . Glue is not for foldables alone . <p> 7 . Interactive notebooks provide " published " learning portfolios. - In many respects , INBs have mimicked the writing process . Years ago , teachers began seeing the value of a step-by-step writing process in which the ultimate goal of publication for an authentic audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Publication increases motivation and accountability , as well as the quality of work . In the case of the INB , the publication includes peer and parent review or presentation in class , **32;60;TOOLONG conferences , and at Open House . Many teachers pass along INBs to the next grade level teacher as portfolios of student work for review or to continue the notebook . Publication provides concrete evidence of students- learning . If they know it , they will show it becomes the mantra of an INB instructional approach . <p> 8 . Interactive notebooks teach the values of organization , neatness , and pride of work. - " Since when did neatness and coloring become Standards ? " complains one teacher . Its true that some teachers go over the top in terms of time expended upon or concentration on neatness and appearance of the notebooks . Most INB teachers strike a workable balance between achievement and effort . Rafael will never produce the same level of artistic accomplishment as Janie . His lack of fine motor skills and her cool sets of high quality pastels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly reasonable to expect Rafael to adhere to- the organizational demands of the notebook and use the color coding to properly categorize the kingdoms and phyla for his science INB . Plus , his table of contents , numbered pages , and right-left orientation have to be accurate . Additionally , Janies INB has to have accurate content , insightful reflection , and properly annotated margin notes on her close readings- and not just a- Da Vinci quality INB. - A little bit of peer pressure certainly does not hurt , nor does teacher affirmation of everyone showing pride of work and doing the best they can . <p> 9 . Interactive notebooks provide a classroom management system for effective learning. - One of the tenets of P.B.S. ( Positive Behavior Support ) is that an active and productive class setting with clear behavioral and academic expectations helps behaviorally challenged students stay engaged in the learning activities . Students are far less likely to cause class disruptions when they are invested in " hands-on " doing-style learning . Additionally , " idle hands are the devils workshop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the- learning task , even when a social environment is permitted . <p> 10 . Many students love- interactive notebooks. - Students prefer INB over tradition instruction because the notebooks are personalized and interactive . Students enjoy the social nature of the INB process . The learn by doing philosophy- has been a particularly American approach to learning ever since John Dewey advocated this practice- over a century ago . Students rarely describe INB classes as " boring .

@@61116361 @1116361/ <p> Many people do not read well because of poor silent reading habits . Correcting these poor reading practices and replacing them with good reading practices will improve both reading speed and reading comprehension . You can become a better reader by practicing these tips . <p> 1 . Improve reading posture and attitude . Reading is not a passive activity . Your body position has much to do with your level of engagement with the text . Reading in bed is wonderful for putting you to sleep , but the prone position is not conducive to engaging your mind with a textbook or article . Sit up straight in a straight-backed chair at a desk or table with good lighting and keep your feet flat on the floor . Place two hands on the reading . Not perfectly comfortable ? Good ! Reading is not supposed to be relaxing ; it is supposed to be stimulating . Establish a purpose for your reading , and be realistic and honest with yourself . Not everything should be read with the same reading mindset . Are you reading the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you reading it to pass a test , to be able to talk at a surface level about the subject , or for in-depth understanding ? <p> 2 . Improve concentration . First of all , turn of the iPod- and find a quiet room . Anything competing with full concentration reduces reading speed and reading comprehension . Consciously divest yourself from the thousand other things that you need to or would rather be doing . Good reading does not involve multi-tasking . Stop taking mental vacations during your reading . For example , never allow yourself a pause at the end of a page or chapter " read on ! Minimize daydreaming by keeping personal connections to the text centered on the content . Cue yourself you quickly return to the text when your mind first begins wandering . Begin with short , uninterrupted reading sessions with 100% concentration and gradually increase the length of your sessions until you can read for , say 30 minutes . Rome was n't built in a day and your reading attention span will take time to improve . Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reading session . Do n't read something else during your break . <p> 3 . Improve reading rhythm.The reading pace should be hurried , but consistent . This does not preclude the need to vary your reading speed , according to the demands of the text , or the need to re-read certain sections . But , do not read in a herky-jerky fashion . Use your dominant hand to pace your reading . Keep three fingers together and pace your reading underneath each line . Move your hand at a consistent , but hurried rate . Intentionally , but only briefly , slow down when reading comprehension decreases . Using the hand prevents re-reading or skipping lines and also improves comprehension . Shortening the stroke of the hand across the page , after practice , will also help expand peripheral vision and improve eye movement . <p> 4 . Improve eye movement . Reading research tells us that good readers have fewer eye fixations per line . When the eyes move from fixation to fixation , there is little reading comprehension . So , focus on the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to the left and right when you are reading columnar text , such as newspapers , articles , etc . Focus one-third of the way into the text line , then two-thirds of the way , for book text . Again , you may need to work up to these guidelines by adding on an additional fixation point , until you can read comfortably . <p> 5 . Improve interactivity.Good silent reading comprehension is always a two-way conversation between author and reader . The text was written by a person " so personalize your reading by treating the reading as a dialogue . This mental conversation improves concentration and comprehension . Prompt yourself to converse by challenging the author with How ? and Why ? questions . Ask What Do You Mean ? Make predictions as to where the plot ( if narrative ) , or argument ( if persuasive ) , or sequence ( if expository ) will lead . Make connections to other parts of the text or outside of the text . 187937 @qwx597937 187938 @qwx597938

It may also be possible that you also have a few Johnnys that you do n't  know about yet . Johnny has reading problems . <p> Johnny did n't  quite catch on to reading in kindergarten and first grade . His second and third grade teachers did spend a few minutes each day with Johnny , along with a few other students , and he did make some progress . However , by the time Johnny was handed his fourth grade social studies and science textbooks , he was not at all prepared for the multi-syllabic decoding , academic vocabulary , and expository text structure of these books . Apparently , other students had reading problems , because the teacher rarely used the textbooks . Instead , she taught the " power standards " to prepare her students for the standardized tests in both subject areas . His upper elementary and middle school teachers focused on the short stories in the literature anthology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the stories out loud or had the students take turns reading in " popcorn " style . Sometimes the teachers played the CD recordings . Of course , Johnnys teachers wisely learned to avoid calling on him to read to protect his self-esteem . Clearly , Johnnys reading deficits continued to compound . <p> In middle school , Johnny was placed in an intervention class for language arts . The focus of the class was to teach grade-level language arts standards at a slower pace . Addressing individual reading problems was not the primary focus of class , although the composition of the class was loosely based upon the reading scores of last years standards-based test . Johnny scored " Far Below Basic " because he was able to read only parts of the passages . Undoubtedly , a few students were placed in the class because they randomly marked answers on the test . Most of the students in this intervention class did have significant reading problems . However , they did not all have the same reading problems . Some students , such as Johnny , lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor comprehension or low fluency scores . Still others were English language-learners . A few students were simply placed in the class due to behavioral problems . <p> Visit most public schools today and you will be able to spot more than a few Johnnys . Unfortunately , the Matthew Effect ( Stanovich ) is alive and well in our schools today . The rich do , indeed , get richer and the Johnnys get poorer . Students who learn to read well in their primary school years tend to continue this success because they use their reading skills to learn content and vocabulary in their intermediate elementary and middle school years . Students who do not learn to read well in their primary school years fall even further behind in school and the gap between good and poor readers widens . While the statistics indicate that only one in six remedial readers ever close this gap , Johnny can be that one . With the right diagnostic tools and instructional materials , caring teachers can better the odds for their students with reading problems . 187937 @qwx597937 187938 @qwx597938

@@61116430 @1116430/ <h> How to Break Bad Reading Habits <p> Many people do not read well because of poor silent reading habits . Correcting these poor reading practices and replacing them with good reading practices will improve reading comprehension . You can become a better reader by practicing these tips . <p> 1 . Improve your reading posture . Reading difficult text is not a relaxed activity . Your body position has much to do with how well you understand the text . Reading in bed is wonderful for putting you to sleep , but not for studying . Instead , sit up straight in a straight-backed chair at a desk or table with good lighting and keep your feet flat on the floor . Place two hands on the reading . Keep the distance from eyes to book about the same distance as that of your forearm . Do n't angle the book too much so that you can keep your head straight . Not perfectly comfortable ? Good ! Reading is not supposed to be relaxing ; it is supposed to be stimulating . <p> 2 . Adjust your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , but it is a crucially important study skill . As a child , you learned to read . Now , you read to learn . Good readers learn more in school and succeed to a greater degree in the workplace . Be realistic and honest with yourself . Are you reading just to tell yourself or others that you did so ? Are you reading for in-depth understanding ? <p> 3 . Establish a purposefor your reading and adjust your level of comprehension . Not everything should be read for the same reading purpose . Reading an article about a favorite movie star does not require the level of comprehension that reading a computer manual does . <p> 4 . Improve your concentration . First of all , turn off the music , put away your phone , get away from the television and computer , and find a quiet room . Anything competing with full concentration reduces reading speed and reading comprehension . Good reading can not include multi-tasking . Stop taking mental vacations during your reading . For example , never allow yourself a pause at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daydreaming by forcing yourself to make personal connections with what is going on in the reading . Prompt yourself to quickly return to the text when your mind first begins wandering . <p> 5 . Improve your reading attention span . Begin with short , uninterrupted reading sessions with 100% concentration and gradually increase the length of your sessions until you can read for , say 30 minutes . Rome was n't built in a day and your reading attention span will take time to improve . Take a short , pre-planned break away from your reading area after a reading session . Do n't read something else during your break . <p> 6 . When reading silently , do n't pronounce the words in your head and do n't move your lipswhile reading . These are called sub-vocalizations and they interfere with your understanding of the text . Focus on what the author is trying to say . After all , the purpose of reading is not to say the words ; the purpose of reading is to understand the meaning of the text . 187937 @qwx597937 187938 @qwx597938

Rote memory is fundamental to higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even songs . Check out the Parts of Speech Rap . Test and re-test to ensure mastery . <p> IDENTIFY Help students identify adjectival components in practice examples and real text . Using quality , un-canned and authentic mentor text , such as famous literary quotations and short passages/poetry kills two birds with one stone : identification practice and sentence modeling . <p> EDIT Help students practice error analysis for each adjectival- component by editing text that contains correct and incorrect usage . Finding out what is wrong does help clarify what is right . But do n't limit your instruction , as in- Daily Oral Language , to this step . Students need the mentor texts and writing practice to master their noun components . Grammar taught in the context of reading and- writing translates into long-term memory and application . <p> APPLY Help students their knowledge of adjectives correctly in targeted practice sentences . Sentence frames are one solid instructional method to practice application . For example , for adjectives <p> It takes a lot of ( idea ) for a ( person ) to drive a ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response : It takes a lot of SELF-CONTROL for a TEENAGER to drive a SPORTS CAR to their ( place ) to their HIGH SCHOOL . <p> REVISE Help students understand the importance and relevance of learning adjectives by revising their own authentic writing . Stress using what they have learned about adjectival- components to improve- coherence , - sentence variety , author- voice , word choice , clarity , and- style . Make sure to share brilliant revisions that reflect these improvements as your own mentor texts . Post them on your walls and refer to them often to reinforce definition , identification , and writing style . <p> 2 . Assessments <p> Diagnostic assessments of key grammatical features , such as adjectives , serves two purposes : First , the results inform what to teach and how much time to allocate to direct instruction . It may be that one class tends to have mastery re : articles but weaknesses in modifiers . A different class may have a different set of strengths and weaknesses . Why so ? One of the mysteries of life . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning . Sharing this data with students is vital . Students need to know what they know and what they do n't know to motivate their learning and see the personal relevance of the instructional task . Check out my favorite whole class diagnostic grammar assessment under- Free ELA/Reading Assessments . <p> Formative assessments need to be designed to measure true mastery of the grammatical concept . So , a useful formative assessment of adjectival- components must be comprehensive , including all steps of the DIE AR process . The purpose of formative assessment is to identify relative strengths and weaknesses of both instruction and learning . Simply giving a unit test as a summative assessment only satisfies the teacher ( and colleagues ) that the teacher has covered the subject , i.e. teaching adjectives . Far better to use the data to affect instruction . Good teachers re-teach judiciously and differentiate instruction according to test data . <p> 3 . Differentiated Instruction <p> Differentiated instruction should focus on relative weaknesses . A good recording matrix for formative assessments will clearly inform the teacher as to who lacks mastery over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Individual , paired , and small group instruction with targeted independent practice makes sense . A workshop design in which the teacher distributes worksheets , monitors practice , and uses mini-conferences to assess mastery ensures effective remediation. - Differentiated instruction does n't have to be a planning or management nightmare . <p> Adjectives Instructional Scope and Sequence <p> Primary Elementary School <p> An adjective modifies ( describes ) a proper noun , a common noun , or a pronoun with how many , which one , or what kind . An adjective is usually placed before the noun it modifies . <p> Examples : <p> How Many ? The five teammates <p> Which One ? took that bus <p> What Kind ? to the old arena across town . <p> Articles <p> An article is an adjective placed before nouns and pronouns . Articles include a , an , and the . <p> The article a is used before a word starting with a consonant sound , for example a tiger ; the an comes before a word starting with a vowel sound , for example an anteater . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of another word or words and makes it more specific or limits its meaning(s) . <p> Example : I ate the big piece . The word big is a modifier , making piece more specific . <p> Comparative Modifiers <p> Use- er for a one-syllable modifier to compare two things . <p> Example : big " bigger <p> Also use er for a two-syllable modifier to compare two things . However , if the word sounds wrong , use or- more or less . <h> Proper adjectives are adjectives that derive from proper nouns . In English , proper adjectives must begin with a capital letter . <p> Examples : American , Canadian , Mexican , German , Russian <p> Three-Syllable Comparative Modifiers <p> Use more or less for a three-syllable or longer modifier to compare two things . <p> Example : wonderful-more wonderful <h> Always use more or less for adverbs ending in ly . <p> Example : quickly " less quickly <p> Adjective Tips : <p> Some long comparative modifiers are adjectives . Adjectives describe a proper noun , a common noun , or a pronoun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Example : intelligent " The intelligent man was more intelligent than his father . <p> Some long comparative modifiers are adverbs . Adverbs describe an adjective , adverb , or verb with How ? When ? Where ? or What Degree ? <p> Example : angrily " She argued angrily , even more angrily than her mother . <p> Always use most or least for adverbs ending in ly . <p> Example : quickly " most quickly <p> Some long superlative modifiers are adjectives . Adjectives describe a proper noun , a common noun , or a pronoun with How Many ? Which One ? or What Kind ? <p> Example : intelligent " Of the many intelligent men in the group , he was the most intelligent . <p> Some long superlative modifiers are adverbs . Adverbs describe an adjective , adverb , or verb with How ? When ? Where ? or What Degree ? Example : angrily " Of the three arguing- angrily , she argued most angrily . <p> High School <p> Participles <p> Participles are verb forms with ing and ed endings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed or ing . <p> The ed ending means that the noun that is modified has a passive- relationship with something else in the sentence . <p> Example : Scared at the noise , the boy hid under the covers . <p> The ing ending means that the noun that is modified has an active relationship with something else in the sentence . <p> Do n't use descriptive adjectives instead of well-chosen nouns and verbs . Especially avoid using adjectives that do not add meaning to a sentence . For example , adjectives such as interesting , beautiful , nice , and exciting do not help your reader understand the nouns or pronouns any better . Be specific as possible with your adjectives . The sympathetic man is better than the nice man .

@@61116525 @1116525/ <p> The exclamation point is one of the most misused and overused punctuation marks .

You probably could avoid using exclamation points for the rest of your life , if you chose exciting and specific nouns with- surprising and vivid verbs . Oh and another misuse : Do n't  use more than one exclamation point . Using three exclamation points does not make a sentence three times as exciting or surprising .

The kind that makes use of our alphabetic code ; the kind that uses spelling patterns and values " spelling rules " ( which do work most of the time ) ; the kind that uses a problem-solving approach to word analysis ( yes spelling sorts ) ; the kind that does hold students accountable for spelling errors in their own writing ; and the kind that makes use of the Monday pretest as a diagnostic instrument and the Friday posttest as a formative assessment . <p> That said , as an author of numerous spelling programs and an often-used Diagnostic Spelling Assessment , I get two questions quite frequently : 1 . Does a diagnostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use the weekly pretest as a diagnostic assessment ? But I 'll let teachers ask those questions in their own words <p> 1. - How can teachers address spelling needs for students who are spelling at a grade 1/2 level and are in grade 5/6 ? How would you give the diagnostic test to these low level students who can not even spell " rag " or " top ? " <p> August 11 , 2013- <p> RESPONSE : - Great question ! An effective diagnostic spelling assessment has to isolate and test specific sound-spellings . The trick is to do so with words which assess specific student knowledge about that spelling pattern and nothing else . <p> With most remedial spellers , such as your hypothetical 5/6 student , these students have had to develop a quite sophisticated set of coping mechanisms and survival skills to be able to read and/or spell anything at all . These students have become sight-word dependent , using word recognition skills , rather than word identification skills to memorize individual spelling words . In all likelihood the student has learned to read via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than through explicit and systematic phonics instruction . But not necessarily . An effective diagnostic spelling assessment has to isolate that variable to really assess what needs to be assessed . <p> In your question you refer to the short a , as in " rag , " and the short o as in " top . " Rather than use these words as test items ( which most 5/6 students would know ) , a good assessment uses multisyllabic words to isolate and assess those sound-spellings to isolate the variable of sight-spelling knowledge . That 's good internal and external validity in assessment-speak . <p> The author of this article has such a comprehensive diagnostic assessment ( See author tag below for links ) to address this issue . For example , the first spelling word on the assessment is " bumper . " The word " bumper " is used , rather than " bump " or " bun " to assess the short u because most remedial spellers , such as your 5/6 student will not know this word as a sight-spelling . <p> In correcting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short vowel u . So if the student spells " bumpr , " than it is correct . Another spelling test item will catch the " er " spelling deficit . <p> 2 . What 's the use of giving a spelling pretest if the posttest is the same list of words ? <p> June 3 , 2012 <p> RESPONSE : - I agree with your sentiments . The pretest is a waste of time , unless we make use of it as a diagnostic assessment . Furthermore ( I 've always wanted to use that transition ) , giving a posttest of the same words is just silly . Why should students have to practice and study , then be re-tested on words they already know ? here 's how to make sense of both the spelling pretest and spelling posttest : <p> 1 . Administer the weekly pretest . <p> 2 . After completing this diagnostic pretest , display the spelling words and- direct students to self-correct their spelling errors by circling the misspelled sound-spellings . <p> 3 . Have students create their own Personal Spelling List of 15 words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Personal Spelling List in this priority order : <p> Pretest Errors : Have students write the spelling words they missed on the pretest . <p> Posttest Errors : Have students write the words they missed on the last posttest . <p> Writing Errors : Have students add on teacher-corrected spelling errors found in their own writing . <p> 4 . On the next class day briefly explain the spelling pattern focus of the pretest . My bias ( and that of the Common Core authors in the appendices ) is that we should be teaching grade-level spelling patterns , not silly themed word lists . If using a spelling patterns pretest , help students learn and problem-solve the patterns through a spelling sort . Avoid useless crossword puzzles , word searches , and write each word ten times approaches . Please . <p> 5 . Students study their Personal Spelling List(s) for the spelling formative posttest . Many teachers elect to give the spelling posttest at the end of the week ; others choose to combine two spelling patterns lessons and include these as part of the bi-weekly unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spelling Lists to save class time . There is no law saying that you have to test each Friday . <p> 6 . To administer the weekly or bi-weekly posttest , direct students to take out a piece of binder paper , find a partner , and exchange dictation of their Personal Spelling List(s) words ( 1020 Minutes weekly or bi-weekly ) . Students then turn in their posttests for the teacher to grade . I know you think theyll cheat . In my experience , very few do . Also this works with second graders ( I 've done it ) on up .

" Does this ring true for your child or student ? <p> Johnny has had some good writing instruction . He can recite the steps of The Writing Process from the posters he has seen in every classroom throughout his elementary school years . He knows all about Writers Workshop . He would know what to expect if the teacher had written " Writers Conferences " or " Response Groups " on the white board as parts of her daily lesson plans . Johnnys writing portfolio is chalk full of fanciful stories and writing pieces in the sensory/descriptive or imaginative/narrative writing domains . He has been encouraged to unleash his creative mind-although that story that he wrote last year about the student boycott of the cafeteria may have been a bit too creative for the principals tastes . <p> However , if you give Johnny a writing prompt , asking him to " Compare and contrast the cultural roles of women in Athens and Sparta , " sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , Johnny might begin his essay with " Once upon a time in a far-away land called Greece , two young women from Athens and Sparta " His difficulties would , no doubt , increase if this were a timed assessment . <p> Unfortunately , most of the writing that Johnny will need to complete throughout his academic and work careers will not take advantage of his story-writing experience . Instead , most of what Johnny will be required to compose will be some form of writing that informs or convinces his reader . Additionally , most of his writing will be subject to some kind of time constraint . Johnny has just not had the instruction and practice in this kind of writing. - His college professors probably will not hand him a " blue book , " tell him to write a story of his own choice , and then turn it in after multiple revisions when his final draft has been published and properly illustrated . <p> Students need to learn how to write structured essays designed to inform and convince their teachers and professors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Johnny into an organized and persuasive writer ? Take the mystery out of essays by replacing the confusing terminology of thesis statements , topic sentences , concrete details , and commentary with simple numerical values that reflect the hierarchy of effective essay structure . For example , assign a " 1 " to introductory strategies , a " 2 " to the thesis statement , a " 3 " to the topic sentence , a " 4 " to the concrete detail , a " 5 " to the commentary , and a " 6 " to the conclusion strategies . Telling a student that a " 5 " is needed to support a " 4 , " which supports a " 3 " is much more intuitive-and students get it ! Teach structural variety by having students write 3-4-5-4-5 paragraphs and revise with 3-4-5-5-4-5-5 paragraphs . Have students analyze text structure by numerically coding their science book or a newspaper editorial . Use this approach to develop sequenced writing skills , incorporating different grammatical structures and sentence structure .

@@61116628 @1116628/ <h> Archive <p> Teachers and parents recognize the important role of independent reading in developing reading comprehension , vocabulary , and a lifelong love of books . Research is clear that independent reading does help students achieve these desired reading benchmarks . According to the chapter : " Reading and Writing Habits of Students " in- The Condition of Education 1997 ( National Center for Education Statistics ) , " Research has shown that reading ability is positively correlated with the extent to which students read recreationally . " <p> In fact , students need to " grow " their vocabularies by 2,000-3,000 words each year , just to make grade-level reading progress . And the most efficient method of vocabulary acquisition is via independent reading . By applying context clues , readers who read text at the appropriate reading levels can maximize the amount of new words added to their personal lexicons . <p> What are the appropriate reading levels for independent reading ? <p> Primary teachers have used the " five-finger method " for years . - Readers select appropriate reading levels by using the fingers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a single page . Any more than five unknown words means that the text is at their frustrational level and another book should be selected . To update and refine this technique for older students , reading text that has about 5% of the words that are unknown to the reader is the appropriate independent reading level . Reading this level of text will expose most readers to about 300 unknown words in 30 minutes of reading . Learning 5% of these words from the surrounding context clues of the text is realistic . This means that students will learn about 15 new words during a typical reading session . <p> How can you pick a book to read that has 5% unknown words ? <p> -Choose a book and count the number of words on any complete page found near the beginning- of the book and multiply that number by 3 . <p> -Read a page toward the beginning of the book , counting the number of unknown words . A good- guideline would be " if you cant define it with a synonym , antonym , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a page near the middle of the book and continue the count . Finally , read a page near- the end of the book and finish the count . <p> -Divide the total number of unknown words by the total number of words found on the three- pages . The result will be the percentage of unknown words . Anything within the 4-6% range is- acceptable . For example , a reader counts the number of words on a page and arrives at 225. 225- x 3 = 750 . After reading the three pages , the amount of unknown words totals 30. 30.00 divided- by 750 = .05 , or 5% . <p> However , too much in-school independent reading time can take away from important instructional time . Also , the ten to twenty minutes per day , usually allocated to independent reading in a crowded classroom is hardly enough time , nor is it the best of environments to achieve the gains desired from independent reading . Additionally , students do not always make wise choices about their free-choice reading materials . Many bright middle-schoolers would prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving most of independent reading to homework , with teacher and parent approved novels serving as the sources of that reading . Students can still choose any reading text within the clearly defined parameters described above . <p> But , what about accountability ? How can teachers ensure that students really are reading at home ? <p> The catch to my independent reading homework is that students are graded on their discussion of the daily reading by their reading partners-typically , but not exclusively , parents . This builds relationships , reinforces internal monitoring of comprehension , promotes reading as a dynamic process of conversation between reader and author , and increases motivation . I require thirty minutes of reading and three minutes of discussion , four times per week . I pass out reading strategy bookmarks that that help students frame , but not limit , their book discussions . Check out these discussion starters . - Teachers love these SCRIP reading strategies , reinforce them in their classes , and students really do use them . I have the discussion partner , usually a parent , guardian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sign off on a Reading-Discussion Log each week . I count this homework as about 15% of the students overall grade . Do kids or discussion partners cheat on this ? Of course . However , not as much as you 'd think . Students and parents much prefer this type of homework to grinding out an essay or filling out a few grammar worksheets-tasks that most parents are ill-equipped ( and loathe ) to supervise . <p> But , what if the students do n't  understand all of the literary nuances of the text ? You 're not advocating independent reading of class novels , are you ? <p> As Kelly Gallagher states in his new book , Readicide ( How Schools Are Killing Reading and What You Can Do About It ) , " teachers are drowning books by over-teaching them . " This resonates with my view , as a reading specialist , that students should be accessing independent-level-text independently . I typically offer free-choice reading ; however , if we are reading a novel that is comprehensible to the vast majority of my students , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide the book on tape/CD for students who have independent reading levels below that of the novels .

Read more <p> A recent discussion on my favorite site , the English Companion Ning , made me take a critical look at just what has engendered the recent demands for increased accountability in our public schools . Both Democrats and Republicans are playing the blame game and teachers are the easiest targets . As a public school teacher , my initial response has been defensive ; however , upon a bit of reflection I 'm thinking that teachers may well largely be to blamenot for the " sorry state of public education " as our critics claim , but for the very accountability movement that is being used to attack us . We teachers are often our own worst enemies . <p> A bit of history helps put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s teachers felt that our norm-referenced testing , such as the ITBS , SAT , CTBS , MAT , provided data that did not measure what we are teaching .

We teachers went wild . Authentic assessments , multiple-measure assessments , and no assessments ruled the educational landscape . I once taught a sophomore world history class for an entire year without giving any traditional tests . <p> However , with teacher-created assessments , testing manufacturers lost money . Educational Testing Services and others do not like to lose money . So , the test manufacturers changed tactics .

Following is her article and my responses to her concerns and comments from the perspective of a public school teacher and educational publisher . Read more <p> A recent discussion on my favorite site , the English Companion Ning , made me take a critical look at just what has engendered the recent demands for increased accountability in our public schools . Both Democrats and Republicans are playing the blame game and teachers are the easiest targets . As a public school teacher , my initial response has been defensive ; however , upon a bit of reflection I 'm thinking that teachers may well largely be to blamenot for the " sorry state of public education " as our critics claim , but for the very accountability movement that is being used to attack us . We teachers are often our own worst enemies . <p> A bit of history helps put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s teachers felt that our norm-referenced testing , such as the ITBS , SAT , CTBS , MAT , provided data that did not measure what we are teaching . We used sophisticated psychometric criticisms such as sampling and measurement error and socio-political criticisms such as bias to largely rid ourselves from the nuisances of these exams . We teachers went wild . Authentic assessments , multiple-measure assessments , and no assessments ruled the educational landscape . I once taught a sophomore world history class for an entire year without giving any traditional tests . <p> However , with teacher-created assessments , testing manufacturers lost money . Educational Testing Services and others do not like to lose money . So , the test manufacturers changed tactics . They asked for and gave teachers what teachers said they wantedtests that purport to test what we teach . In other words , criterion-referenced standards tests. - And the standards-based movement was born . <p> Teachers were even asked to develop their own subject area standards . A seemingly bottom-up initiative . How inclusive ! Each state department of education , county office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these subject area content standards documents . I joined other colleagues in spending countless hours developing the English-language Arts Standards for my own school district . <p> Now the test-makers were happy . They had the basis of a new revenue stream . And , now because the tests ostensibly test what teachers teach , administrators , politicians , and even billionaire do-gooders can hold us accountable and measure **29;453;TOOLONG performance . The zenith ? Our Common Core National Standards . <p> Teachers helped create this mess . We enabled the accountability movement that is choking teacher creativity , teacher autonomy , and teacher initiative . And our students are the ones who are paying the greatest price . In replacing normed-reference testing with criterion-reference testing , we replaced something bad with something worse . " Meet the new boss . " Not the- same as the old boss . Apologies to Pete Townshend . <p> And now the standards-based movement is so endemic that any challenges to teaching to the test or resisting accountability standards are viewed with wonderment by many in our profession . The standards-based movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers have known nothing else . With the new PAARC and Smarter Balanced Common Core assessments , the tail is wagging the dog once again . Teachers are spending valuable class time test prepping and changing instruction to be more test-friendly . The tests themselves take an inordinate amount of class time . Last year at my middle school , we English-language arts teachers had the task of testing all subject area . It took two weeks out of our teaching schedule to administer all of the tests . <p> This is why I argue that trying to get and maintain a " seat at the table " is ultimately counterproductive . The meal served at the table of power is unhealthy , the conversation is stilted ( actually , there is n't much conversationlots of orders given and followed ) and those who partake leave with indigestion . That 's what happened when teachers created standardsfollowing orders at the tablethat were then used against them as the basis first for high-stakes standardized tests , and then as a springboard for national standards created by a corporation created by governors and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should create , set , and decorate another table , then serve a tasty and healthy meal there . We could invite as many people to join as possible , and then enjoy a rich conversation and lots of laughter together as we dine . <p> Michael ( another poster to Majas initial post ) may be right that the problem is that we cant agree on what to serve at that table . But hey , even a potluck would be tastier , healthier , and more socially edifying than the cardboard and nails currently on the Department of Educations menu .

Question : Asks your audience to think about why the essay topic is important or relevant . <p> Example : - Why has the President issued the executive order at this point of his administration ? <p> 3 .

Expert Quotation : Provides an insightful comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Example : - Former Surgeon General of the United States , Vivek Murthy , called- youth e-cigarette smoking " a major public health concern . " <p> 5 . Preview of Topic Sentences : Lists the main point from each topic sentence before or within the thesis statement . <p> Example : - Both positive consequences and negative effects of the new law require close examination . <p> 6 . Surprise : States an unexpected fact or idea , one that is unknown to your audience , or one that provokes curiosity about the essay topic . <p> Examples : - Women live longer than men. - Few Americans- know that the number of Supreme Court Justices has changed throughout history . The report offers new clues about how to improve memory . <p> Examples : - Gang-related murders have increased dramatically over the last decade .

However , the same two introduction strategies would probably not be used as lead-ins to this thesis statement : Americans have changed taste preferences for their favorite ice cream flavors . <p> Use the DQ REPS BC strategies which best match the purpose and scope of the writing task .

A five paragraph **25;511;TOOLONG essay would not include a separate introductory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research paper might necessitate such an explanation . <p> Use the DQ REPS BC strategies which best match your audience . For example , the Background introduction strategy may be essential if writing a response to literature essay to an audience unfamiliar with the novel ; however , identifying the main characters and setting may be unnecessary or even condescending to an audience of students and teacher who have already read the novel . Furthermore , the Reference to Common Knowledge introduction strategy might be necessary for an audience of fourth graders , but not for eighth graders . <p> Place the thesis statement last in short essays. - The audience ( your reader ) expects the purpose or point of view of the essay to be in this position . Do n't  disappoint your audience unless you have a specific reason for placing the thesis statement elsewhere . <p> Do n't  <p> Make unreasonable statements . For example , absolute words such as- never , - only , and- always- and causal connection words such as- because , - results , the reason for , caused , created , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of objectivity in the writer . <p> Pad the introductory paragraph with overly general statements or say what does not need to be said. - For example , The fact of the matter is that Americans have differences of opinions on this issue . Of course , - Americans believe in freedom and justice . <p> Be uncertain or apologetic . For example , saying " it may or may not be true " or " more research needs to be done to reach a firm conclusion " does not build confidence in your audience that your essay will be convincing or informative . <p> Use anecdotes for short essays. - For example , take this often-used anecdote : " When Abraham Lincoln was working as a clerk in a store , he once overcharged a customer- by 6 1/4 cents . Upon discovering his mistake , he walked three miles to return the womans money .

Plus , confusing narrative elements with exposition when establishing the voice of the essay in the introduction can be- confusing to the audience . <p> The Big Picture <p> Think of writing an essay introduction much as how a prosecuting attorney might design- an opening statement . The attorney would take time to consider which introduction strategies would best fit the nature of the case , the character of the defendant , and those listening and deliberating in the courtroom . The attorney begins by explaining- the crime . ( The crime is the topic . ) Next , the attorney connects that crime to the defendant and engages the jury .

" <p> Write or display- these definitions and examples , read them- out loud , and tell- students to copy them . <p> " A simple- sentence has three characteristics : 1 . It tells a complete thought . 2 . It has both a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pronoun and serves as the " do-er " of the sentence . A noun is a person , place , thing , or idea . A pronoun takes the place of a noun . The predicate is a verb or verbs and acts upon the subject- or links the subject to something else in the sentence . 3 .

Afterwards , let 's read the paragraph out loud together as a class . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-educated family. - He- had a lot of challenges to overcome. - Tom was the youngest- of seven children. - Tom did not receive- undivided attention from his parents. - His parent had so many children. - Thomas- did not learn to- talk as a young boy. - His parents did not interact- much with him. - His siblings did not interact- much with him. - He- finally learned to talk. - He began talking- at age four. - Then he- would not stop. - He asked why and how questions about everything . <p> Debrief- with- your students : " What did you think about- how this paragraph is- written ? How did it sound ? Each sentence in the paragraph is a- simple sentence . We can combine simple sentences with a conjunction to form another type of sentence : the compound sentences . A conjunction is a joining word . When we combine simple sentences , - we change the name of a simple sentence to an independent clause. - Let 's copy these definitions and example : A simple sentence is- an independent clause . Two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - Then he would not stop , and he asked why and how questions about everything . <p> Another type of sentence is the complex sentence. - Lets- listen to me as I read the same paragraph , revised with some- revised complex- sentences . Afterwards , we will- read the paragraph out loud together as a class . " <p> Identify the Solution : - Connect to Oral Language and Reading <p> RUNG 3 <p> Convince students that adding sentence variety by including complex sentences makes writing more- efficient , precise , and coherent. - " Now listen to me as I read this paragraph of simple- sentences . Afterwards , let 's read the paragraph out loud together as a class . " <p> - - - Although Thomas Alva Edison was born into a well-educated family , he- had a lot of challenges to overcome. - Tom was the youngest- of seven children. - Because his parents had so many children , Tom did not receive their undivided attention. - Thomas- did not learn to- talk as a young boy since his parents and siblings- rarely interacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age four , he would not stop. - He asked why and how questions about everything . <p> Debrief- with- your students : " Does this revised paragraph- - provide the same information as the first ? What did you think about- how this revised paragraph is- written ? How did it sound ? - Many of the sentences in this revised paragraph- are- complex- sentences . Let 's copy this down : A complex- sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause . A dependent clause has- three characteristics : 1 . It begins with a- subordinate conjunction. - Subordinate means less important than or under the control of someone or something else . 2. - It has at least one- noun or a pronoun and at least one connected verb . 3 . When read out loud , a dependent clause does not- makes the voice drop down at the end of a statement . Example : - Although ( subordinate conjunction ) Mike ( noun ) and I- ( pronoun ) listen ( verb ) , ( When read out loud the voice does- not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author formed complex sentences to make the our own writing efficient , precise , and coherent .

The dependent clause may be placed at the beginning , in the middle , or at the end of a sentence . Copy these sentences with their examples . <p> Place a comma after a dependent clause that begins a sentence . Example:After I sneeze , I always blow my nose . <p> Place commas before and after a dependent clause in the middle of the sentence . Example : - I use a handkerchief , - when I sneeze , to be polite . <p> Do n't place a comma before a dependent clause that ends a sentence . Example : - I stop sneezing when its not allergy season . " <p> Assign a Formative Assessment to Determine Mastery <p> RUNG 6- <p> Write a short paragraph in which you use three complex sentences : one at the beginning of a sentence ; one in the middle of a sentence ; and one at the end of a sentence . <p> Extend the Learning : Writing Style <p> RUNG 7- <p> A- little knowledge can be a dangerous thing . Teach students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row in any given paragraph . Overuse of simple sentences is problematic , but the same is true with complex sentences .

@@61116691 @1116691/ <h> Reading Intervention Placement <p> Placing students in remedial reading intervention classes is certainly a challenge . By understanding what does and does not make sense in the selection process , educators will be able to avoid many of the usual pitfalls of these types of programs and have a greater chance at success . <p> What Does Not Make Sense in Terms of Reading Intervention Placement <p> 1 . Placing students in remedial reading classes from the results of standards-based assessments and herding them into a reading intervention class is crazy . Students score poorly on standards-based tests for all kinds of reasons . The student data from the PAARC and SBAC- Standards-based assessments measure student achievement relative to grade-level standards ; they are not designed to measure reading-vocabulary abilities , as are normed tests . Additionally , placement based upon the previous annual exam ignores the reading history of the students . Finally , in my experience , this placement mixes students who really only require strategic reading intervention with students who need intensive reading intervention . Usually , more students wind up in intensive reading intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students into a remedial reading intervention class without- regard to behavioral criteria is crazy . Severe ADHD students , students with anger issues , and students who bug the heck out of other students or teachers all need special intervention and may , indeed , need remedial reading instruction . In fact , many of the students who have behavioral problems have learned these behaviors to cope with reading problems . However , just a few of these students can ruin an entire class . We have to take our heads out of the sand on the behavioral issue . Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports ( PBIS ) need to be in place alongside of- Response to Intervention ( RtI ) to form a cohesive- ( MTSS ) Multi-Tiered System of Supports for these students . <p> 3 . Placing students into a class of 35 students for remedial reading intervention is crazy . Any remedial reading class has students in that class for many different reasons , even if the placement criteria make sense . Some students have vocabulary deficits ; others have decoding issues ; others have fluency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading teacher must differentiate instruction . In order to differentiate instruction , the teacher-student ratio has to be manageable and the class size has to be limited . <p> 4 . Placing students in intensive remedial reading classes for 30 minutes a day , for one semester i.e. , 18 weeks , is crazy . A survival skills , band-aid approach to remedial reading may even be counterproductive . True remedial reading intervention takes time . <p> 1 . Standards-based assessments , such as the PAARC or SBAC , can be a rough , initial screening to alert educators about potential reading problems for individual students . However , a second round of diagnosis is definitely called for before placing student into an intensive reading intervention program . Selecting diagnostic assessments that are outside of the primary remedial reading program is of critical importance . There is the inherent problem of a publishers conflict of interest i.e. , let 's keep as many students in this program as possible in order to sell more books. - These multiple choice reading assessments will efficiently and appropriately narrow down the list of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening has been made . <p> 2 . Establish clear selection guidelines that deal with the behavioral issues . Behavioral problem students need help , too , but not in a class size of 35 students , and not at the expense of other students and their teachers . Smaller class sizes with specially trained teachers that deal head-on with the behavioral issues , as well as the reading issues , are essential to the success of behaviorally-challenged remedial reading students . <p> 3 . Reasonable class sizes are keys to remedial reading intervention success . Explore structural considerations , such as early-late , team-teaching , and after-school options to achieve sensible teacher-student ratios . Explore using teachers , who volunteer part of their teacher prep with additional stipend or in lieu of teacher duties ( trade-offs ) to help out . Explore incorporating instructional aides , parents , and student tutors to help manage larger class sizes and to assist with differentiated instruction . <p> 4 . Providing enough time for students to gain the reading skills needed to be successful in school is essential . I suggest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to make a difference in student achievement . <p> 5 . Remedial reading intervention can not be the dumping ground for teachers who lack seniority . Nor can a reading intervention class be a training ground for teachers . Remedial reading students deserve the best . Teachers without reading expertise need to gain that expertise prior to teaching this unique student population . University coursework and professional development are keys to creating the expertise needed to teach remedial reading intervention classes . 187937 @qwx597937 187938 @qwx597938

Administrators might learn a few things about professional development and site support , as well . <p> 1 . Get to know the teachers that you are working with outside of their classrooms . The staff room should be your starting point for building relationships . Your first contact should never be a classroom observation with your clipboard in hand and the principal in tow . Also , hang out with teachers while they are doing duties . Offer to take a duty assignment at random . <p> 2 . Build trust . Although your boss may be the principal or district supervisor , remind teachers- that you really work for them and that what they say/share will- remain in strict confidentiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative word about a teacher . For example , " Mr. Brown has no classroom management skills and does not teach to the standards " can be better said as " Mr. Brown really cares about improving his teaching craft , as we all do , and is working on classroom management and teaching to the standards . " <p> 3 . Be a classroom helper. - Offer to help do short workshops with below- level readers IN THE ROOM , so that the teacher can keep an eye on you . All teachers want help with their- kids . Do individual reading screenings . Offer to help the teacher complete individual diagnostic and formative assessments . You need to earn the right to be heard . <p> 4 . Remind teachers- that you are there to help and not to evaluate . Remind teachers- that you work for them and that what they say/share will- remain in strict confidentiality ( no snitchin to the- principal ) . <p> 5 . Offer to take the teachers class , so that the teacher can- do a peer observation . Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 6 . Offer to do a demonstration lesson and- ask for the teachers critique of your own teaching and what you share . Ask for criticism and let the teacher see your vulnerabilities and weaknesses as a fellow teacher . All teachers have insecurities. - By showing that you are not perfect , you will open up the channels of communication and trust . Teachers will ask for your feedback and input on their own teaching , if they see you as an equal with the time and resources to help them . <p> 7 . Keep staff presentations short and sweet . Do n't  be a know-it-all . When at all possible , enable another teacher to become the staff presentation star . Be a coach and let the players take all the credit . <p> 8 . Compliment a- teachers teaching frequently and direct those compliments to- that teachers colleagues and to administrators . Make teachers feel good about themselves because of you . A brief note is better than a verbal compliment . Every teacher is concerned about his or her reputation among colleagues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run a school-wide reading incentive program and build relationships with kids . The more the kids like you , the more they will ask their teachers to have you visit their classrooms . Pop into classrooms weekly with cool reading bookmarks and rewards certificates . Eat lunch with the kids and hang out with them on the playground . <p> 10 . Find out who the most influential- colleague is and start building relationships there . 187937 @qwx597937 187938 @qwx597938

You may have as well . <p> This is my first year of teaching and I have been given a Reading class . I 'm at a large urban high school and I 've been told that the students are bright , but reluctant readers . For some of the class we will be using the Reading Plus program but for the rest of the time I have just been told to do anything that will improve their comprehension , ACT/SAT scores , high school exit exam scores , and overall reading skills . I 'm not sure where to even begin with this class . <p> I had only one Reading instruction class in my teacher training program , but I did one semester of my student teaching program at a middle school and I taught both a literature class and a reading class . For the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 minutes a day . I did it , but students were pretty resistant . I let students pick their own novels , magazines , comics , or newspapers to read . Some did read , but others really did n't . I did n't feel like I was really teaching and I doubt if their reading test scores really improved as a result of this class . <p> So , any advice ? The Response to Intervention Coordinator was on my interview panel and said she would help me with this class , but I would like to start planning now . Should I keep doing the SSR ? I have one month to plan . <p> It was n't the post that got me thinking about Backwards Reading Intervention , but the responses . <p> The consensus response to this frequently-posed question regarding what to teach in a reading intervention class is the advice to let students choose their own reading . This student-centered approach seems admirable , and notable authors Nancy Atwell , Donalyn Miller , and Stephen Krashen are all proponents of free voluntary reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , students do not always pick what is in their best interests . Given a choice , most children will pick candy over vegetables . <p> I could go into quite a bit of anecdotal evidence here with respect to the drawbacks of in-class SSR/Free Voluntary Reading : ** peer pressure , mismatched reading levels , trashy adolescent lit , lack of accountability , etc . But the real point I would like to make deals with the basic instructional question . How strange that a student-centered approach to learning , as advocated by many teachers and authors , does not extend to a student-centered approach to instruction . To cut to the chase , why are many reading intervention teachers so reluctant to differentiate reading instruction according to the diagnostic needs of individual students ? Sit in on most elementary , middle school , high school , and community college remedial reading classes ( Been there , done that ) , and you 'll find what I have found : We teach them the same stuff . It 's teacher-centered instruction , not student-centered instruction . <h> Backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading backwards . We begin with what we want to teach them and how we want to teach them , but we all-too-often ignore the them . Having taught a remedial high school reading class for four years , I eventually discovered that each student was in that class for different reasons . To achieve the progress that each student deserves , we have to begin by finding out those different reasons . The what and how- of instruction should derive from diagnostic assessment . <p> Of course , teachers want to plan instruction ; you have to teach them something . However , perhaps the best response to the teacher 's post would be one that provides the diagnostic assessments , recording matrices , instructions re : data analysis and decision-making and flexible program resources that will allow the teacher to adjust instruction according to the diagnostic needs of her students . That kind of planning makes sense.Here they are and happy planning . You 're making a world of difference for these students .

@@61116798 @1116798/ <h> Archive <p> Get ready for some terrific phonemic awareness activities But first , let 's get clear on just what phonemic awareness is all about , why it is important , and how it relates to reading . Phonemic awareness is the basic understanding that spoken words are made up of individual speech sounds . We call these speech sounds phonemes . There are about 43 common phonemes in English . See my attached list , - Phonemes , which includes adjustments for the Spanish phonemes in footnotes . <p> Why is phonemic awareness essential ? <p> Between 20 and 40% of the population does not naturally develop phonemic awareness . Current research indicates that there may be both medical and genetic factors that contribute to this deficiency ( Grossen , 1997 ) . <p> When children can not hear and manipulate the sounds ( phonemes ) in spoken words , they struggle learning how to attach these sounds to letters and letter combinations . Lack of phonemic awareness is the chief causal factor of reading disabilities ( Adams , 1990 ) . Phonemic awareness is the best predictor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1977 ; Stanovich , 1986 , 1994 ) . <p> It 's true that specific speech sounds differ among languages , and this makes phonemic awareness and phonics acquisition more challenging for English-language Learners ( ELLs ) . However , ELLs are certainly able to transfer their phonological awareness skills from their primary language to English , and research indicates the positive benefits of phonemic awareness training ( Abbot , Quiroga , Lernos-Britton , Mostafapour , and Berninger , 2002 ) . Indeed , some primary languages , such as Spanish , share more phonemes with English than not . <p> Phonemic Awareness Assessments <p> Not all students will have mastered the same components of phonemic awareness . Thus , diagnostic assessments are a must to efficiently teach these unmastered components . After completing phonemic awareness assessments , grade and record any unmastered phonemic awareness components for each student on a progress monitoring matrix .

You can be a pessimist and see the glass as being half-empty or an optimist and see the glass as being half-full . I prefer the latter .

Direct instruction in the language conventions of grammar , usage , mechanics , and spelling is what the Common Core Language Strand authors envisioned , not endless practice without effective instruction . <p> Yes , kids need lots of practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our teacher training programs about effective lesson design : Explicit Behavioral Objectives , Connection to Prior Learning and Lesson Transitions , Pre-teaching , Direct Instruction in the Content or Skill Standard with Multi-modality Examples and Language Support , Checking for Understanding , Guided Practice ( which certainly could include some editing , but why not decision-making between what 's right and what 's wrong , instead of error-only scavenger hunts ? ) , Formative Assessment , Re-teaching , Individualized Instruction , and Independent Practice . Of course , teachers are accustomed to different names for the essentially the same lesson components . Essentially , the teacher uses comprehensible input to introduce new learning , the students practice with the teachers help , the teacher assesses students mastery of the lesson content and skills and uses the data to re-teach or individualize instruction , and assigns independent practice in which the students- apply what they have learned . Basic lesson design . <p> The Daily Paragraph Editing program suffers from the same false assumptions that some teachers , administrators , and parents frequently share : All students are alike and need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : each is different and has different needs and different levels of content and skills mastery , particularly in the disciplines of the Language Strand : grammar , usage , mechanics , spelling , vocabulary , and knowledge of use . <p> A cookie-cutter approach to instruction such as Daily Paragraph Editing , Daily Oral Language , and Daily Language Review winds up re-teaching what some students already know ( a waste of time ) , not building upon previous grade-level instruction , and short-changing instruction for those students , such as our ELL , Special Education , and below grade level students who need assessment-based practice. - Students need effectively designed grade-level instruction , using all of the elements of direct instruction ; plus , they need assessment-based individualized instruction for additional remedial practice so they can " catch up " while they " keep up " with rigorous writing instruction . <p> Teaching that helps students actually learn and retain skills and concepts requires something more than just a writing opener used only a few minutes each day . We teachers can do better than piecemeal and ineffective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standards , they want- their students to learn , retain , and be able to apply them in the reading and writing contexts . <p> Bottom line ? The Daily Paragraph Editing program is a short-cut to " teach " Language Strand Standards that cant possibly transfer to long term content and skills acquisition . It has many of the same issues as Daily Language Review and- Daily Oral Language . Teachers wind up " teaching " the same content and skills year after year . Clearly , we have better alternatives for effective instruction in the the Language Strand Standards . 
@@61116813 @1116813/ <h> How to be an Effective Reading Specialist <p> As an elementary reading specialist and staff developer for five years in the Elk Grove Unified School District in Northern California , I learned from lots of my mistakes . - In the hope that prospective reading specialists , coaches , and staff developers might learn from someone elses mistakes , I 've jotted down a- few tips . Administrators might learn a few things about professional development and site support , as well . <p> 1 . Get to know the teachers that you are working with outside of their classrooms . The staff room should be your starting point for building relationships . Your first contact should never be a classroom observation with your clipboard in hand and the principal in tow . Also , hang out with teachers while they are doing duties . Offer to take a duty assignment at random . <p> 2 . Build trust . Although your boss may be the principal or district supervisor , remind teachers- that you really work for them and that what they say/share will- remain in strict confidentiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative word about a teacher . For example , " Mr. Brown has no classroom management skills and does not teach to the standards " can be better said as " Mr. Brown really cares about improving his teaching craft , as we all do , and is working on classroom management and teaching to the standards . " <p> 3 . Be a classroom helper. - Offer to help do short workshops with below- level readers IN THE ROOM , so that the teacher can keep an eye on you . All teachers want help with their- kids . Do individual reading screenings . Offer to help the teacher complete individual diagnostic and formative assessments . You need to earn the right to be heard . <p> 4 . Remind teachers- that you are there to help and not to evaluate . Remind teachers- that you work for them and that what they say/share will- remain in strict confidentiality ( no snitchin to the- principal ) . <p> 5 . Offer to take the teachers class , so that the teacher can- do a peer observation . Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 6 . Offer to do a demonstration lesson and- ask for the teachers critique of your own teaching and what you share . Ask for criticism and let the teacher see your vulnerabilities and weaknesses as a fellow teacher . All teachers have insecurities. - By showing that you are not perfect , you will open up the channels of communication and trust . Teachers will ask for your feedback and input on their own teaching , if they see you as an equal with the time and resources to help them . <p> 7 . Keep staff presentations short and sweet . Do n't  be a know-it-all . When at all possible , enable another teacher to become the staff presentation star . Be a coach and let the players take all the credit . <p> 8 . Compliment a- teachers teaching frequently and direct those compliments to- that teachers colleagues and to administrators . Make teachers feel good about themselves because of you . A brief note is better than a verbal compliment . Every teacher is concerned about his or her reputation among colleagues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run a school-wide reading incentive program and build relationships with kids . The more the kids like you , the more they will ask their teachers to have you visit their classrooms . Pop into classrooms weekly with cool reading bookmarks and rewards certificates . Eat lunch with the kids and hang out with them on the playground . <p> 10 . Find out who the most influential- colleague is and start building relationships there . 187937 @qwx597937 187938 @qwx597938

Why give the enemy ( the opposite point of view ) ammunition ( acknowledgement and evidence ) ? <p> The counterclaim can be defined as- the opposing point of view to ones thesis . It is also commonly known as the- counterargument . A counterclaim is always followed by a refutation , which is often referred to- as a rebuttal . The Common Core State Standards - for grades 7-12 include the counterclaim in the argumentative essay ( W. 1.0 ) . <p> Its all about scholarship and tactics : intellectual honesty and manipulation . <p> In argumentative essays the writer must prove his or her thesis according to the rules of the game , but the writer needs to know the rules so thoroughly that these rules can be used to work in the writers favor . I learned this lesson the hard way when I was a senior at the University of Southern California ( Go Trojans ! ) .

The research is clear that teaching the alphabetic code explicitly and systematically is an essential component of effective reading instruction . Now , this is not to say that there is n't a place for some sight word and word family ( onset and rime ) instruction , but the primary means of reading instruction must be the sound-spelling system . <p> Plenty of phonics-based programs do a fine job of providing that systematic instruction . However , some do the basic job , but will bore both students and teachers to tears . Learning to read is hard work , but it should also be fun . Reading instruction that is interactive and enjoyable will teach positive associations with reading to both beginning and remedial readers .

True , there are plenty of exceptions , but applying the rules and adjusting for exceptions is certainly better than memorizing every word as a unique entity . Imagine having to memorize each of the Chinese characters to be able to write simple communications and most will agree that the alphabetic system serves us well . <p> Rationale <p> The English sound-spelling system works in about 50% of spellings . You can be a pessimist and see the glass as being half-empty or an optimist and see the glass as being half-full . I prefer the latter . The basic problem-solving strategy in spelling should not be memorizing the spellings of all words . Instead , the speller should first attempt the spellings that match the sounds of the word .
