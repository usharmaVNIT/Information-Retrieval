Wallis said she had never seen the materials contained in the scrapbook . <p> The scrapbook photos show the huge crowds on hand , along with the juxtaposition of horse-drawn carriages , trollies and vintage automobiles traversing the streets , with the celebratory events all playing out against the backdrop of a downtown decked out with elaborate bunting on every building .

B. Gardner , Judge Newby , J.B. Worley , O.N . Sams , Geo . L.

" <p> Later , the success of the celebration is reflected in various newspaper stories , presented in the style of the day with multiple headlines and sub-headlines displaying unabashed pride and containing so much information that they made the need to read the actual stories almost unnecessary . <p> Another newspaper article dated Sept. 19 , 1907 took the practice even further , proclaiming in headlines and sub-headlines leading to a story thousands of words in length , " CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION AND HOME-COMING A GLORIOUS SUCCESS .

" <p> The most anticipated returning visitor and speaker for the event was Highland County native Joseph B. Foraker , the former Ohio governor and at the time a United States senator . Included in the scrapbook is the original letter from Foraker on Senate stationary dated Aug. 15 , 1907 , accepting the invitation , and adding , " I shall certainly be there if alive and in good health on September 18th , and if I can I will be there also on September 17th . " <p> Page after page of newspaper articles contain the complete text of speeches made by the various dignitaries . <p> Concerts by various local bands at different points in town were scheduled throughout the celebration .

@@121760241 @10760241/ <h> Our View : Time to fish or cut bait in Hastings case <p> The criminal investigation into Hillsboro Mayor Drew Hastings began in mid-December of last year , meaning it has plugged along for five months . Its time to wrap it up and either file charges against the mayor and anyone else under the investigators microscope , or announce the case is being dropped . <p> While officials involved in the investigation are tight-lipped , most indications are that charges will likely be presented to a grand jury . The next scheduled grand jury meeting in Highland County is June 7 . Considering the nature of the allegations against the mayor and possibly against an administrative assistant it is difficult to believe that investigators , led by the office of state Auditor Dave Yost , can not have their evidence lined up by then and start the process of giving the accused their day in court assuming a grand jury agrees that the evidence warrants indictments . <p> The allegations that we know , through various warrants and affidavits , are as follows : <p> Hastings received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid without going through the proper steps , and the document authorizing the rebate included the signature of the safety and service director via a signature stamp that was utilized without his approval . The resulting charge would be forgery and possibly tampering with records . <p> Hastings used or facilitated the use by others of a city dumpster to dispose of debris from his personal property or properties , and asked an individual to lie about the use of the dumpster . The charges connected to these allegations would be theft of service and obstructing official business . <p> Hastings did not live where he claimed to live when he filed to run for mayor in 2011 . The charge would be election falsification . <p> There may be other allegations that have not been brought to light . Charges brought in the Hastings case would likely be a mix of felony and misdemeanor charges , according to those familiar with the case . <p> There are many people who , when examining the charges item by item , wonder why so much time and effort has been devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption cases involving government officials or offices . Indeed , the accusations that are known can be viewed as relatively minor , and maybe even easily defensible . And the very nature by which it all began with the filing of a civil suit brought by five residents who have been outspoken critics of the mayor opens up the ensuing criminal investigation to suspicions of having political underpinnings . The civil suit was dismissed due to technical issues , but the criminal probe has dragged along at a tortoise pace . <p> If it happens , we do not agree that criminal behavior by any elected official should be ignored , regardless of the amount of money or level of activity that might be involved , large or small . But we strongly believe that the Hastings investigation involves straightforward allegations on which investigators should be able to expediently act if they believe charges are warranted . City government has suffered waiting for the investigation to wrap up . Projects have been placed on hold , and tensions among city offices have grown more strained by the day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case deserve the right to face their accusers and an opportunity to answer specific charges , rather than suffer an endless parade of rumors and a dark cloud of unproven suspicions . City government needs to move forward . The people of Hillsboro deserve a resolution .

One of the biggest responses we ever had to a story was a brief mention in a city council story that the local Taco Bell was rebuilding after a fire .

I reported what he told me , and I made sure to mention that there were organizations and people who disagreed with his point of view on marijuana . <p> The marijuana debate has never been something I 've engaged in to any significant degree . But those who commented and claimed that Dr. Beery was way off base , or had no basis for his opinion that marijuana is a " gateway to hell , " were wrong to paint the coroner as some kind of lone nut stranded on an island or stuck in the 1950s . <p> I know this because of emails I received from people who saw our story and wanted to back him up , people who have been involved in the marijuana debate for a long time . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote , " I believe there is a link to the legalization of marijuana and increase in heroin overdoses .

" I so agree with Dr. Beery , Marijuana is the gateway to hell. " She added , " I 'm sharing my sons unimaginable fate to make others aware of the harms of marijuana in hopes of preventing more young lives being lost and parents the agony of losing a child . " <p> You may well disagree that marijuana is a harmful drug or a gateway to heavier drug use , and you may be among those who insist it has medicinal value .

But clearly , Dr. Beerys position on the subject is hardly heretical . There are obviously people all over the U.S. who have their own firsthand stories of heartbreak and tragedy connected to marijuana and who share their stories freely in an effort to counter the notion that pot is harmless . <p> Most people who defend marijuana do not even make the medical argument . They just want to smoke it for fun and relaxation . They often say , " What about alcohol ? Alcohol is worse !

No one , on any subject , has a monopoly on all the facts , because they ignore facts that do n't  fit their argument , and because new facts emerge all the time , especially on medical topics . <p> People who have lost loved ones or who have seen the negative impacts of marijuana should not be dismissed or ridiculed . Their personal experiences deserve to be respected . As a county coroner , Dr. Beery sees what he sees on a regular basis .

" That got my interest . I went home and turned it on and heard stations from all kinds of other places and got hooked on radio big . " <p> It was 1963 when Levo took a class in Blanchester that gave him his ham radio license . <p> Fast forward about 14 years to 1977 . On April 17 that year 22 local " hams , " or ham radio operators , including Levo , met at the Hillsboro Farm Bureau Conference Room to form the Highland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first president . Today , there are nearly 100 HARA members and more than 150 ham radio operators in Highland County , according to Levo . <p> On April 22 , HARA will celebrate its 40th anniversary with a dinner at the Hillsboro First United Methodist Church . Levo said an invitation is extended to current members , past members , former licensed hams , and others interested in amateur radio and radio communications . <p> It is the use of ham radios and related events that Levo says is what kept him interested all these years talking to people around the world , attending trade shows and conventions , and the places those events have taken him . <p> It was at one of those shows in Coeur dAlene , Idaho that Levo said he hooked up with a group of hams trying to make contact with someone in all 3,076 U.S. counties . <p> Levo said it took him about 20 years to do it , but he is now among about 1,500 people who have accomplished the feat . <p> Once when he was working a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to a man who asked him if the Nazarene Church in Hillsboro was still about a block away from the Highland County Courthouse . Apparently , the man had been a missionary in the Hillsboro area for a time . Another time he was working a station in Australia when a man he contacted said he had been training for a tool and dye position at Milacron in Cincinnati , and that the people the man stayed with took him for a weekend picnic at Rocky Fork Lake . <p> " I 've been fortunate at some trade shows to have met some people from countries that I have talked to on the radio , " the Hillsboro resident said . <p> Levos wife , longtime Hillsboro educator Kathy Levo , is also an HARA member . John says that happened because she wanted an addition to their home . So he told her if she would get her ham license , he would add the room . Then he says she agreed to take an advanced ham class when she wanted a knew car . <p> Kathy agrees somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a new room with a fireplace , and that the second deal had more to do with a cruise of the Panama Canal . <p> According to John Levo , no one is sure who the first person was in Highland County to own a ham radio or send the first signal from one . But he said the late Harry Barrett remembered a man who worked on Lake Erie boats that could have been the original one . <p> " His family lived on the Chillicothe Pike and he would return home when the lakes were frozen during the winter , " Levo said . " While here he would use Morse Code and a wireless set to communicate with his companys offices to learn when the lake would reopen for shipping and when he was expected to report to work . " <p> But if that was not the case , Levo said it would likely be New Viennas Paul Terrell who was first to regularly grace the airwaves on ham radio while he was still in school . <p> Prior to World War I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy tried to control it . That changed in 1912 when the government began issuing licenses to people passing tests proving a high degree of electronic knowledge and who had mastered Morse Code . Most of those receiving licenses were employees of electric , telephone or railroad companies , or former military members . But Levo said Hillsboro had an operator that worked at the Carnation Milk Plant . <p> Levo said the first person in Highland County to earn a license was Virginia Barrett Layman , known as 8UEZ . " She often said she did it to prove to the men she could , " Levo said . <p> From the late 1950s through the mid-1960s , a loose-knit group of amateur radio operators gathered on air on Sunday mornings to discuss various topics and Levo said they became known as the Rocky Fork Emergency Net . He said the group continued until an amateur radio club was formed in Clinton County in the 60s and many Highland County hams became members of that group . The Clinton County club sponsored a series of license classes that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FCC ) exam , according to Levo . <p> In time , he said , there were about as many Highland County members of the club as Clinton County members , so it was suggested that Highland County form its own organization . <p> Also in the mid-1960s , Levo said , the Hillsboro , Peebles , Lynchburg , Martinsville and New Vienna areas were a hot bed of amateur radio activity because radio theory was taught in the schools and many teachers and students became licensed . <p> There are still advantages to ham radios . <p> " One of the reasons were looked favorably upon by the federal government is because if there was to be a terror attack on the power grid or normal telecommunications , the ham radio community would be called upon to provide communication , " Levo said . " People believe ham radio is old-fashioned . Well , no , were not . With the technology we are using we can provide communications in emergency situations when others might not be able to . " <p> Anyone interested in attending April 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John or Kathy Levo at 937-393-4951 for more information . <p> " We are making an effort to reach those that were exposed to ham radio during their high school days , " Tourtelot said .

@@121760358 @10760358/ <h> Our View : Hillsboro leaders right to repeal water , sewer rate hikes <p> Barring unforeseen circumstances , Hillsboro City Council is on the verge of repealing legislation passed several years ago that mandated annual increases in water and sewer bills . <p> As reported this week by The Times-Gazette , the move comes after two straight years of moratoriums on the rate hikes that were first recommended by the Hastings administration in 2014 . Rebecca Wilkins Utilities Committee , including members Bill Alexander and Tracy Aranyos , studied the issue and ultimately recommended that the increases be permanently abandoned . <p> An ordinance to repeal the increases is on the agenda for council when it meets in regular session Monday evening . At scheduled increases of 3.5 percent each year , water and sewer bills would be more than 10 percent higher today if the moratoriums had not been enacted beginning in 2014 . <p> The currently-scheduled annual rate increases began when city council , in 2008 , approved rate hikes to be triggered each September through 2016 . The increases were part of a schedule coordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure the city could meet the obligations of loans connected to the new water treatment plant . <p> The Hastings administration recommended the first moratorium on the scheduled hikes after it learned in 2013 of additional state funding that had been awarded in 2008 and 2009 but somehow had not been collected . In 2014 , council unanimously agreed to a year-long moratorium on rate increases after the Utilities Committee had also studied the issue . <p> Council approved another moratorium in 2015 , which lasted until September of last year . Since then , a series of 30-day moratoriums were approved , meaning that Hillsboro residents were spared the final two years of the rate hikes put in place in 2008 . <p> Even though the schedule of hikes was expiring at the end of 2016 , the repeal legislation is designed to ward off any confusion or claim that the moratoriums that were passed simply delayed the increases and that they could still be collected in 2017 and 2018 once the moratoriums expired . This legislation on the docket for Monday will ensure that the increases are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new act of council . <p> We applaud the Hastings administration and Rebecca Wilkins Utilities Committee for recommending savings for Hillsboro residents by taking the responsible action of ending the incremental increases of city water and sewer bills when additional funding made the increases unnecessary . It was a commendable action to take in an age when local governments find it difficult to turn down revenue in any form .

They present one individual as their subject , and then ask a series of questions about whether respondents approve or disapprove , item by item . <p> More importantly , presidential job approval ratings are a national snapshot , not a state-by-state survey . As we know , presidential elections are not national elections , they are state-by-state elections . <p> Smart campaign strategists have always recognized that even more important that the breadth of a candidates popularity is the depth of it . Its come to be called the " enthusiasm gap , " and in that contest , Trump led Clinton wire to wire in the 2016 election . <p> What you can expect from time to time in the coming months and years are polls presenting a hypothetical matchup between Trump and an unnamed opponent , i.e. , " If the 2020 election was held today , would you vote for Donald Trump or the Democratic Party nominee ? " Trump will almost certainly always lose those polls by a wide margin . <p> But once you start inserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather than " the Democratic Party nominee , " insert Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders , Joe Biden or any other Democrat of your choice , and Trump will either win the poll or it will be close . That 's because all actual candidates carry negative attributes in the minds of voters , whereas only diehard Republican respondents will respond negatively just to the phrase " the Democratic Party nominee . " <p> Donald Trumps base , along with his approval rating , may forever be in the 39-42 percent range , but that coupled with two or three more points ( votes ) from the dreaded " undecideds " would be more than enough for him to be re-elected in 2020 once there is an actual Democratic Party nominee as well as the usual plethora of third-party candidates on the ballot . <p> So the daily or weekly job approval reports are exercises in futility , all sound and fury signifying nothing . <p> Of course , all this assumes that if Trump runs again , he will be the Republican nominee , which wont happen if Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You remember Kasichs 2016 campaign for president ? Of course you do . <p> At the risk of dredging up bad memories of the embarrassing spectacle of Kasichs " The Man Who Just Wouldnt Go Away " bid for the White House after winning one state in the primaries ( his own ) our governor finally got out in early May of last year . <p> At the time , he said , " I have always said that the Lord has a purpose for me as he has for everyone . And as I suspend my campaign today , I have renewed faith , deeper faith , that the Lord will show me the way forward , and fulfill the purpose of my life . " <p> As is the case with most of us when we claim to follow Gods will , God seems to want exactly what John Kasich wants . It appears that the Lord might be pointing Kasich right back to where Kasich himself thinks he should be . What a happy coincidence . <p> In a recent interview with CNN , Kasich at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson Cooper pressed , " You would n't close the door on it ? " Kasich responded , " How do you close the door on anything ? if I see something that I need to do to help my country that I really believe that I have to do , you know , I would think that I would probably do it . " <p> Kasichs new book because we need a new book from Kasich is entitled , " Two Paths : America Divided or United . " You figure it out . <p> But after Kasichs ego is assuaged by one more round of media attention , state-by-state town hall gatherings and another swan song along the lines of " The Lord Has a Path For Me , " maybe in a different key , and after he realizes that the Lord really wants him to become a political pundit on television or a lobbyist or an advisor for a big investment firm , Trump will again be the nominee . <p> And when that happens , critics and pundits will endlessly point to Trumps low approval ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been re-elected with approval ratings this low .

@@121760370 @10760370/ <h> Our View : Hillsboro leaders right to repeal water , sewer rate hikes <p> Barring unforeseen circumstances , Hillsboro City Council is on the verge of repealing legislation passed several years ago that mandated annual increases in water and sewer bills . <p> As reported this week by The Times-Gazette , the move comes after two straight years of moratoriums on the rate hikes that were first recommended by the Hastings administration in 2014 . Rebecca Wilkins Utilities Committee , including members Bill Alexander and Tracy Aranyos , studied the issue and ultimately recommended that the increases be permanently abandoned . <p> An ordinance to repeal the increases is on the agenda for council when it meets in regular session Monday evening . At scheduled increases of 3.5 percent each year , water and sewer bills would be more than 10 percent higher today if the moratoriums had not been enacted beginning in 2014 . <p> The currently-scheduled annual rate increases began when city council , in 2008 , approved rate hikes to be triggered each September through 2016 . The increases were part of a schedule coordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure the city could meet the obligations of loans connected to the new water treatment plant . <p> The Hastings administration recommended the first moratorium on the scheduled hikes after it learned in 2013 of additional state funding that had been awarded in 2008 and 2009 but somehow had not been collected . In 2014 , council unanimously agreed to a year-long moratorium on rate increases after the Utilities Committee had also studied the issue . <p> Council approved another moratorium in 2015 , which lasted until September of last year . Since then , a series of 30-day moratoriums were approved , meaning that Hillsboro residents were spared the final two years of the rate hikes put in place in 2008 . <p> Even though the schedule of hikes was expiring at the end of 2016 , the repeal legislation is designed to ward off any confusion or claim that the moratoriums that were passed simply delayed the increases and that they could still be collected in 2017 and 2018 once the moratoriums expired . This legislation on the docket for Monday will ensure that the increases are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new act of council . <p> We applaud the Hastings administration and Rebecca Wilkins Utilities Committee for recommending savings for Hillsboro residents by taking the responsible action of ending the incremental increases of city water and sewer bills when additional funding made the increases unnecessary . It was a commendable action to take in an age when local governments find it difficult to turn down revenue in any form .

@@121760377 @10760377/ <h> Trump and the war with media <p> Its still difficult to comprehend that Donald Trump is president of the United States of America . <p> Yes , I 'm happy about it . And its not as though Trumps victory took me by surprise . I wrote several times throughout the long , long presidential campaign that the 2016 election was , despite what the polls said , a change election . Hillary Clinton was never going to represent change , nor did any of the other Republican candidates , not in any meaningful way , not in the way that millions of voters wanted change . <p> Change may be too mild of a description . What voters wanted was upheaval , a complete undoing of the status quo in favor of a tell-it-like-it-is " drain the swamp " outsider maverick . <p> As of this writing , Donald Trump has been president for nearly 72 hours . So far , no nuclear missiles have been launched , as the left warned . In fact , President Trump is less likely to launch a nuclear war than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self interests . Trump owns property all over the world . <p> Donald Trumps greatest sources of pride are his vast holdings and his children and grandchildren . He does n't  want any of it blown to smithereens . Trump wants to go down in history as Americas greatest president , and that is his highest motivation . Trumps ego is the size of Texas , but in this case it also serves as a positive influence to get results . <p> Trumps first two or three days in office have been dominated by hissy fits by Big Media ( a term I prefer to " mainstream media , since the media in question is hardly in the mainstream of America ) that he seems to have declared war on them , an odd complaint considering the medias non-stop war on Trump . How dare he fight back ? <p> When it comes to his relationship with the media , Donald Trump is doing exactly what countless Republicans and conservatives have threatened to do over the years , but have never found the courage to do call out Big Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GOP , and treat it as such not just by whining about it , but by taking it on in daily hand-to-hand combat . <p> Over the weekend , Big Media The New York Times , the Washington Post , NBC ( and MSNBC ) , ABC , CBS , CNN and all their affiliated digital platforms were tripping over each other to point out " lies " being told by Trump and his press secretary , Sean Spicer , over everything from the size of the crowd at the inauguration to Trumps relationship with the intelligence community . <p> Big Media has been " fact checking " Trump over the weekend , and surprise , surprise has rendered a judgment of guilty on all counts of fudging the facts . Trouble is , they have no credibility to do so . They surrendered it completely during the campaign and beyond with their open , unapologetic ridiculing of Trump and his supporters and their blatant support for Hillary , ending with their embarrassing weeping over the fact that it was not Hillary Clinton taking the oath on Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one residing on the right rather than the left , has also given up any real claim to the " fair and balanced " slogan it adopted long ago . Fox News entire business model is based on its decision to cater to an audience that was ignored and even ridiculed by the rest of Big Media . Such a model garners big numbers liberals have multiple viewing options for news , thereby splintering the audience , while conservatives have only one but it also disqualifies Fox as an unbiased deliverer of fact . <p> Where does someone go today for a national media outlet that delivers the facts and just the facts , without a blatant bias on the left or the right ? I cant think of one , and that is Americas loss . <p> And that is also why it is difficult to suggest that President Trump should stop tweeting , even though under ideal circumstances ( an unbiased media atmosphere ) I would suggest as much . Trumps ability to reach millions of Twitter followers and bypass the press is a formidable weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and even necessary . <p> But many of Trumps tweets over the course of the campaign were indefensible , just like social media comments made from time to time by the mayor of Hillsboro , including recently . Trump and Drew Hastings share a lot of qualities that are appealing , but they also share the same unfortunate inclination for unnecessary insensitivity resulting in self-inflicted wounds not that Hastings is the only elected official in Hillsboro with a social media problem . City council should consider writing and instituting a social media Code of Conduct for all city officials . <p> In Trumps case , there is still hope that he will at least temper his tweets and use the platform less frequently and in less inflammatory fashion . But make no mistake , we live in a new national media environment and a new social media environment . We now have a new president who understands the game as it is played today , and he s better at playing it than the media . <p> Donald Trump is the first true social media president . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional sense are living in a bygone world . Still , President Trump needs to find a balance between delivering his message directly to the people while still maintaining a level of respect befitting the Oval Office a respect that should be expected and fostered , even in a social media world . 226139 @qwx1086139

@@121760416 @10760416/ <h> Republicans not ready to lead <p> As someone who has frequently criticized the national medias coverage of Donald Trump and Republicans in general , I have to admit that their take on the Obamacare repeal debacle was spot on . Some headlines : <p> " Republicans fold after years of vowing Obamacare repeal " The Atlantic . <p> " Failure of the health care bill reveals a party unready to govern " Vox Media . <p> That last one is my favorite , because it is so obviously true . The Republican Party , especially as constituted in the U.S. House of Representatives , is completely unready to govern . <p> The GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare was primarily thwarted by a group of 30 to 40 members of Congress who call themselves the " Freedom Caucus . " Their spiritual leader comes from the other chamber , U.S. Sen. Rand Paul , the Republican gadfly from Kentucky who enjoys nothing more than appearing on cable television to pronounce himself a " true conservative . " <p> For sure , there were some moderate Republicans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucus outnumbered them and the legislation would have passed with Freedom Caucus support . <p> After House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Trump called off the Obamacare repeal roll call on Friday for lack of enough votes , Rand Paul and others of his ilk were reveling in their " victory . " That is how they think . <p> The Freedom Caucus never accomplishes anything other than to stop legislation from happening . It never has enough power or support to pass legislation into law . You can remove one section of rail from a thousand-mile train track and stop a train , but it takes a thousand miles of rail to make a train travel a thousand miles . The Freedom Caucus idea of victory is to remove one section of rail . They could n't build a thousand miles of track if their lives depended on it . <p> Was the GOP repeal plan perfect ? Of course not , not for anyone . Rand Paul frequently labeled it " Obamacare-lite . " here 's the thing Obamacare-lite would still have been better than full-blown Obamacare . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate result Freedom Caucus . <p> The absolute worst part of Obamacare has always been the individual mandate , the requirement that all Americans must purchase health insurance , or face a stiff penalty enforced by none other than the Internal Revenue Service . It is the most un-American , unconstitutional mandate imposed in all of U.S. history . The GOP plan supported by Trump and Ryan would have done away with the individual mandate , and that alone made it worth supporting . <p> Trump and Ryan tried to placate the Freedom Caucus , which , for anyone paying attention in recent years , was hilarious because it was doomed from the start . The Freedom Caucus never takes yes for an answer . Multiple reports detailed how every time Trump and Ryan gave the Freedom Caucus something they wanted , the caucus came up with something else . The bar kept moving , which was predictable . The Freedom Caucus all along wanted to kill the bill , and then take credit for killing it . <p> But there 's a much bigger picture at play here , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Freedom Caucus couldnt see the big picture if they were trapped in an IMAX theater . The Freedom Caucus always plays small ball . <p> The big picture here was the importance of a victory for President Trump in his first major piece of legislation . To accomplish that , it would have required Republicans of various stripes to bend , to be flexible , to put the good of the party and the president above themselves . <p> The Democrats did it in 2010 when they passed Obamacare in the first place . Republicans did it back in 1981 when they gave Ronald Reagan a first-year victory on his 1981 tax cuts , binding together with 40-some Democrats in a House actually controlled by the Democrats . <p> here 's how the New York Times reported the 1981 tax cut victory : <p> " In a decisive victory for President Reagan , the House of Representatives today approved the Administrations tax cut bill The key vote , 238 to 195 , gave Mr. Reagan a third upset victory over the Democratic House majority on fiscal issues . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future victories for Reagan . That 's the kind of story Donald Trump needed . That 's the kind of New York Times story he could have had if not for his own party , which , unlike what Reagan faced in 1981 , is actually in the majority in the House . Instead , he got this from the same newspaper , thanks to Republicans : <p> " House Republican leaders , facing a revolt among conservatives and moderates in their ranks , pulled legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act from consideration on the House floor Friday in a major defeat for President Trump on the first legislative showdown of his presidency it was the biggest defeat of Mr. Trumps young presidency , which has suffered many . " <p> It was crucial in the big scheme of things for Republicans to hand Donald Trump a victory on the legislation to repeal Obamacare , no matter how flawed individual Republicans thought it was . Failing to do so demonstrated clearly that , as the headline said , they are not ready to govern . <p> So here is what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They kept Obamacare as the law of the land , a strange victory for conservatives . <p> They allowed the media to ridicule President Trump and the Republican Party for failing in their first big legislative test . <p> In the earliest moments of the new presidency , they identified themselves as unreliable for all future initiatives supported by the Trump administration . <p> Since the repeal catastrophe , President Trump has said he may have to start working more with the Democrats to pass major pieces of legislation . That is what he should do . The Republicans had their chance , and they blew it .

At last count , there were at least five Republican senators waffling or declaring their opposition to the repeal effort for a number of stated reasons . <p> The House of Representatives went through similar drama , first embarrassingly falling short of enough votes to pass a health care bill earlier this year before finally passing one . <p> As usual , Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) is a leading objector to the GOP bill , and being against something appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senators express concerns about rolling back the Medicaid expansion that was a major part of Obamacare . <p> Nevertheless , as imperfect as the Republican plan might be , it will without doubt be an improvement on Obamacare . If the GOP plan does nothing but eliminate the individual mandate the law that , for the first time in history , forced Americans to purchase a private product for no other reason that being alive it will be worth the vote . <p> One of the most misleading objections to rolling back Obamacare is the claim that millions will lose health insurance , which completely ignores the fact that millions only signed up for health insurance because their government forced them to do it , under threat of a penalty enforced by the Internal Revenue Service . Many , if not most , will be happy to be rid of it . <p> To be clear , any Republican who votes against the GOP health care bill is in essence casting a vote in favor of Obamacare , because keeping Obamacare will be the end result of a failed vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care bill is the long-term fallout of failing to pass the bill . Let 's be clear about what the stakes really are in this current drama . <p> The national media is ready ( and in most cases hopeful ) to pounce on the outcome that sees the GOP failing to pass the bill , not because media members think its a bad bill , but because they love nothing more than promoting the narrative of a dysfunctional Republican Party and a dysfunctional White House . <p> To move on from the medias preferred narrative that President Trump has not accomplished any major legislative initiatives as though doing so in the first six months of an administration is par for the course and that his party is separating from him , it is important to pass the bill . <p> As noted here before , Democrats understand such things . That 's how Obamacare became law in the first place . They understand the bigger picture , the importance of victory over defeat . <p> So far this year , Republicans have been slow to demonstrate the same level of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " principle " leaves them boasting about their codes of honor and adhering to their beliefs , but no progress , and victory after victory for the party out of power . <p> The GOP has it within its grasp to completely change the narrative in Washington and beyond . For instance , it is only because there are enough Republicans pretending that the Trump-Russian allegations might be anything more than a political attack by Trumps opponents that they remain in sharp focus . <p> It is well documented that Russia and China accomplished virtually the same level of interference in the 2008 and 2012 elections as in 2016 , but since Trump won in 2016 , well , the national media makes it their lead story for months on end , with no end in sight . Republicans playing along gives the media the cover it needs . <p> If the GOP had within their ranks the fortitude to grab control of the narrative from their opponents , they would be progressing at a pace that would result in one victory after another , thereby creating an entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resolve on the Republican side is probably an exercise in futility . Even most Republicans seem at a loss to understand the landscape that led to Trumps victory , and the reality that Trump voters hold in their hands the electoral fate of Republicans next year and beyond . <p> If Republicans in Congress fail to pass legislation supported by President Trump , the midterm elections will result in Trump voters returning to the polls , particularly in primary elections , to replace those who wont back the president with those who will . This is the midterm result few are forecasting right now , but as those elections draw closer this reality will become clearer . <p> That sentiment does not reflect a hope , a threat , or a guess ; it represents a reality , based on what happened in 2016 , which , as time will demonstrate , was a beginning , not an end . <p> Reach Gary Abernathy at 937-393-3456 or by email at **27;319;TOOLONG

Pictured ( L-R ) are Austin Kimball , Jeremy Hayton , and Austin Goolsby . <p> Ryan Applegate The Times-Gazette <p> Hillsboro High School will be represented by four male athletes at the 2017 Track and Field State Tournament on June 2 and 3 at Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium at the Ohio State University . The four athletes are Jeremy Hayton , Austin Goolsby , Luke Gallimore , and Austin Kimball . Following is a preview of three of the four athletes : <p> Austin Goolsby <p> Goolsby a junior qualified for the tournament in the boys pole vault field event for the second year in a row after finishing as state runner-up a year ago . This season for Goolsby has been arguably his best all-around year in track and field , along with his dominance in the pole vault he has competed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the boys 100-meter dash . <p> Hillsboro head coach Bud Marsh was full of praise for the high school junior saying , " Austin is a junior , as a freshman he did 10-06 . Well , you know he loves to pole vault so he did things during the summer and the winter and the next winter he was vaulting 15-00 . All of that is because of the work he put in to get bigger , faster , and stronger . That 's what it takes to get better , that 's what you got to do . " <p> Goolsby was extremely good in all four events that he participated in this year garnering several top finishes and setting the bar for the entire state in his favorite event , the pole vault . He also was a top finisher and a regional qualifier in the long jump competition . Goolsby is just as good on the track having success in the 100-meter dash and helped the 4+100-meter relay team reach the tournament as well . <p> Given the level at which Goolsby competes in all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on qualifying for the tournament in his second best event , the long jump , may be the catalyst that propels him to the state title in the pole-vault . <p> Goolsby said , " I was kind of disappointed at first , when I did n't  qualify for the long jump , but I talked to coach and we kind of decided that its probably best because I will have most of my energy left for the pole vault . " <p> Coach Marsh said , " He wanted to try to do both , but both events run simultaneously . At regionals when he finished the long jump he went over to the pole vault and he did n't  have much left . You have maybe 12-15 jumps in you including practice and everything . You could tell he was wore down . He should have made it if he had done his jump before , one of the tops in the state , but it would have taken away from the pole vault . " <p> Goolsby qualified for the tournament as a result of posting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens High School . Goolsbys best vault of the season was 16-00.00 , a height that if repeated could earn him the state championship . <p> Goolsby indicated that he has his sights set on not only the state title , but also the state record height of 16-07.00 by saying , " I want to get a chance at the state record , I think I have a chance at it , I have gotten that in practice before . " <p> Goolsby will be competing on the first day of the tournament , Friday June 2 , at 9:30a.m . <p> Austin Kimball <p> Kimball a junior will be competing with the boys 4+100-meter relay team at the tournament . The team has had a tremendous season on the track with several top finishes and great times throughout . <p> Kimball runs the first leg of the event and has helped enhance the teams overall ability to compete at higher levels and against stiffer competition . <p> This is Kimballs first year on the track team . When asked about his late entry into the sport Kimball said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to get bigger for football , but this year the coaches told me I could do more track to get more speed , so I did it to get more speed . " <p> Kimballs contribution to the team is undeniable and he has plans , regardless of the outcome at the tournament , to come back out for the team next year . <p> Coach Marsh said , " Kimball has really solidified our 4+100-meter team this year in his first year out . Before him we only had three sprinters , so his addition to the team has been tremendous . <p> Kimball had this to say about the teams chances of winning a state title , " I 'm just hoping we qualify for the finals . If we make the finals hopefully we can put together a good game-plan . " <p> The semi-finals for the boys 4+100-meter relay will be held on Friday at 2:55p.m. , and the finals for the event will be Saturday at 1:50p.m . <p> Jeremy Hayton <p> Hayton qualified for the 2017 Track and Field State Tournament after what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior on the track . Through hard work and dedication Hayton has transformed himself into one of the top athletes in the state and the results of his focus and determination have been on display for all to see . <p> Hayton , a senior who did not advance past the district tournament prior to this season , qualified for the boys high jump by posting a jump of 6-04 at the regional tournament held at Athens High School . Haytons highest jump of the outdoor track and field season was 6-06 . <p> Haytons string of success started in the winter during the indoor track and field season which saw him win the state title for the high jump and qualify for nationals on the strength of a 6-09 jump . <p> Hayton , regarding what has changed from last year to this year , said , " Last year , when everyone was leaving for regionals and I was n't with them , I came out here and started jumping and running a whole bunch . I got my diet in check , started lifting weights , doing plyometrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . " <p> Coach Marsh emphasized the work that Hayton has put in to get to this point saying , " Jeremy has stepped it up a notch . About a year ago he made up his mind that he was going to make himself the best athlete that he could be . He started working out , jumping , and running and making himself better . He really worked hard , any time you go from 6-00 to 6-09 that is a big jump for anyone . He did that all on his determination to get better . I cant say I had a lot to do with it , he just decided he was going to do what it takes to get better . " <p> When asked to compare Hayton to past athletes Marsh said , " There is no comparison . " <p> Hayton has supreme confidence in himself and said " I 'm pretty confident . When I was in indoor I did n't  worry at all , I was so calm and confident , that 's how I 'm going to go into the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have bad steps I end up making the jump most of the time , so I 'm real confident about that . If everything is perfect Im going to try and get a personal record that day . " <p> Marsh believes Hayton has a good chance to claim the state title and said , " Jeremy has stiff competition , the best jump going in is 6-05 . I believe he is the top in his event , he can win , he just has to put everything together . " <p> Hayton will be competing in the boys high jump on Saturday at 9:30a.m . <p> Luke Gallimore <p> Gallimore a senior will be competing as part of the boys 4+100-meter relay team .

@@121760450 @10760450/ <h> The undoing of OReilly by OReilly <p> Its difficult to conjure much in the way of a defense for Bill OReilly and his unceremonious dumping by Fox News . <p> If you knew nothing of OReilly other than what you have seen on television during the course of his two decades as host of " The OReilly Factor , " you would probably come away with the impression that while he presided over an interesting and provocative hour of TV each night , he was likely as arrogant and condescending off camera as on . <p> That impression also came across in person based on my one-time , limited exposure to him during the 2000 GOP convention in Philadelphia , where he was the featured speaker at an Ohio Republican Party breakfast and it was my job as communications director for the ORP to make sure he was comfortable and cozy . Need more coffee , Mr. OReilly ? <p> Bill was n't happy about having to be up so early to do the breakfast thing , and he made that clear . On the other hand , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one encounter . Even celebrities are allowed to have bad days , and frankly I was no happier about being up for the 7 a.m. breakfast than he was . <p> So I never let his less than warm-and-fuzzy attitude that day or his obvious ego and temperamental behavior define him forever in my mind . After all , I was working in state and national politics , where large egos and temperamental behavior are par for the course . <p> But that limited encounter hardly makes it more difficult to imagine OReilly being boorish and narcissistic on a regular basis . It may well be those attributes that allowed him to be a pretty tough interviewer and to call out guests who famously violated his " no spin zone " rule . <p> OReilly is smart and informed , and despite being obviously right-leaning he often did walk a more middle-of-the-road line than other more blatantly conservative and partisan Fox personalities . <p> While it is true that with great power comes great responsibility , it is also too often true that with great power comes great feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassment leveled at OReilly by women ranging from former on-air contributors to low-level staffers are legally unproven , but the millions of dollars in out-of-court settlements , as reported by The New York Times and not denied by anyone , do n't  exactly help paint OReilly as an innocent victim . <p> Big Media outlets like The Times , the Washington Post , and , on the TV side , CNN , have been openly gleeful for the opportunity to bring OReilly down . CNN was the first national cable news network , the granddaddy of them all , and CNN officials have never been happy that Fox so quickly , dramatically and consistently knocked them off the top perch for the last 16 or 17 years . <p> Fox hosts have never been shy about ridiculing CNN ( and MSNBC ) over ratings or content , and CNN in particular is more than happy to kick OReilly when he s down . <p> Fox did n't  care at all about the accusations against OReilly or the costs of the settlements ( some of which were apparently paid by Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Factor " was a huge cash cow . Not until advertisers began deserting OReilly did Fox have a sudden crisis of conscience . <p> To be fair , we have not heard OReilly really address the issue except with very vague statements focused on the perils of being in the public eye . We have not heard his side of the story , and its always important to remember that there are at least two sides , and usually more , to every story . Accusations can not be taken at face value ; there is always more information that can dramatically alter the first draft of conventional thinking . <p> Over the weekend it was announced that OReilly will begin hosting a podcast starting Monday . Perhaps hell have more to say about the subject , or maybe hell ignore it and take up where he left off on his last Fox broadcast , focusing on current events ( other than his own current events ) . <p> The only thing truly crystal clear through this experience is that the leftwing media is not at all abashed about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles in recent days have already pointed out the hypocrisy of much of the media that investigated and denounced OReilly compared to its defense and apologies for a former president of the United States who engaged in his own unique brand of intern mentorship during private time in the Oval Office . <p> But that double standard is so understood and expected as to be almost openly acknowledged by our most revered newspapers and TV networks . If OReilly was a liberal and a Trump-hater , wed be tuning into " The OReilly Factor " on Fox tonight at 8 p.m. as usual . <p> But OReilly should have been smart enough to recognize the playing field for what it is . The left was only able to bring him down because he gave them a sword . That 's something he apparently failed to recognize . <p> It could be he was blinded by his own hubris , which might be the OReilly factor that will end up being remembered above all others . 226139 @qwx1086139

Last I heard , more than 1,300 had come to pay their respects at a visitation service Friday evening at the Danville Church of Christ . <p> Terry was a young teacher at Lynchburg-Clay when I attended there . He and his wife , Gloria , were favorites of everyone who was fortunate to know them . I fondly recall hayrides at their farm that they would host for students .

Kip graduated from Whiteoak a couple of years before Lynchburg-Clay let me out , but his exploits as a baseball player were already legendary . Everyone in the region was proud of Kips accomplishments , and we all followed him closely when he pitched for the Detroit Tigers . <p> I played mens league basketball against Kip back in the day shortly after he quit baseball , and he was also an outstanding basketball player , with an amazing leaping ability for a guy 511 . He could easily dunk , which I envied , and had a good jump shot . <p> Last week we spoke for probably an hour or so , and I loved hearing more of his stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of which ended up in the article . Every so often he would start to tell a story and say , " Well , you 're probably not interested in that .

It was great catching up . <p> Incidentally , since that story appeared I 've heard from online readers in far flung places who were Detroit Tigers fans and who well remember the excitement over Kips early success with the Tigers in 1978 . He left a big impression on the fans . <p> Tornado coverage <p> Big thanks to Jim Lyle , director of the Highland County Emergency Management Agency , for his accessibility and for providing information in the immediate aftermath of last Wednesdays tornadoes . <p> Jim spent the rest of the week on the road all around the county , working with other officials to determine the extent of the damage , but he always took time to take my calls or call me back very soon . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , also much appreciated . <p> Its somewhat amusing to have to wait for an official determination as to whether a storm event like that represented a tornado or just high winds .

Could that be called trying to interfere in things like elections ? And were outraged that the Russians may have tried to influence the U.S. presidential election ? Its what governments do in regard to other countries , and , in the case of the United States , were pretty open about the fact that we do it , too . <p> There 's no evidence that anyone connected to Trump helped the Russians do anything . But that wont deter the media from creating smoke with no fire , even as they insert a kernel of truth in the middle of their hysterical stories . <p> For example , an online CNN story on Monday with the headline , " Trump and Russia : What the fallout could be , " included this paragraph buried in the middle of an otherwise salacious and damning recap of events : " Constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trump-Russia ties at this point . The fallout is far more likely to be political , and possibly within Trumps own Republican Party .

John was killed on Christmas Day in 2008 , when a mortar round struck near his living quarters in Mosul , Iraq . His wife and children never got to see him come home . <p> This Memorial Day weekend , let 's laugh and play . Let 's gather with our friends and family and celebrate the start of the season .

The grant was won last October one of just a handful of similar grants awarded across the United States and the implementation plan for the funds was approved just a couple of weeks ago . <p> As site coordinator , Winkle will be paid $75,000 a year for the next two years . Turning Point is contributing $15,000 a year toward that amount , and her role at Turning Point will be reduced to just one day a week while she focuses on the lake project . The money she is paid as site coordinator will represent her total pay for both overseeing the lake project and her Turning Point duties , she said . <p> Meanwhile , $263,500 in contracts will go to the Highland County Community Action Organization , including $197,500 to create , operate and fund a new land bank in the county , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake region , including onsite services . <p> Winkle sees the land bank as a main component necessary to acquiring and cleaning up areas of the lake that have fallen into blight or resulted in unattractive detriments to economic growth at Rocky Fork . <p> At least during the two-year life of the grant , the land bank funds must be targeted only to the lake region , said Winkle . In other Ohio counties , land banks have improved local economies through efforts such as rehabilitating distressed or abandoned properties by turning them into useful sites for office space , retail centers or recreation facilities , often by partnering with local hospitals , schools or other entities for community improvement projects . <p> Another salary-related part of the grant provides $38,000 a year for a full-time sheriffs deputy at the lake . On Thursday , Highland County Sheriff Donnie Barrera will participate in a ceremony at Rockhold-Brown Banks Northshore Drive location , where he will accept the keys to part of the bank building that will serve as a sheriff substation , along with the keys to a cruiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A key component of the grant is $90,356 set aside for a consultant to create an economic development plan for the lake . Winkle said the consultant has not yet been determined , but it will be " a professional firm specializing in economic development in rural areas . " She said " a couple of good candidates " are under consideration . <p> Winkle said that part of creating an economic development plan for the lake is agreeing on a shared vision and purpose for the lake region . <p> " Were fortunate to have a blank slate here , " she said . " Is it a sportsman or recreation destination ? A family vacation getaway ? " She said that just as important as identifying the positive attributes of the lake is avoiding the negative ones . <p> Winkle spent much of Tuesdays interview defending the role of non-profits in both the lake project and other areas , especially after comments by Hillsboro Mayor Drew Hastings were raised . At Mondays city council meeting , Hastings was critical of FRS Transportation and what he described as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often at odds with economic development goals of city planners . <p> Winkle had high praise for Julia Wise , the executive director of the local Community Action Organization , which will play a large role in the lake project . She said Hastings and others have a misconception that non-profits like CAO do n't  do enough to break the cycle of poverty and dependence . Hastings did not mention CAO by name on Monday . <p> " I do n't  know anyone who talks more about breaking the cycle than Julia , " said Winkle . But she said it was important to make the distinction between " situational poverty " and " generational poverty . " <p> Winkle serves on the CAO board , and said Wise operates one of " the most well-run and efficient non-profits . " She said Wise is " motivated by a passion to empower people , not keep people down . " When it comes to the cycle of poverty , " Julia is an outspoken advocate for changing that , " said Winkle . <p> She said CAO is perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as operating the new land bank , and it was CAOs involvement in the proposal that helped win the overall grant . <p> She said CAOs increased presence at the lake will lead to a healthier population , especially among children , and she also spoke up for FRS Transportation . She said that providing a means for lake residents to travel for employment purposes or attend doctor appointments is crucial , as well as the ability to grocery shop in Hillsboro because they will eat healthier than if their only option is " a frozen pizza " from a nearby convenience store . <p> Winkle said that addressing issues of poverty and crime are crucial to helping the Rocky Fork region turn its fortunes around . Her experience at Turning Point in helping people re-enter society has led her to understand the need to break old habits , she said . <p> " Its about peer association and the neighborhood they live in , " she said . " Who are they coming home to ? " She said that in developing the lake plan , project managers talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break certain cycles . <p> She said that in Hillsboro , 30 percent of the city lives in poverty , " and its roughly the same in the county . " She said the loss of DHL in Wilmington as a major employer and the general economic downturn of 2008 is still impacting the community , and " rural communities do n't  recover as quickly as others . " <p> She said the region is " fortunate to have non-profits that seek dollars that are not available to units of government . Without them , the local governments are on the hook . " <p> Winkle said , " Many taxpayers want less government and lower taxation . Non-profits are often supported wholly or partially through private donations , creating the situation whereby the government is not Big Brother , and people are voluntarily helping their fellow citizens .

Still , news of his passing was heartbreaking . Last I heard , more than 1,300 had come to pay their respects at a visitation service Friday evening at the Danville Church of Christ . <p> Terry was a young teacher at Lynchburg-Clay when I attended there . He and his wife , Gloria , were favorites of everyone who was fortunate to know them . I fondly recall hayrides at their farm that they would host for students . When you ran into him through the years , you were excited to talk with him and catch up . He always had a positive attitude , a caring heart , and a great sense of humor . <p> Terry was also one of the best Christian examples I have known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so , but because you watched how he lived his life . <p> Condolences to Gloria and their children , Becky , J.R . and Troy , and all his other family members .

Kip graduated from Whiteoak a couple of years before Lynchburg-Clay let me out , but his exploits as a baseball player were already legendary . Everyone in the region was proud of Kips accomplishments , and we all followed him closely when he pitched for the Detroit Tigers . <p> I played mens league basketball against Kip back in the day shortly after he quit baseball , and he was also an outstanding basketball player , with an amazing leaping ability for a guy 511 . He could easily dunk , which I envied , and had a good jump shot . <p> Last week we spoke for probably an hour or so , and I loved hearing more of his stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of which ended up in the article . Every so often he would start to tell a story and say , " Well , you 're probably not interested in that .

It was great catching up . <p> Incidentally , since that story appeared I 've heard from online readers in far flung places who were Detroit Tigers fans and who well remember the excitement over Kips early success with the Tigers in 1978 . He left a big impression on the fans . <p> Tornado coverage <p> Big thanks to Jim Lyle , director of the Highland County Emergency Management Agency , for his accessibility and for providing information in the immediate aftermath of last Wednesdays tornadoes . <p> Jim spent the rest of the week on the road all around the county , working with other officials to determine the extent of the damage , but he always took time to take my calls or call me back very soon . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , also much appreciated . <p> Its somewhat amusing to have to wait for an official determination as to whether a storm event like that represented a tornado or just high winds . Local residents had no doubt they were hit with a tornado . <p> " Trust me , it was a tornado , " one eyewitness assured us from one of the areas where one of the three tornadoes hit . Eventually , the National Weather Service agreed . <p> Good for the goose <p> Finally , with the manufactured hullabaloo over the Trump-Russia issue and the subject of Russias interference in U.S. elections , I came across an interesting tidbit about U.S. ambassadors . <p> On the United States diplomacy section of the U.S. State Department website , one of the roles of a public diplomacy officer stationed in a foreign country is described as follows : " Build mutual understanding and support for U.S. policies by reaching directly to publics in foreign countries working with traditional and social media ; websites ; educational , cultural and sports programs ; and all manner of people-to-people exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding and support for U.S. policies by reaching directly to publics in foreign countries working with traditional social media , websites " etc . <p> In other words , bypass the government and try to influence the people directly . Could that be called trying to interfere in things like elections ? And were outraged that the Russians may have tried to influence the U.S. presidential election ? Its what governments do in regard to other countries , and , in the case of the United States , were pretty open about the fact that we do it , too . <p> There 's no evidence that anyone connected to Trump helped the Russians do anything . But that wont deter the media from creating smoke with no fire , even as they insert a kernel of truth in the middle of their hysterical stories . <p> For example , an online CNN story on Monday with the headline , " Trump and Russia : What the fallout could be , " included this paragraph buried in the middle of an otherwise salacious and damning recap of events : " Constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trump-Russia ties at this point . The fallout is far more likely to be political , and possibly within Trumps own Republican Party . " <p> In other words , " We tried , but we cant come up with anything illegal , so well keep reporting it like its Watergate anyway , because if we keep doing that we can make the political fallout worse than the actual legal ramifications .

" <p> In the safety and service directors report , McKenzie said the city will now have to address buildings neighboring the site of the former Colony Theatre , which was torn down last week after it was found to have been structurally unsafe . McKenzie said the buildings are now open to the elements and may need repairs . <p> According to McKenzie , street paving on High Street will begin Sunday , Aug. 6 , and crews will do work overnight for 21 to 30 days in the northbound and southbound lanes . McKenzie said crews will also pave a section of SR 138 within city limits in coming weeks . <p> McKenzie also said letters have been sent to property owners affected by the North High Pathways Project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadline for the project is July 31 . <p> Hillsboro City Auditor Gary Lewis asked McKenzie when a new police chief will be installed , since Browder has been in the position on an interim basis for several months . <p> McKenzie said the administration has already begun discussion on the matter , and it will be further discussed in the Civil Service Committee at a later date . <p> During public comment , Jennifer Reed went before council complaining of an incident where she said the city mowed landscaping at her Johnson Street address without her permission , after which she was charged with obstruction of official business . Court records show the case was dismissed on the condition that Reed keep up her property . <p> Reed , who has appeared before council on the same issue several times , said she had been informed by Koogler that if she had new information on the matter , he would place the matter back into a committee for further discussion . <p> As Reed described the incident and following court case , Donley interjected . <p> " Youre rehashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal counsel recognized that the city was violating my property rights , " Reed said . " Your legal counsel recognized that the city was interpreting this ordinance " <p> " I 'm going to interrupt you , " Donley said . " Our attorney could not be here I 'm going to put this back in committee . " <p> McKenzie assured Reed the city would take no further action until the matter had been discussed further . <p> Reed also said the city should incorporate green space into plans for sidewalk projects . <p> " Something you might consider when you 're creating some aesthetic is to incorporate some native plants into some of those right-of-ways to where it does n't  require weekly mowing maintenance , " Reed said . " And look what theyve done in some places like Cincinnati and Columbus in creating these pollinator beds and the amount of upkeep that would be involved in that sort of thing , and it also might be an attraction feature for the city . " <p> " OK , maam , you 're excused , " Donley said . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and family members to thank the city for renaming Baker Street to Curtis Street . <p> Also Monday : <p> McKenzie said he learned it will be his decision whether or not to change the veterans memorial at Liberty Park , as several people have suggested the flagpoles be moved due to excessive vandalism . McKenzie said he would be in communication with the concerned parties to make a decision . <p> Council heard McKenzie say that making a number of alleys one-way is being explored , including the alley running alongside Downtown Drug , the one along Twenty-Four Exchange deli , and the alley running alongside Wandas Grill building which would be one-way headed east off North High Street . <p> Executive adminstrative assistant Debbie Sansone reported the Hillsboro Planning Commission further discussed a possible group housing development with representatives from the Board of Developmental Disabilities , and asked them to consider a different building site than one they proposed on North High Street . The commission also held a zoning hearing and approved sign variances . <p> In the Street and Safety Committee report , chairman Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , and commended the Hillsboro Police Department for maintaining security during the festivities . Harsha said the committee met recently , nixed a request to allow hunting within city limits , and recommended council form a parks and recreation committee .

@@121760557 @10760557/ <h> When Facebook takes control <p> My personal Facebook page barely exists . I do virtually nothing on it . However , that does n't  stop Facebook from sending messages about me . Such was the case over the weekend when Facebook decided to send out a notification that I had a birthday , encouraging my friends to send me birthday greetings . And so , they did . <p> It was very nice . At first , a few " Happy Birthday , Gary ! " messages came filtering through , which I knew because they showed up in my email . I began thanking the six or eight friends whose messages trickled in early . " Thanks , Larry ! " " Thanks Bob ! " " Thanks Cheryl ! " and so on ( exclamation points are required on Facebook messages lest you seem unenthusiastic ) . <p> Now I do know enough to know that when its someones birthday and they start receiving birthday wishes on Facebook , most people just say something at the end of the day like , " Thanks to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never asked someone to friend me on Facebook , and whatever friends I have on there are there because they have asked me to friend them , which I always do . So considering my limited level of engagement , I did n't  think I had too many friends on Facebook and , by comparison to most Facebook users , I do n't  . Therefore , I did n't  think that acknowledging every birthday wish individually would be too much of a problem ; plus , I 'm old-fashioned enough to think that if someone takes the time to say Happy Birthday , I should acknowledge that person . <p> But then my sister posted some pictures of me in regard to my birthday on her Facebook page , and " tagged " me . When someone tags you on Facebook , that means your life has come under someone elses control . My sister has a lot of Facebook friends , and naturally many of them are mutual friends or acquaintances ( in the traditional sense of friends and acquaintances , not the Facebook definition of friends ) . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the universe . <p> Since I had begun thanking people individually , I could n't stop now . I was already in too deep . How would it look if I had thanked the first 15 or 20 people who wished me Happy Birthday , one by one , but no one who came after ? It would look pretty darn inconsiderate , that 's how . <p> So I must have replied with up to 50 or so personal thank yous , and then caught myself thanking some people twice before I realized this was Facebooks evil plan to have its revenge on me by driving me insane . So I finally gave up . Facebook had defeated me , as I feared it would when it started its wicked scheme early on my birthday morning . <p> Back to the pictures posted by my dear , dear sister . She posted a couple of recent pics , then she decided to post a picture from a high school sports banquet in 1974 , which showed me wearing a pair of plaid bellbottoms , looking quite smug and sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and classmate Jamie Burton pointed out in a comment , I was quite proud of . <p> According to my daughter , when one of my granddaughters saw it she asked if Papaw was wearing pajamas , since she has a pair of pajamas that look very similar . No , Maddy , I was wearing a pair of very cool pants , which is verified by the fact that the same picture shows my basketball coach , Phil Blankenship , wearing a very similar pair of pants , and he was and is a very cool guy . So there . <p> ( The late Glenn Moberly , who was the reserve basketball coach at Lynchburg-Clay at the time , is the only one in the picture who was wearing something that was n't designed to cause blindness or insanity . ) <p> Sister Ann also posted a couple of pics of me at age 3 , one showing me laughing with my dog , Ranger , and I guess back then I did look kind of adorable in an innocent Opie sort of way before I discovered girls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be a law against other people posting pictures of you on Facebook without the express written consent of Major League Baseball , or something like that , and there should be a mild punishment along the lines of arrest , imprisonment and even torture , depending on the level of embarrassment connected to the picture . <p> It should also be illegal to tag people on Facebook who really do n't  understand how Facebook works , because it will drive them insane . <p> I was having dinner Friday night with one of my sons and my 5-year-old grandson , who really does look just like Opie , red hair and all , and I was messing with him as he was busy coloring the Frischs placemat , and I said , " Do you know its my birthday tomorrow ? " and he said , " Yeah , Daddy told me . " And I said , " Are you getting me a present ? " He hesitated , and finally said , " Nah , Daddy said there 's not a party . " And I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he shrugged and said , " Adults do n't  get presents . " <p> When you 're an adult with more than six decades behind you , the nicest presents of all are simple birthday wishes from friends , family and acquaintances , including those you have not spoken with in many , many years , and you find yourself strangely moved that they have taken the time to send along a birthday greeting , even if it took just a couple of seconds out of their day . It really was very nice to get them , unexpectedly . <p> But as the day ended and I thought everything was returning to normal , Facebook took one last shot , taunting me with a message that said , " We hope you had a great birthday , Gary ! here 's a video we made for you with some birthday posts from your friends . " It might as well have said , " We hope you had a great birthday , Gary ! We hope you understand now that you can not escape us ! We have taken control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want ! Sleep well ! " <p> My wife tells me that I can set my Facebook page not to notify people of my birthday , and , being old school , that is what I plan to do , mainly as part of my repudiation of Facebooks grand scheme to control our lives . Granted , that may not stop my sister from notifying people and posting pictures , and it remains a mystery why I thought she was so sweet when Mom and Dad brought her home from the hospital . <p> If you want to friend me or message me on Facebook , that 's great . Ill probably notice it within a few weeks . But please do n't  tag me . Its too much responsibility . <p> Gary Abernathy is publisher and editor of The Times-Gazette and can be reached at 937-393-3456 or by email at **27;580;TOOLONG

Route 35 intersection in Jeffersonville . <p> The proposal would place the second hub off Interstate 80 north of Ravenna in northeast Ohio . <p> State Rep.

According to the bill sponsors , some CEOs have opted to transfer their businesses to other states because of flight reductions . <p> Butler said this proposal would conveniently position these airport hubs regionally in southwest and northeast Ohio , servicing 4-6 million people living approximately an hour from each terminal . <p> The Fayette County commissioners were unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan Dean was contacted by the Record-Herald , he inquired about details and was sent a 31-page bill . <p> " It calls for the creation of a Southern Ohio Airport Authority , " said Dean .

One concern I have is I saw no mention of representation from Fayette County with the Port Authority . But they 're at the very beginning of it and it has a long way to go . " <p> During a press conference in Columbus , Butler said there is flat , dry available land in both Jeffersonville and Ravenna . <p> " Businesses from all over the country , many from Ohio , are moving their headquarters near major hub airports , taking good jobs with them , " Butler said . " Ohio currently does not have a major hub airport even though we have the population density to support two the size of Dallas/Fort Worth and Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating the most modern infrastructure in the country , drawing in thousands of well-paying jobs , and will create a huge surge of economic activity . " <p> A likely location for the proposed hub in Jeffersonville would be the 1,600-acre mega-site at the U.S. 35 and I-71 interchange . County officials have been working more than 15 years to bring in a significant business to the mega-site . The state of Ohio has certified it as the largest job-ready site in the state . <p> The centralized location allows for ease of access from all directions and draws available workforce from both rural and metropolitan communities to Fayette County , according to county officials . The shovel-ready site has water , sewer , natural gas , and electricity available and has the ability to extend rail service to the site from an adjacent property . <p> State Rep.

The proposed amendment , underlined on page 725 of the 3,512-page state budget , House Bill 49 , states that fifth-degree felony incarceration sentences with the exception of violent or sex offenses , or similar prior convictions must be served in a county and/or municipal facility , rather than at an Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction facility . If the budget is approved with the amendment included as is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Highland County Common Pleas Judge Rocky Coss told The Times-Gazette Friday that the amendment was included in the state budget because the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation will be handing out money to pick up the difference in local incarceration expenses . <p> Coss said he received communication from the ODRC saying it will offer $19 million the first fiscal year covered by the budget , and $39 million in the second . Locally , Coss said that equates to about $23 per day per inmate less than half the average daily cost of inmate housing in Highland County , which is about $55 . <p> " Sometimes , the only option I have is to put them in jail , sometimes for their own protection , " said Coss . " Under that proposal , the county is going to lose $32 a day to pay for that . " <p> Coss said he feels uncomfortable with the fact that there was no cost analysis involved in the amendment . <p> " I think its rather hasty to make a decision like this in a budget process , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its governed by a desire to get people out of the prison system to save the state money . <p> " If this were a separate or standalone proposal , the law requires that the bill have an actual analysis of the impact on the state or local governments , but when you get it into the budget bill , its not required , so there has been no fiscal analysis .

@@121760664 @10760664/ <h> On Fathers Day , promoting hope and stability <p> For many , Fathers Day brings a feeling of gratefulness . Its a time to think about dads and the powerful ways they influence their childrens lives for the better . Whether with wise advice , a listening ear or just a sense of humor when the chips are down , their example and guidance are significant in shaping the lives and futures of their children . <p> But Fathers Day also feels bittersweet , because it is a reminder of the many children in our community who are living without the presence of a father in their lives . <p> As a child support prosecutor , I am faced daily with the repercussions of rearranged families parents who no longer live in the same home , and children who rarely see their fathers . <p> The National Fatherhood Initiative reports one in three children live in a father-absent home . These children are four times as likely to live in poverty , seven times more likely to become pregnant as a teenager , twice as likely to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime and go to prison . <p> The incredible link between the absence of a parent and almost all societal ills is the impetus behind programs like the Ohio Commission of Fatherhood , which has helped Ohio become a national leader in encouraging and aiding fathers to be involved in their childrens lives . <p> In partnership with the commission , and with the help and support of our courts and child support enforcement agency , we have spent the past year developing a fatherhood initiative here in Clinton County . <p> During multiple meetings over the last year , we 've heard from agencies , schools , churches , and nonprofits who all want to help encourage responsible fatherhood in our area . This week , I will be submitting a proposal to the Ohio Commission on Fatherhood to create the position of a part-time fatherhood coordinator in Clinton County . We are among the first small counties in Ohio to launch a Fatherhood Initiative , and it is my hope that our neighboring counties such as Highland and Fayette will also benefit from having a fatherhood coordinator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that when fathers are stable , they are far more likely to support their children , both financially and emotionally . My hope and goal is that when fathers land in a difficult spot , we can come alongside them with hope and a helping hand . <p> On a small scale we want to at least connect parents with resources for the barriers they face : employment , transportation , treatment , counseling and legal help . <p> On a wider scale , we realize that even in the difficult case of a divorce or broken home , we can still pursue outcomes that are positive for the family , the children , and our society as a whole . Our purpose is to provide hope and promote stability by connecting dads with resources to help them be the best fathers they can be . <p> As a prosecutor , its my job to hold parents accountable and ensure that children receive the support they need . As a daughter , I recognize the profound role that a father can play in a childs life . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we work together to promote responsible fatherhood in our nation and here in Southern Ohio . <p> This Fathers Day is an opportunity to celebrate and thank the fathers and father figures in our lives .

@@121760670 @10760670/ <h> That darn cat scared me <p> As I gingerly crept down the stairs , the creature was waiting at the bottom . It sat up on its hind legs , bared its fangs and claws and hissed like something out of Africa . My plan had been to make Chaucey the cat go back outside where he normally resided . But when it became more than obvious that he was in no such mood , I quickly decided Chaucey could stay in the basement that night . <p> We inherited Chaucey many years ago shortly after we moved into a home on SR 124 that an aunt and uncle had lived in for several years . They tried to take Chaucey with them to their new home a handful of times , but each time he found his way back to his old home . So we had a cat . <p> Chaucey was an old , white Tom cat , and not what you would call friendly . In fact , for some reason he would have almost nothing to do with my wife or stepson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the mood struck him . <p> Earlier in his life Chaucey had been hit by a vehicle in front of the SR 124 home , which sat probably 10 yards or less from the road . He would roam the woods behind the house for days at a time , but he would not go close to the road where he nearly lost his life . In fact , he had a little path worn in front of the front porch , and he would go no closer to the road than that path ever . <p> It seemed strange because his jaunts into the woods would often last a week or two . Then hed show up with new wounds , would nurse himself back to health and stay around the house for a month or two , then would disappear on another adventure into the woods . <p> By the time the poor cat passed away it had no tail , no ears and a scarred face , which we could only assume were the result of fights when he was out on his adventures . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another piece of tail , with a slash across his face , or limping . He evidently kept fighting until he lost his ears and tail completely , and that was largely why I hightailed it back upstairs that night he looked like he was in the mood for another fight . <p> By that time Chaucey was not allowed in the house much . That 's because he once infected our home with fleas . And infected is an understatement . <p> A day or two before my wife was to leave for a friends wedding in California , we noticed a flea or two in the house . The day my wife left for the wedding we noticed there were more . So we went out and purchased some of those flea " bombs .

Not to mention mad at my wife , because it seemed that somehow , since she had abandoned us for California , it just had to her fault . Right ? And besides , she 's the one that suggested the worthless bombs . <p> That night we went upstairs to go to bed . There was no carpet upstairs , and as far as I could tell the fleas had not advanced that far yet . But each time I closed my eyes it seemed like every inch of my body was itching , and sleep was not possible . So we packed up late at night and sought relief at my parents home . <p> We called the exterminator the next day and the fleas were quickly gone .

That 's where the cat stayed at night by then . For a couple minutes we could n't figure out what it was , because it sounded like nothing we had ever heard before . But after listening a while longer , I looked at my stepson and said , " Shane , I think that 's Chauceys death chant . " <p> Sure enough , we found Chaucey dead on the porch the next morning . <p> At first , between the chants from the evening beforehand that one night in the basement I was afraid to touch the thing , thinking it might spring to life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried him to the woods and put him to rest where he seemed most at home . <p> That was many years ago . <p> Now we have a really cool , black Tom cat .

@@121760687 @10760687/ <h> Will Hillary concede the election ? <p> While Donald Trump is the one who endlessly gets asked the question , let 's be honest , the candidate most likely not to accept the results of the presidential election is Hillary Clinton , should she come out on the losing side . <p> If Donald Trump is declared the winner on the evening of Nov. 8 , can anyone really imagine Hillary stepping in front of the cameras and microphones , conceding the election , congratulating Trump and wishing him well ? <p> Uh , no . <p> No , if Trump wins , what we can expect from the Clinton campaign with its water carried by most of the national mainstream media are endless allegations of voter suppression , shenanigans in minority precincts , interference by the Russians , and improprieties by Republican secretaries of state and other GOP election officials . Those claims will be substantiated by the New York Times , Washington Post , and all the broadcast TV networks , all of whom will offer " facts " backing up Clintons allegations . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Trump is victorious , the national mainstream media and the Clinton campaign will encourage the Trump electors in each state remember , when we vote on Election Day , we are voting for presidential electors , not the candidates themselves to become " faithless electors " and instead cast their votes for Hillary , because Trump is simply too dangerous . Such arm-twisting happened to Bush electors in 2000 . <p> On the other hand , if Clinton wins and Trump is the one contesting the results , he will be denounced by those same news outlets as a threat to the peaceful transfer of power . Regardless of your political affiliation or who you support in this election , you have to acknowledge the truth in how the media would treat each eventuality . <p> A Trump victory is still a real possibility , despite efforts to imply that the election is over . As of Oct. 22 , at least three respected polls had Trump leading or tied with Clinton nationally . According to Real Clear Politics , IBD/TIPP had Trump up 2 , Rasmussen had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tie . Many other polls showing Clinton with the lead are within the margin of error , including the Economist and Reuters polls . <p> Of course , state by state results are what matter , and we are all witnessing , two weeks out , the propagandizing of a Hillary landslide , with traditionally Republican states going to Hillary . Along with the NeverTrump Republicans and other GOP candidates who have lately turned their backs on Trump and who , in so doing , would be largely responsible for electing Hillary , they hope its a self-fulfilling prophecy . <p> The polls will continue to fluctuate , but this race wont be over until Election Day , and the results will likely not be accepted until well after Nov. 8 , no matter who is ahead when the first round of counting ends . <p> The Bush-Gore contest in 2000 set the precedent for contesting results . Al Gore refused to concede on Election Night 2000 , leading to a court battle that , to this day , has many claiming that George W. Bush was " selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates in the last 16 years have refused to concede on Election Night , both of them Democrats Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 . <p> So why does the media contort themselves into pretzels when Trump says hell wait and see whether he accepts the results on Nov. 8 ? <p> For the same reason they devote 5 to 10 times the amount of print and airtime to unsubstantiated allegations from women who have emerged as much as 30 years later to claim that Trump touched them or kissed them without their consent , compared to much more solid evidence that Hillary sold access to foreign powers through Clinton Foundation donations , illegally deleted tens of thousands of emails after they were subpoenaed by Congress , and hired paid agitators to cause violence at Trump rallies . <p> Its not difficult to believe that Donald Trump has acted inappropriately toward women , since he bragged about it to Billy Bush in a now infamous taped conversation . What 's impossible to believe is that his victims only now became spontaneously motivated to come forward . Can we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party and their media allies have been planning the October revelations since the summer of 2015 ? <p> If you despise Donald Trump on a personal level , that 's understandable . But what you have to concede is that there 's not a phony bone in his body . Trump is who he is , without apology , demonstrating it time after time against the wishes of his own campaign strategists . Not since the days of Wilt Chamberlain endlessly holding the ball in the low post has everyone been breathlessly waiting for someone to eventually pivot . But Trump , like Wilt , thinks he knows best and ignores his coaches . <p> Trump will be Trump . He may be obnoxious , but he is about as open and real as anyone who has ever run for president . Hillary , by comparison , couldnt be more carefully wrapped and packaged if she came with a child-proof cap . What Trump supporters like most is that he is someone who is the opposite of a poll-tested candidate with a focus-group message . If he loses , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Its likely that on Election Night no one will be able to conclusively report who won the presidency , because neither side is likely to concede it . The U.S. Supreme Court should be on high alert , because the election is almost certainly coming its way . <p> If that happens because Trump has been declared the winner , we will be told that Hillary is doing the right thing on behalf of the nation . If it happens because Hillary wins and Trump challenges the outcome , we will be told that Trump is a sore loser and a threat to democracy . The talking points are already prepared , either way .

@@121760692 @10760692/ <h> He went out doing what he hated <p> I was thinking about this because over the weekend I read a story online about a man from Australia who passed away at age 68 , and his loved ones said they took comfort because he " died doing one of the things he loved the most in the world , taking photos of birds in beautiful bushland with his wife and friends " <p> This is a common sentiment when someone we know and love passes away suddenly . If they happen to leave this earth in the middle of doing something they loved to do , it often serves as a comforting thought . " He died doing what he loved . " I 've said the same thing many times over the years . <p> But , speaking for myself , I would prefer to die doing something that I hate . If I died doing something that I love , I think I 'd be pretty upset that I did n't  get to finish it . <p> There are things I really hate to do . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  rake them , but I usually regret it when spring rolls around . So if you ever hear that I dropped dead raking leaves , you should think to yourself , " At least he died doing something that he hated . " <p> Same for shoveling snow . Since we all have to die sometime , I 'd much rather die shoveling snow from my driveway than , say , sitting in my recliner with a bowl of M&amp;Ms watching the NBA Playoffs . Dying while doing something that you hate gives you the worlds greatest excuse for not finishing the job . <p> As I 've mentioned before , I hate long meetings . Whether I 'm a participant in the meeting or covering it for the newspaper , any meeting that goes longer than an hour is , in my opinion , a failed meeting . So if I 'm in a meeting and it goes into the second hour and I happen to drop dead , anyone who cares should console themselves by saying , " He was probably happy because he did n't  have to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  get me wrong . I 'd like to live to be about 110 . Or more . I have no desire to die whether doing something I love , something I hate , or something I 'm ambivalent about . But we all have to go sometime . Death and taxes , you know . So it just seems to me that the more fortunate circumstance would be dying in the middle of doing something you really hate to do . <p> Of course , its not always possible to know whether someone was doing something they loved or hated when they expired . For instance , I love playing basketball . About six years ago I ruptured my Achilles tendon playing basketball , and I decided I was getting too old to play anymore , at least when it comes to all-out competitive games . <p> But I still like to go out once in a while and just shoot on a basket in my backyard you know , just stand-still foul shots , maybe a game of HORSE , nothing strenuous . Sometimes I still have a hot streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes with my back to the basket and still swish every shot . When that happens , I am truly doing something that I love . <p> Other times I cant hit the side of a barn . I cant make a foul shot . Even layups roll off the rim . This is when I do what I have always done curse at the basketball . <p> When I was young growing up on the farm practicing by myself and had bad shooting days , I would sometimes get so mad that I would throw or kick the basketball as far as I could send it . <p> This was not logical , because I did not have an endless supply of basketballs at hand , and there was no one but me to go traipsing across the yard or the field to retrieve it . <p> But trudging a long distance to retrieve the basketball gave me time to cool down , and then I would spend the walk back to the court calmly talking to the basketball , but sternly warning it that it had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse consequences , possibly including deflation or puncturing . This usually worked . <p> So the point is , if I dropped dead shooting baskets by myself , it would really be impossible for anyone else to know whether I died doing something that I loved or something that I hated . It would all depend on whether I was having a good shooting day or not . I would rather die having a bad shooting day . If I was swishing every shot , I 'd hate for that hot streak to abruptly end . <p> Most people agree that the absolute best way to leave this earth is to die peacefully in your sleep . Maybe , but I think that depends on what you have planned for tomorrow . Collecting that $10 million jackpot from the state lottery ? Not great timing . Raking leaves ? Good to go . 226139 @qwx1086139

He provided statistics this week from 2016 on 50 fatalities he investigated last year that he deemed suspicious , or at least unusually odd or interesting . <p> Beery said there has been a steady increase in deaths related one way or another to drugs , raising fatalities connected to illicit drugs to alarming proportions . He said the word " epidemic " is not sufficient to describe the toll being taken on Highland County . <p> " Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding that " epidemic " implies something beyond peoples control . <p> The 50 cases provided by Beery from 2016 range from deaths by car crashes , burns , gun shots , heart attacks , hyperthermia and suicides to asphyxia and embolisms . But most of them have a common denominator , he said the presence of drug use , or a history of drug use . <p> At least eight cases out of the 50 cited by Beery include marijuana as a factor contributing to the fatalities , in his opinion . Six fatalities were connected to heroin , three to cocaine , eight to amphetamines , including methamphetamine , and several to drugs like Xanax , Valium , Clonazepam and , especially , Fentanyl , which has been increasingly found mixed with heroin . <p> Beery blames a lax attitude by society and particularly by elected officials , including at the state and federal level , for contributing to the rise in drug-related deaths . He said former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holders decision not to pursue marijuana charges at the federal level " opened the door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently expressed views on marijuana that were opposed to treating the drug as seriously as other narcotics . In a 2016 PBS interview , after he was no longer attorney general , Holder said , " Its hard for me to imagine ever decriminalizing crack cocaine , drugs like that . But the whole question of should marijuana be decriminalized , I mean , that 's a conversation I think that we should engage in . " <p> Beery is aware of the fierce pushback among many people and organizations to his stand on marijuana . Groups like the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) whose mission is " to move public opinion sufficiently to legalize the responsible use of marijuana by adults , and to serve as an advocate for consumers to assure they have access to high quality marijuana that is safe , convenient and affordable , " according to its website have won referendums and convinced legislatures to at least legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes . <p> Many patients suffering from certain serious illnesses or chronic pain insist that marijuana is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marijuana has no medicinal qualities . He blames Ohios Republican-led " so-called conservative " legislature for caving in on the medical marijuana issue , even though the consequences of marijuana use and cultivation are obvious , especially in southern Ohio , he said . <p> " Just look at Pike County , " said Beery , referring to the murders last year of the Rhoden family , where a large marijuana growing operation worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on the street was found . <p> Beery said a lax attitude about border security and drugs also contributes to the problem . <p> Beery said that while investigating deaths in recent years , " I would see other things , " ranging from marijuana to heroin to cocaine that , to him , were obvious contributors not just to overdoses but to car wrecks , gun shots , homicides , burns and suicides . <p> Beery has high praise for Highland County Prosecutor Anneka Collins and her decision to pursue two overdose deaths as involuntary manslaughter cases , going after the people who allegedly supplied the deceased with the drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marijuana last for weeks . But more than that , " it sucks at the soul , " said Beery , and causes people to lose their will to improve their spiritual lives or turn their lives around . He said his experience shows that coming off marijuana , along with other drugs , leads to violent behavior when people are " in the throes of seeking more . " <p> Beery said that lives that could otherwise be purposeful and constructive are being lost at a frightening pace . He said he investigated two fatal overdoses on Thursday alone that happened almost simultaneously , one in Hillsboro , being investigated by the Hillsboro Police Department , and the other near Berrysville , being probed by the Highland County Sheriffs Office . <p> " They probably happened at the same time , " said Beery , speculating that the same drug source could be responsible . <p> Beery said he works closely with local law enforcement , emergency medical responders , funeral homes , medical professionals and others to conduct his investigations , and praised the cooperation he receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his positions might change their minds if they saw what he sees on a regular basis .

Does that prove " success " as opposed to other routes our government could have taken that might have saved even more lives , or that might have actually made a dent in the proliferation of such behavior ? <p> No one disagrees today that the heroin , meth and overall illegal drug problem here and across much of the U.S. have grown to epidemic proportions .

" Terrorism " is really not too strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria emerged showing children , including infants , dying from the chemical weapons attack unleashed by dictator Bashar al-Assad .

The babys parents are charged with child endangering . You no doubt read about the mother who passed heroin to her incarcerated son at the London Correctional Institute via an open-mouth kiss . You probably heard about the seven inmates in Fayette County who overdosed on one recent day . You saw where Paint Creek EMTs responded in March to 45 overdose calls , compared to 12 in March 2016 . <p> Portsmouth has long been ground zero in this region for heroin and other opioid terrorism .

It crossed the doorstep , and its in our house . All the government programs , all the well-meaning efforts supported by government leaders of both parties , did not work . It is time to declare them failed . <p> In Portsmouth , many officials with whom I met did not think it was unreasonable to send in the National Guard to police the streets and round up the pushers , the terrorists . <p> I am not from the school of thought that says we should just let drug abusers die .

I have no issue with the general public being able to purchase Narcan under a controlled and monitored system . <p> But the free distribution of Narcan by a government agency no matter how many warnings or anti-drug encouragements come with it sends this message more loudly than any other : " We know you are going to be using heroin , so when you do , here 's a free rescue kit . " Its like a parent telling is son not to exceed the speed limit , but installing a radar detector for him so he can avoid the cops when he does . <p> We fight drugs on the fringes with typical government thinking instead of attacking it for the terrorist assault that it is .

Because Joe seemed almost larger than life , so big and strong that it kind of seemed he would defy death . <p> I never knew Joe all that well , but he was always around . He was there when I was a little kid , following my dad to Sunday afternoon basketball gatherings where he and Joe both played .

That 's where I first met Joe and Arlenes oldest son , Jon . <p> How could we have known back then that we would became high school teammates in basketball and track , and lifelong friends ? Little did we know that the precedent had already been set . <p> Jon is a year younger than me , in the same Hillsboro High School class of 1980 as my brother Brent .

After the match , a massive man came after me , obviously intent on teaching me a lesson . But Joes brother , Larry , about half the other mans size , stepped between us and saved my hide .

We finished the year 1-18 , albeit against likely as tough of a schedule as any Hillsboro team ever faced . Anyway , probably because the rest of us where not as talented as Jon and he was frustrated with losing , he decided to quit after one game . As the process was playing out , big Joe showed up in our locker room , and he did not look happy . Things suddenly turned quiet , then Joe boomed the words " boy " toward his son .

It was built between 1842 and 1844 by Christopher Arthur for Peter Leake Ayres , a native of Jamestown , Va . <p> After several different owners , the home was purchased in 1882 by Joseph Gaskill . During this time , the building went through many changes including the addition of rooms , closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class hotel named the Highland House . In 1889 , Samuel Parsons Scott and his sister , Jane , purchased the property as an investment . At that time Cary T.

Under their management , the Highland House became famous for its food with not only travelers , but the townspeople who came out every Sunday for a traditional family meal . <p> The Highland House changed hands again in 1964 when Helen Boyd purchased the property . Two years later , the newly formed Highland County Historical Society was able to purchase the Highland House from the Boyd estate . <p> Now , 15 rooms and four wide halls are arranged to recreate the past .

The explosion in foster care costs must be paid for . The current revenue from the existing Children Services levy does not , nor was it intended , to cover the number of children now ending up in foster care . If more funds are not provided through an additional levy , the money will come instead out of the countys General Fund , severely hurting other county services , including law enforcement . <p> It appears that the county has responsibly asked voters to approve a levy that is no more than what is actually needed .

The other , Issue 7 , is a 1-mill , 10-year additional levy for the Paint Valley Alcohol , Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services program costing $35 for every $100,000 of evaluation . While a strong argument can be made for Issue 7 , we can not ask Highland County residents to support both levies in the same year . <p> No one wants to pay higher taxes .

The last of the 88 forming districts was Lucas County in 1963 . <p> On a state level , the supervisors of Highland , Clark and Butler counties met in September of 1943 to form an association to represent the interests of all the supervisors in the state . They met , adopted by-laws and formed The Ohio Federation of District Supervisors , now known as The Ohio Federation of Soil and Water Conservation Districts . <p> That private organization formed for the purpose of representing all district supervisors and guiding the formation and evolution of Soil and Water Districts in Ohio . The conservation problem here in Ohio and the Corn Belt was not the wind erosion that had so dramatically defined the problems of the Dust Bowl across Americas Great Plains .

In Ohio , the first two pilot projects were the Upper Hocking in Fairfield County and Rocky Fork in Highland County , as Highland County was again leading the way in Ohio . <p> That Rocky Fork Watershed Project brought Tom Parry here as the federal district conservationist for Highland County .

Highland County was surveyed from 1963 through 1968 , and the document was printed in 1977 . These surveys represent perhaps the most intensive study of the land and the soils that has ever been undertaken . Soil surveys provided the basis for all land disturbing activities and fertilization for crop production .

No-till was not an easy step for agriculture to adopt , but as chemicals and equipment refinements continue , farmers have been able to increase yields and reduce input costs to the benefit of the land in reduced soil erosion . <p> David Parry said that in 1986 Highland County was awarded the State Conservation Farmer , the top no-till corn yield and the top no-till soybean yield in the state . <p> These were significant accomplishments from a southern Ohio County . <p> Perhaps the single greatest advancement in private land conservation was the passing of the 1985 Food Security Act ( Farm Bill ) as it was dominated by conservation provisions and led to many tools still in use to day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land would be considered highly erodible land . <p> The act created the Conservation Reserve Program and increased the public commitment to help agriculture protect lands for future generations .

" It just means our city is a more valuable asset . We did major improvements , and our city is more valuable . " <p> Hastings said he believes there were several contributing factors , mainly involving infrastructure projects and the citys aggressive pursuit of grant money . <p> " Most of that was due to us doing infrastructure projects , including roads , " he said . " Part of the reason we had such an improvement is that we were very aggressive on grants and making sure we had matching funds for available grants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position where we have a lot more cash and a lot more money so when opportunities come along , were better poised to take advantage of them .

@@121760841 @10760841/ <h> Hillsboro facing decision on Paint Creek relationship <p> The reason the city of Hillsboro has a contract with the Paint Creek Joint EMS/Fire District instead of belonging to the district as a member like everyone else is because of a law that said fire and ambulance districts could have no more than nine members . That quota was filled by the time Hillsboro City Council voted in 2013 to disband Hillsboro Fire &amp; Rescue in favor of coverage by Paint Creek . <p> Those entities that have joined the district as members the village of Greenfield , along with the Highland County townships of Madison , Paint , Liberty , New Market , Washington and Jackson , and the Ross County townships of Buckskin and Paint have all done so under a scenario that results in an additional 5.5 mill property tax . That 's the price of admission to become a member of the district . Hillsboros contract of $570,000 or so a year with Paint Creek was calculated based on the amount that would be collected if the property tax was imposed on the city . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greenfield village council and a trustee from each of the eight townships that belong to the district . Since 2014 , Hillsboro City Council has always had a non-voting member on the board , first Lee Koogler , currently Dick Donley . Hillsboros representative on the board can participate in discussions and offer opinions , but can not vote . <p> With little to no fanfare , though , the law that limited the members of a fire and ambulance district in Ohio changed in December . There are now no limits , meaning Hillsboro is eligible to join . <p> Hillsboros current contract with Paint Creek runs through December of this year . Both Paint Creek and Hillsboro city officials by and large agree that they would prefer that Hillsboro be a full-fledged voting member of the district when the current contract expires . <p> here 's where the fun begins . If Hillsboro City Council passes a resolution to join the district ( and the Paint Creek board accepts , which has to happen , too ) , the result will be that city property owners will pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities that join the district . <p> And under the law specifically related to fire and ambulance districts , all it takes is a resolution by city council . A ballot issue is not required , and a citizen referendum to repeal the tax is not permitted . Back in 2013 , I interviewed an attorney with the office of general counsel for the state tax department for a story on Paint Creek , and she verified all that . <p> County auditor Bill Fawley said in the past that the millage actually collected is closer to 5.2 mills rather than 5.5 because of a somewhat complicated mathematical formula ( well , to be honest , all mathematical formulas are pretty complicated to me ) , but the bottom line results in an extra property tax of about $173 a year for every $100,000 of valuation . <p> In years past , there were some on council who suggested that even though council is charged with deciding whether to join or not , they would still put the matter on the ballot since it will raise property taxes . Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is not really fair since non-property owners get to vote on it , too ) . But a ballot issue to raise property taxes by 5.5 mills in Hillsboro would almost certainly go down to defeat , especially because some would argue , hey , well still have fire and EMS coverage by doing more contracts using existing city general fund money , as we 've been doing all along . <p> So rather than waste everyones time , just have the same courage that was exhibited by trustees in the townships who voted to join over the last four or five years and thereby imposed the tax on their property owners and took the heat for it . Or , just vote to do more contracts . Either way , city council should not abdicate the responsibility to make the decision . <p> The good news is , the city has 10 more months to figure out which way to go . But if city council does end up voting to join the district under the traditional arrangement as everyone else who is covered by Paint Creek , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra unencumbered $570,000 a year or so in its General Fund . <p> Unless , of course , you buy into the argument that was made frequently back in 2013 , especially by Hillsboro firefighters , that a four-tenths of one percent income tax that was passed back in 1978 was specifically for fire coverage , and if its not being used for fire coverage anymore , it should be rolled back . <p> I addressed this subject at length in a 2013 column , where I noted that back in 1978 , Hillsboro voters did indeed pass , by a vote of 564-451 , a tax increase of four-tenths of one percent . The ballot language said the tax hike was for " the support of the life squad and other municipal purposes for the City of Hillsboro . " But the 1978 tax was repealed and replaced by another narrowly-approved tax increase in 1986 , which is the last time the city income tax was hiked . <p> According to the ballot language , the new 1986 tax hike of one-half of one percent that repealed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general municipal operations , maintenance , new equipment , extension and enlargement of municipal services and facilities , and capital improvements of the city . " There was no mention of the fire department or the life squad in the ballot language , and looking back at news coverage at the time it is clear that the tax hike was designed to be spent for any and all city needs . <p> Considering there has not been an income tax hike in Hillsboro in more than 30 years , despite the cost of everything going up , city leaders would have a pretty good argument against rolling back any portion of the city income tax even if the city no longer has to pay for a Paint Creek contract . Instead , the mayor and others will likely make the case that the extra half-million dollars a year will greatly enhance the citys ability to pave more streets and engage in more all-round infrastructure improvements and blight removal .

If they do , " children will tell you a lot . They want the guidance and security . " <p> Stroop joined the United States Air Force just a couple of weeks after his graduation from Lynchburg-Clay High School in 1985 . He served with the Air Force security police for nearly a decade . When he was ready to leave the Air Force , he applied for a job with the Highland County Sheriffs Office . <p> Stroop recalls that in January 1995 his Air Force service ended one day at midnight , and then-sheriff Tom Horst " called at 8 a.m. the next morning " to offer him a job . <p> Stroop joined the sheriffs office as a corrections officer , moving to road patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the post in 2006 , Ron Ward , who was sheriff by then , asked Stroop if he wanted to step in . <p> Stroop did n't  hesitate .

He said youngsters who attended DARE courses often approach him and pull their DARE cards out of their pockets or wallets to show him they still carry them . He said at one memorable DARE graduation ceremony , a girl came across the stage to receive her certificate , and as Stroop extended his hand , the student shook her head , instead opening her arms to give him a big hug . <p> He said the girls father had died of an overdose , and she had never been able to discuss it openly until she attended the DARE program . <p> In addition to teaching students about the dangers of drugs and alcohol , he often speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Tuesday , he did a presentation at Weastec . <p> As Stroop prepares to step down he hopes to keep working occasionally as a special deputy his service is being recognized not only locally but across the state .

The award is named in honor of a DARE officer in Chillicothe who was killed during a robbery in April , 2005 . <p> Before becoming a DARE officer , and even in later years when schools were not in session , Stroop spent countless hours on road patrol often dealing with dangerous situations .

Sheriff Donnie Barrera said Tuesday the challenge is to find another officer interested in taking on the program , along with figuring out whether school resource officers who are becoming more of a fixture in local schools can fill the role . <p> When he became sheriff in January 2015 , Barrera took DARE from a part-time to a full-time program . At the time he said , " With the drug epidemic you 've got to have education . " Barrera said Stroop has been the ideal DARE officer . <p> " Weve been friends for years , " said Barrera , adding , " I trained him for the road .

Hillsboro , Greenfield and Lynchburg-Clay currently have them , and their duties not only include providing security , but also mentoring , counseling and serving as positive role models and youth advocates . Barrera said the trend toward in-school resource officers might fulfill the role that has long been filled by a DARE officer . <p> But the sheriff said a final decision is yet to be made . <p> " Right now were just trying to figure out what to do , " he said .

I quickly said , No thank you and excused myself from dinner " <p> The student continued , " DARE has helped me in more than just saying no . It has helped me know that its ok to be you , that you do n't  need to be ashamed of yourself It taught me that I am beautiful no matter what the world tells me . It taught me that I can be whoever I make myself . I can be a straight A student , perfect attendance , and Honor Roll . I can be on the National Juniors Honors Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love being me and love my life . " <p> Letters like that are not uncommon . Stroop said teachers and law enforcement officials are often the most trusted people in the lives of children who do not have positive home environments . <p> " Lots of parents do n't  take the time to listen , " said Stroop . If they do , " children will tell you a lot . They want the guidance and security . " <p> Stroop joined the United States Air Force just a couple of weeks after his graduation from Lynchburg-Clay High School in 1985 . He served with the Air Force security police for nearly a decade . When he was ready to leave the Air Force , he applied for a job with the Highland County Sheriffs Office . <p> Stroop recalls that in January 1995 his Air Force service ended one day at midnight , and then-sheriff Tom Horst " called at 8 a.m. the next morning " to offer him a job . <p> Stroop joined the sheriffs office as a corrections officer , moving to road patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the post in 2006 , Ron Ward , who was sheriff by then , asked Stroop if he wanted to step in . <p> Stroop did n't  hesitate . He had helped raise money for the program in the past , and , " I liked working with kids , " he said . <p> Stroop said the impact DARE has had is evident in a number of ways . He said youngsters who attended DARE courses often approach him and pull their DARE cards out of their pockets or wallets to show him they still carry them . He said at one memorable DARE graduation ceremony , a girl came across the stage to receive her certificate , and as Stroop extended his hand , the student shook her head , instead opening her arms to give him a big hug . <p> He said the girls father had died of an overdose , and she had never been able to discuss it openly until she attended the DARE program . <p> In addition to teaching students about the dangers of drugs and alcohol , he often speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Tuesday , he did a presentation at Weastec . <p> As Stroop prepares to step down he hopes to keep working occasionally as a special deputy his service is being recognized not only locally but across the state . Stroop , who served a term as president of the DARE Association of Ohio , was recently notified that he will be honored as the 2016-17 Larry R. Cox DARE Officer of the Year by DARE Ohio . The award is named in honor of a DARE officer in Chillicothe who was killed during a robbery in April , 2005 . <p> Before becoming a DARE officer , and even in later years when schools were not in session , Stroop spent countless hours on road patrol often dealing with dangerous situations . He recalls being shot at , and dealing with violent episodes as part of various drug busts . <p> " I just thank God I made it this far , " he said . <p> Stroop and his wife , Richele , are the parents of two sons , A.J. , who is graduating this year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basketball scholarship , and Gavin , who will be a sophomore next year at Lynchburg . <p> With Stroops retirement , the future of the DARE program , which began in 1983 , is uncertain . Sheriff Donnie Barrera said Tuesday the challenge is to find another officer interested in taking on the program , along with figuring out whether school resource officers who are becoming more of a fixture in local schools can fill the role . <p> When he became sheriff in January 2015 , Barrera took DARE from a part-time to a full-time program . At the time he said , " With the drug epidemic you 've got to have education . " Barrera said Stroop has been the ideal DARE officer . <p> " Weve been friends for years , " said Barrera , adding , " I trained him for the road . " <p> He said Stroop will be missed for his contributions , his sense of humor , and " just being Bobby . " <p> A state grant has paid part of the DARE officers salary each year . Barrera said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the state was missed because an officer has to be attached to the grant application , and it had not been decided who would replace Stroop . But the sheriff said he attended a meeting in Columbus on Tuesday and thinks its still possible to obtain the funding . <p> But schools are increasingly utilizing their own resource officers , who are usually local police officers or special sheriffs deputies who are shared with school districts . Hillsboro , Greenfield and Lynchburg-Clay currently have them , and their duties not only include providing security , but also mentoring , counseling and serving as positive role models and youth advocates . Barrera said the trend toward in-school resource officers might fulfill the role that has long been filled by a DARE officer . <p> But the sheriff said a final decision is yet to be made . <p> " Right now were just trying to figure out what to do , " he said .

Hastings said this week it is wrong for the city to continue paying Wilkin . <p> Safety and Service Director Todd Wilkin apparently remains on the city payroll despite his firing in November by Mayor Drew Hastings , and the city is taking steps to arrange for an outside hearing officer to preside over Wilkins challenge of his dismissal . <p> " He s still being paid as far as I know , " said Fred Beery , the city law director , on Monday . Beery painted the decision to continue paying Wilkin in terms of a procedural step to limit the citys legal exposure in anticipation of a claim by Wilkin against the city . He said he could not offer much in the way of public comment on the situation , especially since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . <p> " No one is doing anything without full disclosure , we just cant discuss it very openly right now , " said Beery . <p> Hastings fired Wilkin on Nov. 22 , about two weeks after a jury acquitted the mayor on felony charges in a trial in which Wilkin was a key witness . <p> Hastings said Monday he is " vehemently opposed " to Wilkin continuing to be paid . Hastings has consistently said that Wilkins firing was within his purview , and others should not have become involved . On Monday , he said it was his understanding that Wilkin would only be paid through the end of 2016 , and while he disagreed with that , he was willing to accept it since council seemed to favor it . <p> But now , he said , the city is paying both Wilkin as well as Stantec Engineering , a firm Hastings has engaged under a short-term contract to handle city service issues , meaning that a total of about $14,000 a month is being expended " for SSD pay , " according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual salary of $74,000 . <p> Hastings said he has called for a special council meeting this week to address the issue . He said he does not believe council has a full understanding of events occurring behind the scenes . <p> " We are going to be hyper transparent , said Hastings . " Something smells . There are a lot of unanswered questions . " At its regular January meeting last week , council adjourned into executive session for nearly 40 minutes , presumably to discuss the Wilkin situation . <p> Wilkin has retained the firm of Freking , Myers &amp; Reul to represent him , and his attorneys notified the city in December that Wilkin is appealing his dismissal on the grounds that he qualifies as a whistleblower . <p> In their letter notifying the city of Wilkins appeal , his attorneys stated that Beery told Wilkin in an email , " Rest assured , as Lee ( Koogler ) and I have explained to you , your status as a whistle blower is accepted and acknowledged .

Since Wilkin was the safety and service director and Hastings is the subject of Wilkins appeal , an independent hearing officer from outside the city is being arranged , Koogler , the council president , confirmed Monday . <p> Government offices were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr . holiday , and city Auditor Gary Lewis did not respond to text and voice messages left on his cell phone . 226139 @qwx1086139 <p> Mayor Drew Hastings , left , and former Safety and Service Director Todd Wilkin are pictured at what turned out to be Wilkins final council meeting in November 2016 before his dismissal .

In his 1984 address commemorating D-Day , President Ronald Reagan asked why these men willingly went through the hell that they did on the beaches of Normandy . The answer , he said , was faith . Faith in the mission . Faith that they fought to liberate , not conquer . Faith that if they died , they died with honor , for humanity . Faith in the brotherhood of those they fought alongside . <p> Last week , the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health , which I chair , heard testimony from Sebastian Junger , author of " Tribe : On Homecoming and Belonging , " on how the Department of Veterans Affairs treatments and programs can better provide for the health and well-being of our vets . In his book , as Junger explores post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans , he reflects on what soldiers are returning to and what they leave behind when they come home : re-entry into an individualized society , leaving behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to Junger , the same goes for a nation in times of crisis . For example , after World War II , many Londoners who lived through the brutal Blitz claimed to miss the communal underground living that characterized their lives during the war . <p> Loyalty , inter-reliance , and cooperation these are three characteristics that Junger assigns to the after-shock of war or conflict . They can be traced in the aftermath of crises throughout history , both on the micro and the macro scale . Think back to Sept. 11 , 2001 , the most sweeping terrorist attack on American soil and the first confrontation with evil of that scope that many of the current generation can recall . The days following the attack forged the vast , diverse citizenry of America into a single heartbeat , whose coat of arms was the red , white and blue cloth of our nation , and whose enemy had one name . When Osama Bin Laden was killed 10 years later , the front pages of our newspapers were splashed with photos of people in cities across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " USA ! USA ! " <p> The good guys won and those good guys included all 300 million Americans who were cheering together . <p> On a personal level , Junger finds it a source of stress for veterans when this sense of community is gone , saying : " Having something to fight for , and fight through , is a good and important thing . " Its not too different for our nation as a whole . When we as a country lose sight of our common goals , our national identity , and the shared values we fight for and believe in it weakens us . We become divided , distracted , and mired in gridlock . I believe we can see an element of this occurring in our country today . <p> Its not because there are n't  battles to be won . In fact , our country faces threats from all corners of the globe from ISIS and radical terrorist groups recent attacks in Europe , to North Koreas nuclear capabilities and missile tests , Chinas aggression in the South China Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also face a myriad of challenges here at home . Our health care system is crumbling just this week , one of Ohios largest health care providers announced it is leaving the states health care exchange , leaving 18 counties without an insurance option . Our tax code is broken and needs to be overhauled . Our roads , bridges , and highways are aging and need to be rebuilt and repaired . <p> These are challenges best faced together . They are battles best fought side-by-side . We wo n't always agree , and that 's a good thing robust debate in the marketplace of ideas is a unique underpinning of democracy . But we seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day , here in America , we are all on the same team . A perfect example was Thursdays Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with former FBI Director James B. Comey .

But the reality is , both teams need the same thing : we need facts . We do n't  need more fires .

Then we need to move forward together . <p> It will be impossible to address all threats to the United States , our democracy and founding principles , if we rarely come together as Americans . Practically , this means engaging in civil discourse , finding common ground in shared goals , and having tough conversations expecting some differing opinions . It means remembering who we are and what we fight for as we fight through the challenges facing our nation . We are all unique , and our opinions are as diverse as we are , but we are all Americans .

In his 1984 address commemorating D-Day , President Ronald Reagan asked why these men willingly went through the hell that they did on the beaches of Normandy . The answer , he said , was faith . Faith in the mission . Faith that they fought to liberate , not conquer . Faith that if they died , they died with honor , for humanity . Faith in the brotherhood of those they fought alongside . <p> Last week , the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health , which I chair , heard testimony from Sebastian Junger , author of " Tribe : On Homecoming and Belonging , " on how the Department of Veterans Affairs treatments and programs can better provide for the health and well-being of our vets . In his book , as Junger explores post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans , he reflects on what soldiers are returning to and what they leave behind when they come home : re-entry into an individualized society , leaving behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to Junger , the same goes for a nation in times of crisis . For example , after World War II , many Londoners who lived through the brutal Blitz claimed to miss the communal underground living that characterized their lives during the war . <p> Loyalty , inter-reliance , and cooperation these are three characteristics that Junger assigns to the after-shock of war or conflict . They can be traced in the aftermath of crises throughout history , both on the micro and the macro scale . Think back to Sept. 11 , 2001 , the most sweeping terrorist attack on American soil and the first confrontation with evil of that scope that many of the current generation can recall . The days following the attack forged the vast , diverse citizenry of America into a single heartbeat , whose coat of arms was the red , white and blue cloth of our nation , and whose enemy had one name . When Osama Bin Laden was killed 10 years later , the front pages of our newspapers were splashed with photos of people in cities across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " USA ! USA ! " <p> The good guys won and those good guys included all 300 million Americans who were cheering together . <p> On a personal level , Junger finds it a source of stress for veterans when this sense of community is gone , saying : " Having something to fight for , and fight through , is a good and important thing . " Its not too different for our nation as a whole . When we as a country lose sight of our common goals , our national identity , and the shared values we fight for and believe in it weakens us . We become divided , distracted , and mired in gridlock . I believe we can see an element of this occurring in our country today . <p> Its not because there are n't  battles to be won .

They are battles best fought side-by-side . We wo n't always agree , and that 's a good thing robust debate in the marketplace of ideas is a unique underpinning of democracy . But we seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day , here in America , we are all on the same team .

Then we need to move forward together . <p> It will be impossible to address all threats to the United States , our democracy and founding principles , if we rarely come together as Americans . Practically , this means engaging in civil discourse , finding common ground in shared goals , and having tough conversations expecting some differing opinions .

Council took no action when members reconvened . <p> The Paint Creek boards meeting on Tuesday was held at the North East Street fire station , where board members also toured the facility . The mayor was invited to participate in the executive session with Paint Creek board members , along with George and Jon Salyer , Paint Creeks human resources manager . <p> Back in 2008 , city council approved the construction of the North East Street fire station , along with the purchase and remodel of an existing building on West Walnut Street for a new police station , at a combined cost of about $1.7 million . The fire station opened in 2010 , occupied by Hillsboro Fire &amp; Rescue . <p> But after council approved a measure in 2013 supported by Hastings to disband Hillsboros fire department and instead contract with Paint Creek for services , the citys new fire station was no longer officially in use , except for serving as the location for various meetings . <p> Paint Creek had in the meantime purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street and Governor Trimble Place for $260,000 from Hastings , who had bought it in 2010 and later spent about $85,000 on upgrades . <p> The city granted Paint Creek permission to use bays at the North East Street station for a couple of its vehicles , but the mayor has said recently that Paint Creek has been utilizing other parts of the building , too , prompting him to enter into talks with Paint Creek for the purchase of the facility . <p> On a related matter at Mondays city council meeting , Hillsboro resident Chris Mathews addressed council , saying that a recent article in The Times-Gazette prompted him to show up to voice his opposition to the possibility of the city joining the Paint Creek district because it would raise property taxes . Mathews said such a move would be " irresponsible , " as well as " absurd . " He said the city income tax " already paid for a fire department . " He said he wanted council members to state their position on the subject . <p> Since January 2014 , the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hillsboro for about $570,000 a year , whereas townships covered by the fire district are voting members under a plan that covers cost of membership through a 5.5 mill property tax . Until recently , the law allowed only nine voting members on a fire district board , but that provision no longer exists , clearing the way for Hillsboro to join like the townships . But a vote by council to join the district would bring with it the increase in property taxes just as the townships pay . <p> Mathews , who was usually among individuals who attended council meetings regularly in 2012 and 2013 to oppose disbanding Hillsboro Fire &amp; Rescue , said Monday he was not arguing to bring back the Hillsboro fire department , but said that an eventual increase in property taxes was predicted when the Paint Creek deal was made , and now there were no other options . <p> Hastings said that over the last four or five years , he and city council had done " a remarkable job turning this city around , " including doing " a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see more improvements . " He said the city could continue paying for fire and EMS coverage from the General Fund , but the final decision would be councils . <p> Council president Lee Koogler said he has always intended for council to begin addressing whether to join Paint Creek as a member during " the second half of the year , " with public notices to ensure people " have the opportunity to address it . " <p> In other business Monday , Nate Green , director of economic development for The Montrose Group , a development planning and lobbying company , addressed council at Hastings invitation to describe the purpose and benefits of an Economic Development District , a new historic preservation tool recently approved by the state legislature . <p> Green said the districts are targeted for historic downtowns such as Hillsboros , although they can be utilized in other areas . He said they make use of what he described as a " super TIF " tax increment financing to help revitalize downtowns . <p> But " you have to have an economic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps municipalities develop plans and write legislation to create the districts . <p> In another matter , leaders and members of Cub Scout Troop 37 in Hillsboro attended Mondays meeting . At the mayors invitation , scouts led the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of the meeting , and then later requested permission to conduct a cleanup day at Liberty Park , suggesting the date of April 22 . <p> Koogler and other council members thanked the scouts for their interest in performing the cleanup , and Hastings told scout leaders to contact his office to confirm the date . <p> In other matters : <p> Hastings said he was abandoning the idea of stripping the pavement from West Main Street to leave the exposed brick after substantial negative feedback from residents and business owners . He said he had received " never so much comment " against a plan , adding , " Its not going to happen . " He said public works lead Shawn Adkins would schedule repaving the brick that was already exposed as soon as temperatures permit . <p> The mayor told council that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law director Fred Beery was successful , as previously reported in The Times-Gazette , paving the way for a " plan of action to tackle a lot of blight " in the city . <p> Hastings said the city was going to " wait a brief time to decide appropriate action " in regard to a partial wall collapse of a property owned by Jack Hope after ascertaining what Hopes plans are regarding the incident . Prior to the council meeting , Morris property committee met and urged that the vacant property ordinance be enforced and that letters be sent to vacant property owners to address issues that might avoid future issues such as the wall collapse . <p> Council unanimously passed a resolution introduced by Hastings opposing Ohio Gov . John Kasichs budget plan for the state to take over the collection of business taxes from municipalities , with city auditor Gary Lewis lending his support to the resolution , calling it " absolutely ridiculous " and another way for the state " getting its foot more and more in the door " of local control . Koogler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and service director Gary Silcott reported that the city is ready to put out bids for demolition of the back portion of the Colony , and said that income surveys will be conducted in parts of the city so various grants can be pursued . Silcott said Phase II of the North East Street project should begin this summer . Hastings said job postings have been placed for a permanent safety and service director . <p> Lewis reported that the city has about $6.6 million on hand , and assured Koogler that a currently-low unencumbered balance was typical for this time of year , adding that he still expected a year-end carryover of about a half million dollars . <p> Hastings reported that the Hillsboro Planning Commission denied a variance for a dog boarding kennel in the 500 block of North East Street , is considering a variance request for a metal fabrication business in the 900 block of West Main Street , and that Planning Commission chair Tom Eichinger is leading the effort toward a master zoning plan for the city . <p> Hastings announced that Sherri Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is retiring in May , and that Tasha Gregory will be deputy tax commissioner , moving from the water office . <p> Council approved a resolution for Hillsboro to renew its partnership with Highland County Community Action to seek Community Housing Improvement Project ( CHIP ) grants , with Hastings noting that he met recently with the housing administrator , who agreed to provide better reporting and oversight on impacted city properties . <p> Council member Justin Harsha reported that his Street and Safety Committee met to discuss the FRS transportation issue raised by Hastings at the February meeting , adding that the committee agreed not to pursue any changes in the service . <p> Council approved an ordinance recommended by Rebecca Wilkins Utilities Committee to redistribute water and sewer revenue to address storm sewer problems , which Lewis said would amount to about $60,000 set aside each year and for which he would create a new fund , after being told by state officials that a new fund was permissible . <p> Wilkin reported that her committee decided to take no action on a request from Greystone Motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hastings for consideration of a citywide trash collection plan was placed into the Utilities Committee by Koogler , who also placed into the Property , Maintenance and Restoration Committee a request by the mayor for the city to consider allowing a potential business to use the old water plant at the end of Homestead Avenue owned by the city . <p> Council approved an ordinance designating 50 percent of revenue it receives from the hotel lodging fee to go to the Highland County Visitors Bureau , which Hastings said at the January meeting would amount to about $12,000 . <p> Council approved Lewis request for the lease/purchase of a dump truck with a snow plow for $167,000 , financed over four years . <p> All council members were present except Dick Donley , whose absence was excused. 226139 @qwx1086139 <p> Hillsboro Mayor Drew Hastings , lower left , and members of the Paint Creek fire district board prepare to go into executive session Tuesday to discuss the possibility of the fire station on North East Street in Hillsboro being purchased by the Paint Creek district . <p> LONG ...
