Great wine , glorious rolling countryside , shimmering coastline ... what 's not to love ? All you need to do is decide where in the south of France to go . We 've picked a few of the top spots for your break away . <h> Aix-En-Provence <p> When we think of the south of France , we tend to imagine Provence . Lavender fields , wineries , little hilltop villages - it 's all there . And at its heart is Aix , a city with roots deeply entrenched in history and art . <p> If you 're travelling with kids , they 'll appreciate a break from walking - take Le Petit Train , a fun tram that runs through the centre of town . Children will also love the Museum of Natural History in the Aix Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs and fossils - a great choice if you happen to encounter a rainy day . <h> Bordeaux <p> A busy city in the heart of rolling wine country , Bordeaux has a little of everything , be it culture , cuisine , art or entertainment . Sip some of the world 's finest vintages and take in the picturesque surroundings of wine country , or indulge in the sights and sounds of the central city . <p> Naturally , Bordeaux is a hot spot for those keen on good wine , and if you have your heart set on picking up some great vintages , the city is an excellent base . There are lush vineyards throughout the region offering tastings and tours , and it 's here that you 'll find some of the most beautiful chateaux in France . <p> To keep the kids happy , opt for a taste of something more exotic with the Zoo de Bordeaux Pessac ; from tigers to a special jungle of parrots , there are all kinds of exciting creatures to discover . You 'll also find the Science Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactive exhibits that let the whole family get involved . <h> Toulouse <p> Lovely , lively and packed with things to do , Toulouse is full of surprises . There is so much visual splendour here , from the grand neoclassical facade of the Place du Capitol , and its museum of art , to the many pretty pink brick buildings , which earned Toulouse the nickname " La Ville Rose " . This is a city made for ogling . <p> Certainly , modern art fans will love the exhibitions of Les Abattoirs while happy snappers will appreciate a visit to the Galerie du Ch+teau d'eau , the world 's first photography museum . Take a drive through the African Safari Park , which offers plenty of fun , and look out for exotic creatures . <h> Nice <p> It 's all there in the name : C+te d'Azur .

There are birds , lizards , marine animals and over 2,500 species of different plants . If the sun is out , it 's well worth taking the Petit Train , which takes you on a winding ride around the Old Town and the port , past attractions such as the Colline du Ch+teau . It 's a great way to get your bearings , and see the sights . <p> Getting there : We recommend breaking your journey in Lyon .

@@14420379 @3020379/ <h> Driving in France <p> With stunning scenery to discover there 's no better way to explore France than behind the wheel of a car . Driving allows you to choose your A to B , and even take a detour on the spur of the moment , so you have total freedom to design your journey . To ensure a safe and smooth journey while in France , Eurotunnel le Shuttle has compiled this list of simple tips to remember . <h> What to bring <p> A full , valid UK driving licence is required . Due to new updates from the DVLA the paper counterpart is no longer required and this includes when travelling on the Continent . You must be 18 or over to drive in France . <p> A GB sticker to display in the rear windscreen and your motor insurance certificate . ( 1 ) <p> A breathalyser - You are required to carry a self-test breathalyser when driving in France but there is no current legislation demanding a fine for non-compliance . The official text states that one unused breathalyser must be produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that if one is used or damaged , you will still have a replacement to produce . <p> A warning triangle and reflective jacket for use in a breakdown . Without these you risk being fined around G90. ( 2 ) <p> Headlamp converters ( for driving on the right ) are compulsory to prevent dazzling drivers coming the other way . ( 3 ) <h> What NOT to bring <p> Radar detectors are illegal in France . If you are caught with one you risk fines of up to G1,500 . Satnav and GPS systems which show where speed cameras are located are also illegal so make sure this function is disabled or removed completely from your device . <p> We also have maps and satnavs . Alternatively , our Route Planner will help you choose the quickest , non -motorway or most scenic route to your destination . <h> Ready to drive in France ? <p> Fasten your seatbelts because , as in the UK , wearing front and rear seatbelts is compulsory when fitted . <p> It 's illegal for children under 10 to ride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments about who gets the front seat ! Children under 10 must be in the back seat and in a child seat if they weigh less than 15kg . Over this weight they can use a seat belt with a booster seat . <p> Now that you 're all buckled in and ready to go , the main thing to remember is that people drive on the right-hand side of the road in France . <p> It 's important to be alert when driving , so try to minimise distractions in the car until you feel comfortable in your new environment . <h> Tolls : you can beat the queues <p> If heading south , it 's best to avoid driving via Paris as traffic can be heavy , unless of course the capital city is part of your trip . <p> The quickest way to travel between regions and cities in France is via motorways . Take plenty of change with you as you might have to pay motorway tolls at automated barriers . Alternatively , you can buy a " Liber-t tag " which enables you to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euros . The fee is exactly the same but payment will automatically be taken from your chosen bank account in GBP . <h> Exclusive Eurotunnel Le Shuttle offer <p> Buy a Liber-t tag and beat the queues at the French motorway tolls : <p> Apply for free - no fee ( save G10 ) <p> Save 50% on the annual fee , only G3 ( normally G6 ) from the second year onwards <p> G20* refundable security deposit on the tag <p> G5* active usage fee - only for the months in which the tag is used and capped at G10 in any subscription year <h> Rules of the road <p> Do n't be intimated by roundabouts . The rules are the same as in the UK except you drive in the opposite direction . When approaching a roundabout , give way to traffic on your left already on the roundabout . <h> Speed limits in France <p> For your safety on the road be aware that speed regulations start at the town name sign and end on leaving the town .

If you are over by 30km/h you can lose your licence and your vehicle can be confiscated if you are over the limit by 50 km/h . <h> Emission Laws in France <p> If you are planning on travelling to France this year , it might be worth considering the new Air Quality Emissions Certificate , which has recently been enforced by the French Government . The certificate is being introduced in order to lower emissions from vehicles travelling to specific areas in France ( Low Emission Zones ) and as of the 1st of April 2017 , the following locations will require all UK registered vehicles to purchase the new certificate : Paris , Lyon and Grenoble . <h> Ready to refuel ? <p> You 'll find motorway service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tank .

Diesel = Gazole ou Gasoil <h> Parking rules <p> It is usual practice in French towns to allow parking on one side of the street for half of the month and then on the other side for the second half of the month . Parking may also alternate weekly or daily . <p> Parking is free on roads with a dotted white line or no markings . Blue zone parking areas allow free parking for a designated time .

You can pick up a new parking disc at newsagents or tobacconists and failure to display the new disc could result in a fine . Blue parking zones are shown with a parking sign with a cryptogram in the bottom corner as in the example shown here . <p> Street parking in Paris is limited as many roads are pedestrianised and it 's illegal to park your vehicle for longer than 24 hours in the same spot . <h> Car insurance and motor breakdown <p> You must have third party insurance cover ( a legal requirement ) at the least , but it does n't cover any costs incurred by you as a result of an accident . Make sure your policy is fully comprehensive and that you have your Certificate of Motor Insurance before setting off . <h> Lights <p> It 's advised that dipped headlights are used at all times outside towns in any weather .

The French Riviera is an incredibly popular destination , especially during summertime , so I 've gone through some of my all-time favourite beaches , to help you choose where to lay down your towel this summer . <h> Plage des Salins <p> When you think of Saint-Tropez , you might picture the three-mile-long sands at Pampelonne , the area 's most famous , and longest , beach . Having attracted the uber-chic holiday crowd of the 1960s , Saint-Tropez is still popular with creatives and the yacht-owning elite today . While Pampelonne is beautiful , you do n't have to travel far to find a beach of equal beauty , with significantly fewer people .

A small shingle beach , Paloma is banked by thick trees and overlooked by the exclusive Paloma Beach Restaurant , which , it 's said , frequently plays host to the likes of Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie . For me , though , this beach is a brilliant place to swim , with its calm waters protected by the crescent-shaped bay . I love diving off the beach 's pontoon , and you can take a jet ski or rent a wakeboard from the restaurant .

Weather conditions can change the accessibility of the Calanques , so it 's best to check conditions the night before . You can walk down to the beach from the car park at de la Fontasse by following the marked walking route , but prepare for a bit of a climb down ! <h> Plage de l'Almanarre <p> A great option for families with kids , Plage de l'Almanarre can be found alongside the Route du Sel ( Salt Road ) , south of Hy+res .

Autumn , as the leaves begin to turn and the air becomes crisp , is one of my favourite times of the year to get outside and explore . For those of you visiting France this Autumn , or at any time of the year for that matter , here are my top four walking trails . Enjoy ! <h> Tour du Mont Blanc <p> The Tour du Mont Blanc is one of France 's most famous routes , and even a brief walk along this 170km trail will show you why . The route circles the infamous Mont Blanc , covering ground in Switzerland and Italy , as well as France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , the trail goes from the Little Saint Bernard Pass " on the French-Italian border " and passes through Beaufort , Passy and Argenti+re ( to name just a few ) on route to the Swiss border in the north . A few years ago , when I visited the area , I stayed in Chamonix and spent a few days doing short hikes , to the north and to the south , along the trail . Les Houches is a beautiful town just south of Chamonix , and it can be reached in just 1.5 hours , while Vallorcine , a tiny , unspoilt village , is a 3.5-hour walk to the north . <p> - <p> Yellow signs lead the way on the Tour du Mont Blanc . <h> Routes des Grands Crus <p> The Routes des Grands Crus is the perfect trail for wine-lovers ( including me ! ) , as it takes you through Burgundy , one of France 's main wine-producing regions , offering plenty of opportunity to sample a glass or two along the way . The trail begins in Dijon and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages , including Nuit-Saint-Georges and Beaune . I 'd recommend choosing somewhere as a base and , from there , taking daytime hikes up and down the trail . You could even drive between the towns , staying for a couple of nights at each , and spend the days walking different parts of the route . <p> - <p> Walk the Routes des Grands Crus and stop at vineyards along the way . <h> The Loire Valley <p> The Loire Valley is located in the middle part of the Loire River in central France , and it 's known as the Garden of France due to its abundance of orchards , vineyards and agricultural fields . There are many walks to choose from in the area , ranging from short and sweet 2km walks to harder 15km hikes . I 've been to the Loire Valley enough times to not remember the exact number , but each time I try to explore somewhere new .

From the delicious world of French fromage , to the mature flavours of Switzerland , whether it 's creamy and soft , or hard and tangy , nothing quite beats Europe 's love for cheese . To help you get inspired for your next trip across the Channel with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle , we 've put together a guide to touring the continent 's top cheese destinations . So , grab your guide and your satnav , and get ready for the cheese holiday of a lifetime . <h> Begin your journey with the cheeses of France <h> Drive west to Normandy <p> From Calais , you can begin your cheese tour by heading west to Normandy , the original home of Camembert . The first ever Camembert was produced by Marie Harel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only those who produce the cheese in the same way as Harel have the legal right to naming it Camembert . Once matured , Camembert has a creamy , buttery taste , with a pale yellow interior and bloomy rind , and goes perfectly with roasted garlic and baguettes , as well as a glass of Normandy cider . <p> If you want to find out more about Camembert during your trip to Normandy , be sure to spend a day visiting La Maison du Camembert . This museum and farm allows visitors to explore the history of the cheese , as well as learn all about how it 's made . <h> Cruise down to Brie <p> Once you 've had your fill of Camembert , hit the road and drive down to the Brie region , specifically the town of Meaux , home of the famous Brie de Meaux cheese , a delicious type of Brie cheese that 's unpasteurised . Made from cow 's milk , this creamy , straw-coloured cheese has a sweet , buttery taste and a bloomy , white rind . Brie de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seine-et-Marne to Yonne , so be sure to head to the listed regions for a taste of the real thing . <p> When cooking with Brie , be sure to complement the flavours of your meal with a flute of champagne , or for something richer , a glass of red Bordeaux . <h> Finish your French cheese journey in Roquefort <p> If you 're a fan of blue cheese , take your tour of French cheeses down south to Roquefort , for the cheese of kings and popes . According to EU law , only when the Roquefort cheese is matured in the natural Combalou caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon , can the cheese be named Roquefort , so be sure you keep an eye out for the real thing . <p> On average , this crumbly cheese is aged for five months , with the end result being a sharp and salty , white and blue cheese that works well in Southern-French salads . <h> Drive west for formaggio in Italy <h> Begin your Italian journey in Bergamo <p> From Roquefort , head west to Italy , where your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a working mozzarella farm . Quattro Portoni Caseificio produces over 20 types of cheese , but with a substantial buffalo farm located on the estate , many flock to sample a fresh ball of mozzarella di bufala , or buffalo mozzarella . <p> The creamy , milky flavour of the cheese goes perfectly with a tomato and basil salad with lashings of extra virgin olive oil , but it 's also a popular topping choice for traditional , Italian pizzas . <h> Drive south to Parma <p> Not only is Parma the home of delicious ham and incredible architecture , it 's also well known for the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese . According to the strict rules of PDO ( Protected Designation of Origin ) , for the cheese to be officially Parmigiano Reggiano , the milk used must be from cows that have fed on the fresh grass and hay of Parma . <p> Once matured , the cheese has a crystallised texture , with a natural rind , straw-coloured interior and a fruity , nutty taste . Many Italians grate the cheese finely over warm dishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After your stay in Parma , head further south to Tuscany , where you 're likely to enjoy plenty of Pecorino Toscano , wherever you find yourself in the region . One of many types of Pecorino ( with others being Pecorino Sardo and Pecorino Romano , both from Sardinia , and Pecorino Siciliano , from Sicily ) this hard cheese is made from ewe 's milk , and has a creamy-yellow colour , and a buttery , nutty flavour . When cooking or dining out , it makes for the perfect accompaniment to any Italian spring salad . <h> Head north for a taste of Swiss cheese <h> Stop off in Fribourg <p> From Tuscany , make the journey up north to Switzerland , to the canton of Fribourg , where one of the best types of Gruy+re cheese is produced , Le Gruy+re Premier Cru . Matured in humid caves in Fribourg for 14 months , the cheese has an earthy and nutty flavour , a rusty brown rind and semi-soft texture that 's won the World Cheese Awards in London a total of four times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a must-try on any cheese tour of Europe . <h> Continue up to Emmental <p> From Fribourg , make your way back up to the region of Emmental , the home of Emmentaler cheese . Although easily recognisable because of the holes that run through the cheese , these famous holes are also one of the reasons why it 's one of the most difficult cheeses to produce. - According to the AOC , to be correctly named Emmantaler , the cheese must be aged for four months , where it will be left with a hard , natural rind . When eating , Emmantaler works perfectly with thick slices of ham in a buttered baguette , yet one of the more popular choices in Switzerland , is to mix it with Gruy+re in a pot of fondue . <h> Finish your journey with a slice of Dutch kaas <h> Enjoy a whistle stop tour of Westerkwartier cheese <p> Westerkwartier is one of the two provinces that Kanterkaas , according to its PDO , can be traditionally made , with the second being Friesland . Two types of Kanterkass are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a type of hard cheese that is seasoned with ground up cumin . The second is Kanter Nagelkaas , a cheese that is also flavoured with cumin , but also nutmeg , adding a slightly sweet , spicy taste to it . <h> End your cheese tour in Gouda <p> Named after the city itself , Gouda is one of the most popular cheeses in the Netherlands . One of the best places to grab a wheel of Gouda for yourself is at the Cheese Market , which is located just outside of the Gouda City Hall . Rows and rows of Gouda wheels are stacked up high at each of the market 's stalls , providing cheese lovers with varied Gouda types , from the young Graskaas cheese , to the extra-aged Overjarig that often has a black outer rind . @qwx187290 <p> If this cheese tour of Europe has got you inspired for a holiday with a difference , then be sure to book your tickets today .

Being French , I am proud of my culinary heritage , and as a mother , I try to encourage my kids to try as many new things as possible . Generally , my children are n't particularly fussy , but there have been a couple of occasions on our driving tours of Europe where we have come across some slightly more unusual delicacies . Never known to shy away from the unknown , however , we all gave them a go and found them to be really quite tasty .

This all started in the 14th and 15th centuries , when Portugal was expanding its power from the shipyards of Porto , so the majority of meat produced in the city went to supplying the sailors . All that was left for the inhabitants of the city were scraps of meat , offcuts and by-products . Tripe has since become a culturally important dish , and is most often enjoyed in a type of tomato stew , which is both nutritious and delicious . <p> The drive to Portugal cuts through some of the most beautiful regions of France and Spain , and is well worth the extra mileage .

These little morsels are delicious , bursting with the subtle flavours of the ocean . <p> Goose barnacles are most commonly found along the Costa da Morte region of Spain , which can be reached through France and along the scenic Northern Spanish coastline . <h> Baby Eels , Spain <p> Another Spanish delicacy is that of baby eels , known locally as angulas , which is particularly popular in the Basque Country . <p> Fresh angulas at a market <p> Similarly to goose barnacles , angulas are somewhat difficult to catch ; they tend to only come out after dark and during bad weather .

@@14420513 @3020513/ <h> Coach Security <h> Guidance on coach security and international travel <h> General <p> With the current level of threat to national security , operators of the Ports and Channel Tunnel face increased requirements to ensure the security of their property , the ships , and trains that transit the Channel Tunnel . <p> As a result , coaches may be subject to search by a number of authorities for several reasons , including for the protection of the ship , port or Channel Tunnel . If Channel Tunnel or Port Security is not satisfied with any security aspect of a coach or its passengers or crew they may refuse travel . It is therefore in your own operating interests and also more widely for security and safety of all those using cross-channel systems to ensure that the possibility of this happening is reduced . <p> The following guidance is designed to provide general advice to Coach Companies and their staff ; in order to promote coach security and reduce the risk of delay due to security related concerns . <h> Information for Coach Passengers who have Lost or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of UK citizens arriving at Eurotunnel Calais terminal having had their UK passport stolen or it has been lost . As you can appreciate , there are a number of checks that the UK Border Agency have to complete before allowing passengers entry back to the UK . This may cause lengthy waiting periods for your coach and customers - in some cases - the scheduled departure has been missed . <p> With the aim to reducing the possible waiting period , before arriving at Eurotunnel terminal , please ask your coach driver to ensure that all passengers have a valid UK passport in their possession . In the event of a customer reporting a lost or stolen passport , please ask the driver to complete the attached form , which MUST be faxed to UK Border Agency before the scheduled return crossing time . This will allow UK Border Agency teams to perform the necessary checks prior to the coach travelling which should help minimise any delay . <h> Control of Passengers Boarding and Leaving a Coach <p> Coach crew should ensure that no person is permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of a valid form of authorisation , such as a ticket or pass for that particular journey . <p> Passengers not wishing to travel must inform a member of the Coach crew , who should amend their records accordingly and ensure that any accompanying baggage for the passenger is removed before travel . <p> Coach crew should ensure that the number of passengers on board the coach matches their records for that journey , and should do this at the beginning of the journey and also whenever passengers re-board after any stops . <h> Luggage Reconciliation and Unaccompanied Baggage <p> It is imperative that when loading the vehicle , all baggage must be reconciled with passengers using your company for that particular journey . If a coach search is undertaken and any baggage found that can not be accounted for ( including items left from previous journeys ) , it could result in a significant delay whilst the baggage is removed and checked , or the coach being refused travel . <p> Coach crew should ensure that they alone are responsible for loading and unloading all baggage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unloaded by passengers or any other member of the public . <p> It is advisable that Coach Companies should have a simple but effective manifest or tagging system to provide baggage reconciliation . It is advisable for Coach Companies to develop procedures ensure that all luggage is fully checked and accounted for prior to travel . This would greatly speed the identification of passengers ' baggage in the normal search routine and would help to reduce the time required for searching a coach . <p> If unaccompanied baggage is discovered en-route to the Channel Tunnel or Ports , the Coach crew should immediately contact their Company and make arrangements for it to be removed at the earliest opportunity . It is unlikely that such luggage will be allowed to travel even if subject to screening by the Port/Channel Tunnel Operator . Arrangements should be put in place to recover such luggage as soon as possible . <p> If unaccompanied baggage is being carried knowingly , the Coach Company should inform the appropriate Port or Channel Tunnel Operator prior to arrival . The Company should explain the reason that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove the item(s) . Please note that it is unlikely that coaches will be permitted to travel unless unaccompanied items are removed altogether and thoroughly checked for any suspicious items or devices by the Port or Channel Tunnel Operator . <p> Any unaccompanied baggage found by the Port or Channel Tunnel Operator or surrendered by the Coach Company will not be returned to the coach . You should make arrangements to collect any such luggage as soon as possible . <h> En Route Stops <p> If any stops are being made to collect additional passengers , or for comfort breaks , the Coach crew should ensure that no baggage is removed unless there is a valid reason , and that this luggage is accounted for when the journey resumes . Coach crew should also ensure that all passengers produce a valid ticket or pass when boarding or re-boarding the coach . <p> Searching of Luggage by Port or Channel Tunnel Operator and Police <p> Port or Channel Tunnel Operators are permitted to search any public vehicle travelling through their system , and may , where necessary , involve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach itself and all baggage carried on it . <p> Transport Security Directorate place requirements on Port and Channel Tunnel Operators to search a certain number of vehicles , depending upon the current levels of threat .

From the endangered bears of the Pyrenees mountains , to the grunting wild boar of the North , you 're bound to discover a species that captivates you . To help you on your wildlife journey , we 've put together a list of some of the most popular animals in the country , including where you 're likely to spot them . So , pack up your binoculars , book your ticket across the Channel with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle , and begin your very own wildlife expedition today . <h> The South <h> Genets <p> Introduced from Africa by the Saracens in the 12th century , genets are now a commonly found mammal in the South-West of France , close to the Pyrenees Mountains . Feasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures can be found in heavily wooded areas . With long , striped bushy tails and a spotted back , they 're also pretty easy to identify , so make sure you keep your eyes peeled during your next road-trip through France . <h> Green lizards <p> These brightly coloured reptiles love to live in humid woodland , so the Southern and North-West of the country is where you 're likely to find one or two of these fascinating animals scurrying across rocks . The lizards are mostly , unsurprisingly , bright green , with the male of the species often displaying a blue chin , and the juveniles appearing to be almost brown in colour . These beautiful creatures love to feed on large insects as they hunt through the tall grass , and in the perfect habitat and environment , they can grow up to 40-centimetres in length . <h> Bears <p> Reintroduced to the Pyrenees Mountains a few years ago , the number of bears settling in France has increased considerably over the years , despite protests from the local sheep farmers , who fear for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears , the animals are still considered endangered , and there 's said to be only around 20 bears roaming the national parks . Even though it 's unlikely you 'll spot one in the wild , the best time to track them down is during the summer , when they 're less lethargic . Just remember to keep a safe distance , they make look cuddly , but at two-metres in height and 70-kilograms in weight , they 're anything but . <h> Chamois <p> Native to the Pyrenees mountains in the South-West of France , the sturdy chamois goats are well experienced in the art of clambering up mountains and cliff faces . During the summer months , the chamois climb high up into the mountains , often reaching summits , where they fill-up on long grass and herbs . However , when the winter comes and the mountains become colder , you 'll often spot lone chamois in the forested areas at the foot of the hills , so they can feed on the thick barks of trees . <p> The chamois goats have a distinct face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short curled horns . Plus , they 're quite small in stature and have a slight hump on their back , making them pretty easy to identify when hiking through the Pyrenees mountains . <h> The North <h> Wolves <p> Once extinct in France , during the 1990s wolves travelled from Italy to find refuge in this country , eventually settling in the French Alps . Nowadays , there are over 200 wolves living in France , with many of them making the journey from the snow-capped mountains to the warmer Southern coast . Despite the increase in numbers , French wolves are endangered , so sightings of these beautiful creatures are few and far between . So , if you do spot one , make sure you sit back and admire it as it prowls over the hills . <h> Wild boar <p> Known as sangliers , there around two-million wild boar settled in France , meaning you 're likely to spot a group or two during your drive throughout this magnificent country . Found mostly in the rural areas of France , you 'll often spot these enchanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , including little piglets , otherwise known as marcassins . <p> Much larger than their domestic cousins , wild cats have a thick , long , tan and striped coat , and can weigh up to anything between three and five kilograms . Using their strong limbs , they hunt down small mammals and birds to feed themselves and their kittens , a truly amazing sight you should aim to witness . <h> Golden eagles <p> These giant birds of prey are often spotted soaring through the air of Northern France , but can also be found swooping past the mountainous regions of the Alps and the Pyrenees in the Southern parts of the country . These magnificent birds prefer to make nests in the forests of Northern France and some of the more rocky mountains , but you 're just as likely to see them hunting through the air , as you drive through the windy , scenic French roads . <p> The birds are brown and grey in colour , with golden-yellow beaks and feet , and a huge wingspan that 's hard to miss .

Although it 's tricky to pinpoint the exact time the flowers will bloom due to the ever-changing weather , the best time to visit the forest is usually during the latter half of April , when the bluebells flower , and a sapphire glow envelopes the forest . <h> Exploring Hallerbos <p> The best way to explore Hallerbos , and the swathes of bluebells , is by following the four hiking trails that guide you through the woods . Three of the trails are marked with different coloured poles , with each covering different routes and distances for varying abilities . The Achtdreven Walk is just 1.8-kilometres in distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles . The Achtdreven route is designed for visitors with limited mobility , and provides plenty of picnic benches throughout the course , so that families can enjoy lunch with a view . <p> The two other marked routes are the Sequoia Walk , which is four kilometres long , and the Roebuck Walk , which is seven kilometres long . For Sequoia , simply follow the blue poles , which take you past conifers and giant Sequoia trees . The Roebuck Walk is marked out by yellow posts , which guide you through three of the four valleys in Hallerbos , where you can stop to take in the picturesque views , and wait patiently for wildlife to pass . <p> Follow the Bluebell Walk <p> The one unmarked walking route is the Bluebell Walk , which takes you through the heart of the bluebells during the spring .

The local community and government have become heavily involved with protecting the wild species that inhabit the forest and its surroundings , so a lot has been developed and built over recent years . In 2010 , a bridge just outside of the forest was transformed into a ' wildlife tunnel ' , which enables animals to move safely on grassy marshland , instead of the road .

One version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander who is said to have saved the residents of Dunkirk from famine , and was therefore declared a hero , and the carnival 's idol . <p> Another version tells the story of the Dunkirk residents bidding farewell to the local fisherman .

People rally together to really be a part of celebrations , forgetting about social norms , showcasing solidarity and friendship , and seeing each other as the equals they are . <p> Arguably the best part of the carnival is the live music from the marching bands , where musicians , singers and dancers are led by a drum-major .

Famous the world over for their fine cuisine , there is just something the French have when it comes to culinary expertise that ca n't be matched - as far as I 'm concerned , anyway ! So , the summer is finally upon us and in full swing , and with it comes the much-loved barbecue season . To get you inspired behind the grill , take a look at some of these delicious French-inspired barbecue recipes to try out this summer , next time you fire the coals up ! <h> French-style Crispy Barbecue Chicken <p> Doing chicken well is a speciality of the French , and this recipe is a failsafe for culinary success . The meat is moist and tender , whilst the skin is crispy and delicious - the perfect combination . It is sure to go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onion , garlic , rosemary , bay leaves and white wine vinegar in a large bowl to make the marinade .

Pop the halved lemon and the bay leaves from the marinade inside the chicken , place it in a roasting tray , cover with plenty of tin foil and put it in the oven for one hour . <p> Once the chicken is cooked through , take it out of the oven and finish it off on the barbecue to get that lovely smoky flavour .

Leave them to soak for at least a couple of hours . This will prevent them from catching fire on the barbecue , and ruining your monkfish . <p> Cut the monkfish fillets into cubes and set aside . Mix together the Herbes de Provence , minced garlic , olive oil and white wine in a bowl .

It 's also good to have a variety of delicious side dishes to complement the main affair , and one of my all-time favourites has to be potato salad . The recipe I follow adds a bit of tarragon to give it that extra depth of flavour and interest . <p> Put the potatoes in a saucepan , cover with cold water and add a pinch of salt . Bring to the boil , then reduce to simmer and cook until tender . Once cooked , drain the water , remove the skin and slice into a bowl .

Like its French counterpart Ghent still retains much of its historic look , making it a perfect picturesque spot for a weekend getaway . <p> Whether you 're looking for a romantic break , some family fun , or some European culture , this city has something for everyone . Let Eurotunnel Le Shuttle be your guide as we explore some of the must-see sights and attractions in Ghent . <p> Belfry and Cloth Hall <p> Wool , and the cloth made from it , played a huge part in Ghent 's history during the Middle Ages , resulting in the city growing rich from this industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest quality woven cloth , and at the centre of production stood the Cloth Hall , or Lakenhalle . <p> Constructed between 1425-1445 , the hall was a thriving trading spot for cloth merchants , where they would inspect merchandise and broker deals . As the industry declined the hall was preserved through different usage , including serving as the city jail for more than 150 years . This rich history has left its mark on the building and made it a must for visitors . <p> Attached to the hall is the imposing historic Ghent Belfry , or Belfort , which offers unparalleled views across the metropolis . The bells in this tower are a matter of civic pride to the city 's inhabitants , historically rung to mark battle victories , today they often celebrate more peaceful occasions . Despite the tower 's ancient construction , an elevator has been installed inside , so visitors can avoid lengthy stair climbs in order to enjoy the panorama . <h> Saint Bavo Cathedral <p> This religious structure has stood on the site for more than 1,000 years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the cathedral 's crypt . This sits alongside remains of further expansions throughout the ages , allowing you a glimpse into the development of the grand structure . <p> Today the cathedral is not just an architectural wonder , but it also houses arguably one of the most important renaissance artworks in northern Europe . The world-famous Ghent Altarpiece , is an impressive screen of 24 framed paintings by the two famous masters Hubert and Jan Van Eyk . The breath-taking detailed scenes depict Biblical figures including Adam and Eve and the Lamb of God . <p> Gravensteen <p> Overlooking one of Ghent 's picturesque canals is the formidable Gravensteen , or Castle of the Count . Built in the Middle Ages this compact castle comes straight out of epic tales of knights and dragons , with its looming fortified walls and towers . <p> The building served as the seat of the Counts of Flanders until the 14th Century , and its most notorious resident , crusader Count Philip of Alsace , ensured there was a fully equipped torture chamber inside should anybody actually manage to scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle , climb the ramparts and even get a gruesome glimpse at some of the count 's favourite instruments of torture . <h> Museum of Fine Arts and SMAK <p> To the south of Ghent town centre you will find the verdant and peaceful Citadelpark , which plays host to two of the city 's most impressive galleries . <p> The Museum of Fine Arts , on the park 's east side , houses a collection which includes some of the finest examples of Flemish painting in existence , including works by Hieronymus Bosch , Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony Van Dyke . <p> If you 're looking for something a little more modern then the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst , or SMAK , also located in Citadelpark , is the destination for you . With constantly changing exhibitions of cutting edge work accompanying a collection of more established artists , including pieces by Andy Warhol , Francis Bacon and David Hockney , there 's plenty to excite modern art lovers . <h> Gentse Feesten <p> Once a year , for 10 days , Ghent is transformed- by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's streets . The annual Gentse Feesten , or Ghent Festival , was first held in 1843 and from humble beginnings it has grown into a modern celebration of everything from music and theatre to food and comedy . <p> Every year and the whole town is consumed with celebrations as some two million visitors descend on Ghent . Traditionally beginning on the Saturday before July 21 this modern incarnation of the event has become a sort of ' festival of festivals ' with miniature festivals taking place across the city over the 10 day period . <p> Attendees can opt to wander the streets and enjoy the many free buskers and performers who come out in force for the event , or head into the city 's many bars and performance venues where every style of music is represented in one form or another . <p> With so much to see and do , without the crowds of its neighbours Bruges and Brussels , Ghent is the perfect destination for a Belgian break . <h> Ghent @qwx187291 @qwx187288 <p> from -23 @qwx187300

These madcap motorists make up the contestants of the annual Beaujolais Run , a car race from England to France and back again , all in honour of the humble grape . <p> Whether you 're hoping to compete in the race or simply following in its tyre tracks , a road trip through the region during the local Beaujolais Nouveau day festivities is an unforgettable way to experience the true meaning of France 's love affair with wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of the racers affections is Beaujolais Nouveau .

@@14420645 @3020645/ <h> Art Movement Road Trips - Cubism <h> October 15 , 2014 <p> Following on from my last post , which focused on the Renaissance art movement , in this instalment , I 'm going to jump ahead a little to one of my favourite periods in art history , Cubism . Emerging in the early 20th century in Paris , Cubism is widely considered one of the most culturally significant and important movements of the last century . <p> Pioneered by the likes of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braques , and later Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes , Cubism completely changed the direction of art and sculpture of the time , pushing boundaries by deconstructing classic techniques and conventional attitudes to form and shape . Examples of Cubist masterpieces can be seen in galleries the world over , but still the best place to immerse yourself in this genre is Paris . There are a couple of incredible exhibitions currently on in the city , as well as other permanent collections . Plus , when it takes just 35 minutes to cross the Channel with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Marcel Duchamp : La Peinture , M+me , Centre Pompidou <p> In yet another bold and challenging move , this time from beyond the grave , Marcel Duchamp forces us to look again at his work and the intentions of his art . In this exhibition , a vast collection of Marcel Duchamp 's paintings have been gathered , coming together in the largest retrospective of his painted work since shortly after his death . His style has been much debated over the years , overlapping and drawing on several movements , rather than maintaining a purist style . His famous Nude Descending a Staircase , No. 2 was famously rejected by the school of Cubism at the time in 1911 , which was the catalyst behind his subversive attitude towards painting and art . His aim was always to make people think , to start conversations and debates , rather than just produce aesthetically pleasing pieces , and this new exhibition at the Centre Pompidou in Paris does just that . The exhibition is now open and will be running until 5th January 2015 . <h> Exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cubism and is still the best place in the world to explore the artwork that emerged out of this movement .

With France only 30 minutes away with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle , I 'd recommend fitting in a French culinary class on your 2014 holiday . <h> White Wine and Cheese <p> Traditionally produced French cheeses make the perfect companion to wines and I love to enjoy mine on holiday after a busy day of sightseeing .

Another popular suitor is Petit Basque , a creamy sheep 's milk cheese with sweet overtones , produced by the Lactalis family in Laval , Mayenne , France 's western region . <p> - <h> Red Wine and Cheese <p> If you prefer red wine then it 's important to remember that the older , fruitier and less tannic it is , the better it will pair with a creamy wedge of cheese .

Or , travel south of Dijon , between Fixin and Gevrey Chambertin to see how cheese is made during the early mornings at a Gaugry factory . Discover how to combine the diverse flavours of French wine and cheese at a two-hour pairing session at Baud et Millet restaurant in Bordeaux . There you 'll learn about famous Bordeaux wine regions like Medoc , Saint-Emilion , Graves , Entre-Deux-Mers and Blaye - my favourite kind of lesson . <p> Take a master class at culinary arts centres like Paris by Mouth who run a range of tours and tastings , or join a two-hour cheese and wine class for 85 Euros at Cook'n With Class .

From the singing birds in the sky , to the rolling green hills dotted with beautiful castles . On more than one occasion I 've felt like I was in a real-life Disney film . <p> This had me thinking . There must be somewhere in France I can go and experience a real-life fairy-tale ? I discovered the closest thing at Ch+teau de Chambord . This is the real castle from Beauty and the Beast . When I say real ' , I do n't mean there is an actual beast lurking in the West Wing ; this is what the animators of the original 1991 Oscar-nominated film based the fictional castle on . <p> Like the song says , Beauty and the Beast is a tale as old as time ' . A bookish girl , bored of her life in a French village , must save her father after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his home . She swaps places with her father , and during her time in the castle , realises that the Beast may not be so beastly after all . <p> The film is based on La Belle et la B+te ' , the original French fairy-tale by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve . Her version did n't include singing tea pots and squabbling clocks and candelabras , but it 's still just as magical . <p> Though the real Beast 's castle may not be on the top of your list to visit , you 'll certainly want to visit Ch+teau de Chambord . <p> Would you believe , Ch+teau de Chambord was n't intended as a permanent residence ? King Fran+ois I ( who ordered its construction ) only lived there for a few weeks . It was n't until King Louis XIV was in power that the castle was finally completed . When the interior was finished , his exiled father-in-law King Stanislas Leszczynski of Poland resided there . <p> During the French Revolution , the structure of the castle fortunately remained intact , although the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the castle was passed through different hands , and it fell into disrepair .

Or , you can opt to take a guided tour . Each tour is unique , and you can learn all about the history and architecture that make this place so beautiful . <p> Experience the Park <p> The ch+teau is situated right in the middle of a beautiful park . I can assure you it 's not like the grounds of the Beast 's castle ; there are no scary wolves in the woods here !

Once an important industrial hub , due to the iron quarries of the Biscay Bay area , it is only in recent years that the city has become the arts and culture centre that we know it as today . <p> Evidence of this gritty past can be seen when exploring the city 's interesting architecture , but the surroundings are packed with natural beauty too . The city 's urban centre is overlooked by two modest mountain ranges , and these are lined with fantastic walking and hiking routes . <h> Main Attractions <h> The Guggenheim Museum <p> Perhaps the most well-known of Bilbao 's attractions , the Guggenheim museum was hailed as an important architectural feat when it was erected in 1997 , and has developed since then to become a respected institution in the arts and culture scene .

It took many years to build , starting in 1511 , and over this time some Renaissance influences were added to the architecture , making it a particularly interesting structure . Set on top of a picturesque hill , the cathedral is surrounded by beautiful gardens and if you climb the tower , you 'll get some stunning views of the city . <p> The contrast between new and old architecture can be enjoyed throughout the city . <h> Plaza Nueva <p> Created in 1821 , this Neoclassical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when exploring the city .

From the sun-bleached beaches of the south , to the rolling fields of the Loire Valley , I 'm lucky to have seen some of the most magical places France has to offer . Now , with three kids and a busy lifestyle , I take short breaks " with the family , of course " to Northern France . There are plenty of reasons to visit this lovely part of the country " here are my top seven . <h> 1 . Lille <p> For most people seeking out a city break in France , Paris is the obvious choice , but sometimes the lesser-known choices are , in many ways , better . An underrated city , a little over an hour 's drive from Calais , Lille has so much to offer . Highlights include : the Palais des Beaux-Arts , Jardin Vauban , the beautiful Vieille Bourse building and the fascinating Lille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't had the pleasure of trying calvados , then you 're missing out . Produced in Lower Normandy for centuries , this apple brandy is a must-try for anyone visiting Northern France . Calvados is made from specially selected apples , which are then made into cider and distilled into brandy . The brandy is then aged in oak casks to give it its distinctive flavour . <h> 4 . C+te d'Opale <p> If you 're more of a beach-lover than a city-breaker , you 'll be spoilt for choice in Northern France . One of my favourite spots is the C+te d'Opale ( the Opal Coast ) . Stretching for approximately 75 miles , the C+te d'Opale is made up of beaches , rugged dunes , cliffs and estuaries . Relax in the sun on Le Touquet 's beach or go for a walk along the cliffs at Cap Blanc Nez. <h> 6 . Boulette d'Avesnes <p> Another of Northern France 's delicious delights , Boulette d'Avesnes is a type of cheese produced in Avesnes , a small village near the Belgian border . This soft cheese is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is hand-shaped into a small cone . It has a strong smell and flavour , and is a particularly popular amongst my family " even the little ones will give it a try ! <p> My seventh and final reason to visit Northern France is the Ch+teau de Coucy in Picardy . Built in the 13th century and part-restored six centuries later , the Ch+teau de Coucy is a great place to spend a day out with the family . Take your time exploring the ruins , which are set in the Normandie-Maine Regional Natural Park , before heading to a nearby town for a bite to eat . @qwx187293 @qwx187287 @qwx187296 
@@14420698 @3020698/ <h> Tips for Oktoberfest 2016 <h> August 23 , 2016 <p> I 've seen many of Europe 's key cities and visited several of their annual festivals , from foodie markets to Mardi Gras . For me , though , one event always stands out for being the most carefree and jovial of them all , and it 's known across the world as a brilliant celebration of Bavarian culture and history . I am , of course , talking about Oktoberfest . <p> The festival is about 200 years old and is held in Munich each year . It 's a really unique experience and definitely not one for the faint of heart ! That said , Oktoberfest is more than just drinking beer , with plenty of rides and fairground fun to enjoy . Plan your trip using my handy tips for Oktoberfest 2016 . <h> Get up early ! <p> While you might not feel like waking up early the morning after a long Bierhalle session , it 's a great idea to beat the crowds and secure a seat in your tent of choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't reserved a space , so bear this in mind . Waking up early also gives you more time to enjoy a hearty German breakfast " I recommend a feast of liverwurst slices , Comte and Emmental cheeses and soft pretzel rolls with jam . <h> Book ahead <p> If you 're visiting on the busier days ( Saturday and Sunday ) , you 'll have to book a table at one of the tents if you want to get a seat . Each tent is different , with something special on offer at each one . Hacker-Pschorr , for example , has beautiful cloud decorations adorning the walls and ceiling , Ochsenbraterei is a chilled-out tent boasting delicious traditional Bavarian cuisine and Hofbr+u-Festzelt is a much livelier option . <h> Visit during the week <p> Visit during a weekday and enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere overall . While it 's still worth booking a table , regardless of the day you visit , visiting during the week means rubbing shoulders with more of the locals , while the weekends are incredibly busy with tourists . <h> Dress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's great fun to dress up . Finding suitable Tracht ( traditional Bavarian clothing ) can easily be done online before you travel , or at one of the many traditional clothing shops in Munich . Local department stores such as K&amp;F , C&amp;F and Kaufhof will also stock plenty of costumes around festival time . You can choose to dress in a traditional style , or simply have fun with what you wear ! <p> For traditionally clothed women , the main features include a short-sleeved white blouse , worn beneath a Dirndl dress , which should be calf-length . A pinafore should be worn over the dress and should be the same length , worn with low-heeled black shoes or loafers . <p> For men , a plain white or checked shirt can be worn with leather trousers ( Lederhos'n ) and these can come with or without braces , although with braces looks quite fetching ! For the complete outfit , men should wear off-white slouchy socks with authentic Haferl shoes , but regular black shoes will look OK , too . <h> Want a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hofbr+u-Festzelt tent , if you want to order a beer you need to be seated . Staff wo n't look at you if you 're milling around , so make friends with a group who are seated if you ca n't find a bench for yourself . This is also another good reason to book in advance . <h> Take enough cash <p> When you 're out and about exploring the huge Oktoberfest grounds , the last thing you want is to unexpectedly run out of cash . While some parts of the event do take card , most of the tents take cash , so before you set off each morning , make sure you 've got enough for the day depending on what you 're up to . For a couple of beers , a main meal , a brez'n ( pretzel ) and your local transport fare to and from the event , you 'll need about 50 Euros , and do n't forget to tip your waiter or waitress ( about 10-15% ) . Personally , I always carry a little extra cash , just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench ( unless you 're prepared to chug ) <p> While many people stand around their respective benches to stretch their legs , do n't rest your foot up on the bench unless you 're prepared to chug your beer . Doing so will win you the glory of the tent , however remember to pace yourself throughout the day . All of the tents serve soft drinks and water , so you 've got plenty of options if you 're taking a break from beer . @qwx187293 @qwx187287 @qwx187297

If you 're feeling adventurous , and want to challenge your taste buds , follow our inspiring guide to the most cherished , yet strangest , dishes throughout the continent . <h> France <h> Escargot <p> This typical French dish consists of land snails , which have been removed from their shells , cooked in garlic butter , and then placed back in their shells for presentation purposes .

One of those things is Father Christmas . We call him P+re No+l in France , but these days Santa is Santa all over the world . But it was n't always that simple . When my kids were starting to grow out of believing in Santa , I did some reading to find out just how we ended up celebrating this unusual festive figure . <h> Step 1 : St Nicholas <p> The story of Santa Claus starts with St Nicholas of Myra . This fourth-century Mediterranean saint ( both Greece and Turkey claim him as a local boy ) had a reputation for secret gift-giving , slipping coins into people 's shoes when they were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , these stories grew and developed into legends , including the most famous : that St Nicholas decided to pay the dowries of three poor sisters in order to keep their family together . Two years in a row , as each girl came of age , he threw a purse of gold through their window in the night to support her - but when the girls ' father lay in wait to catch and thank the mystery gift-giver , St Nicholas climbed onto his roof and dropped the final purse down the chimney . Some versions of the myth claim that the youngest daughter had been drying her stockings before the fire , and the gold landed neatly in one of them ! Even seventeen hundred years ago , almost all the elements of the Santa Claus myth were already in place . <h> Step 2 : Sinterklaas <p> It is n't too much of a jump to see how ' St Nicholas ' , or especially ' St Nikolaos ' , can turn into Sinterklaas , and that 's exactly what happened in medieval Europe .

Although he comes on St Nicholas ' Day , Sinterklaas looks more like the god Odin , who also has a long beard , a staff and a fine horse . In these traditions , Sinterklaas was said to come from Spain because half of the real St Nicholas ' bones and relics had been moved there - this is still the story today , just as we tend to say Father Christmas comes from Lapland or the North Pole . <p> - <p> Sinterklaas at a Dutch celebration <h> Step 3 : Santa Claus <p> Nobody seems to agree on just how Sinterklaas became Santa Claus .

Whilst the city is a fun , busy hub of activity , some little known places still exist , and these can be enjoyed away from the crowds . <h> Places to unwind <h> Hofje van Brienen <p> Amsterdam is full of beautiful spots that serve as wonderful places to simply sit and enjoy the scenery . When strolling through the city streets , you might pass by one without realising , as they are often hidden behind large doors . When opened , these doors lead you into wonderful , quiet courtyards . One of the best districts to find these secret courtyards is Jordaan , which is home to Hofje van Brienen . <p> Found on Prinsengracht , just north of Prinsenstraat bridge , this peaceful courtyard , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hofjes are enclosed by almshouses , which were originally built to house elderly people who , often widowed , did not have the financial means to look after themselves .

In Amsterdam Noord you 'll find Schellingwouderpark , a wide open stretch of land that has been dedicated to preserving the local ecosystem . A former industrial waste site , the park is the city 's newest green space , opened in 2010 . <p> This park is a great place to visit when it 's hot , as it 's quieter than Amsterdam 's other parks and the IJ lake gives off a cooling presence .

The most renowned market in the city , and perhaps the Netherlands , is Albert Cuypmarkt , but there are others that attract fewer tourists , and offer a more authentic experience . One such place is the Farmer 's Market on Noordermarkt , which runs every Saturday from 9am until 3pm . <p> This is a small and vibrant market , specialising in natural and healthy goods , like cheeses , honey , bread and homemade cakes . It 's a great place to go if you want to use local produce in your cooking .

Here are our top 7 tips for learning French while on holiday <h> 1 ) Head to local markets <p> You can pick up some delicious fresh bread , or should I say pain , and learn the French words for different foods . Look at the product names and signs and ask for a quantity or weight of something . Next time you 're going to a market you can write your shopping list in French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it comes to ordering your evening meal from the French menu , the words with roll off your tongue and your pronunciation will be spot on . <p> Local flea markets , or brocantes , are perfect places to learn French as the stall holders are used to chatting with customers about the age , make and history of products and haggling prices .

Make sure you ask someone to correct you if you slip-up so you can keep improving . <h> 2 ) Take a tour without an audio guide <p> If you think you have some basic phrases down and really want to extend your vocabulary past small-talk then choosing not to have an English audio guide could be just the ticket . Combine your visit to a museum or gallery with some self-taught French by browsing the displays and reading the French signs as well as the translations .

Keep your ears open and you 'll pick up phrases from overheard conversations and get plenty of opportunity to practise speaking French when ordering or asking the waiter for recommendations . <p> Head to the nearest tourist information centre and ask , in French , what 's on and for recommendations of places to visit . Someone working in tourist information is likely to speak English too so they can correct you or explain if you do n't understand . <h> 4 ) Tune into French radio <p> Tune into a French radio station ( including internet stations ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piaf and you 'll be pronouncing your words perfectly in no time .

You can get the whole family involved by teaching the kids French versions of famous songs . Coming up to Christmas , popular choices include Douce Nuit ( the French version of Silent Night ) , or Vive le Vent ( Jingle Bells ) . As the melody will already be familiar you can concentrate on your pronunciation and the meaning of the words . You 'll find plenty of French Christmas carols here . <h> 6 ) Watch French films and TV programmes <p> Watch French films with English subtitles to follow the plot and learn the lingo at the same time .

With practice , you could soon progress to following a French film or programme without the need for subtitles ! <h> 7 ) Choose a French language holiday <p> If self-teaching using books , recordings or any of the above are n't right for you then sign up for a French language holiday where the interaction and guidance may help you learn even quicker . <p> These are fully-immersive experiences which will help you get a deep understanding of the French way of life and culture . You 'll also pick up local expressions and sayings , giving you the confidence to chat with French speakers in any situation . <p> Find a residential French course in your favourite destination in France or Belgium and your accommodation and food will usually be included in the cost of the course .

Like our translation of the word ' ch+teau ' , the phrase ' Cathar castles ' contains a misnomer - in this case ' castle ' is entirely the right word , but ' Cathar ' is rather more questionable .

Well , why not try France ? While the idea of dressing up in spooky couture seems strange , you 'll definitely enjoy celebrating Halloween the French way . <h> Spooky beginnings <p> This age-old folklore celebration made its way to France in the early 1990 's and is becoming increasingly popular among the French masses due to the influence of American pop-culture and commercialism . <p> Halloween originated in Ireland , Britain and Northern France among the Celts tribe as a pagan Celtic harvest celebration of Samhain . October 31st marked Hallows Eve - which later evolved into Halloween - and was considered the night when dead spirits rose to float among the living . <p> The Celts frightened off evil spirits by wearing masks and lured in good spirits by preparing harvest ( fruits , breads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans embraced these traditions and established November 1st as All Saints Day ( also known as La Toussaint ) , mainly marking the end of the harvest and in honour of the holy saints . <p> Halloween celebrations have evolved since the Irish immigration of the 1840s , and finally made its way to American soil as a commercial holiday . While Halloween remains a solemn occasion for some , most of the French population entertains this spooky affair. - <h> Halloween comes to France <p> Gradually , select venues in Paris , such as The American Dream Bar , began to embrace Halloween festivities . The Cesar group later launched the Mask Museum in **27;439;TOOLONG in 1992 and encouraged the celebration of Halloween across France . Locals were encouraged to get involved in festivities when on October 24 , 1996 , a full-day Halloween carnival was held in St. Germain-en Laye . <p> - <p> Philippe Cahen , head of the innovative creative company Optos Opus , had challenged 25 artists to create Halloween-themed artworks which were then exhibited at the Victor Hugo Clinic near Arc de Triomphe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calls a culture rather than just a commercial holiday . He later created Le Samain cake in 1997 and registered the word ' Halloween ' as a world trademark . <p> Keep your eyes peeled for a bargain as shopping centres and restaurants offer Halloween specials to their customers . Cafes , bars and clubs host Halloween parties where guests dress as mummies , vampires , witches and ghosts rather than the typically American superheroes and princesses . Lately however , children prefer dressing up as American animated characters . Although trick-o-treating is becoming a popular tradition , most French children visit stores rather than going from house-to-house . The pumpkin also comes into play as the French now enjoy carving and even baking specialty cakes and tarts . <h> Celebrate Halloween French-style <p> You can kick off the Halloween celebrations in France by visiting cities like Nice or even Paris , and joining the biggest Halloween party in Paris at Le 1515 . <p> You can pick up a plump pumpkin at La Ferme de Gally ( Gally Farm ) in Gally Bailly , a pumpkin patch about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuals so you can create your very own jack-o-lanterns . It 's located on Route de Bailly + Saint-Cyr-l'Ecole 78210 , is open daily and costs no more than 4 Euros . <p> You can drive to Disneyland Paris with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle to catch the Halloween fireworks and light show . Kids can enjoy the ambience of Main Street USA as it transforms into ' Spook Street ' . Throughout the Halloween season there 's a daily Villain Parade where the spotlight is on Disney villains . Another spine-tingling attraction is the Phantom Manor where you can hop onto the doom buggies . <p> If you 're into chasing spirits , you can visit the eerie P+re Lachaise cemetery in Paris or hang out with skeletons and ancient tombstones by driving down to the Catacombs , an ossuary holding bones of six million Parisians created at the end of the 18th century . Other ghost-hunting spots include Montparnasse Cemetery and Montmartre Cemetery . While in the Normandy region , ghost sightings have been reported at Mont Saint-Michel . <p> Only a 50-minute drive outside Paris , you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Ch+teau De La Roche Guyon . For more scary adventures you can go on the Mysteries of Paris Vampire and Ghost Tour . @qwx187290 <p> Paris is a 3-hour drive from the Eurotunnel Le Shuttle Calais terminal following the A26 and A1 . <p> There 's nothing more enchanting than going to the Witch Festival ( F+te des Sorci+res ) in Chalindrey ( a 4 hour and 40-minute drive from Eurotunnel Le Shuttle 's Calais terminal , following the A26 ) to see the exhibitions of 16th century witchery .

Skiing and winter sports are great , but my favourite thing about summer is the chance to visit some of France and Europe 's best lakes . Swimming , sailing and hiking are just some of the activities I enjoy , so if like me you want to see some of Europe 's natural beauty , make sure you take a look at my selection of top European lakes to visit this summer . <h> Lake Hallstatt , Austria <p> Austria is known for its striking landscapes , and Lake Hallstatt is no exception . Located in central Austria 's Salzkammergut region , the lake is a glassy expanse of water , overlooked by green mountain peaks , while the pretty town of Hallstatt sits alongside the banks of the lake . Recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site , Hallstatt is one of Europe 's oldest inhabited settlements , and it 's an incredibly beautiful and romantic place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far reaches of Lake Hallstatt , with or without a guide to show you the way . This is a great option if you 're travelling with family as you can all relax and enjoy the scenery . Alternatively , you can rent two-person paddleboats and explore the lake 's surface at your own leisure . <p> For those of you after a more active holiday , the surrounding rocky terrain is ideal for rock climbing . There are a number of via ferrata ( protected routes with an iron cable for support ) for both beginners and intermediate climbers , which you can follow . Alternatively , chilled-out holiday-goers can simply lie back in the sun and enjoy the many grassy areas that surround the lake . <h> Lake Como , Italy <p> Near to Milan in northern Italy , Lake Como is nestled in the foothills of the Alps , and is known for being a luxury retreat destination . The lake 's deep blue waters are often used for regatta championships , and sailing is popular throughout the year . About 120 kilometres long , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can discover , however my favourite has to be Argegno . With great links to the busier destinations of Como and Bellagio , Argegno is beautifully calm , and my favourite place to hide away after a long day exploring the lake . For a luxury stay , I recommend choosing Villa Belvedere , with lakeside views , simple , chic interiors and fantastic breakfast options . <h> Activities <p> For me , exploring Lake Como on foot is unbeatable . On a sunny day I can spend hours walking around the lake , and when staying in Argegno , I 'll often walk north towards Menaggio , which takes about three hours . This walk takes you alongside the lake , so pack a lunch and take in all the glorious scenery . This route is also perfect for cyclists , and makes for a refreshing morning bike ride . <p> Lake Como is very popular with sailing fanatics , as the calm waters are great if you 're just starting out . If you 're about to sail for the first time , I thoroughly recommend the lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses here are spread out over a few days and they give you a really great introduction to the sport . They also have shorter lessons , and cater for experienced and pro-sailors . <h> Lake Geneva , France/Switzerland <p> A fantastic multicultural destination , Lake Geneva is located right on the French/Swiss border . While all the towns on the lake 's banks are officially French-speaking , you 're likely to hear several languages in one day while on the lake , including French , Swiss German and Italian . This makes it a great people-watching destination ! Geneva is one of the largest lakes in western Europe , and hosts the annual Tour du Lac rowing event , as well as being a popular yacht and catamaran racing spot . <h> Activities <p> A popular spot for visitors to Lake Geneva is Vidy Beach , just outside of central Lausanne on the northern banks of the lake . On a hot day , swimming is undoubtedly the most popular activity here , but I also love the idea of taking a stroll through the surrounding forest and parklands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclists and in-line skaters , while the water is popular with windsurfers and water-skiers .

So , with just a 35-minute journey to France on Eurotunnel Le Shuttle , all you have to do is pack up your swimming gear and hit the road . <h> What is wild swimming ? <p> With the popularity of sports such as Triathlons on the rise , wild swimming is now the choice for many swimmers . If you are n't familiar with wild swimming , then do n't worry . Wild swimming is just swimming but in natural open waters , such as rivers , lakes and sometimes even the sea . With wild swimming , all you need to do is forget about the chlorine-filled indoor pools of back home , and revel in the picturesque surroundings of the lake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lac d'Ilay <p> The stunning Lac d'Ilay is located in the Jura region of France , close to the Swiss border .

The lake is relatively large , and with the water being slightly shallow and warm , it makes for perfect conditions for a long distance swim - plus , you wo n't have to worry about any unwanted cold shocks as you jump in . <h> Lac d'Annecy <p> The Lac d'Annecy is a deep pool of aqua-blue , surrounded by striking mountains and dense forest .

Although many fine operas have been written in English and about England , they have never seemed to overtake the German , French and Italian classics that still dominate the repertoires of more traditional houses . I love being able to go to the opera and hum along to arias I 've known since childhood , but I ca n't help thinking opera would be more popular here if English composers were given as much programme space as Puccini and Wagner . <p> Still , the beauty of our close connection to Europe is that nobody needs to go without - whether you 're craving an Alpine view , a particular bottle of wine or a little light music , the continent is just 35 minutes away with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle .

And it has to be said , one of the best bits about Christmas is getting to spend time with your family and spoil them with gifts . So show them just how much they mean to you , and treat them to something a little extra special this year . If you happen to be visiting the continent any time soon , there 's still plenty of time to get some Christmas shopping in ; and if you 're not , why not plan a trip over and shop ' til you drop !

This glamorous department store has everything you could possibly want for everyone on your Christmas list , all under one roof . And if you 're stuck for stylish ideas , they even host fashion shows in store , which are sure to inspire !

Two hours of pure fairy-tale escapism is sometimes exactly what the soul needs . My search for fairy-tale goodness led me to Mont Saint-Michel , the island commune that is the inspiration behind the castle in Tangled , as well as Minas Tirith in The Lord of the Rings- films . <p> Only a four-and-a-half-hour drive from Calais , Mont Saint-Michel is a small island commune in Normandy , less than a mile from France 's coast . When I say small , this is no exaggeration . As of 2015 , the island had a population of just 50 . The island 's inhabitants are vastly outweighed by tourists- it 's visited by three million people a year , making it one of France 's most popular landmarks . <p> Mont Saint-Michel was originally inhabited by an Irish hermit and his following , prior to the sixth century . Mont Saint-Michel changed hands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Normandy in the 10th- century . <p> The Mont Saint-Michel Abbey is situated in the centre of the town , perched on the very top of the hill . All the other buildings surround its incredible structure , making it a signature landmark . The great halls , houses , shops , and fishermen and farmer 's homes have been built in gradual layers towards the bottom of the island . <p> The building of the abbey was supported by French Dukes and Kings from 966 . This was a century after Aubert , a local bishop , claimed that the Angel Gabriel wanted a church built out on an island . The church was so highly regarded that , despite the dangers of crossing the tide , there were huge pilgrimages . <p> In 1794 , the abbey was turned into a prison . Napoleon III closed it in 1863 , claiming quite rightly that it was an architectural treasure that needed to be preserved . It 's still used as a place of prayer , with monks and nuns of the Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem having resided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , you 'll notice that this is the very place where the makers of Tangled got their idea for the castle . Based on the German fairy-tale of Rapunzel , it 's another example of how Europe is the traditional home of fairy-tales . If you 're planning a tour of the myths and legends of the continent , I 'd say that this is definitely a great place to tick off your list ! <p> Animators travel all over the world trying to find stunning locations to recreate on film , and the fairy-tale magic of the abbey was exactly what the film crew behind Tangled needed . When you arrive at Mont Saint-Michel , make sure you look out for the similarities between the two castles . You 'll realise just how similar they are ! <p> Watch the Tides Change <p> The tide at Mont Saint-Michel is famous for how fast it change . <p> The Bay of Mont Saint-Michel is famed throughout the world for its fast-changing tidal variations .

The silly thing was that all that time I was making myself French toast for breakfast or pudding at least twice a week - I 'd eaten the dish all my life , but never heard its English name before . In France , we call this delicious treat ' pain perdu ' or ' lost bread ' , because it 's a great way to salvage stale bread - you simply soak the slices in milk , sugar and beaten eggs and then fry them in butter for a sweet , cakey treat . <p> Whatever you call it , French toast has spread across the world and is now popular from Chicago to Hong Kong .

Book your journey <p> Lille 's Annual Flea Market The Braderie - Millions of visitors descend in search of a bargain More than 100km of stalls for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or so the saying goes , and nowhere is this more evident than Lille 's annual flea market , The Braderie . For one weekend every September France 's fifth-largest city is closed to traffic completely as vendors of all trades and types line the streets with stalls . In a tradition reportedly dating back to medieval times , anybody can come to the city to buy or sell wares , and every year millions of visitors descend on the ancient streets in search of a bargain . Estimates suggest there are more than 100km of stalls for you to explore , which can prove a daunting prospect if you are unfamiliar with Lille and its winding medieval streets. - This Eurotunnel le Shuttle guide will help you find the best the market has to offer and make the most of your weekend . For further information www.lilletourism.com Origins of the Braderie The definite history of The Braderie appears to have been lost in time , but popular local legend has it that the event originated when medieval aristocracy gave their serfs permission to sell their old clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper classes thought the event looked so much fun they eventually joined in and soon the flea market had become an established tradition . Today anybody is free to set up a stall , with the event become a sort of massive jumble sale rather than an organised market , though serious traders often reserve their pitches weeks in advance and the city hall has also begun offering reservations . There are no restrictions on what can be bought and sold ( outside of the general legal ones of course ) so expect items of all shapes and sizes . The Braderie has become particularly well known for its antiques , with items from across Europe on offer , ranging from war memorabilia to fine art . Getting there , parking and getting around Lille is a 109km ( 1hr 15min ) drive from the Eurotunnel le Shuttle terminal in Calais . Take the A16 out of Calais , heading east , then take exit 57 towards Lille . From there the A25 will take you right to the edge of the city . City centre roads are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to park out of town and take public transport in . Just off the A25 , on the way into the city , are Porte d'Arras , C.H.R. B-Calmette and Porte des Postes car parks , where you can pay for long stay supervised parking . Both are near Metro stations , so it 's easy to leave your car and head off to explore the market . Alternative out-of-town car parks can be found north of the city in Lomme and east in Villeneuve d'Ascque . Where to shop The Braderie does not officially open until 3pm on the Saturday , so although you can browse some of the stalls in the morning it is often worth saving your energy until trading begins .

On the night of Halloween , villagers would gather for a candlelit vigil throughout the night , and children would dress up to enact the danse macabre in costume . <h> Spain <p> These days , the celebrations around Dia de los Muertos , or Day of the Dead , are most commonly associated with Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time of year is marked to honour lost friends and relatives , and to remember them and pray for their souls . The Festival traditionally lasts three days , from 31st October until 2nd November , and it 's this final day that is the famous Day of the Dead . <p> In Mexico , there are brightly coloured , vibrant parades held all across the country , honouring the dead with sugar skulls , marigolds and the favourite foods of the deceased . In Spain , there are similar festivals and parades around the country , culminating at the end of the day with people gathering in cemeteries to pray over the graves of their families , leaving flowers , candles or other offerings . <h> Visiting Europe with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle <p> If you 've been left feeling inspired to visit Europe and discover more about the many different cultures across the continent , there 's no easier way to get there than with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle .

But for sheer inventiveness , we ca n't hold a candle to the Continent . All across Europe ancient traditions and curious customs have hung on to the modern day to become tourist attractions - and with our handy guide to some of the most unusual festivals and events , you can avoid the crowds and experience something truly different . <h> Battle of the Oranges , Ivrea <p> Inspired by the story of a young woman who saved herself from a tyrannical baron by cutting off his head , the largest food fight in Italy is a citrussy carnival held less than a day 's drive from Eurotunnel Le Shuttle in Calais . The Battle of the Oranges is held on the Sunday , Monday and Tuesday directly before Lent begins , so the next event will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind nets or wear a symbolic red cap to avoid being hit , but beware of stray flying oranges ! <h> Festa della Madonna Bruna , Matera , Italy <p> Many Italian towns hold ceremonies venerating the Virgin Mary , but none of them are quite like the ritual performed every year in the southern Italian city of Matera . On July 2nd , ' shepherds ' and ' knights ' parade through the streets from dawn to announce the arrival of a huge , gorgeously decorated float depicting the Madonna , which is led through the streets under police guard . However , no sooner has the statue arrived at Matera 's beautiful cathedral then the crowd tears it apart in a potent symbol of rebirth and freedom . A truly memorable spectacle . <h> Wattol++mpiade , Brunsb++ttel , Germany <p> Say goodbye to the idea that Germans are always sensible and efficient when you visit the Mud Olympics , held each year in the coastal town of Brunsb++ttel . Well under a day 's drive from Calais , this indescribable two-day event - which celebrated its 10th anniversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a muddy version of Woodstock and all sorts of other activities ( as long as they involve mud ) .

Held on the second Sunday in August ( this year it 's on August 13th ) , this incredible celebration of all things porky includes piglet races , black pudding eating competitions and the hotly contested Cri de Cochon or pig-squealing contest . As you 'd expect , the food is magnificent - and with the mountains on one side of you and the surf of Biarritz on the other , there are plenty of ways to work off the calories ! <h> La Tomatina , Bu+ol , Spain <p> One of Spain 's oddest and best known festive events , Bu+ol 's annual tomato battle is held on the last Wednesday of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a week-long festival . In one hour , the twenty thousand participants throw around 150,000 tomatoes at each other , painting the town centre red with juice . You 're free to watch or spectate , but be aware that from this year the town has started to charge a G10 entry fee ; tickets can be bought online here . <h> Brussels International Tattoo Convention <p> Somewhat more modern than the other festivals on this list , the Brussels International Tattoo Convention nevertheless offers an opportunity to experience a culture unfamiliar to most . The fifth BITC will take place from November 10th-12th , with incredible displays of the tattooist 's art available to all comers . The convention also includes a fashion show , art auctions , a wide variety of musical and burlesque acts and various shops , bars and more .

Ideally located just a few hours ' drive from Calais , this is an opportunity to watch a new European tradition slowly finding its feet . <p> We 've chosen festivals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can factor them into a gentle road trip and see the sights along the way . The best general advice for visiting one of these festivals is to make doubly sure of the dates it 's happening , perhaps arriving a day or two before so you know where you need to be and where it 's safe to leave your car . It 's also good to remember that , particularly in Spain and Italy , many quaint local festivals are religious in nature - have a good time , but try not to get in the way of the townspeople . @qwx187290 <p> Wherever you 're heading in Europe , the best possible start to your holiday is a quick , cheap and hassle-free journey from the UK with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle .

However , if you fancy heading ' off the beaten track ' and experiencing a different side of France , then here are five places that you simply must drive to . With the freedom of your car , I know you 'll enjoy cruising through France and stopping off at some of my favourite pit stops . <h> 1 . Drive along the Route du Champagne ... <p> I recommend stopping off at the champagne houses between Reims and Epernay - there are so many to choose from and you 'll have the opportunity to meet local producers who 'll teach you everything you want to know about champagne . <p> - <p> Champagne vineyard <p> Here are a few of my favourite places to visit en-route : <p> Champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heart of the Montagne de Reims wine area . They offer tasting sessions from March to December when the vines are in season , and take it from me , the champagne is exquisite . <p> Champagne De Castellane If you 're looking for somewhere a little different to the large champagne houses , then De Castellane offers something more low-key but equally as exciting . You have the opportunity to visit the museum and climb the historic tower , all topped off with another glass of bubbly ! <p> Champagne Jean Milan This family-run champagne house is located in Oger near Epernay . It 's one of my favourite places to stop on the route ; I love the simplicity and family feel . Five generations of wine makers have worked in these vineyards since 1864 and have produced the finest grapes for prestigious names such as Veuve Cliquot and Krug . You can finish your tour of Jean Milan with you 've guessed it , more champagne ! <h> 2 . Visit Bayonne ... <p> The capital of the French Basque Country and the birthplace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful places in south-west France . The region is renowned for producing some of the finest chocolates in the country .

At the end of the outing , you 'll have the opportunity for a ' choctastic ' tasting session . <p> While you 're in Bayonne , it 's worth exploring the city too ; there 's so much to see and do , and it was recently recognised for its exceptional cultural heritage . If you 're interested in history , I recommend a visit to the Basque Museum Bayonne ! <h> 3 . Visit some of the most exciting and cultural markets ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever been to ; there is a distinct lack of hurry and haste , but there 's a certain magic about French markets that I can not describe . <p> - <p> Metz Market <p> Here are a few of my favourites : <p> Metz Covered Market This historic market is one of the oldest in France , and is home to over 40 different stalls .

What a perfect way to spend an evening in Paris ! <h> 5 . Jump on a ferry at Normandy and head over to Le Mont-Saint-Michel ... <p> If you 're interested in the history and culture of France , then you must visit Mont Saint Michel , " The Wonder of the Western World " and the most beautiful piece of architecture that you are likely to see in northern France .

I love going to the cinema in my spare time , so when it comes to travelling through Europe , I 'm often on the lookout for film locations to visit . Here are some of my favourite spots , for movie buffs to enjoy . <h> Pan 's Labyrinth - Spain <p> Undoubtedly one of my favourite films , Pan 's Labyrinth is a haunting tale of life under the Franco regime , in 1940s Spain . As her mother falls increasingly i 'll , and her surroundings become more and more distressing , the main character Ofelia wanders upon an overgrown labyrinth and inside finds a faun , who gives her a series of tasks to complete . <p> This scene , as well as those showing the rebels ' camp , is shot in and around the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are fun to explore on foot .

Many of the battle scenes were shot at St. Peter 's Cemetery , so if you have time , I 'd recommend visiting this spot during your stay . <p> - <p> Mirabelle Gardens and Mirabelle Palace were used for The Sound of Music <h> The Bourne Supremacy - Berlin , Germany <p> If you 're a fan of action films , you 've probably seen the Bourne series , a fast-paced set of films that focus around Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon ) , former Treadstone operative , who is trying to piece together his identity .

There are loads of other spots in Berlin where the film was shot , so why not see how many you can find . <p> - h <p> Walter-Benjamin Platz features in several scenes of The Bourne Supremacy <h> Why not use this list of film locations during your next trip to Europe ? <p> Travelling with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle will take you from Folkestone to Calais in just 35 minutes , so you 'll be looking out for movie stars in no time . @qwx187293 @qwx187287 @qwx187296

With a history dating back to the Middle Ages , I love exploring Audresselles ' past through its fascinating town centre and sea front , which is home to traditional flobarts ( small boats ) that are still in use today . With such a thriving fishing culture here , it 's only natural that the local cuisine centres around seafood . <p> Delicious fresh fish and crustaceans take pride of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where you can order a whole crab ( if you know how to dismantle it ! ) Local activities make the most of Audresselles ' natural beauty and wildlife , and the first time my family and I visited , we went searching on foot for mussels , shrimp and crabs .

When the weather is fine , try taking a stroll along one of the marked hiking trails which line the coast " you wo n't be disappointed . <h> Wissant <p> Wissant , which translates to white sand ' in English , is a thriving village most famous for its vast beach . During low tide , the beach is a vast stretch of flat sand , and is perfect for sports such as windsurfing and kite flying .

If you 're a fan of seafood , you must try the seafood platter ! <p> When it comes to exploring the town of Ambleteuse , there are some great historical spots found in and around town . You 'll see a 17th century fort , Fort Mahon , alongside the Slack river , while the river itself boasts many different types of flora , and I love taking the kids here to teach them a little about nature . I ask them to see how many different types of plants they can spot " but it 's important that they do n't pick any as some are quite rare !

It 's a great activity on a rainy day . <h> Wimereux <p> The seaside town of Wimereux is really charming , and it 's still a hidden gem when compared with much of the coast around Calais . Of all my favourite towns near to Calais , Wimereux arguably has the most to offer . It 's got a stunning beach , with a scenic promenade lined with beach huts , a fantastic culinary scene and there 's even an impressive 18-hole golf course . 19th century Victorian buildings dominate much of the town centre , and on an especially clear day , you can see the white cliffs of Dover from the coast ! <p> If I 'm treating my family to a special day out , we often go horse riding along the beach , which is great fun .

So , book a quick 35-minute journey with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle , and make your way over to Europe to sample some of these culinary delights . <h> Galette des Rois <p> The galette des rois , or sometimes king 's cake , is one of my favourite European treats , and it 's something I always look forward to when celebrating King 's Day , or Epiphany , back at home in France . This delicious dessert gained its name from the hidden treat inside the centre of the cake ; it was said that whoever found the hidden broad bean inside could play at being king for the day . Nowadays , fortunately , the broad beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember when I was little , filling up with excitement as my mother cut through the cake , and I love seeing the exact same thrill when my own children discover the small prize " we all deserve to be kings and queens for one day . <p> Enjoy a slice of galette des rois <p> The recipe of galette des rois tends to change from one region to the next ; in Northern France the cake consists of a delicate pastry , filled with rich frangipane and a hidden porcelain toy . In Southern France , the cake is made from brioche and formed into a circular shape , covered in delicately placed candied fruit ; perfect for when you 're enjoying a cup of coffee in the Mediterranean warmth . <h> Prinsesst+rta <p> The Swedish prinsesst+rta , or princess cake , ( pictured at the top of the page ) , was given this name because of how fond the Prince of Sweden 's daughters were of this beautiful treat . In episode six of this year 's GBBO , the bakers were put to the test and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite difficult to do . <p> The cake itself is made up of varying levels of sponge cake , which are sandwiched between alternating layers of delicious custard , raspberry jam and cr+me patisserie , all topped with a dome of rich , whipped cream . To complete the look of the traditional prinsesst+rta , the cake and dome of cream is covered with a layer of green marzipan , and finished with a pink marzipan rose . <h> Gugelhupf <p> Gugelhupf is a German Bundt cake , made from soft yeast and filled with an assortment of raisins , almonds and kirschwasser , a sweet cherry brandy . Once baked , the cake is of a tall , ring shape and is often finished with a dusting of white icing sugar , giving it a traditional , festive feel . Although this is the traditional recipe , many local restaurants and bakeries create tasty alternatives , from chocolate to cinnamon flavour . <p> While travelling , you 're more likely to come across a slice of gugelhupf in southern Germany , amongst the Bavarian districts of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cup of coffee and a slice of gugelhupf , as you sit back and admire the beautiful Bavarian scenery . <h> Pretzel <p> The Pretzel is another German classic that has infiltrated the US and UK , making it now a common addition to our local bakeries and supermarkets . These tasty , savoury snacks originated in the middle ages , and are said to have been created in the monasteries by German monks . Nowadays pretzels are enjoyed in a variety of ways , from a sprinkling of rock salt to a syrupy coating of shaved almonds and sugar . <p> Tasty pretzel for a snack <p> To get the classic look of a pretzel , bakers create strong bread dough and twist it to make the classic shape . The dough is then treated with lye ( a high PH solution ) and sliced with a knife ; this gives the finished pretzel the glossy look and opened split that is traditional within southern Germany . <h> Fancy a slice ? <p> If this list of tasty treats has got your mouth watering , then start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether you 're heading to France or Germany , a trip to Calais from the UK only takes 35-minutes with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle ; plus , there are n't any luggage restrictions , so you can bring back as many cakes and bakes as you like . @qwx187293 @qwx187287 @qwx187297

From warming stews to bowls of soup , Britain has some of the most comforting foods , but what about Europe ? In this post , I look at my top three favourite meals from around Europe , from Italy to Germany . If one of these dishes takes your fancy , then all you have to do is hop on board Eurotunnel Le Shuttle and make the quick journey across the Channel , where before you know it , you 'll be enjoying a range of delicious recipes . <h> Pasta Alla Norma <p> Apparently named after the famous Vincenzo Bellini opera , Norma , this mouth-watering pasta dish is a Sicilian classic , which originates from the city of Catania on the east coast of the island . Freshly made rigatoni is boiled and then served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slice of grilled aubergine and layers of grated ricotta cheese . Whether you 're sat at home and in need of a comforting recipe , or find yourself in a Sicilian restaurant looking to try a well-loved classic , this dish ticks all the boxes . <p> In the mood for some delicious comfort food ? Take a look at the recipe for Pasta Alla Norma , and try it for yourself . <h> Fondue <p> Fondue is a popular dish across Europe and beyond , but its original culinary home is Switzerland , and was even advertised as the Swiss national dish during the 1930s . Since then , it 's become a popular choice for parties across France ( my kids love it whenever we go back home ) and Italy , as well as the perfect meal when you 're in need of something comforting . <p> Traditionally , all you do to create this is simply melt a selection of your favourite cheeses , add a couple of glugs of white wine and a handful of garlic cloves - it 's very easy .

Picked as one of Germany 's national dishes , this meal consists of beef that 's been marinated over a couple of days , in a mixture of wine or vinegar , water , herbs and spices - the types of spices and herbs used tend to differ in each of the country 's regions . The point of the marinade is that , not only does it flavour the meat , it also tenderises it prior to cooking , meaning that you can pick out more affordable cuts from your butchers . <p> Once the beef is ready to cook , all you have to do is sear the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it to stew over a few hours , until the meat flakes away under slight pressure . Once served with rotkohl ( red cabbage ) and kartoffelkl++e ( potato dumplings ) it makes for the perfect winter recipe . <p> - <p> Nothing warms you up like a plate of sauerbraten . <h> In the mood for one of these tasty meals ? <p> Then make the quick 35-minute journey across the Channel with Eurotunnel Le Shuttle , so that you can drive on over to your destination of choice , and enjoy a bowl of your favourite European comfort food today . @qwx187293 @qwx187287 @qwx187297
