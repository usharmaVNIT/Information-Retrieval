I do not have a fenced in yard , so my tortoise pen is all I have unless I drag my x-pen out . Now if I remove the tortoises and let the rabbits in their pen for playtime , is there anything that they can pass between the two species ? I obviously wo n't have them in together ( unless that 's ok ? But I doubt it ) but I did n't know about like bunny poop and tortoise poop carrying anything that would harm the other . <p> Hey there , I ca n't vouch for cross contamination but I have seen desert species kept with bunnies in a zoo ( more a glorified kids farm ) but all the animals were well cared for and healthy there . Like I said I have no idea about pathogens but these sulcatas and flop eared things got on fine . <p> Hmmm .... they eat a lot of the same stuff , so I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other would probably hurt . I think it was brought to our attention in another thread a while back that sulcatas do take advantage of the plentiful amounts of " pre-digested " vegetation from all the native ungulates in their natural environments . Rabbit candy should n't hurt them . <p> Over all , I think I would worry more about the rabbits getting harmed more than the tortoises . Can Salmonella bacteria harm rabbits ? <p> Why ca n't you build a separate enclosure and not take the chance with the rabbits or sulcata ? I would n't risk it and I do n't think it is really a good idea to house fosters in a manner that is not really proper . Most fosters have to have proper housing available to become a foster . Housing the two together is not proper housing for either . Why not put the xpen inside the sulcata pen . At least that way they ca n't get to each other . <p> I was n't going to let them in together at the same time , like . I said unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have an indoor area for the torts so for about an hour a day switching them indoors then letting the buns have some outdoor time . The rabbits usually have mostly full run of my house when I 'm home , but as someone here pointed out , they eat relatively the same foods , so the flower bed I have planted for the torts and the grass and weeds , would be a nice snack for the buns in addition to their regular diet . The only reason I ask is because right now I have a litter of 3 buns about 10wks old , and the tort pen is bigger than my xpen by at least 5x . Just figured I would give them the extra room . <p> I think this question would best be answered by an experienced exotics vet . Many parasites and pathogens are very host specific . But some are not . There is certainly a salmonella risk to the rabbits if they ingest the tortoise poo , but unless the rabbits are shedding a parasite that could infect a reptile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I really do n't know how much risk there is to the tortoises . There might be some huge risk . That I ( we ) just do n't know about , or there might be no risk at all . Sorry , wish I knew more . I can say that I would not take the risk until I got a good answer from someone who I felt was qualified to answer something so complex . <p> I do n't know where you live ? But here in the high desert and surrounding desert areas have CDTs and cottontail and jackrabbits .... I know here at our place the cottontail often reside in the burrows and hides right along with the torts .... I know that they pass each other all over the desert and many critters reside within the burrows of CDTs/DTs .... now , I would not say that you should take my word for anything .... but it is not something that I worry about here ( heck , quail and snakes and such also co habitat with the torts here in the desert .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with rabbits at my work , as a couple people had mentioned , I guess I would be more worried about the salmonella risk . My vet says she does n't think there is a huge risk , since I pick up daily , but with her not dealing with herps , as Tom suggested , I am going to wait til I talk to my torts vet .

I have a 6 inch ornate box turtle and my little baby sulcata and i have read that they can not be around each other due to some microbe or something that they carry that will kill the other . but i can not find out exactly how or what it is that is so bad for the other ? i like to give them free time in the house and when it gets warmer in the yard ... but i only have one house and yard so how can i keep it safe without keeping one caged up all the time ( which of coarse would have to be the box turtle since she wo n't get as big as a small car lol ) ... is it something in their poop or what ? i would love for them to meet and hang out together when my little guy ( still cant decide on a dang name lol ) gets a little bigger but only if it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me exactl what it is that 's so bad and how it is transfered to the other , and what it does as well as how to prevent it from happening . <p> It is a bit like Russian roulette .... maybe you will be the one that squeaks by and never end up with a sick or dying tortoise or turtle ..... on the other hand that is exactly what you may end up with .... its that draw of chance that you will have to decide on ... me personally would not take those odds taking into account the negative side of the draw ... <p> Another this.g you will want to take into thought is ... you are fully aware of the ultimate size of your sullie so there would be physical damage that will be a genuine hazard .... now , then there is the issue that each species has evolved with the ability to ward off certain types of bacteria and such so with their own species the bacteria and such are not foreign .. but throw in the mix one smothers set of species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turtles are both notorious poo sniffers ... vouchers ... eaters that the swap of bacteria and such can prove lethal ... <p> Somewhat like when we travel abroad we should get certain shots to prevent ourselves from being at increased risks of catching some foreign germ .. bacteria prominent in different parts of the world ... due to even that mere new exposure can wreak havoc from person to person due to the lack of exposure which in turn makes one vulnerable to a host of goodies .... now , this may not be the best example but the one that came to mind .. <p> Let me give you a real world example . A keeper has hinged-backs and red-footeds . These two species are closely related by DNA which means anything that one gets , the other can get as well . This can be worms , flagellates , mites , diseases , and every other form of pathogen known that passes in droppings , physical contact , secondary infection ( infecting a substrate or water dish then the other animal touching the same thing ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean and have been for millions of years . The germs in both groups has had a long time to mutate and specialize , and both species have had a long time to grow some immunity to the pathogens . <p> Using a typical quarantine period helps minimize SOME pathogen cross-contamination , but not all of it since many germs can dwell in the system in a state of low activity until some stressful event causes the pathogens to bloom and shed- now infecting the other species . The newly infected species has little resistance and often does not do well . <p> There are dozens of other real-life examples . - Gopher tortoises kept captive , even for a short while , then released to the wild have brought pathogens to wild populations with little resistance and cause wide-spread illness . - Europeans bringing disease to natives in North and South America , etc. - Cattle from one region are generally restricted from travelling to other regions without documentation . - International restrictions exist on importing everything from certain invertebrates to lots of kinds of plants just to minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also in place ) . <p> Thousands of keepers violate this rule every day and most of the time nothing bad seems to happen . However , it often bites the keeper in the bottom when the tortoises that have been quietly harboring infections all this time are stressed then start doing badly . <p> The best and most simple solution is to keep animals from different regions apart , period . The most commonly used method is to put them together and hope for the best . <p> By the way , this all ignores the detail that box turtles and sulcata do not come from very similar habitats to begin with . <p> Apologies .... using my dumb smart phone and it changes ... adds words it likes better .... so in my second section of prior post the word " smothers " should have been " others " .... and the word " vouchers " should have been " touches " ... <p> And along with what Mark said ... turtles and tortoises are sick for a very , very long time before you notice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even years , and when one eventually shows symptoms and dies , they 've been together for so long that you do n't realize that living together is the reason for the sickness/death . <p> Yes the do come from different habitats but again I am not talking about housing together . Both have heir own separate enclosures in seperate rooms and even in seperate levels of te house . What I am wondering is if I let one out to roam the house or yard then after that one goes in his or her cage then I bring he other out , is there any fear of one catching something then ? And yes I do realize sulcatas get very large ( note the " size of a small car " comment lol ! ) I realize turtles and torts do not " play " in the sense that we think of , but let 's say I have both roaming he house or yard together , what 's the best and worst case scenario that potentially could happen . Keep on mind this hypothetical situation would be supervised so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the germs subject lol . <p> It 's not only one microbe exchanged between closely related animals , but many . If they live together - or even near to each other - they are going to swap bacteria , archaea , fungi , and protists with each other . Many of these organisms are commensal ( harmless ) , some mutualistic ( beneficial ) , and a few parasitic or pathogenic ( disease-causing ) . If animals are not adapted to living together ( like two species from opposite sides of the world ) , then they should not be forced to do so . That applies not only to turtles , but to animals in general , including humans and other primates . <p> However , I hasten to add that some turtle species do appear to be adapted to cohabitation with certain other species . For example , when you look at pond turtles on a log , they may be from several different species ( painted , sliders , cooters , chicken turtle , etc . ) . Moreover , underwater those same turtles may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface ( snappers , mud turtles , musk turtles , etc . ) . In that type of a system , those animals may have adaptations for sharing germs ( microbes ) with other species . Granted , an individual introduced from a far away community could introduce dangerous new parasites or pathogens . However , as long as there are no foreign pathogens around , I think such species can safely be kept with other species , but only those with which they have co-evolved . <p> When you look at terrestrial systems , though , it 's a different story . How many species of turtle do you find on land in a given environment ? Usually one , rarely two , almost never three , and to my knowledge , four is unheard of . For example , here in North America , you may find Gopherus tortoises coexisting with one type of box turtle or another , so there may be two terrestrial species living in the same ecosystem . Generally , though , it 's only one species : sulcatas in the Sahel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes redfoots and yellowfoots cross paths , but they usually do n't . Ditto with Greek and Hermann tortoises . <p> The point of all this is that , while pond turtle immune systems may be fine with cohabitating , terrestrial turtle immune systems probably are not . If animals do adapt to new pathogenic microbes , then that takes eons - and we ca n't afford to wait that long . <p> I do n't think he " wants " them to interact . I think he just did not understand why one could n't wander the yard and then the other and right now they are the same size . I guess the simplistic explanation is that torts can carry diseases that can kill a turtle and turtles can carry a virus that can kill a tort but it does n't happen in the wild because their species never cross so they have no immunity to eachothr <p> I agree with all the above posts , but ..........

Every living animal carries its own load of viruses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised in a sterile bubble , and as we said , when these pathogens are exposed to animals that are not resistant , bad things can happen . <p> Really good cares ( UVB , good diet , etc. ) work wonders to prevent the stress that causes pathogens to ' bloom ' in the host , then shed and get picked up by others . <p> And , of course , most of the pathogens we are talking about are pretty mild , like the common cold . It is like the classic bell curve- some small number of situations like this will result in absolutely nothing happening . A big hill in the middle represents the bulk of the situations- something happens but is not a big deal- possibly not even noticed by the keepers .

Mycoplasma probably wo n't be carried long without expressing itself , and your turtle and tortoise are almost certainly free from it . I do n't think either of your species are on the radar list for herpes either . <p> Many keepers do exactly what you 're proposing . I do n't , but many others do . It is not advisable because of the possibility one could be carrying something , but the real risk is probably somewhat low . If I had to put money on it , I 'd say both will be perfectly fine . But you need to know that it is a real risk . From what you 're reading in the above posts , I can see that you now know there is a risk ! <p> The most likely problem would come from your wild-caught box turtle and could be transmitted to your tortoise .

I 'm sorry for insulting you in any way , I wished only to express my exasperation at you wishing me to care for Walter at the expense of my toads . The toads , if you 've read about them in other posts of mine have great sentimental value to me . I would no sooner surrender them then stamp out their species . They are both key participants in a breeding program to save their species which is pretty much gone here . For your information I am not underage , I live at home because my Mother is mildly infirm and I take care of her when she 's having bad days . Her garden is her only passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great sacrifice by her . If you 've ever dealt with anyone infirm you would realize how much they prize certain things . <p> There are a couple of toads ( Bufo speciosus ) - and a fence lizard , as well - that come into both my Hermann 's enclosure and my daughter 's Ornate Box enclosure and everyone seems to get along fine ... the toads ( and , presumably , the lizard ) catch bugs attracted to the **26;0;TOOLONG food and drink/soak in the water dishes , but that 's about all the interaction , apparently . <p> No idea if your toads would be a threat to your tort or not ... what kind of toads have you ? <p> If the toads are a species native to your area ( or one that was ) , then I would n't worry too much . I have n't kept toads so I have n't done it myself , nor am I familiar with that species ; however I have seen wild toads ( and snakes , lizards , etc ) in my tortoise enclosures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall said : <p> There are a couple of toads ( Bufo speciosus ) - and a fence lizard , as well - that come into both my Hermann 's enclosure and my daughter 's Ornate Box enclosure and everyone seems to get along fine ... the toads ( and , presumably , the lizard ) catch bugs attracted to the **26;28;TOOLONG food and drink/soak in the water dishes , but that 's about all the interaction , apparently . <p> No idea if your toads would be a threat to your tort or not ... what kind of toads have you ? <p> I 'm planning the construction of a large pen for Walter during the summer and I was curious if my two toads could live in it with her ?

So all of mine are already in because of the temp , not because of the rain . However , in some areas , like AZ in summer or the deep south anytime , warm rain is pretty typical . In that case , I would let the quantity of rain be the determining factor . If they were getting wet from a warm rain on a warm day , I think that is awesome .

She is going on 3 years and has been living outside since last September . She eats hibiscus , Mexican petunia , geraniums , roses , some herbs , spider plant and cucumber plants form the yard . I also feed her Kale and green leafy vegetables from the store . The plants she eats have not been organic nor have I re-potted or waited for new growth before I let her eat ( like I see some say to do on other threads ) . She roams around the yard in the morning then goes into the habitat and comes out later in the afternoon before she goes to bed . <p> My yard is being taken over by weeds and a lot of tiny bugs ( gnats , mites etc . ) . What can I use or what if I spray one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . The roses and some other plants are being killed by the pests . Please help ... Thank you <p> I would like to see an answer as well . We just planted a garden full of veggies we can share with Kronk- but I do n't know what to do if it comes to pesticides . I 'd like to keep it organic for us all , but as of now I do n't know how long we will be able to hold out . <p> Best weed killer ever ? Hands . And add a little elbow grease . Seriously , most weed killers are toxic to the soil ( RoundUp stays in the soil for 25 years according to former USDA soil scientist Lt. Col. Don Huber ) They are toxic to bees , to butterflies and my guess is our own DNA gets some of it , too . Tortoises do not need anything sprayed around them , not even from your neighbors , I strongly believe it can hurt them . <p> Second best weed killer ever ? Sulcata . Them sullies love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us/them . Full of nutrients . <p> Pests are a sign that your plants are weak , weakened . Nature , survival of the fittest . Pests , parasites , bad bugs will always attack the weak plant , animal , human . If your plants are amended with organic things , they will be stronger . Not as instant gratification as some petroleum based products . Chemical fertilizers weaken the cell walls and in time create very weak plants . Weak plants , again , attract pest and eventual death . Nature has now eliminated the weak . Also , amend or even change your soil if it is in pots . Healthy soil = healthy plants = no bugs bugging . It all begins with the soil . <p> Maybe you can post pics of the weeds that you are looking at and we can chime in if they are edible or not for your sulcata . If they are good to eat , you can let your tortoise graze , or spoil her by taking your scissors and serving them on her plate . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can use food grade DE . It has to be food grade , the other DE is used to clean pools and is poisonous . You just sprinkle it around and it kills a lot of different types of bugs . It is safe for your tortoise although when I used it I sprayed it in the enclosure then waited a couple days before I put the tortoise out there , I 'm just paranoid sprinkle it around lightly and then leave it , do n't get it wet or it wo n't work . <p> As far as a weed killer , I think this is the right recipe . 1 gallon white vinegar , 2 cups Epson salt , 1/4 cup blue Dawn dishwashing soap . Mix it well and spray it on the plants . It kills whatever plant you spray it on however so make sure it 's just what you want to be dead I used it and it worked very well .

It does not matter if they are " organic " or not , or if you replanted them or not . Plants purchased from any source that were grown in a commercial nursery are full of all sorts of systemic toxic chemicals . They put the chemical granules in the soil that the plants are grown in and the plants absorb the toxins into their cells so that the bugs wo n't eat them . Keeps decorative plants looking nice and pretty for resale . They do n't intend for tortoise owners to buy these plants and feed them to their animals . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

My chickens have the back yard to themselves while my tortoise is in an enclosed area . <p> My chickens are n't to keen on anything that moves so they stay away .

Vulturine guinea fowl are very cool , however . If you let either have access to the tortoise pen , you will be feeding your tortoises a lot of crap , literally .

How many tortoise , what species and what size ? <p> Coco coir does hold moisture as well as anything else . Your problem is not the substrate , your problem is the wide open top and low walls allowing the enclosure air to mix with the room air that is too dry . A closed chamber will help contain your humidity and heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mixture . Does it ALWAYS cause an impaction ? No . Can it ? Yes . I 've seen plenty of cases in the offices of my vet friends . The risk is not worth it . <p> Coco coir works well for me with young Testudo species . For other species I prefer orchid bark . <p> I do n't like " soil " , " top soil " or " loam " because you have no idea what it is made of . It is a combination of some sort composted plant matter mixed with other things , but what is it ? Is it oleander ? Is it grass and mulberry leaves ? Azaleas and roses sprayed with pesticides ? I 'd rather use a product that tells me exactly what all the ingredients are . Something that I know to be safe from years of people using it . <p> Ooook ... I did n't really want to start a fight or anything people . I was n't complaining about anyone here and I 'm sorry if it came off that way . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours researching stuff all over the internet in three different languages and I 've come up with sooo much info that I just do n't know what to do anymore . I ended up registering on this forum because it sounds like people really know their stuff here and I can actually ask question as well . I guess I forgot to mention that the enclosure is for two little Hermann 's tortoises . They 're both around 11 months old and not bigger than 5cm . I had a Tortoise table build for them but it broke and I had to find something that would last a couple of months until I can build a new one . Is the size really too small for that purpose ? ... The original table I had was 120x60 and I was gon na go for 150x60 for the next table I build . I chose a rabbit cage because people use plastic containers all the time and it was the biggest I could find . I use the wire top to set up my lamps . The standarts and opinions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany . Vets , breeders and forums are generally against keeping mediterranean tortoises in anything that has high walls because it wo n't allow for sufficient air flow . Anyway ... I just got scared about the sand mix they 're in right now and wanted to know if I need to change the substrate to something else entirely and whether I might 've just picked a bad brand of coco coir . Maybe something with less of those long strings . I 'll just add a couple of pics of my current set up ... <p> Do n't worry , not you that 's started anything . You really should change your enclosure though . That is really not a good one for tortoises . If you used a closed chamber or even one with solid higher sides and cover most of the enclosure you will find that the humidity will work much more easy for you . Also , the coir is kane of the best , only thing I use . It does hokd humdiity in a proper enclosure really well , if not the best and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pat it down tightly , it does n't stick to them as easily . <p> To everyone else , Continue with helpful info not mud slinging . Everyone has their mixture that works for them . Although lots of us do n't like sand or dirt , it 's not like the tortoises will never encounter it in the wild . A nice post about the dangers of it is all that is needed . Keep personal feelings out please . <p> How high does the humidity need to be because our climate is fairly humid here and so is the room usually . I sprayed the enclosure this morning and humidity is at 69% right now . It usually does n't go below 60% . It 's just the substrate that gets dry and dusty ... Do I maybe not wet it enough ? How often and how much water should be put into the substrate ? <p> I do n't know for your species , but @HermanniChris can help you on that . The slate is fine . Many will put that or flat rocks under the basking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basking temp . A temp gun is a perfect tool to have for that . They are pretty cheap around 10 bucks or so . <p> Spraying the substrate wo n't help much . Actually pour water into it and stir it all around with your hands . You do n't want it soupy but you wanted to hold it 's shape if you pressed it with your hands . Check out the species specific section for information for your type of tortoise , sorry I ca n't remember what they are right now . I also found it overwhelming at first , conflicting information everywhere . It is difficult when you ca n't trust pet stores , vets , or books . Or half of what you read on the Internet . But this forum is the best place to get the information you need . Do n't worry about your post starting an argument , it happens to us all . People are very passionate about their tortoises here .

You see I 've only taken Dale outside a couple of times ( actually about 5 times ) since we got him at Christmas and he 's only 6 inches long so although my cats were interested in this little creature I would n't let them get too close because I was n't sure . My 22 year old son laughed at me because he says that a tortoise has natural protection he has a shell , but I thought I would ask the experts for their advice .

Thank you for letting me know about it and I will defintely turn this information over to my 22 year old son . Dale 's just too little to take any chances with . Candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats . Big Bubba ca n't be bothered about the tortoises as long as they do n't eat his food and Lil Roxie loves to sleep with the babies under the basking lights . So in defense of cats , I think every cat is different and it all depends on how you introduce the torts to the cats ... I think cats mostly do n't care about torts . <p> I agree that normally cats get along rather well with the torts . A hatchling , in my mind is n't safe with anything . Did n't you say your tort was 6 " ? It should be pretty safe at that size . Cats do sometimes paw at a tort , especially when it moves . The claw could scratch and cause harm , but normally I do n't see mine really using claws . Mine more do soft paw touches on them . They could easily flip a tort and unless it ended up in the water or under the lamps , that too probably wo n't do serious damage . <p> That being said , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cats hurting the torts , but because cats do sometimes think substrate is a nice place to go to the bathroom . Another worry I have is with the heat lamps . My cats loved it when they could sneak into the tort pens and get under those lights . They would sleep side by side with the basking torts , until they were caught doing it and removed . One day , I saw my long haired cat stretch up into the light . To the smell of burning hair , I grabbed the smoking cat out of harm 's way . She never realized the danger she was in . Worse was the potential for her to start really burning , panicking and running through the house setting it on fire . <p> That is something to think about . I have two older cats and two younger ones . One is really mean and she loves to kill the fruit rats that come next door and across the back alley . In fact I just saved one from her a couple of months ago ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no way out ) . Which makes me think of something just as important as the cats hurting Dale would be the fruit rats outside . That just came into my mind . I had asked before about using a dog run for his outside enclosure so that he 's safe when he 's outside , but I remember now reading a posting about a rat chewing on a torts leg and hurting him very badly here not to long ago .

Well long story short I took two of the kittens and another lady took two and another lady took one ( that ended going to Germany with her son ) . I did n't think that they would make it but they did . I could n't get rid of them because they 're grey tabbies and nobody wanted them . So one is now my son 's ( Alexander ) .

Hagan Quite often there is confusion in identifying two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Argentine tortoise , Geochelone chilensis , is quite easily distinguished from the other two South American tortoises , looking at first glance much like one of the tortoises belonging to the genus Gopherus . <p> Geochelone denticulata and G. carbonaria are the two tortoises which are often misidentified , particularly by many of the animal dealers who supply these attractive tortoises . Geochelone denticulata is commonly called " yellow leg " tortoise and G. carbonaria is frequently known as " red leg " tortoise . Use of these common names causes confusion , due to the fact that the so-called " red legs " sometimes have red legs , sometimes yellow and very often , any shade in between the two . Many dealers use coloring as their only means of identification , listing a G. carbonaria with yellow legs asG . denticulata . <p> No one characteristic can be used to identify these two tortoises ; it takes a combination of differences to properly identify them . It is hoped that the following text and diagrams will be helpful in identifying these two South American tortoises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold true in the majority of specimens examined . Others are not as stable and will vary from specimen to specimen of species being examined . <p> G. denticulata , which appears to be the species less often displayed in collections , is the larger of the two . Specimens sometimes reach a length of nearly 26 inches . Carapace of both young and adult is a uniform light brown , with lighter yellow-brown centers in each shield . The young denticulate tends to show some concentric grooving or ringing of the shields on the carapace , but larger specimens show very little , if any . <p> The concentric grooving is a very predominant characteristic of G. carbonaria in both old and young specimens . The adult male denticulate appears to be somewhat bell-shaped when viewed dorsally , tending to flare out at the posterior third of the carapace in the area directly above the intergular . Females retain the more rounded shape of the young . Both young and adult , male and female , have a quite highly domed carapace with a gentle rounding from central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher dome . <p> G. carbonaria retains much the same shape throughout its life , having sides of the carapace quite parallel , giving it the appearance of a loaf of bread . In older , adult specimens , the shell can be seen to be indented slightly at mid-body when viewed dorsally , thus giving it a slight hour-glass shape . Carbonaria does not appear to reach the size of denticulata , large adult specimens obtaining an average carapace length of about 19 inches . <p> There is very little information on actual habitat of these two species . They both range over much of the same area of South America , both being found in forested areas where adequate shade is available , as neither appears to like to bask in full sunlight.Carbonaria seems to prefer the damper habitat , being found in wet , muddy dens in the wild , showing a tendency to drink and soak more in captivity thandenticulata . <p> The range of G. denticulata is as follows : southern Colombia ( absent from the north ) , Venezuela , Island of Trinidad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Guiana , Peru and Brazil , being absent from Paraguay . <p> G. carbonaria has much the same range , but includes Colombia , only the western portion of Peru and is found in Paraguay . <p> When the scientists compared DNA from all four species of gopher tortoise they confirmed the close link between X. agassizii and X. berlandieri , and betweenG. flavomarginatus and G. polyphemus . Their results suggested that the Xerobates and Gopherus forms last shared a common female ancestor some 5-6 million years ago . The Texas tortoise , X. berlandieri , proved to be very closely related to the " eastern " agassiziigenotype . It is highly likely that berlandieri evolved from this eastern agassizii assemblage , probably fromXerobates stock inhabiting the north central region of Sonora . Perhaps the closeness of the relationship between the eastern agassizii assemblage andberlandieri explains the occasional occurrence of hybrids from matings between captive Texas and desert tortoises . <p> Article reprinted with permission from International Turtle and Tortoise Society Journal 2:4-5 , 1968. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

Factors that go into ' relatedness ' are genetics , morphology , and geography(paleo) . <p> Chelonians have a good fossil record which also helps drive the determination in relatedness . <p> The two poles of perspective are that every individual is unique - to the idea , we all ( all known life ) share only four proteins that determine what we grow to be . The idea of species and genus make it so we can talk about units of animals that are related and common to each other , and unique and uncommon to other units/groups . Groups themselves have different levels of relatedness . " Species " an artifact of science required so studies can be made that characterize " like individuals " . <p> Great question .

As the branches deprecated &amp; moved into varying climates the various branches became ( over 100ds of 1000ds of yrs ) more &amp; more unique till at some point the two branches could no longer produce viable offspring . This is what happened to torts as evolutionary time marched forward . <p> With the Sulcatas &amp; Leopards , their common ancestor is not as far back in evolutionary terms as say a Redfoot &amp; a Sulcata . Not only that , they share overlapping territories on the com tenant of Africa . So it is possible they have occasionally bred in the wild . <p> The step before complete incompatibility between branches is sterile offspring . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

It 's just common sense to think that ants are going in the enclosure to get food . But if you do n't think they are getting any food then prevent them from getting in. 1 : Spray their path with chemical cleaners . Chemical cleaners or ant poison will kill the ants in path and remove the sent they travel through . 2 . Make a barrier with dried pepper . Ants hate dried pepper and will not cross it if a full barrier is made . 3 . ( MOST EFFECTIVE ) Make a barrier with petroleum jelly . Ants hate the sent of petroleum jelly and it is too slippery for them to cross . These three will prevent ants from getting into your enclosure . I used to have a pet ant colony and used petroleum jelly to keep them in the containers , it also does n't evaporate . Hope this helps 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I used to feed it once or twice a week when I was underfeeding my growing boys and trying to make them grow slower and not pyramid . It was a very small part of a varied diet .

My thinking was that they 'd get a full belly and not feel so hungry , but yet not get a whole lot of growth inducing nutrition . <p> Believe me , I know better now , but back then the word was all about too much food and protein causing pyramiding . <p> So , other than having almost no nutritional value , is there anything else wrong with iceberg lettuce ? <p> I 've wondered about this for many years as so many people are vehemently opposed to iceberg , but I found it quite useful .

So I NEVER tell people they can use lettuce . <p> I spend about $100 a week on tortoise food because I have a lot of tortoises to feed . Because I buy so much foods , I almost always buy the big bag of iceburg lettuce that has carrots and red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , as a filler . But I NEVER feed ONLY iceburg lettuce . My tortoises get quite a nice variety of foods .... including the occasional iceburg lettuce . <p> I also use it when I have excessive amounts of it , and I also sprinkle TNT on it ! The torts love it - I have no idea why ... it 's mostly water . I agree that you have to be careful when you tell others that they eat lettuce . Others can easily get the wrong idea . <p> Alot of pet shops that sell tortoises say that they are easy to care for and say " they just eat lettuce " . I think when some hear that they figure that iceberg is cheap and they usually have it handy anyway so that is what they use until told otherwise . That is a good idea to use it as a filler though , as long as they have enough variety to get all the proper nutrition i do n't see how it could hurt . <p> Hmm I might have to give some to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrated .

Much of the newer field research literature confirms your theory by stating that most tortoise species survive on diet that is very high in fiber , high in calcium but low in most vitamins . A tortoise 's digestive system in captivity probably wastes most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food that is being fed is much higher in vitamin content and volume and not nearly high enough in fiber content . This not only causes the foods to pass through the tortoises digestive system ( the volume ) but also does not allow for a correct population of intestinal protozoa to be maintained due to food passing through so quickly that new colonies can not become established . What would take them weeks to completely digest and expel in the wild takes only a few days , if that in captivity . Their digestive systems are designed to extract energy from very low nutrient foods over a muc longer period of time than is happening when in captivity . <p> Their feces should look dark , dark brown ( almost black ) , completely solid and nearly completely dry when expelled .

What " dry greens " are you suggesting ? The only dry greens I can think of at the moment are the various grass hays . <p> Its interesting hearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves once or twice a week , when they are in season . Years ago , I read that it was good for them , and since they like them so much , I 've just continued . Can you suggest some other trees too ? I know about grape and hibiscus leaves . What others are good ? <p> Many of my feeding habits have become based on frugality . I can get all the weeds , grass , cactus and Mulberry leaves I want for free and they are all much easier to get than a trip to the store . The grass hay , my staple , is really cheap ( $12 for an entire 110 lb. bale ) and we have it delivered with all the other animals hay . I have a flake of this available to them at all times . They eat some every day , even when they have lots of other things available . <p> Roachman-Much of my feeding habits are also based on frugality ! Once the snow clears here I feed mine exclusively foods that grow wild here where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is not limited to : dandelion , red , white &amp; purple clover , broad &amp; thin leaf plantain , wild chicory , crown vetch , sow thistle and quite honestly , several plants that I do not know the identity of . I pick approximately ( 2 ) 55 gallon bags full of weeds every 2 to 3 days . In between feeding days I simply leave the prior feedings in the enclosures . I always scatter the food around , making them forage , rather than sitting in one spot to eat . I have seen all of them ( Northern Mediterraneans and Russians ) eating the drier , couple day old greens equally as much as the fresh greens . In fact , a couple of my Marginated females seem to eat the dry weeds moreso than the fresh weeds . This observance , along with some modern literature by a few authors who have actually studied and observed them in wild has lead me to the same conclusions as you . <p> One of them in particular , Wolfgang Wegehaupt , author of " Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalistic approach to keeping Hermann 's tortoises in captivity . An almost hands off approach . He advocates a very high fiber , high calcium , no " artificial " vitamin diet . He also picks whole plants ( weeds ) and hangs them to dry to feed his tortoises . Essentially the same process that it takes to make hay from grass , only with weeds . I have for many years also fed mine dried weeds by a different method than his . When I brushcut ( basically rough mowing ) my field next to the tortoise enclosures I let it lay for a few days to a week and let it dry . I go along later and gather it all in a large tow behind wagon , dump it on the outside of the tortoise enclosure perimeter and feed it to them as needed . For leaves mine get fed Poplar ( I believe similar to Aspen out west ) , Maple and Apple tree leaves because that 's what grows on my property ! I also have Oak leaves available too that I do occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a vast variety of other edible leaves out there but I use what I have available . I live here in the Catskill Moutains of New York State . A very temperate climate area so I do n't have grape leaves , Mulberry leaves or some of those other desirable tortoise foods available to me . While it may be hard to imagine , I do have a species of pad cactus that I have planted here , grows well and flowers every summer despite below freezing temperatures and being buried in 3 foot ( or more ) of snow for 3-4 months out of the year ! Because I live in farm country , bales of grass hay are very common and for the most part reasonably priced here . I use straw for bedding in their shelters outdoors . I also throw in some occasional timothy hay and what is called " bedding " hay here , which is basically grass with alot of weeds in it . Even some occasional alfalfa hay . When mine have to come indoors in the fall before hibernation and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hay as substrate for the adults and I always have fresh piles of timothy hay available for the young tortoises to graze on if they want to . I also do not put calcium on their food at all but offer it seperately in a shallow dish for them to consume when they deem it necessary . Cuttlebone for larger tortoises , powdered calcium carbonate for young tortoises . I have never used any supplemental vitamins whatsoever . That 's my long winded " theory " ! <p> My " theory " is : I 'm not sure about feeding high water content foods but I think most arid and temperate climate tortoise species should definitely have a much higher , dryer fiber content in their diet than they are probably getting . Along with a much lower vitamin content overall . Weed hay ( as opposed to grass hay ) , leaves and dry greens should be a much larger part of their diet . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I am glad my theory makes sense to you . <p> As far as moisture goes , my thought is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this causes other problems . Fresh greens ( leaves right off a tree , growing plants , etc. ) are reasonably ' wet ' , and most foods eaten in the mornings will have dew on them , etc . If your tort is not dehydrated , this is less of an issue . <p> I agree completely with more fiber- lettuces , etc. are very low in it . Field reports of Red-foot poo usually describe it as well-formed , full of fibers and sand , and green-brown- what you said modified for a different climate . <p> Usually when I 'm talking tortoises in captivity , I 'm thinking outdoors , not indoors ( even though I do have to do both because of climate ) . I think more often than not , tortoises kept indoors probably are dehydrated either slightly or seriously , depending upon their captive environmental conditions . Too much heat , not nearly enough ambient humidity or moisture in their substrate . I do n't think is always the case but based on the never ending posts on this site alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excessive use of heat and so on ; it does seem to be a constant problem . I think when indoors higher water content foods probably are more beneficial to supply additional fluids . But it is n't what most tortoise 's digestive systems are designed to handle . Outdoors , in most U.S. climates , maybe with the exception of the Southwest , when tortoises are active there is usually a higher ambient humidity and regular rainfall patterns . Something that at least Northern Mediterranean species are accustomed to . It 's then that I think they should be on a diet content more designed for their digestive processing . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

@@58539575 @7539575/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Outdoor enclosure and man made burrow <p> Hi - I 've been lurking for a while , but this is my first post . We were given a sulcata about 4 months ago from a work friend of my husband 's who was moving to a cold climate . We live in the Phoenix , AZ area . He said the tortoise ( we renamed him Gordy ) was about 1 year old . I recently weighed him , and he weighed 12 oz . I did n't measure him , but I 'd guess he 's about 6-7 inches . <p> Since it 's summer here now , and getting pretty hot , we 're trying to figure out whether it 's ok for him to stay outside all day/night . He was outside for about a week straight , and I would only bring him in if it went below 70 at night . He has a good sized area of our yard fenced off and had a little shaded house made from a few bricks and a wooden roof for shade . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will get above 110 eventually , I started worrying that even that shade would n't be enough for him . Also , I 've been concerned about how dry it is here and what we can for humidity for him outside . So , my husband dug a burrow for him . He has shown no signs of digging himself , yet . We were hoping he would sleep in there at night and get cooled off during the day . However , the first problem we encountered was ants . They were everywhere ! So , I read the forum and used the Terro liquid ant bait for several days . Finally , tonight we have put him back outside ! ( He seemed to be going crazy inside so much these last few days , so I do n't know how he is feeling about things . ) We tried putting him in the entrance of the burrow twice , and he kept coming out . Then , my husband found him sleeping out in the open in a corner by the wall . So , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was already asleep he would just stay in there . Well , he did n't . He 's right back in that same corner . I 'm just letting him sleep there tonight and hoping it 's fine since the low will be 76 tonight . <p> My question is , is this normal ? Is there something wrong with the burrow we built ? What should we do to keep Gordy safe from the heat ? <p> Hi , I can tell you what is wrong with your burrow : Your Gordy has n't  choose the place where your husband has build him the burrow . Torts are stubborn .... Can you dig him another burrow in the corner he is sleeping now ? I think he would like the burrow if it is in " his " place ... By the way : Can we have some pics of Gordy ? You know we all love tort pics . <p> At one year old and he should still be housed inside in a humid closed chamber . The AZ heat is very dry and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry heat . He also should not live outside 24/7 until around 2 or 10 inches . Read the sulcata caresheets and closed chamber threads under the sulcata section <p> I prefer to bring them in at night until they are at least 8-10 " . Indoors I use 4x8 ' closed chambers . <p> At 6-7 " I would feel comfortable leaving them out most of the day when the weather is nice , but not overnight . <p> The only way they can keep from frying their brains in your hot climate is to get underground when it 100+ . I 'm surprised he has n't started digging on his own already , but I 'm not surprised that he did n't like your burrow . I have found that little ones avoid any sort of burrow or hole in the ground . I speculate that this is because they are afraid of whatever dug the hole in the first place , which is a valid concern in Africa . I find that If I start a hole here and there where I want them to dig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is my burrow thread from a few years LONG ... <p> In your area , heavy shade , shade cloth , misters , sprinklers and any thing else you can think of to keep things cool will be necessary until this little guy figures out how to get underground . You need deep shade that comes from high over head . I find saturating the whole area with sprinklers will lower the temps 10-15 degrees on our 100+ days here . I 'm on a good well , so I can run as much water as I need . <p> Regular soaks , like every day or every other day , will be needed too . Especially , for a little one like yours . When he 's 50-100 pounds you can relax on the soaking a bit . <p> Hi , thank you all for your replies . I have read the care sheet and the links you provided . It seemed like a lot of what I read before was geared towards hatchlings , and so I thought maybe Gordy was old enough to be outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fits in age and size-wise . I thought I read 6-7 inches at some point . If I may ask , what is the reasoning for bringing him in at night , even when it 's warm ? Is it mainly for humidity ? Tom , when you say " when the weather is nice " what does that mean for Gordy ? <p> I 've been doing soaks , but not that frequently , so I 'll do those more often . I had n't realized that he would need until up until 50-100lbs though ! Wow ! How do you get such a large tortoise to soak ? <p> He was already starting to pyramid when we got him , but I think he has new growth that is more smooth . I 'm not sure though , unfortunately , I did n't take a good picture or weigh him when we first got him , so I 'm not sure how much he has grown in 4 months . I 'll attach some current pictures , though . <p> Thanks again for your responses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi , thank you all for your replies .

Its designed to give growing young tortoises what they need to survive and thrive . Your baby is still growing for sure . Monsoon conditions help them grow smoother and thrive . <p> The new growth does look smoother and better . <p> How do you soak a 50 pounder ? Same as any other . Get your large , tall-sided , opaque tub with the right amount of warm water ready , and plop them in there for 40 minutes or so . Then rinse them off , dump and rinse their tub . Repeat as needed . I try to do adults twice a week in summer and less in winter . <p> Why bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Over the years I 've tried all sorts of experiments and they simply do better indoors when they are smaller . Adults and larger juveniles need to live outside because of their size , but little ones will be healthier and safer when kept indoors in a correct enclosure most of the time and at least overnight for one the size of yours . At 6-7 " I leave them outside all day during fair weather . <p> Fair weather for sulcatas in North America to me means : Over 70 dry and sunny , and under 95ish . If it is early morning and I know it is going to warm up into the high 80 or 90s , I might put them out on a sunny 60 degree morning because I know they will warm up and can use the sunshine to get much warmer than the ambient air . If its 68 and overcast , I just leave them inside . If its going to be 118 , I 'll put them out early and then bring them in once the temp starts climbing past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burrow to retreat to and escape the 100+ weather . <p> @Tom said:How do you soak a 50 pounder ?

@@58539578 @7539578/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> Map turtles of the genus Graptemys are native to North America , where a high degree of drainage endemism is believed to have shaped current diversity . With 14 species and one additional subspecies , Graptemys represents the most diverse genus in the family Emydidae . While some Graptemys species are characterized by pronounced morphological differences , previous phylogenetic analyses have failed yet to confirm significant levels of genetic divergence for many taxa . As a consequence , it has been debated whether Graptemys is taxonomically inflated or whether the low genetic divergence observed reflects recent radiations or ancient hybridization . In this study , we analysed three mtDNA blocks ( 3228 bp ) as well as 12 nuclear loci ( 7844 bp ) of 89 specimens covering all species and subspecies of Graptemys . Our analyses of the concatenated mtDNA sequences reveal that the widespread G. geographica constitutes the sister taxon of all other Graptemys species . These correspond to two clades , one comprised of all broad-headed Graptemys species and another clade containing the narrow-headed species . Most species of the broad-headed clade are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are not differentiated . By contrast , in the narrow-headed clade , many currently recognized species are not monophyletic and divergence is significantly less pronounced . Haplotype networks of phased nuclear loci show low genetic divergence among taxa and many shared haplotypes . Principal component analyses using coded phased nuclear DNA sequences revealed eight distinct clusters within Graptemys that partially conflict with the terminal mtDNA clades . This might be explained by male-mediated gene flow across drainage basins and female philopatry within drainage basins . Our results support that Graptemys is taxonomically oversplit and needs to be revised . <p> I was just emailing back and forth with Peter Praschag about this the other day . Some American Graptemys experts are in disagreement with some of this , so I look forward to even more coming out on Graptemys soon . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

He belonged to my husband since he was a small child , but for the past 10 years he has essentially been " neglected " because my husband moved away for college and left him with his family who really did n't care for him much . We recently " adopted " him back and have since changed his bedding ( from corn cob to coconut substrate and organic , non fertilized potting soil ) got him on a regular feeding schedule and have tried to get him to eat a more balanced diet ( previously he ate only lettuce , then switched to tinned Papaya turtle food , then to zoomed box turtle tinned food ) . We have tried to keep his humidity up ( where we live the humidity normally is 10% tops ) and it stays around 40-50% now . He is also eating zoomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaked until soft ) , the tinned zoomed food , we sprinkle calcium powder on his food once a week , and have recently discovered he has an extreme love of blackberries . I do n't know how exactly he lost his beak , but we think it was some kind of infection . He has no problems eating but I am wondering if there is anything we can do to help it grow back , or if it ever will . His shell is also very dry looking and is peeling , which I did n't think happened to box turtles. ( yes , he does have a flag painted on his shell ... it happened maybe 20 years ago and it does n't seem to bother him . ) The peeling has not gotten worse since we took him back , but it has n't gotten any better . We have been trying to regularly put on shell ' lotion ' -for lack of a better word- but it did n't seem to make a difference . He absolutely loves to soak in his water dish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half in half out ( like the picture ) but sometimes he will almost completely submerge himself . We have been trying to take him outside for a few hours a day when the weather permits . Being in Utah the temperature is n't sutable for taking him out year round , but he does enjoy it when it 's warm and will run around the yard .

" But this was not always the case , " explains Professor Dr. Madelaine B+hme , director of the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment ( HEP ) at the University of T++bingen , who continues , " Our most recent study shows that the number of amphibian and reptile species used to be much higher in the course of geological history . " <p> The international team of scientists around the paleontologist from T++bingen and Dr. Davit Vasilyan of the JURASSICA Museum in Porrentruy examined fossils from more than 40 excavation sites in Western Siberia , spanning the past twelve million years . These fossils were collected during 40 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We were able to identify more than 50 different species -- from salamanders and frogs to scaled reptiles and turtles .

Equally unexpected were voucher specimens of several crocodile newts , whose surviving relatives live in modern-day China and Vietnam . <p> " In addition , for the first time we were able to discover an Asiatic representative of the extinct frog family Paleobatrachidae , " adds B+hme , and she continues , " And we also rediscovered an ' old acquaintance ' among the fossils : The Siberian Salamander already inhabited the region beyond the Ural Mountains as early as twelve million years ago .

Moreover , the discovery of terrestrial and aquatic turtles , whose last representatives disappeared from Western Siberia around 5 million years ago , suggests a noticeably warmer climate . <p> " The total of our findings documents Siberia 's varied biodiversity and the dynamic climate history of this region : Within a few hundred thousand years , extremely wet regions with four times the current precipitation transformed into areas with an arid steppe climate .

I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and My 9 pound Sulcata tank baby Sheldon . When I was first introduced to the world of Sulcatas it was after being asked to take in a " turtle " who could no longer be cared for . Being a lover of all animals I had to say yes . Now Imagine my surprise when the day comes and I am presented with not a turtle , but a SULCATA tortoise ( lol ) It was then that I knew I was in for a life long commitment and a lot of learning and researching . I instantly fell in love with sheldon and I am determined to give this everything I have . Sheldon had a rough start in life with the previous owners spending majority of his time in a glass aquariam with a bearded dragon ( heartbreaking ) . This resulted in pyramiding of his shell and a long road to recovery . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits , a move to a bigger more suitable place , proper diet , reevaluating of lighting and heating , and lots of help from people like you on these forums have made Sheldon one happy Tort ! And I ca n't thank all of you tortoise enthusiasts enough for taking time to share your knowledge and educate people like me who need all the help we can get . Unfortunately my first post on this forum was under sad circumstances when Sheldon had to have injections to prevent a reoccurring URI and because of the help from people on here I was able to see what I was doing wrong and change it . Needless to say I have already seen almost 100% improvement . After advice I received on here ( after advice from the vet seemed off ) and adjusting his night temps and humidity his breathing improved dramatically and is getting better day by day . Sheldon is doing great ! So BIG thank you again to everyone from myself and Sheldon ! 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

The most my tortoise does in water besides drinking it , is soaking and going to the restroom in it . I 'm always correcting my friends/family when they say turtle haha <p> 1 . Water is not the enemy . With one exception , the Desert Tortoise , these are not desert animals . Many species live in area with a hot wet monsoon season . Almost all species live in areas with higher humidity than what is found inside of a typical North American home with heating and A/C . Babies should be soaked daily . Older torts should be soaked regularly . Bladder stone surgery is a lot harder and a lot more expensive than soaking an adult tortoise once or twice a week . 2 . Protein is not the enemy . Protein does not cause pyramiding . Tortoises need some protein in the diet . 3 . Pyramiding is not caused by food . It is caused by growth in conditions that are too dry . Sunlight , D3 , and a different food will do nothing to stop pyramiding in an environment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not where your tortoises food should be coming from , with some exceptions like fruit for fruit eating species . Grocery store greens generally lack fiber and some have poor calcium to phosphorous ratios , or just low calcium . If you must use grocery store foods , you need to amend it with supplements to add fiber , add calcium and correct a bad calcium to phosphorus ratio . 5 . Pet stores usually dispense bad care info and sell dangerous or useless products . Ramped water bowls , red bulbs , spot bulbs , coil bulbs , tiny enclosures all bad news . 6 . Vets usually dispense bad care info and sometimes dangerous or useless medications and treatment . If your tortoise vet is not an experienced tortoise keeper , they will probably be referring to a vet handbook or website in the back room , and what they recommend is often either expensive or harmful , or both . 7 . Care info for many species has been wrong for decades . Most people have still not figured it out and argue vehemently with the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dry . 9 . Most people buy their tortoises from the wrong source and do n't know what questions to ask to determine what the right source is . Buy from a breeder or a broker that can tell you how the baby was started . If the baby was started on dry substrate , kept outside all day , and soaked less than 3-4 times a week , buy from someone else . If the baby was fed spring mix and romaine , buy from someone else . 10 . BIG one here : Tortoises should NOT be kept in pairs . They do n't like it . Its not good for them . I can cause all sorts of problems including death . Other species , like chameleons demonstrate their displeasure at the pair situation with body posture or color changes . Tortoise ca n't do either , so they 're forced to live in this unnatural unpleasant situation far too often . 11 . Do n't mix species . High potential for disease and death . 12 . Do n't let your tortoise run loose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lost this way . Every person who lost , killed or injured their tortoise this way was sure it was safe and they were being very careful . It will happen to you . Use an enclosure . 13 . Tortoise are not the pet for people who have no space . They need large areas to roam . Indoors and outdoors too . If you only have room for a small tank , do n't get a tortoise . There are plenty of other reptile species that will do fine in smaller enclosures. 14 . Sand is not a good reptile substrate . High risk of impaction and its a possible skin and eye irritant . 15 . Bought in a bag soil is not a good substrate . There is no way to know what it is made of and it could be something toxic . This also means that a soil/sand mix is no good . Use coco coir or fine grade orchid bark . Or use dirt if your is of suitable composition . That 's what all my adults live on outside . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , and which ones to avoid that cause eye issues , etc . I have had many people confused on what light to buy and which one to avoid , as I was also when I started many years ago . <p> Covering screens would also be useful- which ones block UVA/UVB , etc . <p> Debunking the stuff that pet stores say would also be awesome . Such as a 10 gallon aquarium kit is NOT suitable for any turtle/ tortoise , no matter the size , the importance of turtle tables , outdoor time , and building the proper enclosure for your tort/turtle .

I am a fairly new juvenile Eastern Box Turtle owner and this is the very first time I have ever used any sort of forum , so please forgive me while I am learning . I have had my boxie ( Shelly ) for about 7 months . She has just come out of hibernation and I am wanting to get her out of her indoor enclosure into an outdoor pen . Very excited to read up on the habitats that others have and try to make a nice one for her here in the next few weeks . <p> Welcome ! We have three ornate box turtles and currently have them inside due to moving . We are going to be working on our outdoor enclosure soon too ... if the weather can stay nice enough for us to do it . Under the tortoise species there is a box turtle tab .. there is some old discussions on box turtle habitats and a great place to ask advice . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

As the weather is hot and sunny I decided it was high time to create a good outdoor enclosure for Tortellini to grow in and enjoy . I looked at and read many of the posts on what to include and what not to include . <p> Construction of enclosure : Luckily , I have a wonderful father and husband who helped with the woodworking and construction of this habitat . <p> Painting the enclosure:My two girls and hubby helped with painting and creating the habitat . The inside of the hide box was left unpainted . <p> The enclosure was made so that the hide box can be removed if needed . My girls can sit on top of the hide house and observe Tortellini without disturbing her . They have agreed each night to fill his water container and close the door to the hide box . ( I hate the green of the hide house , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ! ) <p> Inside the box : There is a heat mat , a heat rock , and a water dish . Installation of the thermometer will be happening tonight when the hubby gets home . We also , noted that we may need to insulation ... a step that was forgotten in the construction . We will see how the temps hold up . The hide box has latches on the door and lids on the top . The box can easily be carried with two people using the handles . <p> Overall , I think it is pretty good , but if you notice , or see something to add let me know ! <p> Can you put potted plants in the main area ?

I 'm in a dry area and needed scrappier weeds . They might work well in a more humid climate , like yours . Humans can eat them too , in salads . Everyone benefits ! <p> Definitely go for it !

@@58539619 @7539619/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Super new and looking for some help <p> hi . I recently was just given two what I think may be two male Russian tortoises . I have been saying for a few years that I wanted to get a tortoise . I have not done any research before yesterday . My amazing siblings saved two from a bad situation . They were given to me with a wooden cage that needs some repair to the bottom it is coming apart . I play to put a new plywood board down this weekend . From reading I understand that I am going to have to separate my turtles . So I have plans to get the necessary supplies to build another cage . I was told they are 2-3 and 5-6 . So at what point do I really need to separate them ? They mostly avoid each other . Ok so my next question leads to what I need in the cage . We have a good dish and a watering hole and a hutch . I do n't know what to put down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know much about it and my parents spray the yard with chemicles . I like the way sand looks and there is the coconut stuff that came in it . Can I do half the cage in sand half in the coconut ? More for looks and diversity for the turtles . I also saw they like to climb should I get more things for them ? I really wan na take the best care of them I can so I am looking for lots of advice . I have had them a day . Oh and next is lighting and heat . So it does n't get higher then 73 degrees I read a book it should be between 75 and 95 in the basking spot . I would love recommendations on lighting that I can put in ? They do n't have names yet . <p> So I am about to set up a new pen one for each of them . I have limited space to put the tables so I am going to be building two different towers out of bookshelves . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I want and I plan on the ramps to be dirt ones .

Two tortoise species in the same genus can hybridize ( like Hermann and Russian tortoises , or redfoot and yellowfoot tortoises ) , and even two tortoises from different genera can hybridize ( like sulcata and leopard tortoises ) . But I really , really , really , really doubt if tortoises could hybridize with turtles from other families . <p> Like Student said , you can hybridize some species of feline with certain others , and some species of canine with certain others . However , even within each family , some genetic differences are too great , and certainly between the two families , hybridization is impossible . <p> But more importantly , why in the heck would you want to ? ! Such Frankensteinian experiments serve no purpose . hr <p> yagyujubei said : <p> What about a Humanzee ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has n't been attempted . Probably be best to keep it to yourself , though . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Our closest relatives are indeed chimpanzees and bonobos . Each of these species has well over 90% of their DNA identical to ours . With such genetic similarity , you would think that hybridization would be possible . However , even if fertilization takes place , there could still be problems with the viability of the offspring , either in utero or beyond . <p> In the early 1900s , the Russian scientist Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov did try to create human-chimp hybrids via artificial insemination in a series of efforts known as the " Ivanov Experiments " , but the experiments failed , and no hybrids were born . <p> And it 's a good thing , too . Artificially hybridizing animals is morally dubious as it is , but hybridizing humans with other apes would be extremely unethical . <p> Even if it were genetically possible ( which I seriously doubt ) , the courtship behaviors of tortoises and pond turtles are very different . Plus , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate ( which they wo n't ) , they could still spread diseases to each other .

More recently , Sulimov dogs ( bred in Russia by hybridizing domestic dogs with golden jackals ) have been used to sniff out explosives in airports . Personally , I would not breed any interspecific hybrid , but at least those hybrids were created with a specific job in mind . <p> Also , sometimes other species hybridize of their own accord . Hybrids between coyotes and wolves are rare , but they do happen . Ditto for hybrids between mule deer and whitetail deer , redfoot and yellowfoot tortoises , etc . I am opposed to forcing hybridization in captivity , but one has to admit that sometimes it just happens , even in the wild . <p> As for us , genetic research indicates that early on , our ancestors and the ancestors of chimps used to hybridize long ago before our lineages were fully separate . But that has n't happened for millions of years . Now , despite being closely related to chimps , we are very different from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet , but we are the most intelligent , and moreover we have moral agency . A hybrid between a human and a chimp or bonobo would almost certainly be a miserable creature , and we should know better than to create such a being . <p> First a tortoise and turtle hybrid is impossible . Second they say human.chimpanzee hybrid was unsuccessful . In all honesty would you want a human with minimul mental capacity and the strength.of 5 men running around .

See if he will also nibble on some dandelion greens - one of the best vit A sources next would be kale . Both really high in vit A <p> We offer Kale and red lettuce daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worms ! Even before the eye issues began he had no interest in lettuce . I 'm going to do the Tobramyacin for a week . How many pellets is good enough each day if he continues to have no interest in the worms ( presumably because of his eyes making him uncomfortable ) ? Thanks ! <p> We offer Kale and red lettuce daily . He walks away from them as he does the worms ! Even before the eye issues began he had no interest in lettuce .

Thanks ! 166976 @qwx576976 <p> The pellets are good on their own for the vitamin A. Let him eat as much as he wants . It also has a 2:1 calcium : phosphorus and vit D3 . All good . If he like the pellets , that all around better for him than the greens . <p> Should I soak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just leave him for the remainder of the day ? I hear handling the least amount is desirable , but I know he needs to eat and drink . Also , what should his weight be at 7 months ? He is 26.5 grams . <p> As far as the diet - Eastern Box turtles , when babies , are nearly 100% carnivorous , they are n't going to show any interest in green leafy food and rarely do as adults . Generally baby Box turtles are hunters , they react to moving prey such as earthworms , crickets , slugs , snails and small insects . They do n't usually show much interest in food sitting still and do n't eat processed pellet foods . As they reach adulthood they will begin to consume more vegetable and fruit matter but still be very much " meat eaters " too . Baby Box turtles in general are more demanding in terms of care requirements than are baby tortoises . <p> Humidity - Ambient air humidity , soil moisture and drinking/bathing water are very important to their well being and activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly damp conditions without adequate air exchange . They need the opportunity to be able to get completely dry periodically . This can be a bit challenging to provide but can be done . Rather than a coil UVB lamp a better choice might be a tube type UV that saturates the entire enclosure with light and UV with a separate incandescent basking lamp in one corner with a flat rock below it that remains completely dry . You can still cover part of the enclosure that is not around the basking area . The eye issue could be from dryness or it could be due to a deficiency in vitamin A. If the tortoise is a hatchling or very young baby it 's less likely that it has developed a vitamin A deficiency already . That generally takes place over a longer period of time , not instantly . But I would not rule it out either . <p> Baby Box turtles in general are more demanding in terms of care requirements than are baby tortoises . <p> Thank you We do not use a coil light and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to . He is eating Omega One pellets while soaking every day . He still is refusing worms for some reason , though there was a period about two weeks ago when he would happily eat a red wiggler . Unfortunately I do n't think when we first got him in mid February his habitat was anywhere near humid enough for him . It definitely is now though . Hopefully he will resume interest in worms very soon ! ! 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

He lives in Los Angeles with me and free roams the large backyard where I 've grown him all sorts of grasses and treats and he currently is about 16 " long and 20 lbs . He seems happy enough and spends his time eating all day , pooping every 1-2 days , and searching his world for chicken craps to eat .

Needless to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page and let him ferment his own poop dirt pile ( like the chickens ) and completely missed the boat on needing significant night time heat . Will be working on fixing that over the next month and I do have a question about how small an enclosure one can put one of the radiant oil heaters and how tight a fit in can be in the ' box ' enclosure it sits in . The tort is n't huge yet and I 'm a renter , so if I could cover the next two to three years before I move again , that would be great . <p> Max , the tort , well he has always had some mildly raspy breathing . Not the hissing pissed off ' I want to eat your toes ' sound but just a bit of a wheeze . No discharge , no cough , nor bubbles , etc. etc. and like I said , he grazes all day until dusk every day , rain or shine and would literally walk to San Francisco if given the ability to escape . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got him last year and the mild pyramiding he came with has n't gotten at all worse and may be looking better . Is that a respiratory infection ? Would n't he seem actually sick if it was ? What 's the best way to treat him and what to treat him with ? <p> I would heat a hide box to 80-85 and lock him in at night . I also would not let him eat chicken poop , not good for him . I also would clean out the poop bed you read someplace and give him some nice fertilizer and pesticide free dirt or orchard bark to sleep on and keep his quarters clean . The noise is hard to say if normal as ca n't hear it . However , if he is acting fine , all things normal , it 's probably normal for him . The box just needs to be large enough for your tort to move and turn around in and to be able to get away from where the heater is placed . If you want to make the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I had never heard of the recommendation to let them live in their own poop . I had to go to their web page to read it to believe it .

I do n't think that in the wild , they would choose to sleep right in the poop . They may not mind it much but I do n't think they would do it by choice . When Charlie had his last burrow , it was dug down to a low point , then it turned and came up a little bit before continuing on . All the poop ended up in the low point , and Charlie slept in the higher part . I do n't think this was by accident . <p> Charlie has no trouble settling down for the night .

I am fairly experienced at keeping reptiles and so said yes when asked if I would take a baby in . The first week i thought i was doing well till my continued research taught me much of what i thought i knew was false . So for two weeks now i have had the enclosure at 80% humidity and kept at 80 degrees at night . I have been soaking at least once a day for 30 min . <p> I did know going into it that a sulcata would be a life time commitment and i am excited to continue to learn as i go . <p> This forum has been a very valuable resource and i want to thank all the experienced members that contribute so much of their experience and knowledge . <p> Currently the sully is housed in a 4x 2 enclosure with a cypress mulch substrate . I do plan on changing that to coco core down the road . I am using a mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temp control to make sure it stays at 80 . I also have a large heat mat under the enclose also temp controlled but i have found it to be all but unnecessary . <p> Phase two i plan on turning one of the bed rooms of our house into an enclosure and phase three will be the building of barn with attached greenhouse and pasture . This summer the main goal is reseeding what till one day be the tortoise pasture . The hens have done quite a number on it the past couple of years and it has alot of undesirable weeks currently . ( mainly ground ivy or creeping charlie , Glechoma hederacea which can be a pain to control i know being in the organic lawn care business these days ) <p> So a couple of questions i do have . 1 . Has anyone had any experience with a sulcata sharing a pasture with laying hens ? I know they tort will have to get a lot of size before I could think about it but long term . 2 Admiral Thaddeus ' stool was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me introducing aloe into the diet yesterday ?

However , the Mercury bulb is all you need , not a t5 too . And the aloe will/can make a loose stool . Hello and Welcome sounds like your getting your plans in place and learning quickly . <p> Since the tortoise eats the grass , I would n't think eating chicken poop would be good for him . If the chickens have parasites , which they probably do , the tortoise will soon be infected . Also , chickens are drawn to shiny things , and a little tortoise 's eyes are shiny . My advice is to keep the chickens out of the tortoise yard . <p> Hello and Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is great news for your baby ! <p> You can even mix the cypress mulch and coco if you wanted , it makes a great blend . I would n't let him be with the chickens until they 're scared of him , it could turn fatal for him otherwise . I would be concerned with him eating the chicken mess , I do n't see that being too good for him . Torts tend to eat dog turds when they have the opportunity ... <p> Greetings MangoKing , Welcome to the tortoise forum ! Well done with your research . Something to keep in mind , sulcata 's can live , with proper care and husbandry , 125-150years . At the current human rate I 'd figure you 'd be making a double lifetime pet . LOL . As for mixing with chickens , I say no . Chicken scratch no good , chicken mash no good , and chicken crap no good for tortoises . Plus , yes , chickens can be mean little critters and will ultimately peck your beloved shelled friend as food . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cactus pads will produce the same results . Feed lots of the " safe broadleaf weeds " ( mallow , plantain , dandelion as well as others ) and you 'll have a great , lifelong friend . Read more here in the sulcata section , learn , and ask all the questions you can think of , plus the questions you do n't have yet . Soon , you will be answering beginners questions yourself . <p> Well i do know my chickens do not have parasites . I currently only have a small back yard flock for some fresh eggs and have kept chickens many years now . I never would think of housing them together was more asking if anyone has had them share the same pasture . The chickens have thier own coop that will not be in the pasture i am currently replanting with sulcata friendly grass types ( and eradicating the ground ivy ) . I feed the hens in their own coop . Now it would have to be a decent sized tort to not be food for the hens i am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chickens pecking around a pasture would not be much more than if you had a handful of crows roost in a tree over your enclosure . In any case i am a long way from that and will have to decide down the road if i fence the chickens out . <p> The current feed i am giving my tort is mostly a mix of kentucky blue , pasture type tall fescue and creeping red fescue with dandelion green , wild violets , both broad leave and buckhorn plantains , some wild black berrie leaves and as they are starting to sprout rose of sharon leaves . I supplement this with mazuri softened and cuttlebone . I also have a few trays of tortoisesupply.com african grazers mix planted and sprouted and am going to plant out a baby pool with it this weekend , mostly as a test to see how i like the mix and what types in the mix thrive in my region . <p> Currently i am shaving cuttlebone onto the torts food a few times a week and it has chewed on the pieces i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdered calcium supplement or will the cuttlebone be enough ? what are the thoughts on some of the vitamin supplements for my very young tort ? <p> Has anyone done any research into the effect of grazing on grass types infected with endophytes ? We all know the effects on grazing mammals i am sure but all the research i have read says no real effect on chickens . I have read some of the older threads around here but found no conclusive results . I do not plan to use any endophyte grasses in the pasture i am planting but i do have some endophyte enhanced tall fescue varieties in the lawn around the house . I have currently been avoiding them when i cut the tort feed each morning . I am fairly sure the grass types i am feeding are not infected with endophytes as i had sod web worms and chinch bugs infestations a couple times before i slice seeded in some endophyte enhanced tall fescue . <p> If you want to loose ( to kill ) your tortoise , - keep it together with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day from wild birds . Chicken poop can contain various bacterias and mayby worms . Believe me , I own chickens too . And if your tortoise is n't killed by bacterias the chickens could kill her . It is like@Yvonne G said : Chicken like to pick shiny things and they like to eat meat . A slow tortoise would be a fine " slow food " . Please try never to keep a tortoise together with chickens .

I have a Red Foot that is now 6 and plenty big enough to be outdoors . I promised myself last year that the tort would be out in the early Spring and never did it due to a combination of health problems and a lack of drive to do much of anything ( which I 'm thinking now might be a symptom of the health problem ) . I live in Tampa , Florida so the non-winter temps are perfect outside . The humidity is perfect outside too . My problem is this : I 'm not skilled with woodwork and do n't have the tools . I 'm thinking about putting up a dog fence and using a border on the bottom so he does n't get stuck in the fence and also so he does n't get any escape ideas . Currently I 'm using a Zoo Med Tortoise House inside . It has a hide area that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 2ft x 2ft . I know that 2 of these can be connected together to make it 2 ft x 4ft with two 1ft x 2ft hide areas . It 's right around a foot tall . My question is this : would that even be enough room for one RFT later on ? How tall do I need to plan for the enclosures to be . I 'm thinking about setting up one another Zoo Med Tortoise House or 2 outside for now so that I can get the tort outside . My plan is to put it out on the East side of the house because it faces the neighbors yard and ca n't be seen from the street . ( I do n't have to worry about indoor theft here , but we have idiots that will steal things outside . Someone once stole marker poles that cost around 2 dollars a piece . The reason I 'm wanting the top covered is that we do have birds of prey here . There 's at least one hawk that comes around looking for small animals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day we never saw that pig again . And it was way too small for anyone to have gone through the effort of killing and cooking it . Am I being paranoid ? Can I just get some kind of fence and let them be in it ? Do I really need a covering ? I 'm def going to get a security cam . I may just keep him indoors in the winter . I have n't figured that out yet . Sorry to bombard everything with this at once . It 's just that this has become a priority for me to get done because I will be undergoing a major surgery soon , and I want everything in place and working before that happens--especially in the event that something happens to me . BTW , the tortoise is now more than 6 inches . I 'll have to post pics soon . <p> I 've used the dog fence for temporary quarantine pens . With a wood border it would work fine . Or cinderblocks .

@@58539655 @7539655/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> So I 'm wanting a critique of their diet , but also hoping to put together a handy list of *common grocery store and Wal-Mart foods* that can be fed to a redfoot . I have noticed a lot of people grow their own stuff , or live in / near metropolitan areas where they can get more variety foods , but I do n't . Pretty much have Wal-Mart and one chain of grocery stores in the entire town . I imagine a lot of other people have this same issue . I have peeled through untold pages and lists of redfoot diets , and it 's REALLY frustrating to only have access to less than one tenth of the foods actually listed . <p> So here goes - the ones with asterisks are a rotating base diet , others are sulplemented : <p> The rotating tort menu in my house is pretty close to that list but there are a few extra items I add . I feed zucchini and yellow squash all the time , just cut it into largish chunks so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's firm enough to help wear their beaks a bit but not so firm they ca n't eat it easily . Some of the other squashes , like acorn or summer squash , are a bit too tough for my torts to sink their beaks in . Raw pumpkin is really tough for them but the cans of pumpkin puree are wonderful to keep for emergency rations or an occasional treat ( make sure it 's 100% pumpkin no spices ) . These guys love their fruit so every few days I 'll offer bananas ( we 've always got some in the house and once they 're too brown for humans they go to the torts ) , raspberries , blackberries , watermelon , honeydew , or cantaloupe ( although they are more of a summer treat ) . Sometimes I can find diced up frozen mango in the freezer section of grocery stores or I 'll freeze fresh strawberries for a later time . In the summer I can also pick weeds to lighten my grocery bill , mostly dandelions and plantain weeds because they are the easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in south Texas though . <p> Thanks y'all - I 'm not a big fruit eater , so that 's why they mainly end up with Apple and bell pepper , which they LOVE ! I do n't know that I 've ever seen fresh dates , but I will look . And canned pumpkin is definitely something I can do - I keep squash and canned pumpkin on hand for me and my bearded dragon , so that 's a win ! They go crazy for tomato too , but I read that the acidity is n't great for their systems . <p> Another question , while I 'm thinking about it - my larger tort Alice does n't go for worms or cat food . Other protein options ? ? ? Or should the pellets cover the protein requirements2 , since I know they do n't need a lot . <p> I 'm pretty much in the same situation . We have Walmart and Publix . We also have a farmers market that I 'm going to check out next week . My list of rotating foods is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? We have one ' organic foods ' store that 's absurdly expensive , but that 's where I get a lot of stuff from the list ... before I discovered it the list was half that . We do have a farmer 's market that 's hit or miss ... to give you a heads up - this is totally wierd , but I swear it 's true - sometimes I get greens from the farmers market that are the same kind as the grocery store , but the reptiles like the grocery store greens and not the farmers market greens . I think maybe because they are locally grown the soil chemistry makes the taste different . Certain times of year greens will be more bitter , unless it 's sourced from a different climate like they do at the store . That 's my theory anyway . I just bought a huge bunch of collards at the market that my torts and beardie wo n't even touch , but they ate grocery store collards . But yeah , give it a try , maybe your babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to me ! The only thing I would say is try to add papaya and mango . I also feed zucchini and squash . The main greens I use here are turnip greens , escarole , spring mix , dandelion , and occassional kale . Main veggies are zucchini , yellow squash , sweet bell peppers , mushrooms , shredded carrots . Main fruits are papaya and mango , with kiwi , apple , strawberries and pineapple for variety . <p> Thanks y'all - I 'm not a big fruit eater , so that 's why they mainly end up with Apple and bell pepper , which they LOVE ! I do n't know that I 've ever seen fresh dates , but I will look . And canned pumpkin is definitely something I can do - I keep squash and canned pumpkin on hand for me and my bearded dragon , so that 's a win ! They go crazy for tomato too , but I read that the acidity is n't great for their systems . <p> Another question , while I 'm thinking about it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat food . Other protein options ? ? ? Or should the pellets cover the protein requirements2 , since I know they do n't need a lot . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I use frozen cooked shrimp ( just thaw it out and chop the meat ... oh , they love it ! ! ! ! ) , mushrooms , commercial tortoise food , eggs ( whites and yolks ) any kind of fresh meet/fish : when cooking I 'll scrape lengthwise along the meet fibers which you end up with fesh meet " paste " on the blade of your knife .

There is fruit in the wild like figs and passion fruits , also fruits are seasonal , so they spend weeks gorging on fallen fruits then go without fruit for periods of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you feed 70% of let 's say bananas , strawberries and plums to your pet it will have a constant runny poop .

I have a zoo med heating pad on the side of the tank for at night and the 100 watt multispectrum bulb for the day when they are not outside . I have thermometers and a humidity thing in it . What is the proper temp and humidity you all recommend ? I have read humidity can make them sick ... then I have read it is necessary for healthy shells and torts ? Any input would be greatly appreciated . <p> Its old school to believe that the sulcata needs a dry environment . The new and current school of thought is that the humidity offered during the first year of a sulcata 's life helps to get the shell started on smooth growth . We have quite a bit going on this subject here on the forum . Here 's just one : <p> The simple answer is keep them humid , give them a humid hide box , soak them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 75-80 minimum , but with a 100 degree basking spot . I have not been able to induce any respiratory problems or shell rot or any other problems due to very excessive moisture , humidity and general wetness . If you use some moisture , but less than " very excessive " , you should be fine too . Let me emphasize , you must also keep them warm 24/7 . If they are still smooth after the first year , then you can ease up on the wetness and start letting night temps drop a little . <p> Kristen ... keep the temp in the tank between 75 ( at the cool end ) and 120 in the basking area . A UV bulb is not neccesary if you can keep them outside at least 6-8 hours a day . Depending on the substrate you use , you 'll wan na mist them every couple hours. hr Nice !

Is their a specific buld you suggest to give them what they need . The humidity is reading 40% but I need to check if it is working because it has not changed at all since I bought it yesterday . <p> I only have experience with the T-Rex 100 watt Active UV/heat bulb .

I was just curious if I could keep a baby and an adult of the same species together ? <p> Two tortoises should never be kept together--what you 're talking about are groups of at least 3-4 torts kept in large enclosures with plenty of sight barriers . Two will simply take all their aggression out of one another , while with more , any aggression would at least be more distributed rather than focused on a single tortoise .

Two of the same species certainly can be as babies and young , until they begin to become sexually mature .

Or a newly acquired tortoise that should not be mixed with one that is already established or from different sources . Once the quarantine period is over and the keeper is confident that both are healthy they can be introduced to each other provided that they are similar is size and females . Males of Testudo species can almost never be housed together without being kept in a very large area , larger than usually practical in captivity . A male and female should not be kept together except for short periods for breeding purposes .

I do n't know what 's in it for sure ... but everyday I walk around and collect dandelion leafs , flowers , stems and all and feed them to most of my 27 chelonia . I feed a wide variety of food and dandelions while in season get fed almost daily . Danny will tell you to not feed that often , but I do and I have never seen any damage to any turtle or tortoise I 've raised that way ... however , I also feed a lot of other stuff aw well ... <p> Yeah me too .. everytime I feed him dandelions I let him eat the whole thing ... I 'd say I feed them to him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of them at once , then I pick them daily for a couple days . <p> Of course i am only saying what i do ... some species seem more prone to producing stones than others ... and i have learnt the hard way ... which caused me to change my diet for all my tortoises and to research it more .... all you can do is research for yourself and take all info into account ... <p> During the warmer months my tortoises diet is comprised of close to 25% dandelion plants ( leaves , flowers &amp; stems ) , if not more . Along with several other weeds and plants , it grows here wild , it 's free and I need alot of it ! I have never had any kinds of problems associated with it whatsoever . The rest of their wild diet is made up of clover , vetch , plantain , chicory , lambswort and much more . I pick huge amounts , the equivalent of two 33 gallon trash bags every other day on average . Sometimes it contains less dandelion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking it in . I do n't even attempt to regulate it and have never , ever had a problem . <p> Dandelion stems : Pretty much any time a plant makes a white juice , it will be high in oxalic acid . <p> Tortoises and oxalic acid : I know that oxalic acid is a major buzzword in a lot of tortoise circles , and that there are a lot of reasons for this , such as the experience of people like tortoisenerd and stells , but there are also a lot of people , such as Dr. Douglas Mader and others who seem to poo-poo the whole idea . ( Dr. Douglas Mader , " Reptile Medicine and Surgery " ) <p> They see the problem as one of dehydration first , then as other issues , including vitamin D and a generally poor calcium metabolism . <p> Tortoises of nearly all species eat plants that are so high in oxalates that they are considered toxic to humans- some of the plants they eat in the wild are so full of this acid that if the acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , wild tortoises also manage their hydration better than we usually do , and wild tortoises are often found with stones . <p> I agree with Stella- play it safe and research . Tortoises do not seem to need or benefit from oxalates , so skipping them wo n't bother them at all . The only thing is that using plants with oxalates in moderation in a varied diet just offers you more choices . <p> I would only add that it is important to remember that a lot of bad things happen to dehydrated tortoises , so fix this before you worry too much about other dietary issues . <p> As i have said before ... if the tortoise i had the problem with was dehydrated i would have owned up in an instant ... i have about things in the past and am not afraid of doing so ... not all my tortoises have produced stones ... it was one out of twenty six that did so ... she was bathed and drank at bathtime and from the waterbowl in her enclosure ... but on watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oxalic acid ... i noticed her picking out these foods ... so could only pin point it to a dietry issue ... <p> I 'm sorry , Kelly- I did not mean to imply that dehydration was an issue in your case . <p> As long as I still have dehydration on the mind , I noticed I forgot to add a comment about dehydration . Mike Pingleton ( The Redfoot Manual ) pointed me to the ' Donoghue Formula ' that helps us catch dehydration early . <p> Take the length in centimeters , raise it to the third power , and multiply by 0.191 to get the minimum body weight in grams. ( or , weight in cm3 x 0.191 = min. weight in grams ) . <p> I ran this on my Red-foots and saw an interesting but disturbing trend- they were drying out when outside , but doing OK indoors .

@@58539690 @7539690/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Nails , shell , and beak alarming ! <p> Hello there ! I have been contemplating becoming a first time tortoise owner , and a friend of mine who heard about this suggested I adopt a tortoise belonging to a friend of hers - and that I could probably get the tortoise , the tank , and bulbs free . <p> Obviously intrigued , I went over and visited the little girl tortoise . I do not know if it is obvious in the photos , but what I saw alarmed me somewhat . I was told that she was a Russian Tortoise , but the coloration seemed very wrong compared to what I had seen before in photos and the pet shop . The nails were very long , the beak seems very long , and the shell seems to consist mostly of the yellow ( tissue ? carapace ? ) that is supposed to be thin bands between the shell ... segments ? <p> I just want to know what I can do for this tortoise to nurse it back to health ... or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a first time tortoise owner without a ton of money . Can I adopt this tortoise and get her healthy without beggaring myself with vet visits ? <p> Yep . A Russian . Raised in a horrible aquarium under the wrong lighting and with no way to keep the beak and nails trimmed . Time for a rescue . Let them keep the tank and the bulbs ! A healthy tortoise does not need a vet visit and setting this poor tortoise up correctly will come down to a matter of space . <p> Alright , what can I do for this poor girl ? I have been researching furiously and I think the shell condition is called pyramiding ? Seems like an advanced case . Do you think this is due to lighting , or diet ? She has been fed on a mix of romaine lettuce and pellets . <p> No , not pyramiding . Just extremely fast , new growth . There 's nothing wrong with it . And she 's not unhealthy . I would just get the claws and beak trimmed then set this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather is too cold , then make a safe outside pen and set her up temporarily indoors until the weather turns warmer . <p> If you 're getting her for free you 've already saved money . One vet visit to address the beak and nails is all it will take . Pyramiding is n't terrible . Terrible cases can hurt tort but she 's good . Are you sure it 's a girl ? When you get her take pictures of plastron(belly) and tail . We 'll confirm . People here sometimes use old dressers laid on back with drawers removed for habitat . Line with thick plastic . <p> I 'm just starting out on my own so a bit low on furniture , old or otherwise . Would a big plastic tub from Walmart do in a pinch ? I have seen ones that are 2x the size of tort 's current tank . Also I live in an apartment , so ca n't house her outside . I do however have a balcony I could use when the weather warms some . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

However , direct physical confrontations can lead to lethal injuries so it would be advantageous if fights could be avoided by individuals reliably signalling their body size to potential mates and rivals early on . One way to achieve this is by " honest " acoustic cues to body size in vocalizations . A team around Tecumseh Fitch at the Department of Cognitive Biology at the University of Vienna has now identified cues to body size in calls of American alligators , which is the first finding of this kind in reptiles . <p> American alligators produce very low-pitched rumbling roars , so called " bellows , " year-round and most frequently during mating season . Interestingly , the bellowing displays differ between the sexes , as study co-author Kent Vliet from the University of Florida had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , " visible due to water droplets sprinkling over their backs , preceding the audible bellow . <p> For the current study , lead-author Stephan Reber and Judith Janisch of the University of Vienna recorded the bellows of 43 adult American alligators at the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park in Florida . Then the curators of the institution , Kevin Torregrosa and Jim Darlington , together with the two researchers , measured the head and total body length of all the alligators up close with measuring tapes and hand-held **26;189;TOOLONG devices . <p> In a detailed acoustic analysis , Reber found that frequencies produced by vibrating tissue , such as the vocal folds , hardly correlate with size at all . However , the resonance frequencies are almost perfect predictors of body size . " Resonance frequencies depend on the length of the vocal tract . Larger alligators have longer vocal tracts and therefore lower resonances , " Reber explains . Interestingly , this is the same biological pattern previously found by Fitch in several bird and most mammal species , including humans . It was so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common ancestor with all extinct dinosaurs . " It is thus plausible that also dinosaurs communicated their body size to rivals and potential mates via vocal tract resonances , " Reber concludes . <p> Story Source : <p> The above story is based on materials provided by University of Vienna .

Can you REALLY replicate everything the zoo did do accomplish a mixed species habitat successfully ? <p> And another point that was brought up in another thread was that zoos often do this , not for the benefit of the animals , but because exhibits that look empty do not attract visitors . People like to see a LOT of animals in a enclosure . <p> The bottom line is : there are many reasons NOT to do it . There really is not legitimate reason TO do it . <p> Even in a zoo setting , you do n't know if those animals are kept together 24/7 . They may have holding areas behind the scenes where the animals are housed separately when the zoo is closed , and they are definitely cleaning those exhibits thoroughly every single day . <p> One other thing I 've noticed is that some zoo enclosures will be made to look like they are continuous , but the animals are actually unable to reach each other .

I wonder this for two reasons- a . ) Chelonians are notoriously resistant to a lot of toxins that affect other types of animals , and b . ) Most toxins are targeted towards some aspects of biochemistry . A toxin that kills A , B , and C may be completely harmless to X , Y , and Z. I would wonder if amphibian toxins are ' aimed ' mostly at mammals and birds , or what . <p> Does not really affect the original post , just something that I started to wonder reading the comments . <p> re : amphibian toxins- It would be really interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for two reasons- a . ) Chelonians are notoriously resistant to a lot of toxins that affect other types of animals , and b . ) Most toxins are targeted towards some aspects of biochemistry .

Although I guess tree frogs would benefit from poisoning mammals , birds , and other amphibians more than they would an herbivorous tortoise , but who knows .

So my question is how far away do I want my UAV bulb and heat lamp from the actual tortoises . My glass tank is pretty tall . What temperature do you guys recommend ? <p> Looks like you got the typical pet store bad advice . Both of those bulbs are potentially bad for your tortoise and should not be used . The ramped water bowl is also a serious flipping/drowning hazard . If your tortoise is smart he 'll avoid that bowl , but then he wo n't get any water . You also need about 5 times more substrate and a much larger enclosure . <p> So I went ahead and bought another bag of substrate and took out the water bowl . I also got a i feared heat gun . I 'm going to buy a small terra coat plant bowl for water . My enclosure is a 65 gallon tank . Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first year then I want to build an outside enclosure . As far as the lighting . Your post did n't indicate exactly which ones to buy . <p> The links he posted will contain the information you are looking for , but if I remember right Tom is a fan of tube florescents for uvb and simply using a 65w incandescent flood light for basking spot . Others , like me , prefer to use a mercury vapor bulb . Mercury Vapor Bulbs ( MVB ) provide both UVB and basking heat , though they can be a little pricey , and arguably less reliable . <p> As for the size of the enclosure , how many gallons your tank is does n't matter . It looks like you tank is a tall model . Tortoises need floor space . It may work for a bit , but growing tortoises need space to move to insure proper digestion . Most likely this size will be outgrown fairly fast . <p> Hey there . Your tort is a beauty . Make sure he has a humid hide to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they need that moisture as a baby so that they do n't dehydrate . You can buy a tupperware container at the dollar store and cut a little entry way for your tort to get in and out of . Get some sphagnum moss from home depot , moisten it with luke warm water , and then put that in your hide . If possible , buy/create an outdoor enclosure too . You can find a lot of easy do it yourself enclosure ideas by googling baby tortoise outdoor enclosures . I personally had my torts in a 40 gallon breeder tank , used a 160w Mercury vapor bulb in the daytime and a ceramic heat emitter at night . The temperature should be 95 degrees in the basking spot and between 75 and 80 on the cool side of the enclosure . The most important thing though for little ones is that humid hide and to soak them at least once every other day . Hydration is their friend , dehydration can kill them and kill them quickly . As for a water bowl , I use repti-rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that they can get in and out easily and has little risk of flipping over . A terra cotta dish works well too ( I use those in the outside pin ) Hope this helps ! <p> Also , make sure to get something for the tort to eat on top of , whether that be a flat rock or another terra cotta dish . This will help keep the food clean , stop the little guy from ingesting the substrate which could lead to a blockage , and helps to keep their beak and nails in shape . <p> Wow thank you all so much . I went ahead and took a little bit from everyone . I bought double the substrate I originally had . I bought a utility light with a 65w incandescent flood bulb for heat and for uv I have a long florecent uv bulb . I also got a few terra Cora dishes . One for the food and another for water . And a little piece of wood for them to hide . But they have n't been using it yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time this week . It 's cheap ( under $6 for the moss and Tupperware box ) and really helps your torts thrive . I have 2 in my young cherry head enclosure . One on the warm side and one on the cool side . <p> Hello and welcome ! Just be sure to keep the enclosure humid and give daily soaks , my baby will be 5 months old tomorrow and I 've been learning everything by trial and error and from these folks on here and with their help , my baby is very healthy and active !

We are about to add a little Hermann tortoise to our family and I have some questions . I have bought a book and have been researching non stop on the internet but there are a few things I 'm still unsure of . I live in Ireland where the weather is n't great so we plan on keeping Shelly inside using a tortoise table to house her . We also plan on buying a rabbit run to take her out to the garden supervised for a few hours whenever we get days sunny enough for her . We are in the process of building a tortoise table and are going on Saturday to visit the tortoises and buy a heat lamp and the rest of the stuff for inside the enclosure . The first question I have is we have 3 indoor cats that 's never go outside . 2 rag dolls and a rescue . Does anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept in my daughters bedroom and as she has eczema it 's the only room in the house the cats are n't allowed in and the door always kept shut to keep the cat hair out but I 'm sure at soon stage they will run in . Should I be overly worried about them meeting . The second thing which I ca n't seem to find one answer for is do I hibernate my hermann tortoise . I 'm nervous about doing this . Is it better for them to hibernate . I am finding people giving advice for both and am a bit confused about this . The last thing is food . I realise I am not to give fruit . I have dandelions in the garden and of course all the veg a supermarket can offer . I think I 'll be able to find clover too but all the other names of weeds I 've read I 've never even heard of . Can I also give grass from the garden .

Any advice is greatly appreciated . Regards Kellie <p> Hello and welcome . Dogs and tortoises do n't mix . But I think that cats and tortoises should not create too much of an issue . As for feeding and housing requirements , make sure to read our species specific pages on Hermans . <p> Welcome Kellie . We have 2 dogs and 3 cats . The dogs are actually better with the tortoise as they know the command " leave it " . Cats however as I 'm sure you know are more independent then listening to cues .

They 're both about six-eight months old . About two weeks ago , I noticed Gary 's shell was getting quite soft compared to Daisy 's , so we took him to the vet . The vet diagnosed him with calcium deficiency , an upper respiratory infection , and parasites . I was devastated to hear that his chances are 50/50 , but we 're doing everything we can to help him . We 've been giving him daily calcium and we 've been force feeding him daily with food the vet gave us . He 's finished with his medications regarding the infection and parasites , but he 's not seeming to get better . If anything , maybe worse . Our other one , Daisy , on the other hand is as lively as ever , so we know she 's alright . We 've been putting calcium on their food daily and giving them daily soaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been over two weeks since his vet visit , and he 's yet to eat anything besides when we force feed him . He has no interest in food , even if we put him in it . He sleeps all the time and he 's not very alert . He almost acts like he 's blind . He has no response to sight at all and it seems as though he does n't want to or is incapable of opening his eyes . If he does open them , which usually only happens when we soak him , it 's not all the way and he still acts as though he can barely see anything . What should we do ? What could be causing this ? <p> Info on their habitat : We have both of the tortoises in a fifty gallon stock stank . The tank is filled with a mix of cypress mulch and organic soil . They have two different hides , a rock in their basking area , which is usually at about 110-120 degrees , and they have some succulent plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basking area , so outside of the basking area , it 's about 80 degrees . The tank is open , so it 's difficult to keep the whole area hot . We keep a red night light on to make sure it 's still semi warm at night , but we keep our house cold , so it can get down to 65 degrees . They have two different UV lights . One is a thirty inch , 17 watt light , and the other one I 'm not sure about . It 's not a standard coiled bulb , but it 's one of those bulbs that wraps in almost a narrow , long " U " shape and there 's two of them on one bulb . <p> As stated above , change the U shaped UVB bulb and either get a linear reptisun 10.0 or a MVB bulb . As far as Gary 's symptom of not being able to open his eyes it sounds like some vitamin deficiency . I went through this with Yoda when I first got her . Daily soaks with 50/50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Mazuri and Repashi grassland tortoise food on top of the usual leafy stuff . That worked for me , good luck ! <p> Hello and welcome to the forum . Sorry its under these circumstances , but glad you found us , because you 've been given some bad care info . I hope we can help make things better for your tortoises . <p> You will quickly discover that there is a lot of contradictory care info of this species out in the world . Most breeders do not start them correctly , and most of the care info out in the world for this species is out-dated , based on incorrect assumptions about their lives in the wild , and just plain wrong . In most cases the wrong heating and lighting info is given , the wrong substrate is recommended , and the wrong diet is suggested . <p> Where are you ? Did your tortoises get sunshine over the summer ? How often do you soak them ? Where did you get them and how were they started as hatchlings ? With the answers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on there . <p> Here are some things that I see that need immediate attention . Other posters already mentioned some of these too : 1 . Basking area is too hot . 2. 80 is good , but if its dropping below that on a cool night , it is too cold . 3 . No soil for substrate . You ca n't know what the soil in a bag from the hardware store is made of . Could be anything , including composted toxic plants . 4 . No red bulbs for night time . This tropical species needs it dark , but still warm . Ceramic heating elements or radiant heat panels set on a thermostat best accomplish this . 5 . It is near impossible to maintain the correct temperatures and humidity with an open topped enclosure for this species . 6 . Tortoises should never be housed in pairs . Groups can sometimes work , but not pairs . When people do this , one or both always suffers for it . <p> Read those threads and see what is different in your care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been keeping , breeding and raising 100 's of babies of this species since 1991 . I followed all the wrong advice and did all the wrong things and through decades of trial and error , I figured out what was really needed .

In time , you will also learn what I/we already know , but we 'd like to save you a lot of time and also save your tortoise from what will happen if the typical advice is followed .

Sorry its under these circumstances , but glad you found us , because you 've been given some bad care info .

Most breeders do not start them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for this species is out-dated , based on incorrect assumptions about their lives in the wild , and just plain wrong . In most cases the wrong heating and lighting info is given , the wrong substrate is recommended , and the wrong diet is suggested . <p> Where are you ? Did your tortoises get sunshine over the summer ? How often do you soak them ? Where did you get them and how were they started as hatchlings ? With the answers to these questions we can begin to narrow down what is going on there . <p> Here are some things that I see that need immediate attention . Other posters already mentioned some of these too : 1 . Basking area is too hot . 2. 80 is good , but if its dropping below that on a cool night , it is too cold . 3 . No soil for substrate . You ca n't know what the soil in a bag from the hardware store is made of . Could be anything , including composted toxic plants . 4 . No red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , but still warm . Ceramic heating elements or radiant heat panels set on a thermostat best accomplish this . 5 . It is near impossible to maintain the correct temperatures and humidity with an open topped enclosure for this species . 6 . Tortoises should never be housed in pairs . Groups can sometimes work , but not pairs . When people do this , one or both always suffers for it . <p> Read those threads and see what is different in your care routine . I 'm giving you this info as someone who has been keeping , breeding and raising 100 's of babies of this species since 1991 . I followed all the wrong advice and did all the wrong things and through decades of trial and error , I figured out what was really needed . Literally 1000s of people all over the world are now doing it this way now and all have the same ideal results that I now achieve .

I know there are many reptile keepers who still choose to use red lights at night to heat . In my opinion , we are finding way too much research that now shows tortoises have much better color vision than humans . They can see wavelengths that are invisible to us . Red light in particular is shown as a key trigger in circadian rhythms for all types of vertebrates . ( circadian simply means " around a day " so the urges we feel of when to sleep , wake , peak activity , etc . ) Tortoises also are being found to be extremely color and UVA sensitive in choosing foods . Circannual rhythms ( around the year ) are also triggered by UVA and other wavelength intensity - triggering brumation and breeding , etc . <p> So why do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fine ? I think even humans can get used to sleeping with the light on all night , but that does n't mean it is the best option . We have seen long term effects of those who do this , and the opposite with long term effects , depression , etc from those in extreme northern latitudes where not enough full spectrum light is available . <p> There is just too much evidence that this is not optimal . So with such an easy , inexpensive , long-lasting option as a CHE ( Ceramic Heat Emitter ) available , why expose your tortoise to the red light at night ? Simply put a CHE in where the red light is now . <p> As far as setting up a separate enclosure - you really , really need to place that sick baby in a smaller , hospital tank , and get him away from the other tortoise . Long term , for after he 's well again ? Well , that 's up to you , but more often than not , two tortoises in one enclosure ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely fares well .

Because the water was so dirty and the turtles were unhealthy , the situation caused the turtle 's immune system to weaken and allowed the salmonella bacteria in the turtle 's intestine to multiply like crazy . Because the intestine would become overloaded with the bacteria , they would she 'd high concentrations of the bacteria in their feces , which then entered the already dirty water . Inevitably , small children would put their hands or the sick little turtle in their mouth , and get a salmonella infection . It caused a pretty big stereotype about turtles and tortoises carrying salmonella and making people sick , and led to the outlawing of sales of turtles/tortoises under 4 " as pets .

Any tips or tricks very gratefully recieved . I would normally go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of an issue as he 's more than 36 miles away and I really do n't trust any local vets . <p> Can you post a pic of the nails and beak . Some times people think they need to be trimmed when they really do n't . Their nails are long to begin with . Not shorter like dogs and cats . A flat hard surface such as a piece of tile or flat rock used as a feeding dish will help keep both nails and beak filed down . As adding flat rocks for them to walk on . Please post those pics . If the nails do need trimming , just take the tip off like no more then an 1/8 of an inch . <p> The beak can be trimmed better if you place your Leopards food on a flat tile ( it 's worked for me and my leopards for 17 years ) And do n't forget cactus will help to keep the beak growth slowed down cause it 's tough . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

@@58539737 @7539737/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> Actually the nutrients are absorbed through the thin skin on the underside of the neck and the skin around the cloaca . There is a species of water turtle ( I think in Australia ) that actually " drinks " through the cloaca , but that 's the only species that does . I got this information many , many years ago from Dr. Jartchow in Arizona . <p> I only use the strained carrot/water soaks on babies whose eyes are swollen shut and are not eating . It does no good at all to use it on a healthy baby . <p> From all the postings i have read here on the Forum , soaking in carrot baby food , etc. is almost always one of many last ditch efforts to provide nutrition to a turtle/tortoise that is failing and not eating , or eating very little on their own . When soaked , these reptiles naturally absorb water , nutrients , sugars , etc that often times gets them in a position to eat and drink on their own . <p> A healthy animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting all their nutritional requirements met , would n't need a carrot infusion . <p> If you do some searches here in the Forum , you will see where these soakings were utilized . <p> Yes I saw that it was mainly utilized for sick tortoises but just was n't sure if it was also used as , say a special treat from time to time .

One passed away and the other is not okay . Please help . I bought 2 sulcatas from my local pet store about 2 months ago . I have various kind of hay as a substrate . UVB UVA lighting on timer for 10 hours a day . Also sun bathing every morning . I soak them 3-4 times a week . I keep them in mid 80 to low 90 farenheits . Humidity is always high since i live in Bangkok , Thailand . I feed them mulberry leaves , grass hay , and salad mixed . Recently they seemed to eat less , their body seemed to be swollen and their shell kinda soft too . So i decided to take them to the Vet . They x-rayed my tortoises and they said there is excessive of gas in their intestines . This gas will push their organs inside out and makes them look swollen . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will asked for the x-ray film and show you guys tomorrow ) they said this could happen because of their diet and lack of uvb exposure . I left them at the animal hospital for a week . They had injected them vitamin and some kind of medicine that helps them release the gas out . Unfortunately one of them could not make it . The other one does n't seem to get any better . The other one still eats but not as much as it used to do . Anyone have these experience please share . Any comments would help . Thank you . <p> 1 . remove the hay and instead use some sort of substrate you can moisten . I like orchid bark but a lot of members use coco coir 2. give that poor baby a hiding place . He needs to be able to get out of the harsh light 3. add a waterer to the habitat . A small clay plant saucer will work for this 4. show us the light you 're using . If it 's a coil-shaped compact fluorescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MVB or a tube type fluorescent UVB bulb 5. figure out a way to hang the lights and do n't use the clamp feature . 6. cover that habitat to keep the warm , moist air inside . 7. soak the baby daily in warm water for about 15 minutes each time <p> While this bulb would not cause the death of a tortoise directly , it is a type associated with blindness and discomfort by many members here . We have had several debates and too many posts to count about the issue and the majority decision has been to discourage anyone from using this type of bulb . Especially when other types that have never been associated with any issues are readily available . The good news is that the blindness may be temporary if you stop the use of the offending bulb early enough . <p> Hay is a poor substrate , if it is damp at all and with you humidity it must be ! The dampness plus the heat from lights will create mold and mold spores , which are bound to invite respiratory problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoise 's eyes are being bombarded with harmful rays from the coil-shaped bulb . The bulb , along with the fact there are no hiding places or shade to get away from the bulb , makes me pretty sure that 's your baby 's problem . <p> When those bulbs were first introduced , there was a defect that caused too much ultra violet light to be emitted . That light causes a problem similar to snow blindness , and is very painful . Baby tortoises seem to be most susceptible to it . Once the manufacturers realized they had a problem , they supposedly fixed it , however , there was never a recall of the harmful bulbs and you ca n't tell by looking at either the bulb or the package if it 's an old , harmful bulb or a new , fixed one . So we just advise everyone to not use them at all . <p> the enclosure of your sulcata baby is much to small ! Sulcatas want to run around the whole day long . They need the movement to digest and stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colder place . Your poor little baby has no way to choose between higher and lower temperature . It hurts to see your poor little tortoise so sick , and I hope that he recovered . I wish you the best . What do you just feed while he is so sick ? <p> I am very pleased that your tortoise is better . Does he eat ? Can you please explain to me what mizuri is ? Sorry , I am from Germany .

And yes he/she eats . <p> The calcium that your tortoise eats , whether from its food or from a calcium supplement that you sprinkle on the food , needs UVB or it just gets excreted out in the urine . UVB comes either from the sun or from a GOOD UVB light . Theses are the two kinds I use : <p> has your turtoise cuttle bones to eat in their enclosure ? My sulcatas eat it every day . They need the calcium and every day several hours of UV light to get strong bones and shell as @Yvonne G already said . Here is another idea for setting up an enclosure for your sully . Too bad he / she is alone now . My three little ones are often together and very sociable. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I mainly feed her on a mix of rocket , courgettes , coriander , parsley , dandelion and other leafy things . <p> I 've heard from numerous places that dried grasses are very good for them and should form a large part of their diet . However , I 'm having trouble finding dried grasses that she will eat . I 've got bags of hay from Italian Rye grass , Orchard grass and Alfalfa . She does n't seem interested in any of them . Well , she likes sleeping in the first two , but does n't eat it . <p> Any recommendations on the type of dried grass and/or suppliers so I can try some others ? Maybe I need to try giving her just hay as she might be filling up on the leaves and not learning that the hay is food ? <p> It does n't need to be dry grass . Just grass . Grass is a good way to add needed fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the right kinds of grass hay , but you need to introduce a little differently to get the tortoise to learn to recognize it as food and eat it . <p> Get some scissors or a blender and chop or blend a small amount of grass hay into tiny little pieces . Then put it in a little container with some water and let it soak for an hour or more . Then mix all that in with the day 's greens so that the tortoise can not eat around it . Only use a tiny amount at first . Just a little pinch . Gradually over time , you can add more and more . <p> Some pet stores and some grocery stores also sell little plots of sprouted grass for people to eat or for cats to munch on . Using this fresh grass might also help with the introduction of this new and unfamiliar food . I prefer to use fresh grass to introduce it to a tortoise that is n't used to it whenever possible . If you do n't have real grass outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store bought grass works well . <p> Thanks ! I 'll give that a try . I do have grass outside , just need to check it 's safe for her and wash is thoroughly I guess . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> You need to know if whoever takes care of the lawn and foliage outside is using any chemicals . If its your house and you are the gardener , then you know what is , or is n't , out there . If you live in an apartment or condo , just assume that the grass is full of toxic chemicals and either grow your own or buy it elsewhere . Do not take the gardeners or managements word for it . In many cases those people do n't know what the workers are really doing , or they just tell you what they think you want to hear . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

@@58539749 @7539749/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> Hi there everyone , I am going to be getting a new Russian tortoise soon , I have one male right now and my plan was to keep it simple and just get another male . But today my girlfriend and I went to a local Petsmart to see the Russian there and absolutely loved a female they had there . She was energetic and seemed to love attention , very outgoing alert and healthy . They said they have had her for 4 months with no problems , she has been eating good and has stayed active since arrival . My question is can I get this female and house it comfortably with my male ? I 've read that the male can get a little aggressive if there is only one female . So I was looking for some opinions , particularly from someone who has a male and female together or has in the past . Also mating would be a concern . If they are together is there a chance they will mate ? ( that would be a large problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input is much appreciated ! Thank you ! <p> What about the 6 month quarantine period for new animals ? ? You should not even house them together right away , she could make your boy very sick , very easily , considering as all petstore tortoises are wild caught . <p> There is no clue as to how they will react , but Russians are notoriously brutal fighters . They break the skin , and bloody their victims . <p> One tortoise has to be dominant . I will tell you that right now . Does n't matter WHAT the species is , someone , no matter what the sex is always in charge . I had two female geckos in the same tank for months before a problem developed , and the fast rule of that species is that girls do fine in groups . But nightly attacks of biting , and holding on showed that not every rule works for each individual animal . <p> If you want another tortoise , go for it . I have multiples myself , but everyone is seperate . Be prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enclosure , and equip it with all the essentials--including the 50$ UVB bulb . <p> That 's the problems with torts . They are expensive to set up . <p> Also , M/F pairs will mate . Even if the female is unwilling , the male will harry her non stop since they are in such close quarters . Her stress level will go up no matter what , as she becomes gravid . Then you have eggs to deal with--you will need to provide her with enough calcium , and make sure she passes the eggs and does not become egg-bound and die . Its not a fool proof process , and a vet trip and a shot of oxytocin would not be cheap . <p> There is alot of hassel when putting any two animals together--especially a pair .

I had a male for a year , someone gave me a female.Most likely WC . I did put them together and they were together for about 7 yrs or so . They seemed well established adults . They never had a problem and they were times he would chase her around . Never was there a question of her being bred.I never hibernated them until I got very brave and that following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed them in a new home with someone on this forum just that spring ) I never knew if they hatched . You just never know , but as someone said be prepared . Good Luck Russians are so cool , sometimes I have regrets . ( About getting rid of them ) Na <p> well , sounds to me like it pretty much differs from tortoise to tortoise . You guys also need to keep in mind that this summer they will both be kept in a spacious outdoor enclosure . I think i 'm gon na go ahead and do it , l I 'll be sure to let you guys know how they get along after the quarantine period ! thanks for the input ! <p> When I first got them I bought a single male . I had him for months , maybe a year before I came across a female whom I decided needed to be taken out of the pet shop . I housed those two together for months before I ended up getting another female . <p> That male was fine alone . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither one became overtly dominant or bothered the other one . Their enclosure was not large , nor heavily planted and only had one hide . <p> Now I have 11 that live together . Summers are spent in a large outside heavily planted enclosure , so no issues . Winters I use to keep the males in one group and the females in another . I never had issues . <p> Others folks have had issues and that should be expected ANY time any two or more animla live together ( be they Russian , Leopards , or humans . ) So , if you get a second one , be ready to have to house them apart . Should be okay , because your going to need to have the second animal housed apart for quarantine any how . <p> Keep in mind , a female , even if she has and will never be with a male , may produce eggs and have egg laying issues . Because of that and you not wanting eggs , I would vote trying another male . Remember too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That you can simply toss the eggs , if they do happen and you truly do n't want to deal with them ( or give the eggs to somebody near who would love the chance to try to hatch them ) . <p> I myself , if thinking of getting this for me , would go with the female . Sounds like you have found one you really like and she appears healthy . I myself do keep all of my animals when possible in groups , preferring m/f groups and with one male/two females being my top choice . <p> sounds good ! ill pick her up soon then I am still a little nervous about eggs . If it did happen i probably would n't be able to toss them ... i 'd have to just cross that bridge if it came . but yea ! I think i 'm gon na go for it ! we 'll see what happens ! <p> Right now I have 1.4.1.3 russians ( three eggs in the incubator ) . I do n't have them all together communally yet , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with little aggression . The only times I notice biting is when the male is trying to mate with the females or when they are eating too close to each other . Never anything serious though . It is one of those things that you have to monitor closely . I have started introducing the third female into the group , and the fourth female will be introduced in another year or so ( she 's over 6 " but still very young ) . I am predicting that the hatchling I am hanging on to is going to be a male , and in that case I am going to see how he gets along with the other male once he is big enough . <p> The biggest learning curve for me was figuring out how to get the females to lay their eggs indoors . I tried using nest boxes in the enclosure , outside of the enclosure , heated in various manners , etc. but to no avail . Then I moved them into an enclosure that would hold 8-9 " of dirt and in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eggs . Since then I have gotten dozens of eggs over the past three years , mostly from my largest female , but I have only hatched five ( one initially three years ago , then recently I have hatched the last four eggs they have laid ... here 's hoping that the three in the incubator will follow suit ! ) . <p> I keep mine indoors all year round and do n't hibernate them , and they breed and lay eggs all year round . If you keep a male and a female together they are going to breed , and if they are healthy they will lay eggs ( if you can provide them with enough dirt to build a nest ) . This is something you should realize before you go into it . We need more CB russians in the market , so I think it is good when people with russians attempt breeding them , but just be ready ! <p> I have 2.12 ( I do n't remember the accurate count ) Russians that I keep outdoors , I had them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will see some aggression from the males during spring , but that 's only a natural breeding behavior ( I guess my 2 males are too busy mating with the 12 females and got no time to fight ) <p> Males will always display some degree of territorial ownership when another male is introduced . The degree of aggression varies from animal to animal . <p> I never seen a situation where a female is the dominant leader of a group with one exception-When it is just a group of females with no male present at all . After a period of time a dominant female may emerge and actually act very much like a male in every way . Even ramming , biting and constantly mounting . Once a male is introduced to this group he goes for the dominant female and mounts her almost every single time . <p> Females of some of the above species will often become temporarily dominant even with a male present , when getting ready to nest or want to be bred . They will act like a male in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will often become aggressive when they have picked out a nesting site in order to keep other females from it . Some are okay with another female nesting in her general area , some are not . Typically , the " dominant " female of the group is not . <p> When keeping a male and female together on a regular basis you may experience different levels of aggression at different times of the year , different seasons . For the most part they will co-habitat fine once the initial introduction period has been gone through . But it always bears watching a dominant male for signs of increased aggression so that his cage mates do not become injured . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

It bounces off objects inside the habitat and is reflected into the shade or wherever your tortoise may be hiding . <p> Well let 's hope . they hide behind the pots . so not UV getting down on them . but only been here a week .. so can hope they get out some more .. Just wanted to know /see what people do now that these do n't like basking spots . or some do and others do n't . <p> Just to clarify ... Love you Yvonne , but UV light does not " float around " .

So in direct sunlight , where you would see a UVI reading of 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree will have a UVI of maybe 2 or so . Deeper in the shade it will diminish to practically 0 . A good rule of thumb is - how bright is the light where you are looking ? The more light being reflected - the more UVB will be as well if the main source of light contains UVB . Bright , unobstructed = the most . Well illuminated but shady areas - OK . Dark shade - probably none . Your sunburn on a cloudy day is because just as most sunlight does go straight through a cloud layer , so will some UV . However since we do n't feel as much warming from the direct sunlight on overcast days , we do n't " feel " the UV burning our skin and often stay out much longer than we would if we felt the heat . <p> Many tortoises do passively bask - in the shade under the edge of bushes , or a rock .

Much better for reflected UV . I know hiding under a plant towards the edge of the actual " basking areas " they are getting enough UVB , just need a bit longer . <p> Pre vitamin D is manufactured in the skin with UVB exposure in a matter of a few minutes . It happens quite quickly . The conversion of pre vitamin D to D3 takes longer and needs to be done with HEATED skin . Most of the basking time is devoted to heating the skin for that conversion . That conversion does not require UVB once the pre vitamin D is there . <p> Also , @Martin Martinussen Elongated Tortoises , like Redfoot do get a decent amount of D3 from their diet .

So just msking sure they have what they need . <p> Never know how and when it 's appropriate to get too technical . I just always think about how many people might be doing exactly like I did for several years - Look over the forum content for information and Ideas but never post themselves . Many seem to do that and not even join the forum= so no telling how many do that . So I try to be nice and polite , but I always try to be careful and be accurate .

Whenever I get a new tortoise or a rescue , it sleeps tucked into its shells for months or years before I eventually see it all sprawled out .

That said , I am wondering if earthworms would be possible to put in their soil . I once read ( and of course I ca n't remember where/when ) that they can help keep the viv cleaner as they will process droppings and dead foliage back into good soil . If this is possible , what kind of soil is safe for my torts yet able to sustain a livable environment for the worms ? <p> Yes , you can safely use works . Also pill bugs will help with keeping the enclosure clean . I do n't know what kind of soil worms need , I would just use plain dirt , with no pesticides or fertilizers . Maybe mix in some coconut coir just to help the dirt be a bit lighter . <p> We have plenty of unfertalized untouched ground .

When fed complete , I just switch it out with a replacement chunk . <p> While bringing in these pasture clumps of forage for the indoor enclosure , I usually ended up bringing in many living things as well from earthworms to tiny baby spiders and moth larva . The spiders would end up with neat webs in the corners and feed on the adult moths . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

The drop off is dramatic : at two feet away from the light , the reptile is getting only one-fourth of the UV it would get at only one foot away . It is recommended that the light not be any further than 18 inches ( 46 cm ) from the reptile , and preferably much closer , such as 10-12 inches ( 25-30 cm ) . This may call for some creativity on your part if your reptile is housed in the typical glass tank sold by most pet stores , or is set up as a free roamer . In custom built enclosures , the lights can be securely ceiling-mounted in the enclosure , with the basking areas set up the appropriate distance beneath them . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> thankyou chad , this is tons of info regarding lighting , am trying my best to understand everything about it . its not as simple as i thought . i am going for another look today or 2moro see what is best for me . <p> Tom said : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting sunshine regularly ( summer time for you ) I just use a regular , cheap low wattage , incandescent flood bulb . Adjust the height of the bulb to get the temp just right . <p> In my experience the flourescent tubes do nothing except light up the enclosure . I have found them repeatedly to NOT prevent MBD . The MVBs DO prevent it , in my experience . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> thankyou tom , i am going to look at t-rex products today but over here the main product for lighting is exo-terra which do a Repti Glo 10.0 Compact Desert Terrarium Lamp which as i high uvb output not sure if this would be ok &amp; then just use a incandescent heat bulb ? <p> Do not use the compact bulbs . Those have been known to cause blindness and other eye issues in tortoises ! ! ! <p> Why would you want two fixtures ? That 's just too bulbs to bump , to lamps to plug in , etc etc . <p> I use Mercury Vapor Bulbs on all of my enclosures . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't like the tube lights , and I think if you are still considering a compact bulb , you should search that phrase and look at the pictures that come up . Its just not a good idea , even if at the time , it seems more cost effective . Buy your Mercury Vapor Bulb ( MVB ) online it should run about 50$ with shipping included , and you can get some other supplies while you are at it . <p> I personally would not use any compact bulb as I lost one hatchling and one was blinded by those bulbs . " They " say that the bulbs are fixed now and that they are safe but I personally would n't chance it . I use a black light bulb for warmth at night . A 100 watt Trex for the UVB and an incandescent for just regular light . I do n't use the UVB for 14 hours . I believe they are only needed for a few hours a day then the incandescent for the rest of the time . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think it 's best if a new keeper reads up on the bulbs and makes their own choice . I have told you how I use the bulbs now someone will come on and say I am wrong ... watch for that <p> Similar question , so I though I would pile it on her , I am looking at the Zilla combo light , it has the halogen bulbs , and the t-5 florescents .

A MVB OR an incandescent flood if your tortie gets regular sun .

Your bulb goes off at night . Are you one of those that does not believe in a nighttime heat bulb ? I use my Trex during the day and a black light bulb at night ... that means I turn one one and one off . What do you do ? I have 27 animals in the house and most need nighttime heat .

IMHO 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I do n't know about Tom , but my house is always 70-80 degrees in the summer ( I rarely use central air ) . And for winter , I turn on the heat to make it 68-72 in the house . This is at tort/lizard level . So I never use heat bulbs at night myself . <p> 1 . Using a fluorescent and an incandescant together gives you a pretty true white , or color balance , or full spectrum- however you want to say it . <p> 2 . Using multiple bulbs let 's you better simulate a day- kick on the plain bulbs for 12 hours a day , the heat for 10 hours a day , and the UVB for 6-8 hours a day and you 've simulated dawn and dusk , high noon , etc . <p> 3 . Multiple bulbs gives me a safey margin . My heat bulb went out on me one cold day when I was at work . If that had been my only bulb , my guys would have suffered . Instead , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still OK . <p> 4 . My night and secondary heating is a ceramic heat emitter . I do not trust ' black lights ' since most emit a lot of UVA- a wavelenth that has some benefit in triggering behaviors , but mostly is not so great . ( This obviously would not apply to black lights that clearly state that emit UVB , and it does not apply to ' blue lights ' often used at night- which I am against as I oppose any visible light source at night since it can harm the eyes or disrupt sleep patterns . ) <p> 5 . Part of this answer has to be the size of the habitat . Fitting three bulbs in a 30 gallon tub is silly , but trying to do a 8 ' x 4 ' table with one bulb is usually just about as silly . <p> Not trying to pick a fight , just pointing out the logic of the other side . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977 
@@58539757 @7539757/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> ok i 'm new in this forum and i just bought a russian tortoise from a friend for $30 and i want to know about : The lighting and heating . currently right now i have a bulb 20 watts and i think it does n't really give heat to my russian tortoise . <p> Do i need to put sand in her house ? <p> what does she eats ? i currently give her iceberg lettuce she likes it , what food gives her more calcium or makes her more healthy <p> how big her house should be ? <p> what stuff should i put in her house especially what in the ground , i 'm planning to put sand on her house , what hiding place should i give her besides the log thingy <p> Habitat : The bare minimum size for an indoor enclosure would be a 55-gallon plastic tub , and preferably bigger . An outdoor enclosure would be even better , if possible . If your tortoise must live indoors , that 's okay , just let him spend as much time outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daytime enclosure with both sun and shade , or else roaming under supervision from you . More about the great outdoors below . <p> For some shelter , you can give your tortoise an overturned half log that is big enough for him to fit in . Tortoises , like most animals , need some shelter and hiding places to feel safe and comfortable . You can also provide some fake plants or real potted plants , but those would probably get overturned from his digging activity , so I would n't worry about that . Give your tortoise a shallow dish of fresh water everyday . Tortoises get moisture from the plants they eat , but contrary to popular belief , they do drink and bathe from time to time as well . So just make sure your guy has a shallow dish where he can do that . Also , feed your tortoise on a dish so he does n't get too much debris in his food . <p> Substrate : Your tortoise needs a substrate that he can dig into , but that can retain moisture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend coconut coir/fiber , although some people use cypress mulch , or else potting soil , topsoil , and/or organic soil , since they do not have perlite or vermiculite added to them . Personally , coco coir is my favorite because it has the texture of soil , but since it 's made from shredded coconut husks , it does not harbor fungi or insects , and is resistant to infestation . It also holds moisture well . You want the coco coir ( or cypress mulch or soil ) to be moist but not damp , so that your tortoise can experience some humidity without his skin or shell getting irritated by wetness . Soil naturally contains some sand , but pure sand is generally discouraged , because it does not hold moisture well , and because it can lead to gut impaction ( blockage ) if ingested . <p> Heating and lighting : All reptiles need the right temperatures for proper activity , digestion , and immune system function . Russian tortoises need ambient daytime temperatures in the 70s ( Fahrenheit ) , with a preferred nighttime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basking spot where they can warm themselves up . This gives them the energy they need to move , digest their food , and stay healthy . The hot spot should be 95-100*F . <p> You can create this hot spot with an incandescent light bulb that is the right distance from the substrate to create that temperature . Personally , I prefer using a ceramic heat emitter ( CHE for short ) . These are more expensive than incandescent light bulbs , but they only have to be replaced every few years , so in the long run they save you money . Like a bulb , they screw into a housing and are pointed downward . They emit no visible light , only infrared and heat . So , they can be left on at night if your room gets cold . In most homes , though , nighttime temperatures are fine , so just turn the CHE off with the overhead lights . <p> Lighting also needs to include something that will emit UVA and UVB radiation , which is found in sunlight . UVA radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use calcium . You can use a fluorescent strip light that will provide both illumination and UVA/UVB radiation . Or if you prefer , you can use a weaker lamp for lighting , and a separate bulb for UVA/UVB . Personally , I use a long strip light to provide both at once . If you do use a smaller bulb , do not get a coiled compact fluorescent light ( CFL ) because they are damaging to the eyes . I plug my strip light and CHE into a timer , which automatically comes on every morning at 7am , and turns itself off every night at 9pm . This is very convenient , and you may want to do the same . If not , just turn the lights and heat off at night yourself . Again , real sunlight is important , even if you have a good indoor setup . On nice , sunny days that are not too windy and in the 70s-80s in temperature , take your tortoise out so he can soak up some real sunshine , get some exercise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat mostly leafy greens , or forbs . This includes grocery store greens like lettuce , endive , escarole , arugula , kale , turnip greens , and mustard greens . It also includes many backyard weeds like dandelion and prickly lettuce . As long as the weeds have n't been sprayed with chemicals , your tortoise will know what is safe to browse on . Provide your tortoise with a varied diet so he does not get bored with his food , and so he can get different nutrients from different plants . Also sprinkle a little bit of calcium/vitamin D3 powder about three times a week so that your tortoise will have a healthy skeleton . Leave a piece of cuttle bone ( calcium block ) in your tortoise 's enclosure . That way he can gnaw on it whenever he wants to get calcium and/or to keep his beak trim . If you want , you can also provide commercial tortoise foods like Mazuri Tortoise Diet . These are pellets that resemble dog food , but are made from plants instead of meat . Soak them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit softer . Then offer them the way you 'd offer plants . Again , keep the diet varied - for example , one day arugula , another day dandelion , another day Mazuri , etc . Spring mix from the grocery store is another good way to provide some variety , because it comes with several different kinds of plant already mixed in . <p> You can feed your guy a pile of food about as big as he is every morning , or else split it up into two feedings each day . To put it another way , feed him either the amount he can eat in about 20 minutes , or else in two sittings of about 10 minutes each . Russians do occasionally eat grass , but not much and not often . Bigger tortoises like sulcatas do eat a lot of grass , but Russians do n't . As an occasional treat ( once a month or less ) , you can also offer your tortoise fruit , like tomatoes , strawberries , raspberries , or grapes . You do n't want to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But every once in a while is fine . Also , if you wan to , you can give him snails or slugs as a treat , again only about once a month or less . In the wild tortoises may feed on these when they find them . He probably wo n't like insects or earthworms the way box turtles do , and do n't give him meat like chicken , venison , or beef either . Just remember that your Russian should be getting mostly a variety of leafy greens . Even if that 's all he ever gets , he 'll be a happy tortie ! <p> Pros : - Great looking tort ! You have a beautiful female there and the up-front cost was great <p> What to work on .. : - Her beak and claws need to be worked on . Take her outside and let her walk around on some concrete ( with supervision ) and add a piece of slate to her cage and feed her on top of it . When she eats , her beak will grind down naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage with the proper substrate ASAP . The above post is dead on . For the torts sake , take care of that soon . Same with the lighting adjustment , very critical . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977 
@@58539758 @7539758/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> i have a sulcata tortoise - louis - i just love him . he 's supposedly 6 1/2 months old . the pet store where i bought him told me he was 5 months old , but he was very tiny . after seeing how they raise them there , he probably really was that old , but just was n't growing well . he 's really taken off in growth since i 've had him - growing about 3/4 inch since i got him the first of january . <p> i saw my first redfoot tortoise this weekend and fell in love with them . i knew as soon as i saw them that the next tortoise i would have , would be a redfoot. i 'm not in any hurry to get one right now . i already have enough going on to not need a new pet right now . ( my husband brought home a rabbit the other day and i just bought a second one yesterday . yes , now i have the tortoise AND the hare . ) <p> so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - can my sulcata be raised up right along side of a redfoot ? ? ? what are the major differences in diet and housing that i would have to consider ? i have just begun to do a bit of research on the redfoot and would like to know some really good recommended sites to research them ... besides this one of course . <p> Let 's look at some of the reasons . There is the chance of giving each other diseases , which may be ones the other tortoise has no natural resistance too . There is a huge size difference between a bulldozer adult sulcata and a redfoot . Also there is a personality difference between them , where most sulcata will become more aggressive then the redfoots . Think about if the sulcata is a male and hits sexual maturity and gets into the male one track mind of sex , sex , sex and is constantly trying to breed the poor smaller redfoot . Think stress , possible shell damage , or even worse . <p> Or look at the diet difference , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulcata can eat those things too , but not in the same percentages as the redfoot . An adult sulcata tends to get a lot of hay in it 's diet , but the redfoot wo n't be so happy to see that on his plate . They both could survive on each others diet , but it would not be the best idea for them to have to do so . <p> Then climate , the redfoot tends to not want the high intensity lighting the sulcata needs , plus the redfoot needs a higher humidity level . Yes , they could once more compromise , but should they have to ? <p> My opinion is strongly only one species to an enclosure . Others feel differently and flaunt their ability to do so with no apparent problems all the time . It 's to some degree a personal opinion and you have mine and some of my major reasons for them . It comes down to your choice in the end . Can you do two enclosures ? Which any time you have two or more tortoises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them any how in case of a problem arising . <p> Yea I have to agree with Jacqui on this one and I 've been known to mix species of animals . Redfoot 's diet needs are to different from sulcatas , the sulcata is gon na want all the fruits and goodies the Redfoot gets and that is just bad for the sulcata . <p> Also there are people who have kept different species together with no issue until they were separated and the tortoises seemed depressed . So even if you decide to overlook the health and diet risks sooner or later the sulcata will be to big to live with the redfoot safely and they will have to be separated which could cause stress . <p> I would still get the Redfoots , I currently have two and they are great , just get a different enclosure . A 40 gallon breeder tank works well as a terrarium for Redfoot babies . <p> thanks for the opinions guys . that 's EXACTLY what i needed to know ! i did see the difference in diet and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeding their redfoot or a general rule . the more research i 've done , i have seen that their diet is a LOT different than a sulcata and so they really would not work well together . thanks for the advice ... definitely taken ! if i decide to get a redfoot in the future , i 'll know ahead of time to definitely put him or her in a totally different enclosure . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

First off , I want to second everything Yvonne said . During the day , Russian tortoises need ambient temperatures in the 70s-80s , and basking temperatures in the 90s . At night , they prefer temperatures in the 60s , but it 's not a big deal if your house does not cool off that much . <p> Also , as Yvonne said , sunshine coming through a window is nice for light and warmth , but because glass and plastic filter out most of the UV rays , you need a UVA and UVB bulb for indoors . You said you have a UV bulb , which is great , but I want to make sure it 's a good one . You can use either a long fluorescent bulb , like the ZooMed ReptiSun , or a mercury vapor bulb , like the ZooMed PowerSun . You want to avoid compact fluorescent bulbs ( CFLs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent blindness . <p> As for your setup , it sounds pretty good , but I do have some suggestions for diet . Dandelions ( sunflower family ) are awesome ! Rocket or arugula ( brassica family ) is also a good one . Watercress is another brassica , and it 's good , too , although it does not seem to be their favorite . However , spinach is generally considered to be a poor tortoise food . Many tortoises do n't like it , probably because it contains high levels of anti-nutrients , like oxalic acid and goitrogens . Other plants contain such compounds , but the high concentrations in spinach mean that tortoises should n't be getting spinach very often . Every once in a while is okay , but many tortoise keepers do not offer spinach at all . Again , tortoises seem to smell that it 's not the best plant for them , and often refuse it . <p> I recommend sticking mostly with the sunflower and brassica families ( Russians eat from these a lot of in the wild ) . Other edible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endive , escarole , and radicchio . Other edible brassicas include collard greens , turnip greens , and mustard greens . It 's also a good idea to let your tortoise outside so he can forage on his own . As long as your grounds are not sprayed with pesticides or herbicides , it is safe to allow him to find plants that he likes . Weather permitting , let him go outside as often as possible so he can soak up the natural sunlight , which provides plenty of UVA ( stimulates appetite ) and UVB ( stimulates vitamin D3 production for strong bones ) . Plus , it 's fun ! <p> As an occasional treat ( no more than monthly ) , you can also offer sweeter fruits and vegetables , like tomato , cucumber , strawberry , raspberry , grape , or diced carrots . Finally , you might want to add some good commercial foods to his diet . Mazuri Tortoise Diet and ZooMed Grassland Tortoise Food are both good choices . Just soak the pellets in warm water for a few minutes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer him , too . If your guy is used to whole plants , it might take him a while to learn how to eat these , but most do eventually learn . Enjoy ! hr BTW - In my opinion , bathing a healthy adult tortoise 2-3 times per week is too frequent , and can be stressful . Babies and sick tortoises do benefit from several baths per week , but if they 're healthy , one bath per week is all that 's needed to stay hydrated . Maybe if you cut back on the bathing , your guy will feel more relaxed and his appetite will increase . <p> I remember reading that having the enclosure in a sunlit window could cause the temps in the enclosure to get too warm . Keep a check on the temperature range . If the tort ca n't get out of the hot area then they are unable to cool down after basking . <p> Is the water dish large enough to allow the tort to climb in and self soak ? And shallow enough to eliminate any flipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . Round 6 " or 8 " . <p> As I said earlier she 's now eating again , but still is really sluggish . She does n't like to wake up in the morning and right now she is on my lap and has n't attempted to move . Normally if I leave her like that she would have tried to crawl off . She never normally sleeps this much . Last time she went like this it was because her basking lamp was n't warm enough for her , so she was naturally winding down as if she was to hibernate . I 've put my hand under her lamp and it is a warm as it normally is . But because she 's not sitting under there maybe she is trying to hibernate herself . <p> Should I try and keep her under the lamp ? I do n't want her to hibernate when I 'm still feeding her . <p> Also I just put a thermometer into her cage and under her basking lamp it is only 77F . I brought the bulb from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb . The lamp looks like a desk lamp but it came with her cage . Maybe a new lamp would work ? <p> Also I just put a thermometer into her cage and under her basking lamp it is only 77F . I brought the bulb from the reptile section of pets at home so it a proper bulb . The lamp looks like a desk lamp but it came with her cage . Maybe a new lamp would work ? <p> EDIT : I 've left the thermometer in and it has now got up to 86.4F 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Well , that seems to be the answer then . Russians need a basking temp in the 90s . Most keepers ( including me ) have ours at 95-100*F . Without that elevated temperature , the animal is unable to digest its food , and its appetite goes down . <p> For a basking spot , I usually use ZooMed ceramic heat emitters ( CHEs ) , but I have also used the ZooMed basking spot lamp . You can also use the ZooMed PowerSun , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UVB , and heat as well . As you can see , I like the ZooMed brand a lot , but there are other , comparable products from other brands , too . As long as you 're getting that hot spot to 95*F , that 's what matters . <p> The Arcadia UVB/UVA bulb is equal to ( or possibly better ) than the Zoomed Powersun . Do you have it as close to the basking area as is allowed ? ( there would be instructions with your bulb ) . I believe that is 12 inches for the Powersun 100w , but it might be different with the Arcadia . Do you have a piece of slate or a tile under the basking light to add warmth ? Finally , all of these type of bulbs just become less effective after 6 months , certainly by 12 months . Do you know how old your bulb is ? It might help to replace it . <p> PS . Geo , I always love your descriptions ; this time of the tortoise food groups . hr And Kelly ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one Arcadia bulb ( and if it is relatively new ) , then add a second bulb near the warm end ( can be a regular house bulb ) , to brighten up the enclosure and also add warmth . Get that basking area up to 35c ! <p> The bulb is right near her basking area . I 'd say less that 12in , maybe 8in . The Acadia bulb is her UV bulb not the basking one , at the moment were using a Bayonet one from pets at home . What watt would you recommend , at the mo were only using a 40w basking bulb , that could be why it 's not getting up to the temps she needs . I 'm looking at getting an Acadia basking bulb since you speak so highly of them . <p> The basking bulb gets replaced every 4-5 months when it 's blows , the UVB/UVA bulb has never been changed . <p> We do n't have slate under her basking areas , but I 'll definatly look into that . Anything to get my little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine with this set up since we got her , we 've used the same brand of basking bulb the whole time . Hopefully nothing else is wrong .

But it 's been over 2 weeks since she went . <p> What watt would you recommend , at the mo were only using a 40w basking bulb , that could be why it 's not getting up to the temps she needs . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> If you 're going to use incandescent bulbs for basking warmth , you should get more like a 75-W bulb . A 40-W bulb is not going to be hot enough . <p> Kelly250989 said : <p> It 's just strange as she 's be fine with this set up since we got her , we 've used the same brand of basking bulb the whole time .

Was she housed with other reptiles at the school ? If so , she might have contracted a disease from one of them . Was she transported without adequate warmth ? If so , then she could have developed a " cold " - an upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) . Does she have trouble breathing ? Is there any discharge from her nostrils ? If so , then she 's going to need warmer temperatures and daily warm baths as a home remedy . If that does n't work , then she might need to go to the vet . <p> Good point about the trip . If no URTI , then it may have just stressed her . Tortoises can sometimes go into a funk and hide out for a few weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things right for her now . <p> I am still a bit confused about your lighting . Is the Arcadia a tube fluorescent light ? Or a large bulb light ? Perhaps a picture , or link to the exact kind you have ? The tube lights are fine , as long as they are switched out every 6 months . The basking light can indeed be a regular house bulb , but again , I agree , it should be a higher wattage if it is your only heat source . Whatever it takes to get the basking area up to 35c. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

Also , I have read Chris 's article about keeping Hermann 's . He mentioned that the humidity should be at about 70% . Does that mean Hermann 's actually needs the tropical basking light ? Thanks ! <p> Thanks ! May I ask which uv light do you currently use or do you have any recommendation ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I use different ones for different purposes . In my large closed chambers I use Arcadia 12% HO bulbs in a reflector hood . These are very strong bulbs , so I can use them from farther away , and I only run them for about 4 hours mid-day . I use 10.0 tubes in other areas , and I like mercury vapor bulbs for open topped enclosures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms to normally differentiate between the 5.0 and 10.0 bulbs . That means the tropical or forest bulb is a 5.0 bulb which is a bright light spectrum with 5% of the total light emitted coming from the UVB spectrum . Their marketing idea is that is more like the forest and tropical exposure a reptile would get in more broken , partially shaded areas . The Desert is 10.0 which is the same spectrum EXCEPT 10% of the total light is in the UVB spectrum . The idea of producing a more intense UV like in the open sun of a desert environment . Really desert vs tropical is meaningless - just the desert produces more UVB proportionately so depends upon the application in your enclosure , not tropical or desert . <p> Like Tom said , just marketing hype , and some manufacturers just list the 5.0 or 10.0 and now , 12.0. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I 've raised and sold dozens of green iguanas and a bunch of other Iguanid species too . <p> Most greens , if they are healthy and house correctly , grow up to be aggressive .

Many of the large calm ones I 've seen were housed too cold , too dry , and not fed properly . When their routine changed to something more appropriate for their species and their health got better , their aggression level went up . <p> So to answer your question : Those warnings are justified .

@@58539772 @7539772/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> I adopted 2 male RES a little while back about 4 " each and have been housed together since they where young no aggression issues as of yet . Now I 've been offered a yellow belly slider in much need of a good home ( currently being housed in a small tank not much room ) and I 'm curious as to rather or not I can house them together ? <p> I know the turtles should be the same size roughly , there needs to be enough food for all of them , so they are n't fighting for tank space or food . they have the same basic care requirements ( correct me if I 'm wrong ) is sex going to be an issue ? I 'm not sure if the yellow belly is male or female yet only seen pictures of the small/cramped set up . <p> I do have a rubber made tub as a temp setup with a basking spot if need be . But I will only take in the yellow belly if it can be housed safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is roughly 10gallons per inch of turtle , and 5gallons per inch or every other turtle . I 'm currently trying to work out plans for an out door pond once the weather gets better they will spend weekends at my fathers 200 gallon pond when we are over for bbq 's or visits . <p> My main goal would be a pond but for now they will be in an indoor setup with out door time . Any and all input is welcomed just want to makee sure it is possible and safe to house them together before I say yes to this person . <p> I 'm not too sure on this , I did do some research before I decided on a tortoise instead of a water turtle , but I believe a RES and a Yellow belly can be housed together . But there does need to be some quarantine time apart before you can introduce them together . Hopefully someone more knowledgable will come along shortly . <p> I did tons of research before picking up my tortoise 's as well but someone I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find good homes for some red ear sliders so I took them in . Now there is an ad up for a free yellow belly that needs a home , the temp rubber made setup would be the " quarantine tank . I have googled and people say it is fine and natural for them to be housed together is space permits but I 'm also hoping someone on here has hands on experience . <p> I have 3 RES and a yellow belly in my pond right now , for awhile I had the yellow belly separated until he got big enough to be in with my others , I thought there might be an aggression issue when I introuced the yellow belly since he is only about a year old and the RES 's are about 8 BUTTT they get along great ! The yellow belly bit my female RES on the shell once , now , they all swim around like they have been together forever ! <p> I ended up picking up the girl . I 'm assuming girl smaller claws shorter tale she is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly a year and a half old the woman said . My only worry is having 2 males and one female . Other then some algy on her shell she looks great ate 6 minnos in an hour , not a huge pellet turtle but could have just been full , I have mazuri pellets and nutrafin basix tomorrow I 'll try some collard greens , red leaf lettuce and or romain <p> My wife keeps telling me just to toss her in with the guys because she never had an issue when she kept turtles never quarintined them . <p> I do n't quarintine , and I 've never had an issue either . I 'm sure others would say this is a huge no no though . I have one female and two males . I think the yellow belly might be a female but still too young to know for sure . My female is the bigest of my RES 's and she runs the boys like a boss ! lol The boys seem to do the pretty nail dance at eachother more than at the female , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they have been together the longest . I do n't think you will have a problem as long as they have enough room and food : <p> That is pretty funny my boys ( RES ) have done the nail thing to each other ever since I got them , they too have been together since young ( not 100% sure how young ) both are about 4 " got them from a rescue . The yellow belly is deffinitly a female she is 4 " as well but in better condition shell wise . I went to the doctors came home an all 3 where in the tank wife claims the kids said she was lonley and begged her to put her in the big tank . All is going good boys bug her from time but she will do it back <p> Only odd thing is she does n't seem to be a big basker : s is this normal ?

My uncle had 6 big dogs , German Shepard/Pitbull mixes and they got attacked by a pack of over a dozen desperate coyotes one winter , he had to go out and shoot the coyotes , one of his dogs died in the attack and all of them were hurt pretty bad .

My dad uses two great Pyrenees to guard his alpaca . But your neighbors will hate you , his are pretty much silence all day and then in the evening and night when the predators come out they seem not to shut up .

These are actually the two absolute worst choices for feeders , read on to find out why . <p> Not only are they very fatty and carry a lot of parasites , and are high in copper sulfate , but they also contain an enzyme called thiaminase that blocks thiamine absorption in the predator ( a.k.a , your turtle . ) Over time , this creates a thiamine deficiency in the turtle , and can lead to neurological problems and even death . <p> Fathead minnows , AKA Rosy Reds , are also a danger for this reason .

Pleurodira has the more ancestral side-necked turtles , and Cryptodira has the more derived hidden-necked turtles . Pleurodira has three living families of turtles surviving today . All the remaining 11 families of turtle are in Cryptodira , and here they are below : <p> Family Emydidae - Commonly known as pond turtles or terrapins , this family includes map turtles , painted turtles , red-eared sliders , and others . It also includes the American box turtles ( genus Terrapene ) , and their closest cousins , the wood and spotted turtles ( Clemmys ) , as well as the Holarctic pond turtles ( Emys ) . Judging by the fossil record , American box turtles probably first evolved adaptations for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial existence some 15 million years ago . <p> Family Geoemydidae - These turtles are so closely related to Emydidae , that they were once placed in the same family , but have recently been placed in their own . This family includes Asian pond turtles , Asian box turtles ( Cuora and Pyxidea ) , and Neotropical wood turtles . Asian box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American box turtles did . <p> Family Testudinidae - These are the tortoises , which are the most fully terrestrial turtles . This family is thought to have evolved from the Geoemydidae some 50 million years ago . Although both Emydidae and Geoemydidae do have some members that are terrestrial to varying degrees ( namely the American and Asian box turtles , respectively ) , tortoises have more adaptations to life on land than they do because they have been evolving on land much longer . <p> So , you see , although the two pond turtle families ( Emydidae and Geoemydidae ) are more closely related to tortoises than any other types of turtle , they are not in the tortoise family .

Their bodies are n't designed for actual swimming . But as many can attest , most chelonians , whether they be tortoise , terrapins , boxies or sliders , will not hesitate to cool off by submerging in water . <p> Okay , that makes sense , but then , does n't the box turtle have elephantine feet ? Would n't that mean it should be called a box tortoise ? Not trying to argumentative here , it 's just genuine curiosity . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> The term " elephantine foot " may be somewhat relative and subjective .

Maybe someone else more knowledgeable can expand on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully aquatic pond turtles are paddle-shaped to help them swim , while those of tortoises are more pillar-like ( elephantine ) to help them walk . Box turtles have feet that are intermediate between the two , because they are more terrestrial than pond turtles , but less terrestrial than tortoises .

Do I have it right ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Yep , you got it ! <p> I should add that adaptations for terrestrial life vary among different types of American box turtle . For example , there are several subspecies in the species Terrapene carolina . The Eastern ( T. carolina carolina ) and three-toed ( T. carolina triunguis ) box turtles can swim and feed in the water , but spend more time on land . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf coast ( T. carolina major ) box turtles are more aquatic , with the Gulf coast subspecies even being able to dive . I 'm not sure where the Mexican ( T. carolina mexicana ) or Yucatan ( T. carolina yucatana ) box turtles fall on this spectrum , though . <p> However , in the drier parts of North America , other types of box turtles ( same genus , different species ) are more terrestrial . Here in Colorado , the ornate box turtle ( T. ornata ornata ) lives on the prairie , and the desert box turtle ( T. ornata luteola ) , as the name suggests , lives in even more arid habitats . <p> There are two other species in this genus , too . The Coahuila box turtle ( T. coahuila ) is also known as the aquatic box turtle , so that tells you how much it loves the water .

These animals have varying abilities to survive in arid environments , depending on where they come from . For example , arid-land tortoises excrete uric acid in their urine to save water , while moist-land tortoises excrete ammonia and urea ( like box turtles ) , since that 's metabolically easier and they can afford to lose more water .

So why is a box turtle a turtle ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> A division of reptiles called chelonia includes turtles , tortoises and terrapins . For the most part , the difference between a turtle and a tortoise is more of a matter of semantics than a strict scientific separation . Colloquially , both biologists and laypeople use the word " turtle " to mean all chelonians . In general , the reptiles referred to as turtles live in or near the water and have adapted to swim by holding their breath underwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arid regions and are built for storing their own water supply and walking on sandy ground . <p> From a biological perspective , a tortoise is a kind of a turtle , but not all turtles are tortoises . Tortoises occupy their own taxonomic family , called testudinidae . All types of land and aquatic turtles come in a wide range of sizes , colors and shapes . Sometimes , the name " terrapin " is used to refer to an animal that falls somewhere between a turtle and a tortoise . Terrapins live in swampy areas or begin life underwater and eventually move to dry land . Turtles <p> Turtles can live on land but often live in freshwater , the ocean or brackish ponds and marshland . Their front feet might be fins or merely webbed toes , and they typically have streamlined back feet to help them swim . Some ways in which a turtle and a tortoise are different are that a turtle has a flatter back and might spend much of its life underwater . <p> A turtle typically mates and lays eggs underwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs , rocks or sandy banks . During cold weather , they often burrow in mud and go into a state called torpor , which is similar to hibernation . Sea turtles migrate great distances . They are often omnivorous , eating plants , insects and fish . Tortoises <p> Tortoises live almost entirely above water . They typically wade into water only to clean themselves or to drink . In fact , they can not swim and could drown in deep water . Unlike sea turtles , tortoises rarely migrate . <p> A tortoise 's feet are hard , scaly and nubby so that it can crawl across sharp rocks and sand . Tortoises often have claws to dig burrows , which they occupy during hot , sunny weather or when they sleep . Their shell forms a rounded dome , allowing the tortoise 's limbs and head to withdraw for protection . <p> Another difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that a tortoise is mostly herbivorous . It typically eats grasses , flowers and weeds . Tortoises also eat shrubs , cacti and other plants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leafy greens , especially in captivity . Some tortoises also eat insects , worms and carrion . <p> Eventhough box turtles resemble tortoises in some ways , their behavior is strictly turtle-like . Agressive feeders , mostly carnivorous . The hatchlings even look like water turtles . Some spend quite a bit of time in the water . Mine prefer swamp to dry . <p> Eventhough box turtles resemble tortoises in some ways .... The hatchlings even look like water turtles . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I du n no ... I suppose it 's all relative , but while I agree their behavior is typically more " turtle-esque , " I personally think baby boxies superficially resemble young tortoises , and the resemblance goes both ways between the native gopher tortoise and other species . I 've had people seen baby gophers and mistake them for baby boxies . Likewise , I had people over to my house and when they saw my little baby redfoot , they thought it was a baby box turtle . <p> When I worked at the LPS , I often helped people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking whether it had stripes on the legs and if it had a ridge running down the top of the shell . <p> Box turtles are land turtles , they can go into the water .. but they really can not swim so basically they need to be able to get out of the water quickly ... shallow waters ... I have seen video where they were swimming , but basically if they ca n't reach land they will tire and drown . This is from what I have seen , other ppl might know a bit more <p> Bump - Yeah , that bugs me , too . When speaking in general terms , I call all chelonians " turtles . " However , if I 'm talking specifically about that species , I would never refer to it as a type of box turtle . <p> Another defining factor is they are omnivorous . There feet are completely built differently than a tortoise 's , as well . And while they are mostly terrestrial for most species , they are still semi-aquatic. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I 'm new here and I have to say you all have such beautiful torts/turtles ! <p> I currently own 2 red eared sliders , 1 male who is almost 7 , and a new female who we just got from a friend who could n't take care of her , she is 5 years old and relatively smaller than the male . As soon as I am finished cleaning my house I will spend the afternoon with them taking pictures to share with all of you . <p> I look very forward to meeting you all . I always wanted to have turtle buddies to relate to .

She is 5 years old but relatively small , the ex-owner believes she is small because she was kept in a small environment her whole life . Still have n't picked out a name for her yet . <p> Thank you . She thinks so , too . I 've had her for just over 5 years , she was very tiny when i acquired her , so less than a year , I think , so I reckon she 's about 6 years old now . I love her more than I would have though possible a few years ago . <p> Thank you . She thinks so , too .

Animals ( including humans ) do crave foods they need . However , those cravings have been shaped by evolution in their natural habitat . In the case of humans , we crave sweets , fats , and salt because they are comparatively rare on the savanna where we evolved . In " captivity " ( i.e. industrial society ) we have them in overabundance , which causes health problems . The same may be said for fruit in the case of redfoot tortoises ; craving them is good in the wild , but not in captivity when they are available all the time . As for chocolate , some food scientists think the theobromine in it acts like an opiate , causing people to seek it out for the soothing feeling it brings them . Now , back to spinach ... <p> Kristina said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in favor of the sweeter lettuces that the spring mix contains Spinach is quite bitter , but the whole point of my post is that it is NOT " bad " for them at all .

I have offered it to them in a spring mix a few other times , and they generally eat around it . But perhaps in time , if I offer it in moderation as you suggest , they will accept it . Other plants contain higher concentrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know if tortoises eat those plants ? <p> I think it is tempting to focus on one aspect of a food , when really every food is a melange of vitamins , minerals , nutrients , secondary metabolic compounds , textures , and flavors . Tortoises can eat plants that contain compounds toxic to mammals without problems . For example , Russian tortoises regularly eat buttercup , even though they contain terpenoids that are lethal to sheep . <p> I also think that toxicity and anti-nutrition are moderated by a varied diet , but I also think that different tortoises may tolerate different plants , depending on whether they have evolved to deal with them . In the case of spinach , it is native to Central Asia where Russian tortoises are from , but they do n't eat it in the wild . Maybe there is something about this plant - whether oxalic acid or some other compound - that makes it unpalatable to them . Perhaps for some tortoises , you have to watch how much spinach you offer so they do n't get too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already to sense that they should n't be eating too much of this stuff . <p> I have always fed my tortoises spinach as part of a varied diet . I got called out by Stells and Danny several times for feeding it to my animals and recommending it and red and white clover . I have always said that spinach was good for you ... I always believed Popeye ... <p> I am glad now that keepers are coming around to believing what I 've been saying for years ... <p> I would not feed it daily , however . Moderation means you have to mix things up . I feed something different every day . Once a week or every two weeks is fine , however . It takes me about two weeks to cycle through all the greens that the grocery store near me carries . <p> To better explain what I mean by cycling through food items and feeding in moderation , please refer to the article I wrote on " balanced diets .

I 've began to spend a lot of time with her . I currently feed her Maintenance formula Rep-Cal which both has a fruity pebble aroma and distinct colors . Green , Red , Purple , and Tan . When I used to feed her strictly vegetables and fruit she never ate anything green or rarely any ways . She would go straight for tomatoes peppers and other of that sort and color . I was concerned because she would n't eat greens . And now that i have her mostly on the pellet food again I noticed she only eats the purple red and tan .

Does anyone know a place or a forum to adopt pets . or maybe any in need in the general area of Kansas ? <p> Your tortoises diet needs to be a lot more then just the tortoise pellets . Sometimes they need to be tricked into eating what 's good for them even if they do n't seem to want it . Chopping up the green colored greens and mixing them in with something she does like , spritzing with water so they stick together usually does the trick .

There 's one I 've used in the past ... ca n't remember the name of it , but it comes in a blue pump spray bottle with a red label . You spray it on the dog and the fleas just jump off and die . You can actually SEE them coming to the top of the dog 's coat and jumping ship . You can then spray your carpets and floors and kill the little buggers .

We had fleas in our yard when our kids were young . One kid was very sensitive , but we did n't want to use pesticides around our kids or the dog .

It 's giving me a glimmer of hope . <p> I have 2 little boys and for all these months have been trying all the " natural " methods . I did n't want to do poisons .

Luckily , Amazon refunded our $ and now we have to re order and wait for them to come . Once they do we will set that up and hopefully get some nematodes . <p> We have treated the stray cat since day 1 with Frontline Plus . We just recently treated her for tapeworms too . Poor thing .

We do n't ever have to treat or do anything for them . Its a nice area . Wan na move up here ? We can talk torts . <p> Well after reading up on nematodes and many reviews on them , it is definitely something we will try ! ! Lynne I 'm so happy you suggested that .

If it had been me , I may have acted like an angry momma bear protecting her flea bitten cub . Would n't have been good . <p> Just as another source of info- have you tried your local county extension service ? They are usually great sources of info on things like this and maybe able to help in ways you that have not thought of , including things like ID'ing things to be sure you are doing the right stuff . <p> It really seems you 'd be better containing your pets and bombing the ever loving Jesus out of everything and the yard .

So finding a way to stop is a must . <p> We spoke to our landlords and I have contacted both Corky 's Pest Control and Flea Busters for written quotes .

When the temperature dips below 60F at night I bring him inside , and it 's been under 60 for the last month . I have Mercury Vapor bulb in a dome lamp for indoor heat . It works great but the tortoise wants nothing to do with it . He gets as far away from the lamp as possible . I also tried one of those heat coils that give off infrared heat and it worked like tortoise repellant . <p> My kids tossed one of their blankets in his enclosure and for the last month he 's been burrowing in the blanket .

I keep him under a large south facing window and when it 's sunny he wakes up , eats , sometimes pees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and when he 's warm his appetite is huge .

I 'm wondering if I need to get a pig blanket ( heat mat ) for him or is this normal behavior . I think I remember reading that a heat source from underneath is n't good for a tortoise , but I 'm not sure what I 've got going on now is OK either . I 'm sure someone will let me know . <p> I 'd be interested to hear what anyone else in Southern California does this time of year . <p> Most of us will simply keep the tortoise outside year round with your climate , but build a heated night box , or heated shed the tortoise will go into when the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get some great ideas . <p> There 's a pig blanket on the floor that they sit on and a red brooder bulb hanging from the ceiling at about 4 ' on a timer for night time only .

Today it 's about 59F degrees and they were all out grazing . <p> My leopards live in a chest freezer , it has been gutted and a nice hole cut in the end with flaps over the door .

He also used chest-type freezers for his tortoises . Just like you , he cut a door out of one end and covered with flaps . That was the only modification needed , because the freezers are very well insulated . <p> Dog houses are designed for dogs . Not tortoises . They are too tall inside , the doors are too big and let all your heat out , they are too drafty , and they are not insulated . The floor space is also too small to allow the tortoise to get off of its heat mat . By the time you seal it , insulate it , cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling , reduce and lower the door hole , and make a door , you might as well have just built your own and designed it to fit a tortoise . Not coincidentally , this is exactly the path I took . <p> Hey Duff . I 'm in La Jolla and I 've also been experiencing that uncharacteristically cold weather . My leopard is about 4 years old and is housed outdoors nearly all year round . If it 's under 65 degrees during the day , I just provide him with a regular heating bulb that he likes to sit under to stay warm . If it drops below 55 at night , I just pick him up and he gets to spend the night inside . That way , it gives me some peace of mind that he 's warm and cozy . I do n't have to worry about electrical failures or him not getting enough heat . Only takes like ten seconds to bring him inside , so it 's worth it . It 's gon na warm up eventually .

But it 's looking nice all week so we 'll see how it goes . <p> Hi there , I am an animal keeper , live in San Diego and also have a leopard tortoise . If the tortoise will not use the heat , the heating is inefficient- either too hot or too cold . He should have a basic 50-100w red heat bulb with a ceramic dome . If he is inside during the day he will also need a UVA/UVB bulb ( also known as a power sun ) .

Only that once upon a time we thought they could not see red light which is false .

I suppose blue could be the better option if this is an issue . <p> Always open to new perspectives- why no red bulbs ?

She is just buried away sleeping all the time . <p> I have bathed her , offered her food and woke her and put her under heat lamp . This does n't last long she is soon back in bed . <p> She usually eats and potters about her tank . Is it just time of year ? ? ? I am worried : - ( <p> Also .... hibernation is not needed .... atall ... in captivity ... so it is not something you have to force yourself to do ...

My intention was not at all . <p> Most tortoises in the wild are solitary , coming together just for breeding . However , captivity changes the way tortoises act and how we " make " them react and behave . Some times they do better , especially hatchlings , with competition . However , the flip side is they can start to bully each other and dominance/sexual maturity/breeding thoughts can come into play . Which means , whenever you have more then one tortoise , you always have to be ready to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . <p> In this case , it is a bad idea . You have an animal that is not doing well . Not the time to introduce a new enclosure mate . Also a new tortoise , would have to be close to identical in size , which may be hard to find . Then the biggest reason not to add a new tortoise at this point is : a new tortoise would have to be in quarantine for several months , so it would not help the current issue . <p> hr <p> vickeevam said : <p> Does it make any difference if it 's a red lamp as that 's what she has now ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> All that matters is the heat it puts out .

At room temperature , if she does n't eat or drink anything all winter long , she could lose a lot of weight . At brumation temps ( 40*F ) , she could be inactive for up to 5 months , and not lose much weight at all . <p> I posted a relevant thread on the previous page . My Russian tortoises behaved much the same way during September and October . In their native Central Asia , this species aestivates to escape the heat from July to October ( 4 months ) and brumates to survive the cold from November to March ( 5 months ) , for a total of 9 months of inactivity per year . This is why Russian are very hungry from April to June ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store up for the winter . <p> Given my Russian tortoises ' behavior , the good folks here at TFO advised me to go ahead and let them brumate , so that is what I am doing . After at least 2 weeks of fasting ( and probably more ) , and having been bathed to help them void until last week , they are now in a mini-fridge for the winter . If your tortoise ate well over the summer and is healthy now , then she would be better off hibernating as well . <p> If she is underweight , however , then she should not be allowed to brumate , as it could be dangerous for her . Here is the Donohue equation for determining the minimum weight of a tortoise for hibernation : <p> What this formula tells you is , for a given length , if your tortoise weighs at least as much as the output weight , then it is heavy enough to brumate . Weight is determined mostly by water content , as well as fat reserves , and bone density . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dehydrated , lacking in fat reserves or bone density , or a combination of these . The Donohue equation provides a good indicator of a tortoise 's conditions , although it works better for some species than others , depending on their shell shape . <p> Of course , there is more to health than just weight . If you tortoise has loose stools , it could be suffering from an infestation of parasitic helminths ( flatworms and/or roundworms ) , or from a bloom of the wrong kind of gut bacteria . If your tortoise has a runny nose , then it probably has an upper respiratory tract infection . If the eyes never open fully , then the tortoise could have an eye infection . An animal with these or other conditions should not be allowed to brumate , but should be warm and hydrated , and seen by a vet . <p> Up until yesterday we had been taking her out and putting her under the heat lamp for as long as she stayed there which was n't long ! Did n't do it today and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think she def happy asleep . <p> I will weigh and measure her but not sure about putting her out in shed to hibernate would rather not as she too young but I ca n't make her eat or drink all I can do is bathe her and keep putting her under lamp . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

Mixing species is NOT a good idea , ever . The bacteria changes from animal to animal and they could make each other sick . Also , being together would only cause stress .

They do n't  do good with other chameleons and i 'm sure not with a tortoise . Plus Chameleons like tall enclosures , vs a tortoise which like wide and lots of floor space .

You are observing increased " head-bobbing " when they are intrigued by something because they are breathing more , so that they 'll have the energy to investigate . It 's no different than the more rapid breathing in any other excited animal , including us . The more excited turtles are , the more rapidly they will breathe , and the faster their head will appear to be " bobbing " ... but only if it is resting on the plastron .

The bobbing pattern is species-specific , and affects mate selection . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977 
@@58539790 @7539790/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> First time mommy of a leopard tortoise , need some guidance and advice <p> Hi . I 've got a leopard tortoise four days ago and I need some guidance and advise . I did a lot of research before bring him home but of course I still have some doubts regarding his care . I 'm almost certain that it 's a male . The lady at the reptile centre thinks that too . And said that he 's between 6/8 months old . Measures 6cm and weights 46g . So for me he 's pretty small I made the enclosure myself from an old coffee table . For the substrate I 'm using a mix of soaked coconut coir and a Tortoise Life Substrate ( a mix of top soil and sand ) I have a Mercury light that I leave it on during the day and evening and a black ceramic light on at night . I check the temperature every few hours even during the night I manage to get a temperature around 30/35-C ( 80/95-F ) in the basking area during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending were he is . My main concern is during the night time when I turn the Mercury light off and turn the ceramic on . During that time he 's sleeping in the bedding area and his temperature is around 17/21-C ( 62/70-C ) . He sleeps a lot and I 'm not sure if it 's a normal behaviour for a baby tortoise . Only after I give him a 30m soak , he gets more active , poops and then gets energise , after that I 'm able to give him a mix of greens ( lettuce , watercress , wild rocket and coriander sprinkled with calcium ) I also gave him some strawberry today . Then he moves around and sleeps again . I also spray the enclosure avery two days to keep it moist , I change his water dish every day . I have some water cress pots around the enclosure so he can nibble on it and help with the moisture levels . I 'll attached some photos of the enclosure and my baby boy . So any advise that you could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy happy tortoise I appreciate .

I have a baby sulcata but what species ( if any ) could co habitate with the sulcata while they are babys ? Any insight would be great . Thanks Aaron <p> In my opinion , you should never mix different species of tortoise in the same habitat . If you absolutely HAVE to do it , then it might be permissible to have a leopard in with the sulcata while they are still babies . Because leopards and sulcatas come from the same continent , and live in more or less the same environment , they could live together while they are both the same size . However , the sulcata quickly outgrows the leopard and then would bully the smaller tortoise . <p> Makes sence , What about when they get older and are in the back yard and roaming the house ? will there still be bully problems ? when there is an escape rout ? if so I have no problem keeping with the sulcatas , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 2 Sulcata in a large yard with a good sized shed that they lived in . I had them both together during the day but Tony was a lot smaller so they slept separately with Tony in a tort table in the shed . But then Tony got bigger .

Because that showed me , even tho I thought I had enough room , and there certainly was escape routes , it ended up I had to rehome the smaller one . That was a really hard decision to make . The bigger one , Bob , is a friendly outgoing clown with a great big easy going personality and I would NEVER suspect that he was bullying Tony until I saw it myself . So my advice would be that unless you can keep them in separate habitats forever , do n't add another tort to be with the Sulcata . <p> Bob and Tony lived together for 3 years . I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .

@@58539795 @7539795/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> This list is quite long . It covers the desert dwelling tortoises like the California DT , Greek , Hermanni and Russians . The Ratios are the same for desert dwelling Torts and of course some of the foods are harder to come by and some I leave out all together . It is just a nice list to pick from and change up their foods as I often am eating the same things I have gotten for them . This list is compiled from several different sources which I have stated . If I have forgotten to list any source it was not intentional and if you PM me I will correct it . If you have plants you know can be added to this list please PM me and I will do so . <p> Here it is : What to feed : Grazing on grasses and natural plants is the best nutrition for tortoises . <p> Feed 85%Please understand NO one food should be fed 85% of the time . This list is so that you can choose different items and these items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed Greens should be fed 85% of the time , not just one of the greens ) Just like your plate should have 1/2 of it in veg . 1/4 in meat and 1/4 in carb ( like potato ) But no one would want to eat the same thing on that plate every day nor would it be healthy for them . <p> Too much protein has been linked to severe shell deformities and fatty liver disease . In the past animal protein sources such as dog food have been recommended but protein should be supplied as a plant based source . Any legume ( bean ) is a source of protein and should be limited to 5% or less of the total diet . Tortoises that are allowed to graze and get a varied diet of greens will get adequate amounts of plant protein without supplementing . Yes Alfalfa carries a large quantity of plant protein ( about 15% or more per serving ) . <p> Comment ; The advantage of commercial diets is that they are easier to use than preparing a balanced salad several times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims that the commercial diets are complete and balanced , they may not be so . The ingredients are items that a tortoise in the wild would never have access to . Symptoms from eating an unbalanced diet may take years to develop . <p> Natural Sunlight is an important factor in the process of metabolizing calcium , Vitamin A and Vitamin D. Reptiles including tortoises can not survive without it . <p> I should have distinguished between desert species that do n't eat grasses and those that do . I will be adding more to the master list and in time my hopes are to set up food lists for torts that include as many foods as possible so that people have many choices . Some foods like grasses the Mediterranean species really do n't eat . DT and Sullys tend to eat lots of grasses , etc . This is a work in progress and Josh was nice enough to allow me to initially sticky this to the food thread to get it started , and as time goes on my hope is to combine lists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is easy for a new and not so new owner to find a good variety . If at all possible please check and make sure you are not duplicating what is already on the list that is why I asked all to PM me with additions . It will cause less confusion in the long run . And if you can provide common as well as Latin names all the better though not necessary . <p> I am also working on a Poison or toxic list which I will be posting a little later . <p> Keep those suggestions coming hopefully though a PM and please state which type of tort you are feeding your list too and/or where you acquired your list so that we can give them credit and reference the site . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

It seems , the more I read , the less I understand and know . <p> But on everything from the beginning . I have group of kinixys erosa ( 1.2 ) . All of them was imported from Ghana . Females was imported on 2013 ( I got both on the same year ) and male on 2007 ( I got it on 2015 ) . Male is very active and breeding like a crazy every day . Females are not very happy because of this and try to escape from male . I think that it is not strange , because all females do the same . <p> Both of my females was calm and shy without any aggression . The bigger one was dominant while I had only two females . The smaller one was slowly growing then bigger one . Nothing changed between females when I got male . He became king of a group . During this year there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On this November I decided to change enclousure of my group , which fit better for nesting . I added camera to new enclousure that I could see my group anytime . At first nothing changed . The king of group was male and females tried to escape from him on breeding . Both of females was calm and shy as always . But ... <p> Everything was changed on 2016 11 10 . <p> The smaller one female became very aggressive . <p> She is running around like mad . <p> She is attacking everything that moves . <p> She spent a lot of time in water . <p> Male stop breeding and try to avoid females . <p> All enclousure looks like after the war . <p> I do n't see any trying to dig . <p> It is sad , because I did n't follow weight , so I ca n't say if it changed . <p> Do n't seem , that the bigger female changed . She seems like always . <p> Let 's start with questions : <p> As I know it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you have other thoughts ? <p> How long it takes from aggressive to eggs laying ? <p> I had read many different ways erosa is laying eggs , but I 'm not sure if it is true ( like all things in internet ) . Some say that they are digging as all tortoises , some says that they are laying after leafs , other that they could laying in the bowl of water ... What is your experience ? Could erosa lay eggs without digging ? <p> In the new enclousure I made only one side for digging that it would be more easy to find eggs . Is it good decision ? <p> How you are looking for eggs in your enclousure ? How often you do it ? ... <p> I had read many topics about eggs incubation , but I want to hear your offers on this . <p> I had eggs of testudo horsfieldii before , but it was more surprising than the awaited .

The gravid female will be restless and aggressive for about 3 wks . She will also go off her food a bit and drink more . The first signs of a gravid female is they eat a lot of cuttlebone then start climbing the walls . Homeana dig about 4 to 5 " deep to lay . Not sure about the laying in water thing , that sounds like a desperate way to ditch the eggs because there is no nesting sight available , or a virgin female .

@@58539800 @7539800/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> Hi everyone , I 'm sorry to start my first thread on such a sad note but maybe someone could give me some advice . So , my Russian Lilly ( 7 yrs old ) started to act strange about 3 days ago . She 's stretching her neck and opening her mouth quite wide ( like every 30 seconds or so ) , like there 's something stuck in her throat or she 's about to throw up . Except there 's nothing blocking the throat or her nose . I do n't suppose it 's yawning either . I think , her eyes are a little watery too . Otherwise , none other symptoms are visible : no runny nose , no coughing , she 's acting and eating perfectly well . Could it be RI ? I have an appointment with a vet tomorrow evening but I am really panicking . Thank you . <p> Tortoises do n't breathe through their mouth . So when their nose is plugged up , they do n't breathe . Every so often when they need oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open his mouth wide and take in air . <p> In a very bright light , examine your tortoise 's nose and see if you can tell if it is plugged . <p> The pharmacy sells little squeeze bottles of sterile saline solution for contact lens wearers . Buy a bottle and squirt it up each nostril . Do n't be stingy . Give it a good , solid squirt - up each nostril . The other end of the nostrils terminates in the roof of the tortoise 's mouth , so there is no danger of squirting fluid into the lungs . <p> If this does n't solve your problem you 'll probably have to take the tortoise to the vet . <p> A reminder : Do n't allow the vet to administer the A , D , E injection . An overdose of vitamin A causes a tortoise 's skin to slough off , and some vets do n't seem to understand the correct dosage on this vitamin . <p> Yvonne G , thank you so much for a quick response ! I already read your advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed So , I guess , I 'm just going to keep my girl extra warm and hope for good news from a vet . Will let you know how everything went <p> Hi all , we went to see a vet yesterday and she said it 's obvious that Lilly has trouble breathing and it 's probably because of RI She prescribed injectable antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs . So , now we have to visit a clinic everyday for 3 days to see if my little one 's getting better and after that I can give injections myself for another 5 days . The tort did n't do anything but sleep all day after the visit . Today she 's active again but her breathing is till through her mouth . Also , as much as I trust the vet , should I ask for X-rays ? I am so afraid that Lilly has pneumonia and it would be easier to treat her if we knew exactly what the danger is . Can I still soak her or is it better to avoid it because of the injections ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the antibiotics are working . What kind of antibiotics is she getting ? You can still soak her in Luke warm water . Bump up her temps all around few degrees to help the immune system do its job . Hope she pulls thru ! <p> Hi . My little tortoise Olive had RI the vet gave her an antibiotic injection and a bottle of it to give her orally . We did n't  think she would survive the night she was do poorly . But she did . As she was so small we just put it on her food and if she would n't eat a little bit on her lips . We kept that up for about a week and she 's great now . Good luck with yours . <p> Update . It 's the 4th day of the treatment and it seems my tortoise gone from not well to terrible . It 's color turned slightly paler and brownish yellow ( to me it 's a visible change ) . His front legs look skinnier and the skin is peeling off a lot everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pee which stinks like ammonia . I called another vet who works at the national zoo reptile department and has deep knowledge about tortoises and he said that from all I 've told him on the phone , it looks like the tort maybe have RI ( hard to tell without examining ) , but his main concern , also , is that there 's a huge problem with it 's kidneys and urinal system . For now he advised me all the basics ( higher temps , soaking in salty water , etc . ) . He 's based quite far away from my city , but I 'm taking a day off at work and going to see him probably on Thursday ( or hopefully sooner ) . After the conversation , I went back to see the local vet who 's treating Lilly and she said that for now it 's best to take her off the antibiotics , because she seems worse even before the treatment . She advised to keep the temps higher ( already doing this from the beginning ) and try to feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine that Lilly had : 28th - Baytril 2.5% 0,4 i/m ( not sure what that means ) ; Rapidexon Dexamethson 2mg/ml 0.1 i/m 29th - Gentamycin 4% 0.2 i/m ; Rapidexon Dexamethson 2mg/ml 0.4 i/m 30th - Gentamycin 4% 0.2 i/m ; Rapidexon Dexamethson 2mg/ml 0.4 i/m 31th - today - nothing <p> If it makes you feel any better my tortoise also had the antibiotic injections and the first few made him feel terrible . He would n't eat , walk , or even move his head around . But by the 5th one he started perking up again and did n't seem to have any negative side effects from the shots after that . <p> Lilly did n't survive . It was like 10 minutes later after I wrote my last post here , that I went to her terrarium to check on her to find she was not moving .. It 's just devastating to lose her after 5 years .

If you are concerned about the iodine issue you can add a small pinch of iodinized ' lite salt ' ( 1/2 salt and salt substitute ) . <p> Spinach , by the way , is considered risky because of oxalates- an acid that binds with the calcium in a food and limits it 's usefulness . Spinach has a moderate level of oxalates , collards and other greens have a little less , and things like lamb 's quarters are high in it . Dr. Mader does not think they are a concern in a balanced , varied diet for a properly hydrated tortoise .

Hopefully that will smooth out as he grows ( ' he ' is just an easier reference ) , but I also see a cute little extra scute down in front of that bump . I have a soft spot for those aberrant scute tortoises . So I love your baby ! ! <p> Some of my tortoises eat Mazuri , some do n't .

I just go by the tortoises ' actions . <p> I have always found it best to soak and feed in the mornings . When I was a working stiff I had to get up BEFORE zero dark thirty to tend to the animals before I got ready to go to work . So I soak in the a.m. while I preparing the food . <p> For baby tortoises , I chop up a nice variety into tiny bite-sized pieces . I do n't see if it wilts because it 's a big pile of tiny pieces , which they eat up readily . <p> First let me say thank you so much to everyone who contributes to this forum .

Looking forward to a happy healthy tort to share with everyone . <p> Hi I 'll let everybody else help you with your questions except # 4 get a coffee grinder . Cause I grind egg shells in to a powder for a calcium supplement . Because I do n't know what 's in a store supplement ! And as far as Mazuri I run it through the grinder to make it a real fine powder out of it and sprinkle it lightly over the food ! <p> 1 . I think its cute but just wanted to make sure it was n't a problem or a sign of dehydration now or as a youngster before I got him . <p> 2 . I 've raised the bulb , but is there any height too high where I begin to lose the UVA/UVB ? It 's probably about 10-12 inches above ground level now . He does n't bask much so I believe 108 is too hot for him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other heating method ? I find the 100w to be pretty weak for generating heat anywhere but directly below the " bulb " and since they are on the same hook the two heat sources are very close , probably heating up the basking site too much , but keeping the rest of the enclosure from getting warm enough . <p> 3 . I 'm not a morning person but seems like the consensus is morning soaks are best . I do see him moving around when I 'm leaving so looks like mornings it is . <p> 4 . Love the idea of grinding it up and sparkling on dry . I tried this with wet but it was so messy , smelled terrible , and he still did n't eat it . <p> 5 . Thanks for the advice on bite-sized pieces . I typically serve him 1-inch pieces , but I do see him struggling sometimes on the leafier greens to get a bite off and every one in a while gives up . Bit sized sounds like a great thing to try . <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size you may need 2 CHE for keeping the night temps above 80 .

Do you suggest a stronger CHE or another one on the other side of the enclosure ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I have one enclosure that I have 2 in because it 's so long so I put them about 4 ' apart and it keeps good temps but it 's also in my garage where it gets colder at night . <p> My other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights go out , they run pretty much all night on a thermostat set at 84 the ends of the enclosure are usually around 81 at night . <p> Hello and welcome . You need to move your CHE over the middle of the enclosure , and possibly add a second one . They can both run on the same thermostat to maintain ambient . <p> I see that your questions have been answered , but I also see that my answers will differ a bit : 1 . Some smooth out over time and some do n't . Worrying wo n't change it . 2 . I agree that the bulb needs to be raised a bit . 95-100 is all you need . More than that will just dry them and the enclosure out more . 3 . Soak whenever it is convenient for you . My schedule is highly variable and erratic . I soak then whenever I have time to soak them . It can be any hour of the day , and it can be different day to day . It does not matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like it . They do n't " need " it . Try soaking a small broken off piece until it is mushy . Then mix it in with the greens of the day . Most people start trying to introduce new foods with far too large of a quantity . Start with a tiny tidbit. 5 . I do n't worry about the wilting . If fed the right amounts , there is n't a lot left to wilt . I do not like to chop up the food for babies . I find that it makes it harder for them to eat . I like them to have the weight of the whole leaf for them to pull against so they can bite off pieces that are the right size for their mouth . If you freeze your greens they will usually turn to mush . Try it . <p> Thanks for the reply Tom . I tend to agree with not chopping the leaf to small . He seems to get frustrated if the leaves are n't puffed up around mouth level . If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> I tried crushing up the mazuri on top of the salad and he ate it right up without hesitation . Suhwweeet ! <p> I also raised the UV , ' dimmed ' the CHE next to it a bit , and ordered another for the other side . I 'm using one of the ZooMed tortoise tables but got a glass fish tank lid to put on the open side and cover the entire thing with a tarp . <p> Here 's a pic of the setup . ( there is a tupperware cutout under the large cave about 1/3 of the size to retain moisture . ) Anything else I should change ? <h> Attached Files : <p> Update : First morning soak attempt and the lil guy was wide awake and easy to plop into the bath , no having to dig him out of the hut . <p> I was happy to see when I returned from work that he had demolished every piece of the food I gave him , even with calcium and Mazuri sprinkled on top . He typically only finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf or two of something after an evening soak . <p> If that 's how much better he eats after morning soaks , then looks like I have an early riser for now . That is until I can convince him evening soaks are much better . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977 
@@58539804 @7539804/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> Here are my thoughts on how to house , feed and care for hatchling and small sulcatas : <p> Indoor Housing : The bigger the better . Got room for a 4x8 ' tortoise table ? Great ! Sweater boxes and Christmas tree storage bins work great . Contrary to the popular trend right now , I actually PREFER glass tanks for all the reasons people say they are bad . " They are too tall and restrict airflow . " Great ! More humidity . " The tall sides hold in too much heat . " Great ! I can use a lower wattage bulb and my tortoise will stay warmer for less $ . " They can see out and this invisible barrier causes stress . " After 20 years of sulcatas in glass tanks , this has never been a problem for me . You can tape something opaque to the glass , if they constantly rub their nose on it or try to walk through it . I have never had to do this . I like them being able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse watering troughs , cement mixing tubs or large reptile tubs . I generally prefer something waterproof because babies need high humidity and moisture . Wood does not hold up well when its wet all the time and must be sealed somehow . <p> Substrate : Coco coir . Cypress mulch . Orchid bark . Plain , additive free , soil . Sphagnum peat moss . Pick one or any combination . I recommend you do NOT use any sand , wood shavings , corn cob bedding , walnut shell bedding , alfalfa or grass pellets , newspaper bedding , any type of hay or any other new fad bedding that comes along . Keep your substrate damp to increase the humidity in the enclosure . If you can keep your humidity around 80% at tortoise level , you 'll have a healthy , well hydrated , pyramid free , happy tortoise . Sometimes I cover part of the top of the enclosure to hold in humidity . <p> Humid hide boxes : Use at least one . These will help prevent dehydration and pyramiding and simulate the humid burrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree . I like to use plastic shoe boxes for these and semi-bury them in the substrate . I use a Dremel tool to cut out the right size door hole and a quarter inch drill bit to make a couple of ventilation holes on opposing sides . If they do n't use them on their own , I try to " train " them to use them by putting them in the boxes after lights out . Here 's an example of a couple : I use fine coco coir inside them as it does not mold or grow any fungus . I like to keep it wet in there . <p> Heat : I like to use small , 35-50watt , overhead , spot or flood bulbs for this . Always use ceramic fixtures , never the cheaper plastic ones . In a cool house , I 'll use a bulb like this AND a ceramic heating element ( CHE ) . Keep them both over one side . This will be the " warm " side and it should be 80-90 degrees . Directly under your bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 100-110 degrees , but only in that one spot . The other side of the enclosure should be around 75-80 and will serve as the " cool " side . " Night " temps should stay 75-80ish . These temps will insure that your little tort does not get sick with all the humidity in there . These are the four temps to be concerned with . They should be regularly checked with a temp gun AND a remote probed thermometer . Temps can be adjusted by raising or lowering your bulbs or raising or lowering the wattage . You do not need Mercury Vapor Bulbs or any other UV bulbs if your tortoise gets regular sunshine . 20-30 minutes twice a week is adequate , more is better . Put your light bulb on a timer for around 12 hours a day . They need it dark at night . This is where the CHE comes in . It keeps them warm AND dark at night . Also , I like to project my spot bulb down onto a flat rock or a piece of slate . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat from the bulb over a larger area when they are not on it . This also gives you a good place to measure your basking temp with your heat gun . Here 's an example of a basic enclosure to show what I 'm talking about : <p> Here 's a digital thermometer with a wireless , remote probe . <p> Food : Weeds ; mallow , filaree , dandelion , sow thistle , plantain , etc ... Grass . Mulberry , rose , hibiscus and grape leaves . Hibiscus and rose flowers . Spineless opuntia cactus . Mazuri mixed in with other greens a couple of times a week . Spring mix and leafy greens from the grocery store . Variety is good . Avoid fruit , and use foods like spinach , broccoli , cabbage , iceberg lettuce , very infrequently , if ever . When they get big , over a foot , you can try to introduce dry grass hay . But babies usually wo n't eat it . <p> Supplements : This is debatable and the opinions run the whole spectrum from " none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to use Rep-cal twice a week in a very small amount . I use Herptivite once a week in a small amount on one of the days that I did n't use the calcium . Because my torts get sun year round , I do not generally use any calcium with D3 added . <p> Water : Use a terra cotta plant saucer , or something similar , and bury it so that its flush with the substrate . It will need to be cleaned at least once a day , maybe more . <p> Sunshine/Outdoor enclosures : Sunshine is necessary . 20-30 minutes twice a week will prevent MBD , but more is better . I like to do an hour or two a day for hatchlings and gradually more as they get bigger . Here is a thread with more info on how to do this LONG ... Putting them out for some sun will also get them to exercise more which is also very good for them . <p> Pyramiding prevention : This is all new stuff . You wo n't see it on an internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 20 years of utter failure and tons of research , observation and trial and error . Lot 's of other people helped me to reach these findings , so its not just me . Here is how to grow a smooth , healthy sulcata : Keep them humid , hydrated , warm and spray their shells 3-4 times a day . Yes they are desert animals , but the babies stay hidden in burrows , root balls and leaf litter , where it is HUMID . Babies do n't just walk around out in the open in the hot dry air in the wild . They 'd get eaten if they did . Once they get to around 6-8 " humidity and moisture is much less critical . It is important to get them sunshine , exercise and a good diet too , but hydration , humidity , and moisture is the KEY to preventing pyramiding . Soak them in shallow , warm water at least once a day . I soak them first thing in the morning and again after a sunning session in the hot , dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third time before lights out . Sulcatas are very resistant to shell rot and fungus . I have never seen a single case of shell rot on a sulcata . As long as they are kept warm ( 75 or warmer ) they will not get respiratory infections either . I have tried to keep one too wet and could not induce any sort of problem . You do n't have to go crazy , but do keep them well hydrated . Pyramiding has nothing to do with excess protein or too much food . It has everything to do with MOISTURE , HUMIDITY and HYDRATION . <p> These things are MY opinion and are based on MY experiences with sulcatas and other torts over the last 20 years . My way is not the only way and other people have also raised smooth sulcatas , but it is very rare and can usually be traced back to high levels of humidity and or hydration . Much of this can also be applied to other species , but as of now , sulcatas are the only one that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or question any of this please PM me or start a new thread . <p> How often do you recommend feeding a hatchling spring mix ? and how much ? <p> Thank you for such a wonderful post it is very helpful to all of us that are new to sulcatas. 166976 @qwx576976 <p> This is a bit of a tough question to answer . There are a lot of variables . I 'm not the best person to ask either , as I hardly ever use it . I live in an area with lots of weeds and over the years I 've planted or found lots of good food sources . I would say that if you have a good spring mix ( with no spinach ) , and if you use Mazuri with it a couple of times a week , and if you supplement Ca and vitamins properly , and if your tort gets regular sunshine , then you can probably use it every day . There are just so many other good things around , and I would hate to limit a tortoises diet so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frozen North who use spring mix all winter long . I think they would be better able to answer your question . <p> For your other question : I used to feed small amounts and skip a day once in a while . This has led me to 40-50 pound , 12 year old , " mini-sulcatas " . I 'm feeding my hatchlings every day and the three of them get a heaping butter-tub-lid-full . The lid is about 6 " in diameter and I pile it high daily . Occasionally , if they eat it all up right away , I 'll even give them seconds in the afternoon . <p> Yes he ( i 'm just going with a " he " for now ) IS ! ! ! I am very nervous because I recieved him by a bizarre twist of fate . I am aware of how big he will be and at the moment I am a renter/youngish person and willing to put in the time and effort to making his life happy and healthy . I am having serious reservations about him though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roam ( kinda ) free but like I said earlier , I am a RENTER living in rainy SEATTLE . it will be another three years until I live in a homne of my own , but for now he and I share a big house with three roommates and an arc-full of animals . <p> Hi , I would like to thank you so much for this it makes perfect sense . I just bought two sulcata babies and i got so many different stories i finally googled the part of Africa they were from and saw it was very humid their . After i read your finding i went right in and raise the humidity to 80% . I 'm so glad i can feed them as much as they want . Thank You Vicki <p> This was a very informative post ! Thanks ! I was looking to start raising tortoises and I was not sure which ones I should buy , but I think this convinced me to buy Sulcatas 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Oh good lord , reconsider ! They are a lot of work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an exaggeration , but they are a whole lotta ' tortoise to house as adults . They are still my favorite , but I always want people to know what they are getting into . I 'm four days into building a very expensive new den box for my adults . <p> On a serious note : It is critical that you buy one from somebody whose been doing daily soaks , uses a damp substrate , humid hide box and a water bowl .

Can you suggest a smaller tortoise then ? <p> Well do you think it 's worth it in the end ? Can you suggest a smaller tortoise then ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Sulcatas are only small for a couple years ... after that ? Look out ! If you spoil it and take really good care of it , it could be 100 pounds by the time its 10 or 15 years old ! And they do n't stop there . If they hit 100 pounds by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll reach 150 by the time it 's 20 . So pretty much EVERY species is smaller ( except for Galapagos and Aldabras ) . <p> I 'm finding that the Geochelone pardalis pardalis subspecies of the leopard tortoise shows all the good traits of sulcatas ( fearlessness , curiosity , friendliness , boldness , hardiness , good appetite , cold tolerance , etc ... ) , without all the draw backs ( HUGE size , destructiveness , digging , aggressiveness ) . I tend to pick species based on which ones are best suited to my environment . I live in Southern CA so most species can live outside here year round with a little heated house , but its very dry and very hot in the summer , so I tend to stick with desert-type species . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977 
@@58539805 @7539805/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Weed and Feed <p> About a month ago , I used Weed and Feed on my backyard lawn . My mom told me today that she can no longer care for her 70+ year old California Desert Tortoise . I want to take him in BUT I want to know how the dangers of the Weed and Feed I put on my lawn . I called the manufacturer ( Vigoro ) and they said it 's safe once the ' pellets ' have soaked into the ground . I told them that I fear the poison would have been absorbed by the grass and the turtle will no doubt try to eat it , and they did n't have a good response to that . They just kept telling me it 's safe after it soaks into the ground . <p> Anyone have any thoughts on this ? I WILL NOT take the tortoise in until I am certain my backyard lawn will not harm him . <p> I have no experience personally with this . However , I person in Illinois has Sulcata 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the next summer she feels it is safe and her torts graze . Not sure though what she treats it with . You could possible get a more honest answer from a garden center . They have no stake in the product as it is n't theirs . They have no reason to lie . Good luck <p> I would first find the weed and feed product container and read the label to find out how long the product claims to keep the weeds away ... there are some poisons that will wash away from the application site with several water exposures and then there are some that are designed to work for a year .... so you need to first determine what type the one you used shows .... <p> Now , I am going to remind of a few things about the combo fertilizer/herbicide mixes ... they can be a horrific product to our environment ... there are tests done that show that in households where folks live that have used these types of chemicals have higher traces for longer periods of time WITHIN the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces are found in carpet and furniture and can transfer to children and pets--so remember what you are potentially exposing your household to ( as well as surrounding wash away areas ) when you decide to use a poison chemical for weed control .... remember , you have two hands and they work wonderfully for weed control ... yes , very labor intensive--but eventually a much better form of weed control ... <p> I personally would not allow free grazing on the grass for a year .... now , that does not mean you can not take the tortoise it just means you will have to provide a location safe from the poison and knowing that it will not be a permanent situation but rather a safety measure .... this is just my opinion hr Also ... water your lawn regularly and keep it cut on a regular basis ... this will aid in the ridding process .... <p> And when the time comes .... you will actually have a full time weed eater going in your yard and you will not have need for such poisons ... lol <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once its watered into the dirt and the granules have disappeared , I put the horse back out there .

So watering and sunshine should make it ok for your tortoise . During this temporary time , you can feed the tortoise dark , leafy greens . Maybe he wo n't eat so much grass if you feed him .

So when he comes up from hibernation next year , you can give him the whole yard . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I totally agree with both Greg and Yvonne ....

Snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina ) are being harvested in unprecedented numbers in the United States ( US ) to meet the needs of this international market .

Increases in the export of wild caught snapping turtles to over 200,000 individuals in 2012 and 2014 , compared to under 50,000 in other years , may indicate that farms are becoming unable to keep up with increasing demand .

@@58539808 @7539808/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Is timothy hay safe ? <p> I went to walmart looking for aspen shavings . Right now George is living on mostly newspaper and a small corner of eco earth . I did n't see any aspen , but I did pick up timothy hay as I recalled reading about it online before . When I got back home , I double checked that timothy hay was okay for tortoises and put a pile in another corner of his enclosure . <p> While doing this , I noticed the hay was extremely dry and I felt like I was cutting my hands open . I have read that people do try looking for soft hay . <p> So my question is , can this dry hay hurt my tortoise ? I have a russian tortoise , if this makes any difference . <p> Hay should be dry , very dry . There are other types of hay available like Orchard hay that is softer but my tortoises have never shown an interest in it . I buy mine by the bale from a hay supplier that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed imaginable along with grasses which is what causes that sharp edge feeling . Some people prefer to cut it up in shorter lengths too . I feed it to mine " full size " and have n't had any problems with cuts or any other type of injuries due to the contents of the hay . <p> If you buy grass hay from a feed dealer it 's usually a lot fresher and a little softer . That stuff packaged up by Kaytee or others has been sitting on a shelf for such a long time that it 's very dry and old . <p> Yes the softness of hay varies . I find my tort does n't have a problem with the rough stuff , but yes I prefer the soft stuff . You can find softer stuff at feed stores , or online at places like Carolina Pet Supply ( they have an organic orchard grass that is awesome , but very very pricey especially when you add shipping ) . Look for timothy hay or orchard grass , not alfalfa . It keeps for awhile just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , I only use a pile of it as a hide and such , not for substrate . I do n't think its suitable for substrate as the tort ca n't really walk on it . Russians wo n't typically eat hay . I 've seen aspen in the small animal section at Walmart ( and Petco and such ) ... people use it for hamsters ... just ensure its pure aspen ... not a wood mix , not pine , not cedar . I prefer the stuff for snakes that has smaller particles than the flake stuff in the small animal section , but its more expensive . I am lucky enough to live within driving distance of the Bean Farm ... last time I picked up a car load of 45 lb bags it was $20 each , vs. $10 for a bag maybe 1/20 the size at Petco ( they ship but I do n't know their cost for the heavy aspen bales ) . <p> I did n't mean to use the timothy hay as substrate . I want to use eco earth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hay , as a pile for him to dig in . He already has a log hide that he seems to enjoy . Today , he was only interested in climbing on top of it . I will keep the pile in the corner and get that eco earth laid down . <p> It 's impossible to find regular dirt around here this time of the year <p> I wonder if I can ask the question about the Timothy Hay as well . I have an unused half of the bag from probably 2 years ago . Is it still okay to use ? I went through different substrate phase a while back and got a bunch of different things . I did n't like Timothy Hay too much but I was thinking of giving it to someone else . They are dry and appear to be good . If it 's not good as substrate or food , is it good for anything ? I hate wasting . <p> Hay does n't loose much nutrition over time , in part because there are n't many nutrients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and become excessively dusty . Also look for any white or black growth on older hay before using it . White is a sign of fungus , black is sign of mold . Either or both can happen in situations where the hay has gotten wet or been exposed to high humidity for a long period of time at some point . If it has been kept consistently dry and warm neither should be a problem . Personally , if it were two years old , I would n't use it anyway . It 's cheap enough to replace with fresher hay . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

Maybe then it would make more sense to more people . <p> I think it 's the upfront expense more then anything . 40-50 bucks is really hard for some , but much easier then 2-3 hundred . Most likely when they think of a meter , their bulb has probably burned out and now they need to shell out 40-50 bucks for a bulb , they do n't want to also shell out 2-3 hundred . By the time they need another bulb , they have forgotten about the 40-50 bucks they shelled out a year or so ago . For me . I only use my bulbs for about 4-5 months . Depending on our springs and falls . I also do n't use them all day . <p> Not everybody needs a meter . Those people lucky enough to live in claimants rather tortoises can get outside for a good part of the year do n't have to worry about it . But for those of us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . I am the average Joe , I do n't raise or sell tortoises , I do n't make a ton of money at my job , and I 've had my meter for over three years . Maybe longer , I got the 6.5 uv index meter when it first came out . I look at it as a long-term investment for a long term pet . I put it on my credit card and paid it off in installments . It is a chunk of money but I think most people , if they are honest with themselves and are willing to sacrifice a little here and there , can come up with that much eventually or make payments like I did . I have a mercury vapor bulb that has never been used , bought it in the last year , and it 12 inches it reads 1.7 on my UV index meter . I have a feeling it will read pretty much zero very soon . And the readings are going to be smaller the farther away it is . I have heard that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad because people are being ripped off and I do n't even know it . When I first got it I pointed it at every UVB light I had and I was shocked at the results . But also I think they 're handy because not everybody has an enclosure with exact measurements that follow along with the guidelines written on the instructions for the bulbs . When I had to come up with new lighting for my new enclosure if I had not had the meter I pretty much guarantee I would not have the right kind of lighting that I needed . I know this debate on whether they are truly needed will go on , it comes down to it individuals decision and their situation . But to just automatically write it off as some sort of luxury item I think is not fair . <p> OK , I am officially ticked off . It 's 50 bucks cheaper than what I got it for a few years ago .

@@58539812 @7539812/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> UMDRunner , It is best not to mix species . Each species has its own set of unique needs such as temp , humidity , diet etc . Different species are susceptible to parasites , such as worms , fungus , etc . And each one may be susceptible to different types of worms , or fungus or other parasites . So a Russian may be hardy and able to fend off staphylococcus bacteria ( Staph . Infection ) but a Greek or Sulcata may be susceptible to that bacterium and come down with a bad respiratory infection because they were housed together . And if they are kept together even if you give meds to the sick tort they will just get re-infected because they live with a tort that can carry the Staphylococcus bacteria and not be sick . After re-infection after re-infection will really weaken the sick tort and their lifespan would be cut short . So It is best to keep species with like species only . <p> And controlling humidity inside is done by misting or setting up an inside habitat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist with a sprinkler system if a high humidity is needed and you live in a dry climate .

She knew what I was doing with the tweezers because she would actually hold her tail out and allow me to gently open her poop hole to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In other words , should I do these things for another week or until she poops or is this an immediate emergency room visit ? <p> How many days has she gone without poo'g ? Have you been offering long warm water soaks ? you would be surprised at how helpful soaks are ....

I do n't know how she ate it , it 's as big as her head .... I took pics that I 'll post tomorrow . I put her back in her soak , she 's walking around normally and not trying to push anything out , so hopefully there 's not another piece like that in there . Truly amazed at how she ate this . She 's sleeping in her " hotel " tonight and getting new substrate tomorrow .

If it was n't a colored bulb , there may be a dietary deficiency .

All of the other ones were fine how could this have happened ? Is it that it got bit by something ? Ants ? Rat ? so sad <p> OMG , I am so very sorry . I have no idea what could have happened . I would try to figure it out seeing you have more . I would keep the others maybe in another enclosure until you can figure out what happened . Again , so sorry . <p> After a body has been dead for a while , all the gasses start to build up inside and the body swells . He did n't die because of the swelling , the swelling happened because he died . No one will ever know why , unless you have the tortoise necropsied . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it a large tortoise ? Very sad ! <p> alright today I moved all of them into my indoor enclosed patio and build a good sized area surrounded by blocks and has lots of hiding areas . could the cold have killed them ?

Possibility of insect bite comes to mind . Wasp or Hornet could have stund the tortoise in the head , neck or throat . Especially with the swelling . Depending on how long the tortoise has been dead , the necropsy may yield not much , with a lot of autolysis of the tissues , may not get cause of death . Sorry about your loss .

@@58539819 @7539819/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Tortoise and parrot <p> I have been researching tortoises for a few months now . I plan on doing a few months more research before I commit to a tortoise . I have come across a few questions and concerns I ca n't seem to find answers to : <p> 1 . I currently own a Jenday Conure Parrot . Is it unsafe to keep a tortoise and a parrot in the same air space ? I am most concerned about parasites , airborne viruses , bacterial infections from them being in the same air space . ( I currently live in a small studio apartment , but plan to move into a house with-in the next year , if that makes any difference ) . <p> 2 . As I live in a small studio apartment in Seattle , my potential tortoise will not have access to outdoor sunshine for the first year . I was planning on housing him indoors in an open air tortoise table ( approx. 4x5ft ) next to my back door that is well insulated so that he can receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provide UV and UVB lighting ? <p> 3 . Since I live in Seattle WA , time outdoors will be limited to the days we get warm/hot summer days which can be few and far in between . I was planning on only allowing outdoor grazing above temperatures of 80 degrees ( with shade hides ) . At what temperature is unsafe for my tortoise to be outside ? <p> 4 . I am planning on growing tortoise grasses using tortoise seed mixes that I found online . I also plan on putting my green thumb to the test and propagating tortoise-safe succulents , spineless prickly pear , hibiscus , etc indoors and outdoors for a varied diet for my tortoise year-round . Has any one had luck growing these varieties in the Pacific Northwest regions , mainly Seattle ? <p> 5 . I am planning on adopting either a Russian or Greek tortoise from a local animal shelter . Do you think I will have success with this species of tortoise in the cold , rainy environment of Seattle ? Or should I abandon my desire to own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life health ? <p> 1 . Sharing a cage with access to each others feces would pose a risk , but the risk is negligible if they are in separate cages in the same room . 2 . You will need to buy the right types of UV lamps and a good UV meter . The best UV lamp and fixture would be an Arcadia 12% HO bulb and it will run about $100 , and the meter is around $250 . It can be done and done well , but do n't skimp here . 3 . If its sunny , dry and not windy , even tropical tortoises can go out at 65F . A russian or greek could potentially be out at 55 . You 'll need an infrared temp gun to check surface temps in the area where you want to sun your tortoise . 4 . Lots of people do this and there are lots of threads here with all sorts of ideas . You should have no trouble with this one . 5 . Many people keep those species in the PNW . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Speedy , our Sully , an Indian Ringneck , and 2 Parrotlets . We have had no problems , since they really do n't intermingle , I would suggest hand sanitizer when going from one to the other to cut down the possibility of any cross contamination . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

My name is Ruth Ann and we found a young Russian Tortoise in the middle of the road a couple of months ago . We have n't been able to locate its owners so we have been taking care of him . He was active at first , but now he barely moves and is n't eating . He dug a little hole in the corner of his box and sleeps all day . This has been going on for approx 2 weeks , and he has only eaten once . His eyes and nose are clear and he seems alert and active when I pick him up , but when left alone , he does n't move from the shallow hole he dug . Is this normal ? I 've attached a picture of the box we built for him to live in . If you zoom in , you can see him in the corner under the lamp . <p> Russians are a hibernating species . You should not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a year to be sure he is healthy enough to hibernate(brumate) . So , at his level be sure the temps are 80 with basking of 95-100 and night temps can drop down to room temp . Also put light on for at least 12 hours and make sure it 's bright . <p> Thank you . We 've done all that . Lights are on 12 hours a day . His basking rock is around 92-94 degrees . The box is wide open so mostly room temp , but it 's warmer in the corner where the additional lamps are hung ( heat and UV ) . Do all Russian Tortoises slow down and grow inactive this time of year ? I 'm soaking him for a few minutes every morning to perk him up . He 's alert and awake after his soak , and usually walks one time around the perimeter of his box before going back to the shallow hole he dug , then back to sleep for the rest of the day . <p> He 's probably wild caught and his body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means he is acclimated to start cleaning out his system now to prepare to hibernate . You may have to turn off the lights and place him in a cool spot for a couple weeks to fool him into thinking he has hibernated .

Hoping your little guy feels better . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Thank you ! He feels so much better ! I was very worried about him , but he 's doing MUCH better now .

Basking heat . This is what we talked about earlier in this thread . Your bulb should be on a timer for 12-13 hours a day . Adjust the basking temperature under the bulb by raising or lowering the bulb and fixture , or raising or lowering the wattage of the bulb . Plain old 65 watt flood bulbs work well for me , but you might need something bigger , smaller , or you might need to run it through a rheostat to get the right temp under it . 2 . Ambient heat 24/7 . CHE set on a thermostat . Boom ! Done . 3 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoises UV and lighting needs . Pick your bulb based on mounting height . 4 . If additional lighting is needed because the enclosure looks a little dim , then you can add another long florescent tube and set it on the same timer as your basking lamp . <p> I know this all sounds daunting at first , but it will make a lot of sense once you set it all up . We will help you along the way . You do n't have to do this all on your own . <p> He s kept in a vivarium though as i believed closed enclosures are better for young indian stars so i do n't  think hanging lights would work . <p> Ill have a look when i get in and maybe i could put a basking bulb into the ceramic holder the che is currently in and drill another ceramic holder bracket into the middle for the che .

I did n't want to set up a whole other enclosure just for that one . I would n't do it with my adults though ( and I probably should n't be doing it with my babies either . ) <p> Are they adults or babies ? Wild caught or captive born ? Hermann 's and Greeks can can produce hybrids if they breed so as sub adult and adults , no it is not a good idea . Generally , if they 're both captive born babies there really is n't much harm , but , what subspecies of Greek tortoise is yours ? Hermann 's are a northern Mediterranean species , as are Ibera Greeks . But most Greeks available nowadays are of Middle Eastern origin from Jordan , Lebanon , Syria &amp; Southern Turkey . Middle Eastern Greeks have some different environmental requirements than Northern Mediterranean species . Tortoises from the two different geographical regions should not be kept together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're asking about , but I do keep my baby box turtles all in the same habitat . It just makes it easier on the keeper . But when they 're big enough to go outside , they each go into a habitat specifically for that type of turtle . <p> Generally , I 'm of the belief that different species should not be kept together because of environmental requirements , disease transfer , etc ... This applies to subspecies also ( unless you want babies that are diluted by both characteristics ) . <p> But Eastern , Dalmatian Hermann 's and Ibera Greeks are so close to the same environmental and captive care requirements that they do absolutely fine together . But again , I would not continue to keep them together as adults if they 're different genders because there is the strong potential of them producing hybrid offspring . <p> The main difference between the two species is that most Hermann 's can tolerate cooler overall temperatures and even slightly damper conditions . They ( Hermann 's ) tend to be more active at cooler temperatures whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for warmer , dryer conditions . Other than that their care requrements are identical . <p> In Eastern Europe , Hermann and Greek tortoises can be found in some of the same countries ( e.g. Romania ) . However , the two species occupy different habitats , with Greeks in more open , scrubby areas , and Hermanns in more wooded areas . So even in the wild , the two species probably do n't encounter each other very often , and probably very rarely hybridize ( especially since the Hermann is more closely related to the Russian than the Greek ) . In captivity , however , confined animals may be more willing to hybridize , so mixing species is generally to be avoided . <p> As to disease transmission I have a question . I have a pair of hermann 's and all be building a pen outside in the spring . My friend has a Greek and I was thinking of partitioning a section for him . <p> Is this a bad idea ? The Greek is captive born and under a year and the hermann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Disease transmission between Greeks and Hermanns can be an issue , although I would be more worried about keeping more distantly-related species , which probably have the potential to introduce more exotic diseases to each other . In my opinion , the main issue with Greeks and Hermanns is hybridization. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I recently read Yvonne 's post that Burmese Brown 's as a forest species do not require a full time UVB bulb , and that she noticed that when she did add a UVB bulb to the enclosure that they all hid the entire time it was on .

I do have a closed chamber setup with a UVB strip bulb setup for my young sulcata indoors .

For my sulcata I have a closed chamber design . <p> My Mep are in a table in the Manouria shed .

But this year I have a couple babies indoors , so I have a 10.0 bulb over their table . But it 's up pretty high with plants under it . Because you can feed the Manouria animal protein , they will be getting some of their D3 through their food . Also , the shelf the plants are on provides a lot of shade down at ground level . <p> Ok . Now I 'm thinking of a t5 5.0 UVB bulb about 14 inches above the tortoise , with a ton of plants for shade .

Foods from the brassica family and foods high in oxalic acid should be fed sparingly to those species that are prone to the stones ( desert tortoises , sulcatas ) . <p> I think your tortoise 's problem happened before you got the tortoise . It should be ok now with the frequent soaking and water accessibility . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I got Daisy Mae a yearling and Pansy 6 months old . Sam was Daisy Mae then . So I set each up in a nice tort table and Pansy settles right in . She 's actually in a closed chamber , she starts eating right away and just becomes an easy keeper . However , Daisy Mae is horrible . Every morning she is out on the floor . How ? She bangs and scratches and continually makes noise , wo n't eat and she bites . I 've been covering her table with aluminum foil to keep the heat in .

I know this story is not funny , but we kinda have to wait for Spring and he goes out . I do believe he is different and smarter than the average Sulcata .

This is a serious issue , and although fixing your husbandry would fix the situation in a less serious case , it is of my opinion it will not help this tort in time . If you need guidance there is a vet list on the main page of the forum . A vet visit can start at $50 and go up from there . Best wishes and good luck . <p> Kate is right . The basking spot should be at least 105 . I like more like 115-120 , but only in one small spot in a good size enclosure . Whenever I see lethargy and lack of appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees and see if that helps . It almost alway does . The eyes are a good indicator of this . My sulcattas were raised bone dry on dry dusty substrates ( all wrong ) and never had any eye problems . This is not a humidity issue . <p> He needs to go to the Vet now . I would be soaking him in warm babyfood carrots . I have always used this practice thinking that they do drink some and get some benefit . But you need to get him to a Vet right away . <p> I had the same situation as you about 2 months ago , and it ended sadly . My little one was n't growing , and he did n't eat for a long time , was always sluggish , his eyes were shut , and his shell was soft . I scheduled an appointment with the vet , and 200 $ later they gave me a food supplement that I mixed with water and force fed him . It did n't help much , he still did n't move and everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What I 'm trying to say is this is a serious issue , and it might be Hatchling Failure Syndrome . Just give him the best care you can , and hope for the best . <p> Got a vet appointment . Can you expalin soaking in baby food carrots ? .... Put baby food in a container , water it down , stir it up , and place him in it ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I know a lot of the more experienced tortoise-keepers laugh behind their hands at soaking in baby food , but I can attest to the fact that it really does work . I have rehabilitated many a sick baby this way . <p> The brand I use is Gerber , and I buy carrots or sweet potatoes or squash . These are the ones with the highest vitamin A content . You mix it about half and half with warm water and place the baby in it . You want to use a container with a small floor space , but with sides high enough that the baby ca n't climb out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the sides of the baby . Leave him in the mixture for at least 15 minutes , but longer is better . I sometimes leave them in there for an hour . If your room is warm , 75 degrees or so , the water is n't going to get any colder than room temperature . <p> While most babies do n't actually drink this mixture ( some do ) , they do absorb some nutrients through the thin skin under their throat and the thin skin around the cloaca . <p> I learned this system from Dr. Gentzler who used to be the vet at our zoo before he had a horrible accident that paralyzed him from the neck down . He was an expert tortoise vet . On a side note , if anyone knows him , he just passed away last Saturday . <p> I 've used this system on box turtles mostly , but on some desert tortoise babies too . It usually only takes three or four days worth of soaks to start to see an improvement . <p> Have you noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often with my babies and what I would do with yours is to separate them . There 's a possibility of mental bullying also . So I bet if you separate them and keep the not eating one just a little warmer then normal he might turn around . Hatchlings are hard to raise and I just do n't think that novice keepers should try it . Now you see the one is most probably dying . Have you taken him to a Vet ? A Vet might offer antibiotics , for why I do n't know . But if it were me I would separate them out now and he might have a chance at living . But if you do n't separate them he most probably will die . It 's really serious when hatchling stops eating and you do n't change his living situation immediately . I am not saying this to be mean , I need for you to understand the gravity of the situation ... so move the one , up his temp and soak in carrots . <p> I soked in baby carrots ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerber also , the organic kind . But hopefully like someone said he did absorb it some of it . <p> I went the vet yesterday . She hit me with a lot of stuff . First she did not like that I fed mainly spring mix ... she has a sulcata of her own and has always fed 90% grass hay . So eventhough I tried to get them to eat only this I 'm thinking now I should have tried a little harder . She also critized my calcium supplement , herptivite , saying that it does n't have the correct ratio to phosphorus for absorbtion . She name another type of calcium , I ca n't remember and I did n't right it down . When I find out I will post it and ask your oppinions . She pointed out that they are dehydrated , despite soaking every day . She said that it could be from the poor calcium , poor lighting ( powersun ) , poor diet , but mainly because they probably have pneumonia . <p> I left them with her over night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday if they are doing well . She is going to take xrays to confirm pneumonia , hydrate them , insert a feeding tube , put them in a gas chamber so they may inhale some medications . Hopefully this will work . <p> I called and spoke to her yesterday afternoon she said that after the breathing treatments they both perked up and each peed and pooped on her . I will find out more today . Keep your fingers crossed . <p> maggie3fan said : <p> Have you noticed the one bullying the other ?

Now I wish I did completely separate them , I did separate them while feeding . I thought it was odd that the one snapped , because up until then the other had been more active , more agressive , more " alpha male " . <p> I am not a Vet and I do not have any sort of a medical degree .

I have not been involved as long as my sister , with me it 's just been the last few years . But what I am trying to say is that there 's the hella lot of experience here and we both use and swear by Spring Mix . I add other leafy greens to Spring Mix and I do n't believe small babies can eat hay or even should eat hay . They are babies and they need to eat baby type food . So for us Spring Mix plus other leafy greens is it and I am sorry that your vet does n't approve . It works . I had a 4 year old Gopherus agassizii name Cali . I soaked her almost everyday of her life . I got her as a 24 hour old hatchling . I loved her so ... one day she stopped eating . So after 3 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to my Vet and the very first words out of the Vet 's mouth were ... " Oh my she 's dehydrated " ... How could that be ? I swear I soaked her every day for the first 3 years then backed off to every other day and still she was dehydrated . She died 3 weeks after she stopped eating . It broke my heart , and I do n't know why ... my husbandry is right on ... but I know how you felt when that vet said yours were dehydrated . Sometimes everything we do is not enough . <p> I am sad to say they did not make it . My vet called on Friday afternoon and said that the two had passed . She said it was a combination of pneumonia , gout , and dehydration . She suspected that the gout was a cause of poor diet high in protein from the breeder I got them from . The pneumonia was from getting chilled and being dehydrated and the dehydration could be from many things ; poor lighting ( powersun ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily . <p> I believe the breeder I got my two sulcatas from did not care for them the best . I did everything right that was recommended from you all and this site . I appreciate everything , it just was n't enough for these guys .

I 've had a pair for about a year now and absolutely love them , so i recently decided to add to the group . The original pair has lived outside all summer and was recently moved indoors into a melamine enclosure . I keep 3 inches of coconut coir/Topsoil mix with 1-2 inches of leaf litter on top . A 5.0 UVB bulb , and a ceramic heat emitter . It seems to be working very well . They are fed a varied diet of Mazuri , fresh fruits , boiled eggs , mushrooms , worms , and whatever greens and veggies i can convince them to eat mixed in with the other stuff . Both are large , outgoing animals . The newer ones are obviously imports , and did not come in in the best shape . One actually looks like its been chewed on by something large . I have them setup in 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedding mix , same UVB and heat setup . I 'm curious as to whether there 's anything else that i should be doing to help acclimate them ? They were all treated for parasites before arrival and are being quarantined for 90 days prior to being allowed anywhere near my existing animals . Although i cant really put them together till spring anyways , so the qt process will likely be much longer . These ones seem to be far more shy than my original pair were when i got them , do n't  eat as much , do n't  wander around or dig as much either . Supposedly the gender ratio is 2.5 homes and 0.1 Erosa , but they look to be mostly male , or at least i think they do . I 'm really not good at sexing Kinixys . I 've browsed a few posts here on Homeana care and ive seen it advised a few times that the UVB bulbs should be turned off for a while so that they can settle in . Is this a good idea ? would n't living in darkness be even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do well together . Once i get these sexed , and established , i 'm assuming that ill have to move at least a few males . What would you more experienced folks suggest as the ideal gender ratio for a group ? Thanks in advance for the help . I truly appreciate it . <p> I forgot to mention that they do have water bowls large enough to soak in , and are misted regularly . I have been soaking the new ones everyday since i got them , and my original pair get soaked about 3-5x per week . <p> I 'm assuming these are adult imports , if so I would imagine 2 torts in one 36 " tub is going to be very stressful for them , especially if they are all males . For the UVB I would use a 2.5 fluorescent strip light , a small one set to one end of the enclosure or a 5.0 but try and dapple the light with a plant or something . They do n't like it bright .

He got her from a guy that did n't want her anymore and wanted 50.00 he talked him down to 20.00 so i wonder if something is wrong with her and he did n't want her dieing on him ? <p> There really is n't any way for us to know if something is wrong with her . I would suggest tho , that you soak the little tort in some warm water about right up to the edge of her carapace . Does he have her set up under UVB lights and all that stuff ? Has she eaten ? Is she warm enough ? Can you post a picture of her and the habitat she 's living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquarium . The ambient room temp is about 75 degrees , so I do n't use heat at night . During the day for a basking lamp she has a 100watt UVB bulb . Temps in the hot side of the tank range 100-110 during the day , and 80-85 on the cool side . She has a deep tupperware lid for a water dish and has defecated/soaked daily since I got her . Appx. 1/3 of the tank is covered for a hide . <p> For substrate right now ( got her the day before Christmas , all the pet stores in my area are closed ( small town ) until Monday the 29th ) I 'm using a piece of astroturf-type cage liner . <p> Thus far she 's only ate a single piece of romaine lettuce , about the size of her shell . I realize this is n't the best food for her , but again , stores are closed . <p> The odd behavior in question ( Natalie described it pretty accurately ) is that she 'll stand there and pump her front legs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never said it looked like a seizure ( guess that was her take on it ) . She 's also making a clicking sound with her jaw , something like smacking her lips . There 's no clicking , gurgling , etc when she breathes , just when manipulating her jaw . Other than the leg pumping , she is very exploratory and active . <p> The guy I got her from said that she 'd been trying to eat carrots and ate Kale regularly . Did n't eat tortoise pellets well . He got her in trade from a breeder ... She 's appx. 4 " and 6 months old , so I 'm told . <p> My baby russian tortoise makes the same motion when breathing ... it 's more apparent when he may be scared , but it 's definitely noticeable even when he ca n't see me or does n't have a reason to be scared . He 's also rather loud with his mouth while eating . <p> Not sure what is normal , but my sulcata is over 2 years old and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 " I do n't think ) so yours might be older than you think . <p> Mark 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Growth can very VASTLY . I know for a fact that an aquaintence of mine has a Sulcata that will be 4 years old in March , and he is 14 " long . Yup , that is not a typo <p> It is almost impossible to tell age from size . There are so many contributing factors to growth ... <p> Okay , first things first ... Please visit www.sulcata-station.org and www.africantortoise.com for more information on diet and husbandry . The tank is a bad idea . She needs something that will allow for more airflow , and covering it halfway does not double for a hide . Even a cardboard box with a hole cut in it is a better idea than covering part of the tank . <p> Tortoises do not grasp the concept of glass , and she will think that she can get into the room that she sees outside of her enclosure . Constantly trying to get there will cause a LOT of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think that the bobbing is something to be worried about . My smaller Sulcata will sometimes rock back and forth when she is impatient about getting food . It does n't sound alarming to me . <p> I would be a little more worried about getting her to eat , but do not panic yet . Moves are very stressful on torts and it can take some time for her to settle in and get comfortable enough to eat . The first thing you need to do is get her housing squared away ... That glass tank is only going to add to her stress and make keeping her healthy that much harder . <p> Also your temps are a bit on the high side . It is very easy for a young tort to become dehydrated , which can lead to kidney failure and death . Temps that high are likely to dry her out . The highest should be about 95 farenheit . <p> Good luck with your baby ! If you did n't notice , there is a section of this forum devoted totally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have any questions there are plenty of us here to help ! <p> I meant the tank is covered by a cardboard box for a hide . Sorry I was n't clear on that . <p> In any event , over the past couple days she seems to be doing a lot better . The arm pumping has diminished quite a bit . I think it 's something she 's doing to look scary when I come around , honestly . An act of warding off , or intimidation , perhaps ? Something akin to a snake hissing . <p> She 's been eating much better . She 's taking what I had around the house ( spinach and romaine ) and now that the stores are open I 'm going shopping just for her--for better foods and substrate . <p> Neither diet is appropriate for a Sulcata . They need a high fiber , low protein diet based on grass hay and broadleafed weeds . The veggies should only make up 10-20% of the total diet max . <p> Tortosie pellets contain soy meal , wheat middlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wild . While I am not saying that pellets should never be fed , at the most they should only make up a small portion of the overall diet . <p> It is probably going to difficult to get your baby to eat hay in the beggining , but do not get discouraged . Do not use alfalfa hay , it is too high in protein . Use timothy , orchard grass , or meadow grass hay , and grind it to a powder in a coffee grinder . Sprinkle it over the greens . Vegetables should be kept to a minimum , although greens such as kale , mustard greens , dandelion , collard and coriander are appropriate , and have proper Ca : P ratios and low oxalic acid content ( both phosphorus and oxalic acid block calcium absorption . ) As long as you have a good UV light , I would not give supplements containing vitamin D3 . Pure calcium carbonate or cuttlebone works fine as a calcium supplement . If you wish to give a vitamin supplement , I prefer Enfamil Poly-Vi-Sol for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D , as it is very easy to overdose and can lead to death . <p> There are care sheets on both of the links that I provided for you that offer the proper diet for Sulcatas . Read them before you go shopping . <p> I do n't believe in feeding pellets to small tortoises. grasses and weeds are what they should eat.But it 's hard to get grass and weeds in the middle of winter so I feed packaged Spring Mix because it has a variety of greens all mixed together . Then I add the other greens as available from the store . I sprinkle chopped salad type hay that I get LONG ... <p> it 's already chopped up and easy for the tortoise to eat and it adds the needed fiber ... I sprinkle that hay over the Spring Mix The baby needs a hide for protection and security . That means they need something small that they can sleep in inside the aquarium . It makes them feel secure and they adjust better and sleep better . You can use a cardboard box or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a door , but they need something small like that to sleep in. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

Make sense to me as long as you are prudent . <p> So- what about garlic and avocado ? You almost never see them on food lists , but when you look at the benefits of these foods , I find myself wondering about them . I can not find any research pro or con , and I would not be talking about large amounts- just a little once in a while when we are using them for other meals . <p> I have redfoots and they love avocado fruit . I have read that garlic is bad for trots and should not be given . But we all know how that works two say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for them . I would just call a reptile vet and ask them . As for the person that said that garlic gets rid of parasites in dogs . That is wrong asa a vet tech it can kill your dog along with many other thigs . <p> As for the avocado fat , it is a monosaturated fat and not quite as bad as some other kinds of fats . Animals need some fat in the diet , although we need to avoid EXCESS , as Tom and others have pointed out . <p> As for garlic not really being a food , I am not sure what you mean by that . It is a very useful food for humans . It is related to onions , shallots , leeks , and chives . <p> Thanks , Tom . I knew they did not show up on any dangerous food lists I could find . They offer so many benefits that are hard to find in the typical grocery store greens that I was hoping I could add small amounts once in a while safely . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlic powders as flavorings is generally regarded as acceptable , excessive consumption of onions causes vomiting , diarrhea , and a host of other digestive problems . It has been found that prolonged exposure can lead to a blood condition called hemolytic anemia , which is followed by respiratory distress and eventual death . " <p> " Avocado - The skin and pit of this popular fruit had been known to cause cardiac distress and eventual heart failure in pet bird species . Although there is some debate to the degree of toxicity of avocados , it is generally advised to adopt a " better safe than sorry " attitude toward them and keep guacomole and other avocado products as far away from pet birds as possible . <p> Thanks , Yvonne ! If possible , can you shoot me the source of that ? Bird stuff is often very applicable to reptile stuff . <p> My original thought was to use a very limited amount of garlic . After all , it does have a strong taste and tortoises often avoid that sort of thing . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then ! <p> Avocados ... Hmmm . One big difference between birds and turtles is that birds are really vulnerable to a huge range of toxins , and turtles are rather hard to poison . I 'll have to look at the risks/benefits some more . <p> As for feeding Avocados to tortoises ask Douglas Beard ( Elegans ) . When I was speaking to him on the phone and told him that there were some members on here that said the avocado fruit was toxic to the tortoises he laughed . He said that his ate it quite a bit and always has , even the leaves of the trees . Douglas knows quite a bit about plants and trees and what is toxic to tortoises . I have a giant tree in my backyard and was worried about Dale eating the leaves , but so far so good . Douglas knows quite a bit about plants and trees and what is toxic to tortoises . <p> As for the dogs they can have garlic . It is great for killing bacteria , fungus , and parasites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system . It is also speculated to help repel fleas . However , do no use garlic for toy breeds of dogs or cats . It is speculated that garlic ( and onions ) can cause anemia in toy breeds ( dogs weighing less than twenty pounds ) and cats . Garlic contains many of the nutrients dogs need including sulfur , potassium , phosphorus , vitamins B and C , allicin , ajoene , amino acids , germanium , and selenium . Use fresh or oil not dried as it is far less effective . Do be careful with the amounts of garlic given though . If anyone 's interested in how much per dog weight just ask and I 'll post it . <p> I noticed this thread rather late so I am behind in commenting about the avocados . But like others have said , tortoises love avocados and I have never heard of any sort of problems associated with feeding them . However , I have read that avocados have a bad calcium to phosphorus ratio which means that if fed in large amounts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhibited . Avocados ARE high in fats too but in moderation this can be a good thing , especially for breeding females who could use the extra lipids during egg production . <p> Meg 's ( Meg90 ) tortoise got very i 'll from avocado apparently . I would NEVER feed either avocado or garlic--why take that sort of risk ? Its nothing like they 'd get in the wild , and has no benefit I see . Avocado is much higher in fat and calories than typical tort foods . I would n't even consider garlic a food ... kinda like giving a tort herbs or onion or LONG ... <p> Meg 's ( Meg90 ) tortoise got very i 'll from avocado apparently .

But then again , in moderation I think even a high fat food like an avocado can be beneficial . Plus avocados are known as one of those ' super foods ' that contain a lot of good things besides fats or oils . If they are dangerous I think I would have known by now as I have been feeding them to tortoises ( let me stress once more--in moderation ) for almost 40 years . <p> Oh I forgot about the avocado 's and the dogs . My dogs have been eating avocado 's for years and they love them . The only thing that I 've found with dogs eating avocado is that when they eat them when they 've fallen and are starting to rot and they eat a lot it can make them vomit .

So from that time on the offending food item will be considered as bad or risky by that person .

Approx 33 eggs total I think . <p> Making an egg is an expensive thing for a turtle or tortoise to do , lots of nutrients get used up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs . The few times I have found statistics for wild nests , without regard to hatch rate , most eggs are fertile when laid . <p> I have an argumentative ( debate not cattiness ) that is speculative . . . <p> I think at least some of the takeaway could be that infertile eggs are a result of good husbandry , in that the female had an abundance of resources . I think males , when held in close proximity to females are not very thrifty with their resources , so male fertility ( effective , that is ) goes down while females ' go up with the high quality food we offer in over abundance . <p> Has anyone ever had at times where 1 egg or so is fertile and the rest are infertile in a clutch ? 1 good egg out of a bunch of bad ones ? 166976 @qwx576976 <p> That just about explains most of my Manouria luck . I was able to get 1 , 2 and sometimes 3 hatchlings out of over 20 eggs each sitting , and the eggs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to what Will just said , he recently hatched almost all of the eggs laid this past spring by one female from the same group that used to live here . Besides climate , the main difference was that the male had been separated from the females for quite a while . <p> 14 May 2017 , my star tortoise laid an egg . But it is not the chalky type indicated up here . More like a bit pinkish if you candle it . So highly chance is that it is not fertile ? My star has been laying eggs since 2008 but I never have any success <p> That happened to me starting two years ago with my leopard . Bunch of eggs . One hatched , two others baby died inside eggs , one appeared fully developed the other almost . All the other eggs , around 20 or so nothing . <p> The top two the embryos never developed .... the next 2 were chalking when this pic was taken ( you can see the band on the egg on the left ) ... the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this clutch and they were infertile .... the bottom one chalked . So 3 out of 7 appears to be good at 34 days while the other 4 either collapsed or never chalked and were full of yolk. 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

Some of these have been here for years , some are recent acquisitions . We have 6 redfoots and 4 Cherryheads . These are absolutely my favorite of the tortoises that we keep , they have such big personalities . Two of the new ones were sold to me as " blonde " Red foots . My question is , are these just the product of line breeding for lighter color , and what do they look like as adults ? Thanks in advance . <p> That would certainly be an interesting mix .

My favorite substrate combo is 4:2 mix of coconut bark:coco coir . It is the easiest to maintain ... and is relatively simpler to control pests . <p> I concur with Dean .

@@58539860 @7539860/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> I am a dog trainer by profession . Well technically , an " Animal Trainer " , since I train everything . Have been since the early 90 's . I engage in all types of training and I work with all types of dogs . I train dogs who are so soft they they will pee if you so much as look at them , and dogs that are so hard that they will bite you for looking at them , and everything in between . I hold many National Protection Dog Championship titles , I have trained dogs for Oscar winning movies and I also do the simplest in home private party puppy training and problem solving . I have " fixed " dogs that were so bad they were about to be euthanized , many times . Years ago I did the typical parking lot obedience classes too . I do n't rigidly follow any one discipline , I try to master them all and use them wherever appropriate . My bag of tricks is large . <p> This thread is in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see and hear so much about . It seems to happen a lot more as the weather warms up and more tortoises are outside , where dogs can gain access to them . It is my goal to share my experience with dog-proof enclosure building , and some dog training tips , in the hopes of preventing another tragedy . Anyone should feel free to question , comment , or add their knowledge and experiences too . <p> Enclosures : Chicken wire ai n't gon na cut it . Even a small dog can get through chicken wire . Great for holding in chickens , not so good for keeping dogs or raccoons OUT . You need " welded wire " . One inch by one inch will work , but I prefer one inch by two inch since the thickness of the wire is a bit more substantial . How the wire is mounted and attached is vitally important too . I like to use 2x4s and 4x4s to build solid sturdy frames and attach the wire with deck screws and fender washers . The fender washers are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold down the wire nicely . The deck screws are super strong so you do n't have to worry about the heads popping off like they do on cheaper screws . Heavy duty hinges and hardware are well worth the money in this case too . If you over build it a lot , nothing bad will happen . If you under build it just a little ... disaster . <p> Another option for those who do n't feel so handy with tools is to hire a fencing company to put up chain link panels around your tortoise pen . Kind of like a giant dog kennel . I recommend a chain link roof too . 11 gauge wire will keep most dogs out . 9 gauge wire will keep ALL dogs out . In some instances an enclosed area is not possible or practical , but a simple dividing fence can make a big difference in the safety of your tortoises . Just be aware that a determined dog , turned on by the sight of a wiggling shelled critter , can easily hop most fences . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoises should be the number one line of defense . There are a million ways to accomplish this , but sturdy materials and construction techniques are a must . Allowing dogs and tortoises to share a common space is a recipe for disaster , in my opinion . <p> Dog Training : Even after all these years , I am amazed at the lack of training on most people 's pet dogs . A simple course of obedience will often work wonders . It helps to build the right relationship between owner and dog and it starts the dog learning that it must respond to voice command . This is essential , and although it seems unrelated to the tortoises , the concept of inhibition that comes from plain old vanilla flavored obedience can also go a long way in making your dog re-consider attacking your tortoise without you even there . <p> To directly deal with interaction between dog and tortoise there are many methods . The main premise is to teach the dog that they are not allowed to have anything to do with the tortoise and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on leash with voice command or off leash with a shaker can , hose or squirt gun , or anything else that YOUR dog perceives as negative . The idea is to teach the dog that bad things happen when it gets anywhere near the tortoise , or even shows " interest " in the tortoise . Many people are familiar with the " Snake Breaker " clinics that go on all over the country . The idea is to teach the dog through safe methods that the sight , sound , and smell of venomous snakes is always associated with something very unpleasant . The result is that the dog will use all of its senses to avoid and completely stay away from venomous snakes , thereby saving its life . This same concept can be used to save the life of the critter , our tortoises in this case . By the correct and careful use of a good electric collar we can teach the dog that tortoises are NOT fun chew toys and that somehow tortoises deliver a nasty " bite " when you get your nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enclosure . Now do n't misunderstand , I 'm not all willy nilly about using " shock collars " on dogs , but they ARE a very useful very powerful teaching tool . When used CORRECTLY , they are very effective and can literally save a dogs life , or save the life of object of their affection . <p> For those that decide to go this route , here are some general tips : 1 . I highly recommend you hire an experienced professional to help you with this . A professional tile guy can come on here and type up a thread on how to re-tile your bathroom . What do you think the results would look like when you are finished ? Things can go any number of ways and the ability to read the dog and make instantaneous adjustments is CRITICAL . Enough said . 2 . Only buy top tier , quality equipment . Now is NOT the time to save a few bucks and have an equipment malfunction . I use and recommend the " Dogtra " brand . I use many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very happy with the quality , reliability and customer service . They make collars for dogs as small as 10 pounds . 3 . Before you ever put it on the dog , strap it to your thigh and try it out . Become very familiar with what it feels like and how the controls work at all the different levels of stimulation . 4 . You need to spend at least one MONTH putting this collar on the dog and taking it off randomly through out the day , with the collar turned OFF , to get the dog used to wearing it , and so the dog does not associate the correction with the collar . The unpleasant sensation should be a bolt from the blue , or the dog should think it came from the tortoise . You do not want the dog to realize that the correction only happens when it is wearing its special collar , and you are around . My puppies wear these collars ( turned off ) from the time they are two months old . Sometimes I never even actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I need it . I have dogs that are several years old and been wearing e-collars their whole lives , but I 've have not ever needed to use it on them . The collars mean nothing to these dogs and this is just how it should be . 5 . When you put the collar on the dog , it must be high and tight . It should be all the way at the top of the dogs neck , right up against the base of the skull . It needs to be very tight . Not so tight that you cut off the dogs air , but very tight . The contact points must touch the skin and you do n't want the collar slipping around and rubbing their skin . 6 . After at least a month of diligently and randomly having the dog wear the collar around for hours at a time , go back and re-read number one above . Now turn the collar on and put it on the dog , hopefully with the help of your trained and experienced professional . Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog will know its a set up . Have someone with the remote ready and hiding in the house or somewhere out of sight , but where they have a clear view of the entire dog and tortoise area . For most e-collar applications we want VERY low power . For this one we want it high . We want the dog to be very startled and upset by what is about to happen . It should be NEGATIVE , in other words . Now the next part is subjective and will vary with each individual situation . Somehow you need to let the dog have access to the tortoise and or its pen . When the dog shows interest and goes to sniff at the tortoise or the enclosure , the person inside pushes the button . In most cases that is enough for most dogs . One correction . Its good to repeat the offer a few times over a period of days or weeks to really let the dog know that those tortoises are BAD news and let them learn that they want to AVOID those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the lack of involvement from any humans , the correction ( or bite , as the dog may perceive it ) comes from the tortoise or its pen , and the dog must be able to escape from the situation . In other words do n't do this by sticking the dog and the tortoise in a kennel together . Best in a yard where the dog can get away and go to the other side of the yard from that nasty , mean , magical , biting tortoise . Now please go back and read number 1 AGAIN . Your chances of this working correctly will skyrocket if you bring in someone who is familiar and experienced with all of these concepts . <p> These are just a few ideas to try and help avoid the disasters that we see far too often . If none of this suits you , that is fine and understandable , but DO find something that DOES suit you and your situation . Do something to keep the tortoises safe , and you happy with your dog(s) . <p> Good thread Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and used it for my Bull Terrier . She likes to eat other dogs poop . They work really good , like you said if done right . Mine has a buzzer noise also . That 's all I have to use now . Most of the time I do n't use the collar at all . For my purpose , I trained with my voice and collar together . I used to train people , um dogs too , but not to the extent you do . I could n't put up with the owners stupidity , I had to stop before I went to jail . LOL . Hopefully all dog and tort owners will listen and get it . <p> Brilliant thread , really glad that someone has taken the time to do this . It 's an awful way to lose a tortoise I imagine and my heart goes out to people that this has happened to despite trying , this shows it can be avoided .

I was never a person who believed in e collars ... only because I had seen horrible affects from mis use/ignorant operator . I did research and educated myself and have been able to see times when this tool is humane and indeed does allow dog and man to get along much better ... also obedience training does allow a means of communication from canine to human ....

I have trained dogs in my day and have only encountered two other dogs that no matter what training you do ... no matter what tools you utilize ... you simply have a dog that is smart , fast , tenacious and agile , all of which make for a great animal ... and I adore her , however this is a dog that found her way to me after two other family member households could not handle her character any longer and had I not accepted her as into our household she would have ended up on death row .... there is never a time that she is allowed outside without either myself or her cable line ... at first we did all of the training ... used all the tools ... said alot of choice words ( well I did ) and determined she is a huge hazard to herself ... therefore she will live out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torts various yards on the property are all surrounded by chain link ... they all have places to safely retreat to ... and all works well ..... although in the beginning she would get lose out the front door when my son was younger ... she never even stopped by to look at the torts ... likely because the fast moving rabbits would keep her going ... lol ... <p> Now the other dog is awesome .... he is able to be in the same supervised space with me and a tort and go lay down .... does this mean I trust him ? Hell no . A dog is a predator ... anything smaller than them ( sometimes bigger ) equates to potential prey .... it is not that I hold anything against a dog for being a dog ... but I would be an irresponsible person if I fooled myself in believing anything other than that .... <p> You can safely and securely house a dog(s) and a tortoise if you are responsible for your set up ..... there is no room for error when living things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are keeping some captive critters .... <p> Thanks again Tom .... good share on another effective use of a valuable tool .... if used correctly ... <p> Good info from our friend Tom !

I could see a chicken pecking out a tort eyeball or two . And chickens poop everywhere . I 'm betting they would get on top of the tort and poop right on it ! Scrubbing chicken poop off of a tort shell is n't my idea of fun . Also , given that chicken poop is white , I bet the tortoise would try to eat it ... a lot . Ok , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ! That 's all I 've got . <p> Chickens are not dumb at all ... they know exactly what food is and what not . and they never poop on a turtle the same like when you hold the chicken it would not poop on you 166976 @qwx576976 <p> I guess I musta always owned the " dumb " chickens who were not pooptrained , because mine would poop on anything . hr <p> tortoise5643 said : <p> Sorry just scared about pecking at torts 166976 @qwx576976 <p> Personally I would be too . I have been pecked by chickens and it 's not fun . Did n't kill me , but not fun . hr Mixing chickens and tortoises/turtles works for Sandra and I am happy for her , but it is not something I will suggest to anybody to try . Just my opinion .... <p> Also just a side thing to keep in mind , be sure your chickens are adults because chicks , eggs , and even a weaken/sick chicken could be seen as food by some tortoises ... once more just sayin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . I do it and its fine , but i cant talk for all the other ppl with chickens.mine are very loved and they never pecked me eighter . But like i said that 's a decision and choice what everybody has to do on their own . <p> Sent from my ZTE N9120 using TortForum mobile app hr Jacqui is right mine are all adults , yup do n't  leave the small one with them , also if you decide to have them run around the same backyard , you should do it carefully and introduce them first like do it slowly , like witb a fence first , so that the chickens can see that there is a different animal living there as well. , . i love my hens i have just girls they come right away when i call them , and follow u around like a dog But again i cant speek for everyone .

I would love to have torts and chickens together . I just do n't know if it 's good for either of them ... <p> I have chickens too . I keep them , their food , their water , and their poop completely separate from my tortoises . Loose in a large yard has its risks , though it might work okay for some people , but in a cage together ? No way . You are just asking for trouble . <p> I 've been working chickens for nearly 20 years . Never seen or heard of a chicken that wo n't poop when being held .

" My adults kill rabbits , sparrows , and other things . The crows which surround our property and the hawks behind my house will not encroach beyond the fence perimeter of our property . My babies would be vulnerable to a chicken if the chicken so chose it . <p> I have seen a number of chickens that become close to their owners and ride around on their shoulders . They would not pass waste on their owners and would hop off if they needed to do so or they simply waited . I am talking about people who took their chickens on Vespa rides to the market for company , so the relationship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them together , I am sure there are quite a few folks who can manage it better than I might , so more power to them . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I have seen a lot of pictures and some breeders that house them together , and obviously would have to be an arid tortoise . They would only be living together in the winter , most of which would be bermation period . The feeding dishes would be separate and I do all of my calcium supplement by hand . I used to have torts when i was young but as for husbandry I am new to this , and as I said I am just researching and looking into torts , any suggestions and information is welcome , no offense will be taken <p> There is a local petstore near hear that keeps sulcata and beardies together . Does not look like a good mix to me . Beardies looked kinda stressed and beat up . But they are a breeding group , so could be from each other or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humidity then a beardie , so it would have to be a more arid tortoise . Breading pair of dragons should n't be house together , the male will mate the female to death . And bearded dragons eat their own young thinking they are food , I 've had aggressive babies eat each other ( disturbing and disgusting ) . Babies all have different tanks and would n't be housed together that way , it would be a full grown housing unit . My dragons mostly use the branches and do n't come down onto the ground often , having a lot of wasted ground space in such a big cage . Again , not taking any offense , greatful for the knowledge , just trying to get as much info as i can <p> In MY OPINION , you should keep tortoises with tortoises and lizards with lizards . Do not mix species , whether beardies or tortoises . <p> You want something that does n't require humidity , and yet you are going to keep it in a small ( as far as tortoises go , 360 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would be getting a very young tortoise . All young tortoises require some kind of humidity to grow a smooth shell . Sulcatas come from Africa . Pretty hot and dry there . A mediterranean tortoise like a Greek or Hermann 's also come from hot , dry climates . But as babies , they all stay underground in a humid hiding place . <p> Its good that you are researching now , before jumping in and buying a tortoise . I still think you need to set up his own habitat for your tortoise , no matter what kind you get . <p> Sulcata - gets VERY big . Does much better outside than inside . Greek - ( several sub-species ) some hibernate , some do n't . Does n't get too big and is a nice , friendly tortoise . Hermann 's - similar to the Greek tortoises Russian - Stays pretty small . Is very social with humans , when humanized . Hibernates . Likes to bury in the substrate . Very active and requires quite a bit of space for wandering . <p> Thank-you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything quite well before I get myself into anything I 'm not expecting . I 've been looking into torts for 2 years now and just getting serious about fine details . While younger they would have their own tank , growing up needs and full grown needs are different . With me being up in canada having them outside year round is not an option . During the summer months they can spend the day outside but will be sleeping inside and winter months they can come out everyday , we have a room for letting everybody run around in . A friends room mate had a tortoise years ago and did n't  have a cage for him , just let him have run of the house , had a kiddie pool and dirt area set up . I 'm sure that 's not typical but has anybody had experince with that ? I 'm not against building him his own cage just looking at options 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I have 3 indoor cats . 2 senior females that have been together in my household for 13 years and adult male who 's been with us last 5 years . Everybody is altered . One of the " old ladies " has been having behavioral issues since my twin boys started toddling around the house . It was about this same time when I had to have my 2 original cats put down . the white and gray are my boys who had died , and the all gray is Shari ( my problem child ) here is my Mom petting Shari and the one in forefront is Toffi ( another old lady , 15 ) she 's a tortoiseshell . Shari 's age can only be estimated as she was about 4 when she wandered up to us and never left . We had no info of her prior life . She 's around 17 now . here is Shari today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter boxes all over the place . I tried everything ! Catnip stuff , pheromone diffusers , enzymatic cleaners , you name it . Finally I had a cat shrink ( for real ! ) come to the house and he put her on Prozac which did help . She 'd still have issues on and off though but only on occasion . About a year after all this started I had a new cat join our family . Maxi . got him off craigslist from family who 'd spent 850$ for him as kitten few months prior and then could n't stand the " white hair everywhere " . I was missing that " white hair " , crying daily after my two boys died , so I took Maxi . Maxi is very " alpha " , and wanted to play which I know did n't help Shari 's behavior .

His/Her eyes are looking puffy and are watery.and the skin in the shell by his/her front n back legs are puffy n feel like they r full of air . What is wrong ? I really need help ! and the vet is really spendy here ! I will take him in if i have to but I 'm hoping someone knows excactly what 's going on here ! <p> The puffy , watery eyes sounds like he is much too dry . First thing I would do is give him a good warm soak . <p> Put him in a container of water that is just deep enough to cover the bridge between the upper and lower shell . The water should be reasonably warm to the touch , but not hot . <p> You can keep the water warmer longer by setting it on a heating pad , near a register vent , or putting a heat lamp over it . He may put his entire head under the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will not drown . Soak for 15-20 minutes . <p> If the eyes are still puffy tomorrow , go get yourself some baby food squash , carrots , or sweet potatoes , and soak him again , this time stirring the jar of baby food into the soaking water . <p> The puffiness of the hindquarters could be associated with dehydration . Unfortunately , a lot of times it signifies renal failure , and the only way to check for this is to have the vet do a blood panel . First things first , get him hydrated and go from there . <p> Thankyou ! That was the first thing i did was soak him in warm water in the sink.n his " air filled " skin around all four of his legs is gone . eyes r still puffy n lil watery .

Do you have UV lighting ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is there a water bowl available at all times ? What are you feeding ? <p> Something is n't right if he is becoming dehydrated and having eye issues .

I was referring only to myself at the time . Point being that I had the same issue , and got through it w/o a vet . <p> How big is your tortoise ? Are you able to get a good temperature gradient in an enclosure that is that small ? I suggest investing in a 50 gallon rubbermaid tub or Christmas tree storage box as soon as you can . <p> A damp substrate like the coconut coir would definitely be better . What are the night temp temps in your house ? 70 's are okay , low 80 's are better . Just a regular incandescent black light bulb will help keep the heat up at night , and are cheap at Walmart , etc . I would also put a hide on the warm side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit brutal here . I understand being young , and I understand not having a ton of money . But if that were the case I would make sure to have emergency funds set aside . If your tortoise turns out to be in fact suffering from renal failure and you do not take him to a vet , he very well can die . You may find yourself wishing that you had spent the $50 . <p> Guido ( that 's his/her name ) i do n't  know how long.but he weights 1.25lbs . How can I keep him safe in a tub ? I have a cat who will use him as a toy if i leave him in an uncovered tub . And we keep our house at 78deg all day . I have no problem spending the $50. and I already have . I took him to the vet a few weeks ago when I thought he was breathing funny.but the vet said it was normal n he was just scared and he looked healthy.but his eyes also were not puffy or watery then . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrot baby food ( it was the only veggie baby food i had left at my work ) and he seems to love it.he is actually sitting in it and not trying to climb out . <p> Get rid of the light right now .

You can use a regular incandescent light until you can afford a better UVB bulb , but I am not kidding right this minute take out that bulb ... I had a hatchling blinded by those bulbs and I can show you the write up they did on them ... I 'll find the link ... <p> I concur with Maggie . Stop using the coil bulb immediately . They are dangerous and cause eye problems . That may be the root of your problem right there . <p> I for one do not use a UV light with my Redfoots , and may others do not as well .

All in all with the tub , wire and silicone it would take a couple hours of work and cost around $20 . A brick of the coconut coir is around $3 , and you could have a bigger , humid space for your tort . <p> By temperature gradient I do n't mean too cold , I mean too hot . If the enclosure is small and your house temp is 78* , what is the cool side of the enclosure ? Do you have a thermometer to check ? If it is too warm it can be adding to dehydration . <p> I am not trying to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To get your little guy/gal 100% healthy , some changes should be made .

@@58539880 @7539880/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> So , i 'm wondering about some things I see in my torts behavior , specifically in regards to the thread title . <p> As we all know when you soak regularly , you 'll rarely find any poop in the enclosure . Tort goes into water , poop leaves tort , always on point , lol . <p> I 've rotated my soaking routines , ranging from every day , to as low only twice a week . <p> I find two things constant : 1 being that the tort always poops during a soak 2 being regardless of my soaking routine I never ever find droppings in the enclosure . I changed nothing about the feeding routine all husbandry was the same other than the soaking . <p> My question here is in regards to nutritional absorption . If I kept feeding him and he is n't pooping on his own , is he holding the food in his body longer and processing more nutrition from it ? I 'm wondering if by soaking him daily there may be an adverse effect as not completely absorbing maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too sure to be completely honest with you though . i bet you can google how long , on average ( if it varies enough to require an average ) it takes a tortoise to process all the goodies from the food they eat . thus , letting you know if its overnight or takes a week . i would imagine , though , after a week its well processed and ready to go . <p> One of them is probably " cleaning up " after the others when they do go in the enclosure . Mine usually always go when I soak them . Unfortunately I have noticed that if one does decide to use the enclosure and I do n't catch it fast enough , usually within seconds , Nismo will devour it . It 's pretty gross but for some reason he loves it and is always searching out things I do n't want him snacking on . I am pretty sure this is probably the same in your case you just have n't caught the culprate in the act . <p> My babies get on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning early enough , they will poop . I 'm betting yours are still pooping but one of them is eating it or it gets buried before you see it . They way I see it , if they poop every day or at leats every 2 days then they have more than enough food to keep them happy . <p> There is some talk that yes , by doing the soaks the tortoise does not process all from the food that he would normally do . I ca n't recall seing where this has been tested , just talked about . Like was said also some times poop is eaten by the tortoises ( his and any other choice deposit he comes across ) . Poop does have food value along with , for humans , the " yuck " factor . I remember long years ago when I was showing rabbits , it was said that if they would eat their own poop , they would get more value out of it the second time through . <p> Haha , I 'm so relieved not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tortoise to digest and pass .

I 've been wondering this as my two prepare for brumation . As in , how look should I offer food before it 's too close to their bedding down time ? And should I be soaking more often to help them get cleaned out ? <p> 1 . Like Jacqui said , we 've talked about this before , but I do n't know that anyone can give a proven answer , me included . I soak all my leopards and sulcatas daily for their first 6 months or so . I have higher than average growth rates and they exhibit nothing but health and vigor . If there were some sort of nutrient absorption interruption caused by soaking too often , of all people , I think I would have seen at least some evidence of it in one species or individual at some point over the last five years . Instead , I see just the opposite . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , and seeing the same results with them . <p> 2 . True story about the rabbits and the " night pellets " . Its actually a necessary part of their digestion . Sometimes rabbits that are kept on wire grates that allow their droppings to go through do not fare as well as rabbits who have access to their own poop . Rats are this way too . Tortoises on the other hand are more like horses with respect to their GI tract . While they might be able to extract more nutrients the second time through , it is not essential for them . <p> 3 . I know for a fact that at least in some cases it can take at least up to 7-8 weeks for things to pass through a tortoises GI tract . I have seen this demonstrated multiple times in my herds . <p> 4 . Most of the references that I have seen and read , and the time frame that I have always adhered to for not feeding before hibernation is two weeks .

@@58539883 @7539883/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> Question +G I came home fro work yesterday and found my California desert tortoise flipped over in the backyard . It was alive when I found it , so I righted it and left it alone . The next morning when I woke up I went outside to check on it and found it dead ! Why do you suppose that it died ? It looked good when I found it . <p> Answer +G We are very sorry to hear about the loss of your pet tortoise . Unfortunately , this is a story which we hear a number of times during the summer at our practice . There are many reasons why your tortoise died . <p> In the wild if a tortoise were to flip itself over , it would surely die . Therefore , evolutionarily , it is not adaptive for an animal to put itself in precarious positions which might endanger it . However , for some reason , we hear about backyard tortoises which will consistently flip themselves over by attempting to climb up objects in the yard , losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other reasons which might account for a tortoise flipping over . Two of the more common causes are fighting between adult males , and dogs . When males battle they will use their large gular plates ( the long , often hook like projection beneath the jaw ) to flip over their opponents . In the wild , this spells almost certain demise for their adversaries . <p> It is not uncommon for dogs to play with tortoises , especially dogs which have not been exposed to or grown up with tortoises . The dog may grab the tortoise with its mouth and flip it over during the play , and then after it is finished playing , the dog may wander off , leaving the tortoise in whatever position it was last in . <p> It is not natural for a tortoise to be on its back . Aside from the psychological discomfort of being upside down for long periods , there are a number of physiological reasons why this position is detrimental to the animal . First off , the tortoise has a large lung area and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell space . When the tortoise is on its back , the liver , stomach and intestinal tract fall into this space because of gravity , thus compromising the animal+GGs ability to breathe . <p> Also , being upside down can cause the tortoise to vomit or regurgitate intestinal or stomach contents . If the tortoise accidentally aspirates , or breathes into its lungs any of the gastrointestinal material , it could die . This might be immediate , or it may take a few hours to days . <p> Another possible problem encountered with tortoises which have flipped over is torsion on their bowel . That is a condition where part of the intestinal tract flips over on its own axis , or twists inside the shell . This is a very serious condition , and unless untwisted quickly , the animal will surely die . In the panic of being upside down a tortoise will frequently lose control of its bowels and bladder . Often times a tortoise will defecate or urinate during this time . As an animal becomes fatigued from struggling , it may lose voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant since the tortoise depends upon the water in its bladder for its hydration . Even if the tortoise is found in time and righted , if not given access to water , or given fluids by a veterinarian ( if needed ) , the animal may be at risk of dying from dehydration . <p> If a tortoise gets stranded on its back and it happens to be in the sun the animal may rapidly overheat and die . Even on a relatively cool day , the extra muscular strain from the exertion of trying to right itself can add to the fatigue and heat stress . <p> Another problem often encountered with stranded tortoises is from fly strike . Flies usually do not bother healthy tortoises ; however , flies are quick to take advantage of compromised animals . The flies will attack areas of damaged tissue such as cuts and bruises . They will also attack areas which have been moistened from saliva or urine . Specifically , the flies concentrate their activity around the mouth , eyes and cloaca . <p> When the flies land on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of fly , most of these eggs hatch out into maggots within 24 hours . The maggots then attack the tissue and begin eating away at the flesh . Not only do these maggots cause overt damage to the tissue , they are also carriers of disease . <p> As far as how long can a tortoise be on its back before it may die , it is difficult to say . That depends on a number of causes such as health of the animal , temperature of the day , whether or not it flipped over in the sun , length of time on its back , etc . <p> What should you do if you find your tortoise on its back ? The first thing is to right it . But do it slowly so as not to cause torsion of the bowel by flipping it back over to fast . Then assess it for hydration ( i.e. are its eyes sunken ? Did it urinate ? Is its mouth dry ? ) If these symptoms are present it would be wise to get the animal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a hot day and the animal does not appear too dehydrated , then just cooling it off with water and some oral fluids will suffice . Either tap water or Gatorade , given by stomach tube will be very beneficial . A ten pound animal can be safely tubed with three to four ounces of water . <p> Keep the tortoise in a cool place and observe it for signs of problems . Should any evidence of illness present itself , contact your local tortoise expert or a veterinarian familiar with reptiles . <p> ( Reprinted with permission from the January , 1991 edition of the Tortuga Gazette ) 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977 
@@58539884 @7539884/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Best UVB and Heat Lamp for Tortoise <p> Just wanted to know what you all recommend for UVB and Heat for hatchling/young tortoise . I was informed that using the ceramic fixture was the best way to go , but which bulbs to get . When I had a bearded dragon a few years ago I bought a White Under Cabinet light and fixture at Walmart for around 10.00 which was 18 " , this seemed to work great , would this work ? Also does using a long bulb or regular bulb make any difference , I was thinking that a long fixture would be easier to lay across the 30 gallon tank on one end instead of using a screen top and then placing the round light fixture on top . Also any suggestions on the cheapest places to buy equipment , pet stores are so much more expensive for equipment than going out to other stores and buying either the same thing or something close to it . Thanks . <p> A lot can depend on the species and where you 're from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you plan to take it outdoors a lot during the day and just bring it in at night , etc ? <p> Personally , my schedule does n't permit me to do that much with my baby tortoises , so I currently use a ZooMed PowerSun Mercury Vapor Bulbs . These bulbs are popular among lizard and tortoise keepers because they provide both heat and adequate amounts of UVA/UVB radiation . Individual experience varies , but with the proper fixture , the ZooMed brand is thought to be better than most ( Exo-Terra or T-Rex ) . You can usually find them on Amazon for around $30-35. ( petstores have them for $50+ ) <p> For your size tank , I would get the lowest wattage available ( 100 watts ) and somehow mount the lamp high enough where the basking temps would not get too high . One could argue that such a powerful bulb is overkill for a relatively-small enclosure , but you raise/lower the lamp as needed , and in the likely event of upgrading to a larger enclosure , you could still use that bulb ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use the 12 " ceramic dome shop light fixture from Lowe 's and have had no issues . <p> I agree with Studentofthereptile . Mercury vapor bulb . You could also get a ceramic heat emitter for night time heat with no light if needed . The MVB needs to not have anything between it and the tort . So , cut the screen the size of the light fixture , so all the UVB it gives out will go to your tort . Of cours , like already said . All this depends on where you live and if there is outdoor , natural sunlight time . <p> I do not recommend using MVB lamps for hatchling and very young tortoises . When mounted correctly ( pointing straight down ) at the correct distance for the UVB to be effective , they produced too much heat in a very localzied spot . Baby tortoises , like any age , need to bask to warm their bodies for normal activity and to aid in digestion . Baby and small tortoises can dehydrate rapidly under direct heat due to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives one choice and one choice only . MVB lamps also only produce localized UV and light directly under them , leaving most of the area around them in the dark . A better choice for babies is a combination of a standard incandescent bulb that produces white light ( not a " soft " light bulb ) or a GE Reflecta . Depending upon the ambient room temperature and enclosure temperature you can adjust the amount of heat produced by the basking light by using an appropriate wattage , 40 , 50 , 60 or whatever is needed . It can be moved in closer or farther away to " fine tune " the basking temperature . Along with that a tube type fluorescent UV light that will not only provide UV to the entire enclosure but as additional light . 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

@@58539888 @7539888/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> I 'm having a bit of a unique year with my sulcata hatchlings . Year after year , my hatchlings are pretty homogenous . They are nearly always 35-39 grams and they all look pretty similar . Now in the past I 've had one runt that was " only " 32 grams , and one " giant " that hatched at 44 grams , but those were exceptions . This year I 've had a bout 50 hatch so far and about 12 of them appear to be little runts in comparison to their siblings . I immediately started thinking about what might be the " problem " . Did I not feed the adults enough ? Are all the years of growing weeds depleting the soil of nutrients ? Not enough calcium or protein in the adult females diet ? Well I finally started popping them onto the scale and guess what . All those little runts are 38-39 grams . Their " normal " looking siblings are all 44-46 grams . No joke . I 'm having a year of giants . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be off , but I checked it with the four quarters trick . You can see some size differences here : These guys were all hatched within a few days of each other . <p> Up next is a couple of them with some interesting color .

I measure out my feedings to all my animals and just check the thermometer for daily highs . I do this just to see the different growth rates of my reds and they are always real close . But not perfect due too you ca n't make them eat the same day in and day out . I have noted that on hotter days they eat less and soak more in there mud holes . But there average wait gain is about the same biweekly . <p> My thermometers register the highs and lows each day , but I do n't record it . Ambient drops to 78 at night and climbs to 90ish during the day . I do n't measure the food . All the hatchlings are started in a 4x8 ' closed chamber . They eat a TON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so out of the brooder box . Not much time for new growth to be measured yet . I weigh them all after hatching , but before they start eating . At this point they all have about 7-12 days of food in them . I do n't measure the food . I just throw out endless handfuls onto a couple of plates , and it magically disappears . This enclosure holds any where up to 50 or 60 hatchlings at a time , depending on what has sold and what is hatching . They rotate in and out of there constantly during " the season " . Right now there are about 30-40 in there , but some are soon to be sold and more are hatching right now . <p> I was talking about the adults .

But ... what would be the visual differences ? <p> Like , for example .. Berlandieri , does n't  have the nucal scute , and are also smaller in size , and that kind of stuf ... <p> You have it backwards , Armando - agassizii is the southern tortoise and morflaki is north and east of the river . I have n't been able to tell any difference between them , but then , I 've never actually seen them side-by-side . I 'm not so sure there is an actual physical difference .

I am a new tortoise owner and I have a couple of questions about my tortoise , which I hope you can help me with . <p> So , please meet Torty <p> I always wanted a tortoise , when I was a kid we had several of them in our garden . So on this years birthday I got her as gift . She was bought from a sanctuary farm . <p> I do n't know the history behind the shell damages , but I took her to the vet after I got her , because she had a runny nose . The vet concluded that she is quite healthy and estimated that she must be around 3 years old and of the Mediterranean type . <p> My first question would be to confirm exatly what 's her type is . Is it a Mediterranean tortoise ? Because after googling around , I have my doubts , hence please advise ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small semi-burrow between two built structures which is highly overgrown by grasses which creates a nice enclosure . But I often find her under the jasmine vines sleeping for days . <p> What temperatures can she tolerate ? I keep her in the garden and since for the last two month the temperatures outside have very mild ( 34-23 degrees ) . But now it getting a little cold in the night , the temperature drops to 16-17 degrees . <p> Does she require soaking ? I have been soaking her 2-3 times week for 15 minutes initially , but I do n't see her drinking . Also , it seems that she does n't enjoy the process at all and she often fall asleep during soaking ! <p> Finally , my last questions would be about food . I have planted several plants and grasses which are generally edible by tortoises , which are : bermuda grass , hibiscus rosa-sinesis , agave and aloe vera . I see her eating the grass a lot and every morning I pluck a bunch of hibiscus leaves and leave it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in form of a cucumber or tomato . Is that a sufficient diet variety or I need to add something else ? <p> I apologise for the long post and I really hope that I can get answers to my questions in order to ensure that she dwells in most healthy environment that I can provide . <p> I also think it 's a Greek ( Testudo graeca ) , but I think your vet is wrong on the age .

Is this something I should only give him as a treat ? Is it okay if he munches on them every day when I bring him outside ? Thanks <p> eta : Oh and for the plantain plants can he eat the entire plant ( the weird seedy things included ) or just the leaves ? <p> no more mowing for me either , my sulcata does a great job at that , tho there are some things in the grass he s not interested in so they grow and grow , the grass scutter comes out just once a month to even and clean things up around here , so glad of that , its too hot in so . calif to mow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage the grass and the tort. i love the spring time around here , the dandies grow tall and strong and i can pick them by the armload a couple times a week for about month to 6 weeks . its a great help to a tort that loves to have dandie breadth . its sad for hima nd me when the season is over . big smiles from galileo &amp; spring <p> Dandelion and plantain are great , as long as that 's not him only diet ( they are better than lettuce greens from the store for example ) ! Just make sure no pesticides/fertilizers . Yes it is fine for him to munch as he gets exercise . You may want to scatter some more seeds for variety if you can , or as you said try to transplant them . Are you sure that 's all that is out there ? Kinda odd for a field to only have two things . If he looks like he 's eating the whole time he 's out there , or gains weight ( probably not an issue if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut back on food you feed inside . More of a wait and see thing though . <p> I 'm pretty sure those are the only two weeds out there- maybe a few different types of grass too . It 's kind of like a soccer field . There are a few weeds here and there but it 's mostly grass . I was in rural Michigan this past weekend and there were huge fields full of weeds- tortoise heaven ! <p> ChiKat , is this a wild field or a groomed field like a soccer or sports field ? sports fields they use chemicals on these plants you would not want to let him eat at his leisure . Things like pestisides an fertilizers can cause him to become i 'll and build in his system . And if it is a wild field Kates right there are more than likely lots of different types of weeds . Please be careful . <p> Leads me to a story : I found a wild field close to my house and was thrilled with the idea I would be able to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful yellow flower and a friend of mine said it was ragweed . I knew it was not ragweed but on closer inspection and research I found out it was n't what I thought either . It was fiddler leaf . This weed is BAD for torts . Sure glad I looked it up and took a few days to do research . It was a cost I was glad to pay to have healthy torts . <p> It 's not a sports field , that 's just what I was comparing it to because it 's big and open and mostly grassy . The town is in charge of mowing it but they do n't put any fertilizer or anything on it . It 's a large field surrounded by houses- basically an extension of my backyard . I 'll try to get a picture of the field . The only weeds that seem to be predominant in my area are dandelions , plantain and clover .

Henry has once escaped his dish and came running toward the cutting board . Being that I am in Michigan in the winter I grow the flowers indoors and just cut them off some when they are in desperate need of a snack .

When you soak your tortoise they often eliminate then instead of in the enclosure which also helps to keep it clean . You could also use a soft toothbrush or cloth to clean off your tortoise if needed . Coconut coir is a great substrate for many types of tortoises that Does not smell bad . Do not use pine or cedar or any aromatic bedding for your tortoise , it may smell good to us but it is poisonous to them . Living in Ohio you will be able to have an indoor and outdoor enclosure . <p> The only time I notice an odor from my torts is after they 've pooped .

They fly away approached by torts , so no problem . In fact there is a bumblebee nest in with my hinges that I feel may work as a predator deterent . Wasps see torts as no threat and torts see wasps as no threat . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . We have a terribly high wasp population here right now also .

@@58539896 @7539896/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> I am new to this community as I stumbled upon it while performing some google searches with my Tortoise symptoms . I appreciate any comments or suggestions you can provide for my situation . <p> I have owned a Russian Tortoise since June 2010 when I got him at 9 months old from a breeder . So he is now approximately 1 year and 4 months old . For the first 6 months of his life he ( his name is Gary ) had 2 separate bulbs ( heat emitting and 1 UV light ) . In early January we upgraded Gary to a larger enclosure and replaced the old bulbs with a mercury vapor bulb . The temperature under the light is 95 . The cool end is 70 and the enclosure is large enough that Gary is able to choose his climate . Initially he seemed to like his new enclosure as he spent time exploring and basking . <p> However , over the next 2 weeks in early January he gradually stopped eating and pooping . It has now been over 3 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also remains in his hide box for most if not all of the day ( ca n't say for sure since obviously we do n't watch him all the time ) . Lastly , when we take him out of the hide box to show him food or soak him it takes him a while to open his eyes and then he just seems generally more sluggish . The switching of enclosures could just be coincidental as he should have had plenty of time to adjust by now . <p> I 've read about common Russian Tortoise symptoms such as running nose , watering eyes or shell rot and Gary does n't seem to have any of these symptoms . We live in the Chicagoland area so we are in cold winter months right now but Gary 's temperatures have not changed . I read about some tortoises that had a " sense " that is was winter and went into somewhat hibernation . I do n't know if this could be the case but in all other respects seems healthy . <p> Thank you for your input and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . Cheers ! <p> Even when kept under the best circumstances they will often try to go into hibernation , I would think he is to cold and wants to sleep until it warms up . 166976 @qwx576976 <p> So even though his enclosure temperature has n't changed at all you think he could still " feel " the cold outside and go into hibernation ? <p> So do you continue to try and feed your tortoise during these hibernation months ? How long does it typically last for everyone else ? Do I need to make sure he 's soaked or brought out occasionally so that he gets his sun vitamins ? <h> dmmjThe member formerly known as captain awesomeModerator5 Year Member <p> it is not just heat alone , light cycles also play a part in it , the way you describe him it sounds like he is sluggish , and that IMHO sounds like the " winter blues " to use an expression .

I 'm a first time Tortoise owner and I just want the best for little Gary . Cheers ! <p> Well , you 're trying to make him think that he has hibernated , so I would put him into a closet so he 'll be on the cool side .

I 'm going to continue to take him out at least once a day and show him his food along with increasing the light time in his enclosure to 14.5 hours ( it was at 13 ) . <p> Hopefully he 'll start to get the clue that it 's not time to hibernate .

I would say baring an accident where a truck of beans would overturn in the hermanns natural area they would never encounter them . Try to figure out what their natural food sources are and mimic them as best as possible . Fruits and vegetables are usually to high in fiber an sugars for a hermanns , A treat every so often wo n't hurt . <p> I agree with the mimic what they would eat in the wild ... if you ca n't feed weeds as the primary diet , or want to supplement that , greens and dark leafy lettuces are the next best thing , plus a bit of edible flowers , and maybe some cactus/pumpkin/squash as a treat . I would not feed green beans . I know its tough to have conflicting advice , but I 'd give some thought to it as well as do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of anything wo n't hurt , but the way I see it , I do n't like to feed foods that are just " ok " ... I like to feed the more ideal foods , and I think there are still enough of them to go around for a varied diet .

Anyway , my Russian tortoise I 've had since Christmas , has taken an interest in biting my finger . If my hands are in her cage at all she will go up to my finger and try to bite it . She does it slowly , sniffs them and checks them out then starts to bite . I also let her walk around my living room from time to time while I sit on the couch . She will look around , locate my feet and immediately make her way over to try and bite my toes ! What 's going on ? <p> I 'm not suggesting here that you smell but--tortoises find food by site and smell . Their philosophy is : " I it looks like food or smells like food , try it . " <p> Could be you have the odor of food residue on your fingers . Could also be that your tortoise associates you and your fingers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) do . <p> I wo n't get involved with the smell of your feet ! No really though , mine try to bite my feet too when I 'm barefoot outdoors in their enclosures . In fact , they try to bite anyone 's fingers or feet that they can get close enough too . <p> Just so you know , if you have n't already found out . It hurts ALOT too ! <p> She probably associates you with food . There is a chance it is also a dominance thing . Put 2 torts together , and it is likely one will bite the other - sometimes quite aggressively . <p> I 've only tried this with my russian , but I tried talking tort language with it . Do n't laugh - I think it worked . Basically if you watch 2 interact , there is some head bobbing , and then the biting may start . Who knows what exactly is being communicated , but it is pretty clear that the aggressor is the one bobbing and it will eventually bite the other to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bent index finger acting as a tort head and at first , let it smell it . If the tort tries to bite , I keep it at face level and do some ' head bobbing ' with my finger nub - maybe even tap it on the nose lightly a few times . Who knows ... I 'm probably just crazy ... but it worked for my russian . He does n't try to bite me anymore and I still feed by hand . <p> My Russian Ernie used to do that for about the first month that we got him . He 'd go after fingers , toes , anything that was green , and anything that was red . He does n't do it anymore and has learned what is edible , and what is n't <p> So I make a fist with my bent index finger acting as a tort head and at first , let it smell it .

I 'll bet you 've been called worse things , and considering your recent Sulcata ramming episode ... what he must have thought of calling you if he could speak ... at least at the time ... what with the shoes and the tools and all . <p> I thought it was so cool the way my little ornate Louise would come and take meal worms from my hand.Little did I realize I was creating a monster ! ! !

You have to really stay on your'toes ' when you clean their outdoor pen ! <p> Mine bites my fingers as well ... she has since I have gotten her ! And come to find out my little Zsa Zsa is not a girl but a BOY ! And I also talked to one of my newly tort friends that have RTs and she says that her male RTs bite more than her female ones ... so I do n't  know maybe your little girl is a boy like mine lol !

We have had Desert Tortoises in the past , however due to the size the Sulcatas can get , we traded our Desert Torotises for the Sulcatas that friends had . <p> In feeding the Sulcatas , I have been told to give them a mixture of Orchard Grass , Bermuda and Alfalfa Grass . But , I am reading that Alfalfa might not be good for the Sulcatas . Can anyone tell me if they can have alfalfa mixed with Orchard and Bermuda ? The substrate in their turtle house is also bermuda grass . Bermuda okay as a bedding ? <p> A great site for sulcata 's is the sulcata station , they have a lot of information on thier site . http : **26;661;TOOLONG Stay away from Alphalpha to much protein . Here is the diet they say to give to sulcatas ... <p> 1 . Grasses <p> Grasses should make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should try to supply as many different grasses as you can from the following list : <p> The best way to provide the grass-based diet that a sulcata requires is to have a large , safely-enclosed outdoor yard in which you can plant various types of grasses for your sulcata to graze on . This will allow your tortoise to graze at will , while he gets exercise and exposure to sunlight . Owners who can provide a tortoise yard do n't have to worry about overfeeding , or whether the tortoise is getting enough UV exposure . <p> 2 . Edible Weeds , Leaves , and Flowers <p> These items should make up the remaining 25% of the diet , if possible . Make sure that any plants you feed to your tortoise have not been treated with chemical fertilizers , pesticides , herbicides , or fungicides . If you buy a plant from a large chain store like Lowe 's , Home Depot , Do-It-All , etc. , re-pot the plant in organic potting soil and wait a couple of months to feed the plant to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizers and/or pesticides used by the store to leach out of the plant . Here are some recommended plants for sulcata tortoises : <p> Use these only as special treats for your tortoise . This means you can feed these items in SMALL quantities , and only once per week at most . These items are NOT necessary , but they can serve as a nice treat for your tortoise , or a way to get them to eat calcium and vitamin supplements : <p> As discussed above , many dark leafy greens do contain significant levels of oxalic acid that can inhibit calcium absorption . This is why these items are listed as OPTIONAL , and why they should only be given in small quantities as treats . <p> Pumpkin -- Used occasionally , this is a beneficial food since pumpkin contains mannitol , a natural deworming compound . We use canned pumpkin puree as a way to get calcium supplements into our tortoises . Each tortoise receives a couple of spoonfuls of canned pumpkin mixed with a heaping spoonful of calcium carbonate once a week as a treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the pumpkins ripen in the fall , purchase a small one for your tortoise . You do n't need to cook it or peel off the rind before giving to your sulcata , but you should remove the seeds beforehand . Cut the pumpkin into small chunks , and give a few to your tortoise . Freeze what you do n't use immediately ; even though the chunks tend to get stringy after being thawed , your tortoise will still love them as an occasional treat , rind and all . <p> I+-+-+P-ve read and feed my sulcatas only carrots and cucumber as far as veggies go . They get one or the other in very small quantities . About 10% of there diet in all . They get a mixture of kale and greens in the morning and then go out side into the flower box to munch on clover , Bermuda , and dandelion when I get home from work . <p> my sister lives in the colorado mountains on a cattle ranch - they 're haying right now ( earlier it was clover , not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit in november and I 'm going to ask her for a short bale of clover - but that 's not on the list .. is it OK for my tort ? 166975 @qwx576975 <h> About Us 166977 @qwx576977

I am thinking mainly of the US water turtles ( RES , painted , soft shell among others ) but of course they would most likely be seen as food ( frogs and toads ) . As for keeping insects with your tortoises I would be concerned about the bugs harming and or eating the tortoises . For example crickets If I remember correctly are not meant to be left in certain lizard enclosures because they eat them or certain body parts . Chameleons and their eyes come to mind . <p> So here would be my concerns 1 ) why do you want to do this I only ask because I am curious 2 ( What type of relationship the other creatures would serve prey , enclosure maintenance , friendship . and 3 ) how would they affect the tortoise in the long run , could they injure the tortoise over time , could they transmit a disease or parasite . <p> See whenever I think of doing something for my tortoise I think mainly of the tortoise not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoise would want . For example when I move in a year or two I was thinking of making a combined RES and box turtle enclosure because I thought it would be neat to have those 2 species together , and I know box turtles love to swim . As I thought it over I realized that the box turtles would need a sloping pond on all 4 sides to be able to get out easily . not a big concern mind you , but as I thought it over I think I will make separate enclosures for them so that I can give the RES the pond they truly deserve and give the box turtles the sloping one they will need . whew sorry to be so long winded <p> Yea I agree with the Captian , I was mainly trying to find a way to add creatures tthat would help keep the cage clean .

Any help would be greatly appreciated . <p> Sorry it took so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet is not the right substrate , we do have spagnum moss as well , the vet actually recommended because they are hatchlings with their egg tooth not to put a lot of substrate in the enclosure because when they are hatchlings they can eat it and get bound up . I 'm not sure this is true , I 'm just beginning this adventure , so I would definitely welcome any advice since you have the experience . <p> I have only had these guys about 3 weeks , I have them separated from the 2 other tortoises I have because they came from a different breeder .

Eventually we will be putting them together in a tortoise table , but for right now we are keeping them separate for quarantining . <p> I am attaching the underside , one has little white spots on the plasteron , the vet said it is n't rot , they said it was from the water . <p> I really hope they are cherryhead redfoots , my son wants the ones that marble and these looked different that the other ones the breeder had , so I 'm hoping we have at least 1 out of this group but knowing my luck we prolly have the regular ones . <p> Any help would be greatly appreciated . I have been reading a lot and it 's all good information and I want to learn . The vet said well they are n't dead yet , that was n't very comforting .

Horsefields are master manipulators .

They do not need and more importantly want a friend . The bigger ones have come into their own and instincts kicked in . They have to share food and space and realize those are commodities . You can use cinder blocks or 2x4 's to split the garden into individual areas for them . Indoors they 'll need their own set-ups because the only other option if kept together is one or more will seriously injure or kill the other . They are solitary animals is all .

@@58539916 @7539916/ 166978 @qwx576978 <h> Hello from Buffalo , NY USA . <p> My name is Thomas Lamar , but you can call me Tom . I am quite new to the tortoise keeping hobby . <p> In mid-May , I purchased a hatchling baby Leopard Tortoise from a reptile expo in my city . He was the cutest little thing , but I immediately realized something was n't right . He rarely opened his eyes , his eyes appeared puffy , and his appetite was very much lower than to be expected . I got him to the vet a couple days later , and received that sad news that he had an URI , and would need to be on injectible antibiotics for a couple weeks . He was only about 2 inches long , and his plastron and shell were spongy . The vet told me that he may make it , he may not , and all I can do is try . I was also informed he was actually too small to be sold legally in my state , as he was under 4 inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I had named him ) had an amazing response to the medication . His eye puffiness subsided , he had his eyes open all the time , and he started eating . His favorites were grass from my lawn , clover , dandelion leaves , yellow squash , sweet potato . I was thrilled . <p> Sadly , about 1.5 weeks after I finished the antibiotics , I noticed Wilson was declining again . I still had eye ointment from the last visit , so I began using that , and called the vet for another appointment . I got another 10 day course of antibiotics , but by now Wilson had no eaten in days , I had been force feeding baby food with a syringe daily , and his shell and plastron were the most fragile they had ever been . I had the vet give the first injection to get him started again as soon as possible , and was to give the next injection 3 days later . Unfortunately , on the morning of that next injection , I found my poor little Wilson deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to nurse him basically since I got him had created a bond , and not having that routine these past few days has really felt odd . I purchased Wilson with the intention to have a lifelong companion , not just for one month . <p> So , I am thinking I want to give another leopard tortoise a go . I shamelessly admit that I joined after much reading trying to look for tips on healing Wilson , and today I discovered an " adoption " section of this site , so I joined . After hundreds of dollars in vet bills , I am not really in a spot to purchase another tortoise , especially one that is older , more established , and pricier than a hatchling . However if somebody has a slightly older ( 1-4 years or something ) , already established young leopard tortoise that is less fragile that they are looking to rehome , I would be all for it . In the meantime , I can browse the forums , talk to those much more experienced than I , and gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life it deserves . I wish it would have been Wilson , but hind sight is 20/20 . <p> It sounds like your Wilson was doomed from the time he hatched . Hopefully , you can replace him with a healthy , loved individual from a member here . I also have gotten many animals from Craigslist . But it included two that were really i 'll .

@@58539918 @7539918/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> A decline of species abundance in hunted forest within 0-40 km from hunter access points . ( Radboud University/Joeri Borst ) Hunting is a major threat to wildlife particularly in tropical regions , but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced declines of animal numbers was lacking so far . A study published in Science on April 14 fills this gap . An international team of ecologists and environmental scientists found that bird and mammal populations were reduced within 7 and 40 km of hunters ' access points , such as roads and settlements . <p> Within these impact zones , mammal populations declined on average by 83% and bird populations by 58% . Additionally , the team found that commercial hunting had a higher impact than hunting for family food , and that hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded . The impact of hunting was found to be larger than the team expected . ' Thanks to this study , we estimate that only 17 percent of the original mammal abundance and 42 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The researchers synthesised 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics of Central and South America , Africa and Asia . The study was led by Ana Ben+tez-L+pez , who works at the department of Environmental Science at Radboud University in Nijmegen , the Netherlands . She cooperated with researchers from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency ( PBL ) , the universities of Wageningen and Utrecht in the Netherlands and a colleague from the School of Life Sciences , University of Sussex . <p> Higher hunting pressure around villages and roads <p> ' There are several drivers of animal decline in tropical landscapes : habitat destruction , overhunting , fragmentation etcetera . While deforestation and habitat loss can be monitored using remote sensing , hunting can only be tracked on the ground . We wanted to find a systematic and consistent way to estimate the impact of hunting across the tropics . As a starting point , we used the hypothesis that humans gather resources in a circle around their village and in the proximity of roads . As such , hunting pressure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From there the densities of species increase up to a distance where no effect of hunting is observed . We called this species depletion distances which we quantified in our analysis . This allowed us to map hunting-induced declines across the tropics for the first time , ' Ben+tez-L+pez explains . <p> Not only the big cuddly species <p> The main novelty of the current study is that it combined the evidence across many local studies , thus for the first time providing an overarching picture of the magnitude of the impact across a large number of species . The study takes all animals into account -- not only the big cuddly species , but birds and rodents as well . Ben+tez-L+pez explains the difference in impact between birds and mammals : ' Mammals are more sought after because they 're bigger and provide more food . They are worth a longer trip . The bigger the mammal , the further a hunter would walk to catch it . ' With increasing wild meat demand for rural and urban supply , hunters have harvested the larger species almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel further distances to hunt .

It is 20x15 area with 10 foot ceiling , three foot of the walls are concrete with heavy duty wire screen from the concrete up to wood rafters and same wire screen on roof . The screen is covered in greenery but does let in light and some rain ( rain at times ) The area is 20x15 and it has two rooms with a door between i would take door off and make ramp to go between rooms . Any ideas and advice is welcome .

She told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i 'm nervous about him living outside but i do n't  think its good to be living the way he is ? ? <p> Living outside is where one of that age should be , it 's natural . Sleeping with a towel wrapped around him and on a heat pad is not only bad but very unnatural . As long as you provide lots of shade spots and water he should be fine . If you live where it gets really hot , like AZ and 100+ temps day after day , a misting system or a sprinkler will help cool things down . Even here in Chicago , I have a misting system for those really hot days , like today and probably tomorrow . <p> Next thing is what size tortoise ? At 5 years old they can be a half pound or 50 pounds depending on several factors . <p> Third thing is the housing . Are you talking about some sort of outdoor barn ? We need to see pics . <p> What they need is a large open area when 're they can walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shady areas and a shallow water bowl sunk into the ground that is the right size for your tortoise .

Kona , we named him/her , is 4 years old and we are currently having a suitable home made before we bring him/her home . Can you tell me what types of fruit and veggies to feed Kona , how often and how much ? Also , any other tips would be greatly appreciated . <p> Hello and Welcome . Beside the grazing that Aldabramans tortoises do , he feeds orchard and alfalfa hay , optunia cactus pads and treats of bell peppers , water melon and pumpkin . He also feeds Mazuri . I do n't know how often he does the treats or Mazuri . Where are you located , would help to know what you have available . <p> Congrats on Kona ! Aldabraman is the best resource , but ( no offense ) many folks are great resources and info on Aldabra care is readily available . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of diet - hay and more hay , with grazing available , supplemented with fresh stuff . <p> Personally I 've never known really how much Mazuri to feed . I think it 's a pretty good product , especially the new stuff , and especially in my climate ( Minnesota ) . l , so I supplement with it . <p> Mine just turned 4 last month , got him/her at 1 year and 1 pound . Would you share the size and weight of yours ? <p> I only give fruit as an occasional treat . Aldabran tortoises are grazers , eating grass , weeds and leaves . My Aldabran pasture consists of Bermuda grass , clover , winter weeds , dichondra and a bit of fescue . The more you ' feed ' them , the less they will graze . I give my Aldabran tortoises a big serving of Mazuri Tortoise Diet once a week . <p> Let 's see : in order , we feed ours Timothy hay , hibiscus , &amp; pretty much any weeds . Mazuri twice a week , &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mango tree &amp; mountain apple trees are dropping . About once a month , I buy each one a head of cabbage or lettuce , &amp; let them chow down on junk food . <p> Diana 's husband here . Thank you all for your comments and feedback . We 're trying to do the best for Kona and thank you all for your comments . Thought I 'd ask another questions since we 're newbies with the Aldabra . Kona is n't home yet , we 're getting ready to welcome him/her so we 're doing our best to make sure he/she is safe and happy . One thing of concern are the rocks in the backyard . We 're not sure if this is a danger for a 4yr old Aldabra like Kona . I 've tried to include the photo of the rocks we 're concerned with . We were told Kona could eat them . I was n't sure if that 's true or not but thought I 'd ask fellow owners and enthusiasts . Are these rocks dangerous ? Could Kona indeed swallow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it were me , I would be worried about them and would remove them or if that ca n't happen , I would try to cover them . Hopefully @ALDABRAMAN or @Yvonne G has had some experience with rocks and aldabras . <p> Well , rocks &amp; concrete wo n't hurt him , but they 're sure not something that he should be on very often . He 'll graze on the grass , &amp; so will prefer that area , but I assume you 'll have him outside in some type of protective enclosure , right ? Maybe you can tell us a bit about that . <p> If you could block it , that would probably be the easiest and less pricey . Depending on his size , you might get away with a small decorative style fencing that you can still see thru to the stone/garden areas , while keeping him off of it . I 'm thinking about the black metal type stuff they sell at Menards . I use it for my leopards . It 's easy to put up yourself and quite sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger then something more steady might be needed . <p> It would be a shame to have to fence it off , as the more exercise big tortoises get the less health problems may occur . Aldabran tortoises that do n't walk enough could have constipation problems or develop leg problems . <p> I would just keep an eye on him when you first get him to make sure he does n't try to eat the stones . If he DOES show an interest in them , I 'd hire a high school kid to dig them out . <p> Diet should consist of mainly grass , weeds , leafs and cactus . I have seen young tortoises eat rocks and shells causing internal blockages and perforations resulting in death . As mentioned , aldabras need as much space as possible to afford them ample room for high exercise levels . <p> I only give fruit as an occasional treat .

We 're trying to make sure we can make this the best home possible . The yard is much bigger than the photo I uploaded . We have more grass that extends past the photo shown . However our main concern is the rocks and it looks like we 'll be figuring out what to do with them , replace with sand or grass . ( Sounds like grass is what they prefer ) <p> You mentioned his shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should be concerned about ? Or is that something we can correct by getting him out of his current home as soon as possible ? Too big for his age ? Again , indicative of an underlying condition ? <p> I 've seen a few photos that you 've uploaded where your heard is eating . We 'll definitely try to incorporate some of what you 've shown and mentioned . Less fruit and commercial supplements . <p> Thank you again for letting us pick your brain .

While we usually associate carrots with the color orange , carrots can actually be found in a host of other colors including white , yellow , red , or purple . In fact , purple , yellow and red carrots were the only color varieties of carrots to be cultivated before the 15th or 16th century .

The cedar I bought is not the same as the closet liner ( red ) . Does that matter ? It was pricey and I am almost complete with the construction of the outdoor pen . Could I line the inside of the pen with something to cover the cedar that would be relatively inexpensive ? I will use something else for the indoor pen . <p> My mother had seven turtles in New Mexico and several years ago gave four to another " turtle " person . She kept a Carolina turtle she had for about 30 years , a baby that she discovered among her turtles and a baby her best friend gave her from her turtle group . The babies are maybe 2-3 years old . I think she had some desert turtles , not sure what the babies are . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would care for her turtles . My step brother is transporting them to me here in Pennsylvania and thought I would examine them more closely when they get here to determine exactly what they are . <p> Hopefully , they are Carolinian or Eastern Box Turtles , and not Desert Tortoises or related species , since there are pretty strong federal laws about such things . For that matter , I think there are laws about Box Turtles in Pennsylvania as well , but I am not sure about either of those . <p> Using cedar is not recommended , but there is also very little solid proof it will cause problems when used for the outer walls outside . As far as I know , we can not point at a study or case history and say this was because of cedar walls . <p> It sounds like you may be reluctant to take the advice of seasoned keepers on this , and I can understand- especially since we can not say that it absolutely is dangerous for the tortoises and turtles . <p> I would suggest that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than other species might be , but Desert Tortoises are so finicky to things like this that I would not use it for them .

Eastern Cedar is also known as white or aromatic cedar . Both contain oils which are said to insect resistant ( although I 've seen otherwise ) .

@@58539942 @7539942/ 166978 @qwx576978 <p> There is really no harm in feeding a healthy Greek tortoise ( or other tortoises ) a small bit of fruit once in awhile . But fruit in general should not be a regular part of the diet of temperate and arid climate species . Most fruits are high in sugars and acids and not something that most tortoise species digestive systems are evolved to handle in large quantities . While many fruits do contain valuable levels of vitamins and minerals , so do many vegetables and other food sources that are easy to digest . Fruit should definitely not be fed to newly acquired wild caught tortoises or tortoises that are sick or recently recovered whose digestive systems may be weakened by stress or medications . <p> I think that we sometimes err in not offering fruit at all to the truly herbivorous tortoises . Fruits contain a lot of nutrients that are not available in herbs ... but they are also high in sugar , which is not ideal for us . <p> On the other hand , remember that ' fruit ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edible plant part with seeds in it .
