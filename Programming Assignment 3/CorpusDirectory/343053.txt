Each lesson consists of a sheet of questions for discussion . In my groups , we generally start with a brief prayer after which we read the scripture verses for the day 's lesson . Personally I prefer the scripture be read by one person from a modern translation ( NIV , NLT , Holman , etc ) rather than the more traditional " each person read two or three verses in turn . " We then spend the rest of our time discussing and " answering " the questions . There are often no " right " answers and the questions are primarily used as a springboard for discussion .

@@58355275 @7355275/ <p> The parables of Jesus embody much of his fundamental teaching . They are quite simple , memorable stories , often with humble imagery , each with a single message . Jesus , for example , likened the Kingdom of God to yeast ( an image usually meant as corruption ) or a mustard seed . Like his aphorisms , Jesus parables were often surprising and paradoxical . The parable of the good Samaritan , for example , turned expectations on their head with the despised Samaritan proving to be the wounded mans neighbor . The parables were simple and memorable enough to survive in an oral tradition before being written down years after Jesus death . Most Bible scholars say that Jesus parables appear only in the three synoptic gospels ( Matthew , Mark , and Luke ) . However , if we broaden our view a bit , it seems that Jesus three-part story about the sheep , gate , and shepherd in John 10 can also be considered a parable especially as it chronologically falls right after the related parable of the lost sheep in Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have used comes from the very excellent NIV Narrated Bible in Chronological Order ( hardcover ) and Daily Bible in Chronological Order ( paperback ) by Dr. F. LaGard Smith of Pepperdine University , published by Harvest House . There is another list of the parables in chronological order floating around on the web , but it lists only 35 parables and does not cite a source for the chronology.The chronology is quite a lesson by itself . You can see that the first group of parables focuses on the fact that there 's a new story being told , that its not to be hidden , and it serves as a foundation for what 's coming next . We then have the very important Parables #12 ( sower and four types of soil ) and #13 ( weeds among good plants ) . This is followed by a group of " Kingdom of Heaven " parables ( growing seed , yeast , valuable pearl , etc . ) . Now that the foundation has been built , Jesus gets into the behavior parableshow he would have you act as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tenant . He then moves into using your talents well , remaining watchful , and finally into judgement . Basically its the progression of a Christian life .

Also , print out the entire list of parables and give everyone in your group a copy that they can refer to as your study progresses . I 've found with my groups that each lesson or discussion takes about 45 minutes to go through .

@@58355277 @7355277/ <p> The commands of Jesus embody much of his fundamental teaching and should be taken seriously . Some of them are relatively easy to apply ( rejoice , keep your word , pray in faith ) , others are more difficult ( repent , choose the narrow way , be born again ) and some seem next to impossible ( love your enemies , judge not , and be perfect ) . We like to read Scripture about how God loves us and may be tempted to think that we really do n't have to obey all these commands , that Jesus still loves us , and his grace will cover all . That is all well and good , but as we look at his commands , we see that he emphasized , " if you love me , you will obey my commands " ( John 14:15 ) and , conversely , " obey my commands and the Father and I will love you " ( John 14:21 , 23 ) .

" To my eye , these longer lists tend to have a lot of duplication or commands that are very nearly the same ( " Believe in Me " and " Believe in Him who God sent " seem to me to be the same but McConnell lists them as separate commands ) . More recent lists tend to home in on 50 commands , but not necessarily the same 50 . Bill McGinnis published 50 commands in what he calls the " Complete List of the Commands of Christ .

On the other hand you may feel that some of the modern thought-for-thought and paraphrase translations like The Message are almost too free and stray too far from the original text . You may also realize after reading these translations that sometimes you need the help of footnotes , a study Bible , or a commentary to really understand a passage . <p> Changes in Bible Translations Over Time Exodus 4:24-26 <p> And it came to pass by the way in the inn , that the Lord met him and sought to kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , " Surely a bloody husband art thou to me . " So he let him go : then she said , " A bloody husband thou art , because of the circumcision . " ( KJV ) <p> At a lodging place on the way , the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him . But Zipporah took a flint knife , cut off her son 's foreskin and touched Moses ' feet with it . " Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me , " she said . So the Lord left him alone . ( At that time she said " bridegroom of blood , " referring to the circumcision . ) ( NIV ) <p> As Moses and his family were traveling along and stopped for the night , Jehovah appeared to Moses and threatened to kill him . Then Zipporah , his wife , took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her young son 's penis , and threw it against Moses ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've turned out to be ! " Then God let him alone . ( LB ) <p> One night while Moses was in camp , The Lord was about to kill him . But Zipporah circumcised her son with a flint knife . She touched his legs with the skin she had cut off and said , " My dear son , this blood will protect you . " So the Lord did not harm Moses . Then Zipporah said , " Yes , my dear , you are safe because of this circumcision . " ( CEV ) <p> Explanation ( from a Study Bible ) : God was about to kill Moses because Moses had not circumcised his son as required by Jewish law . As he had spent most of his life in Pharaoh 's palace and had married Zipporah , a Midianite , they were probably not familiar with God 's laws . But Moses could not serve as a deliverer of God 's people if he did not obey God 's laws . Under Old Testament law , failing to circumcise your son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zipporah was probably the one who influenced Moses not to circumcise their son , so she was required to do it to save both her husband and son ; thus her pointed comment to Moses . <p> Changes in Bible Translations Over Time Acts 13:35-39 <p> Wherefore he saith also in another psalm , Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption . For David , after he had served his own generation by the will of God , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption . Be it known unto you , therefore , men and brethern , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins ; and by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not have been justified by the law of Moses . ( KJV ) <p> So it is stated elsewhere , " You will not let your Holy One see decay . " For when David had served God 's purpose in his own generation , he fell asleep ; he was buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay . Therefore , my brothers , I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you . Through him , everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses . ( NIV ) <p> And in another psalm it says , " God will never let the body of his Holy One decay . " When David was alive , he obeyed God . Then , after he died , he was buried in the family grave , and his body decayed . But God raised Jesus from the dead , and his body did not decay . My friends , the message is that Jesus can forgive your sins ! The Law of Moses could not set you free from all your sins . But everyone who has faith in Jesus is set free . ( CEV ) <p> So also the psalmist 's prayer : " You 'll never let your Holy One see death 's rot and decay . " David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for him , has been in the grave , dust and ashes , a long time now . But the One God raised upno dust and ashes for him ! I want you to know , my very dear friends , this it is on account of this resurrected Jesus that the forgiveness of your sins can be promised . He accomplishes , in those who believe , everything that the Law of Moses could never make good on . But everyone who believes in this raised-up Jesus is declared good and right and whole before God . ( The Message ) <p> In all labor there is profit . But the talk of lips tendeth only penury . He that laboreth laboreth for himself ; for his mouth craveth it of him . He that is first in his own cause seemeth just ; but his neighbor cometh and searcheth him .

( NASB ) <p> All hard work brings a profit , But mere talk leads only to poverty . The laborer 's appetite works for him , His hunger drives him on . The first to present his case seems right , Till another comes forward and questions him . ( NIV ) <p> Work brings profit ; talk brings poverty ! Hunger is goodif it makes you work to satisfy it ! Any story sounds true until someone tells the other side and sets the record straight ! ( LB ) <p> Hard work is worthwhile , But empty talk will make you poor . The hungrier you are , the harder you work . You may think you have won your case in court , Until your opponent speaks . ( CEV ) <p> Hard work always pays off , Mere talk puts no bread on the table . Appetite is an incentive to work ; Hunger makes you work all the harder .

Printing in English was not out of conviction , but of necessity in response to the availability of the Geneva Bible , with its strongly Protestant notes . In some ways this Roman Catholic translation of the New Testament is parallel to the Protestant Geneva Bible , for both of them were produced by religious refugees who carried their faith and work abroad . Since the English Protestants used their vernacular translations , not only as the foundation of their own faith but as siege artillery in the assault on Rome , a Catholic translation became more and more necessary in order that the faithful could answer , text for text , against " the intolerable ignorance and importunity of the heretics of this time . " This first Roman Catholic translation was rendered into English from the Latin Vulgate by Gregory Martin , under the supervision of William Allen ( later Cardinal Allen ) and of Richard Bristow . According to the Douay Diaries , Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 1582 . The translation adheres very closely to the Latin , though it shows traces of careful comparison with the Greek . But its groundwork was practically supplied by the existing English versions , from which Martin did not hesitate to borrow freely . In particular there are many striking resemblances between Martins renderings and those in Coverdales diglot of 1538 . Further , by a principle first enunciated by Stephen Gardiner , almost the last Roman Catholic Bishop of Winchester , and Marys chancellor , technical words were transliterated rather than translated .

Translation variations are evident in the side-by-side comparison . The intent of this edition was to be " A Confutation " of the Catholic work by the Protestant theologian William Fulke , D.D . Ironically , its publication secured for the Rheims translation a publicity which it would not have otherwise obtained in England .

The New Testament portion was published in Reims , France , in 1582 , in one volume with extensive commentary and notes . The Old Testament portion was published in two volumes thirty years later by the University of Douai . The first volume , covering Genesis through Job , was published in 1609 ; the second , covering Psalms to 2 Machabees plus the apocrypha of the Vulgate was published in 1610 .

" This was reiterated in 1713 when Pope Clement XI in his bull , Unigenitus , wrote that " we strictly forbid them the laity to have the books of the Old and New Testament in the vulgar common tongue . " So it is clear that this Bible was printed for the church ( priests and bishops ) and not the laity . Indeed , for 115 years after this date ( until 1750 ) , not a single edition of the Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible was printed .

Walton was aided by at least eight collaborators , but however much he was indebted to them , the Polyglot Bible is a great monument to Waltons industry and capacity for directing a vast undertaking .

The center column contains the same verses from the " original " Greek and next to that is a translation of the Greek into Latin .

Johann Ulrich Kraus ( also Krauss , Krau , 16551719 ) was an early German illustrator , engraver and publisher in Augsburg . He was a student of Melchior Knsel ( 1626- ca.1683 ) , who was in turn a student of MatthSus Merian the Elder . Kraus became a partner in the Augsburg publishing company of Melchior Knsel , whose daughter Johanna Sibylla he married in 1685 . He was one of the most successful and respected illustrators of his generation in Augsburg . In 1687 Kraus published his first work : a reproduction of the Tapisseries du roy , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etched by his wife Johanna , who had also been trained by her father .

This version , printed in 1705 , is one of two editions printed in Bamberg in the 18th century .

When Joannes was 26 years old , he had an unusual religious experience or vision that 1 ) he would live a robust life and 2 ) he was a Baptist . These festive and religious feelings were later reflected in his poetry . From 1677 he began to concentrate on etchings and engravings , and he made his name as ingenious etcher in 1680 with 24 illustrations from a popular history book about the Dutch wars . Luiken is also known for a folio of moralistic prints as well as many etchings about the suffering of Christian Martyrs called Religious Persecutions . Joris-Karl Huysmans fictional anti-hero Jean Des Esseintes , a reclusive decadent Parisian , described them as " appalling engravings containing all the tortures that the madness of religion could devise .

But where is it originally from ? We do n't  know . One intriguing possibility is a KJV Bible printed by John Baskett , Oxford in 1716 . It contained more than 60 neo-classical engravings by eminent artists like James Thornhill , Michael van der Gucht , and Claude Du Bosc . Along with the NT volume printed in 1717 , it could have been one of the highlights of Basketts career . Instead so many printing mistakes were made that people referred to his Bible as a Baskett-ful of errors . One of the most famous misprints occurred in the page heading in Luke 20:9 , where The Parable of the Vineyard became The Parable of the Vinegar , hence the nickname of " Vinegar Bible . " ( Herbert 939 ) Before 1750 the illustrations in most English Bibles came from separately published suites of designs by independent engravers and were added to the plain texts of the Bible by the bookseller or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio . The seller ( Doyle Flowers of HIS Books ) says this page is a reprint of an earlier one from late 1600s in which case , it might have come from one of the many KJV Bibles printed by " the assigns of Bill and Barker , London " or " The Theater , Oxford .

Hand written in Amharic in Ge'ez script on vellum. 5.7 " x 5.8 " ( $14.00 ) Geez language is one of the Semitic languages spoken in Ethiopia in the past ; and probably originated from two sources : The Sabaean language originated in Southern Yemen few centuries B.C ; and represents an old Arabic Semitic language spoken by the famous biblical Queen of Sheba . It was also known as Himyarite language . The second source was from Egypt during the Hyksos ruling . The Hyksos were Semitic tribes that invaded old Egypt and ruled for 400 years . When they were expelled out of Egypt they fled to Nuba , Ethiopia , and Canaan . The Christian Kingdom of Aksum ( old Ethiopia ) had occupied Yemen in the early centuries A.D. The Geez language is a combination of the two ; the Semitic and the old Ethiopian languages . It vanished with time and nowadays is only used in biblical and Christian Orthodox schools in old Ethiopia . Leaf is from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf or goat skin with bold black and red ink .

Leaf , c. 1750 Psalis and Doxologies manuscript for the Coptic Year . Egypt . Text handwritten in Coptic . Undated but probably 250+ years old . 6.5 " x 9.1 " ( $20.00 ) The psalis ( Coptic : " praise , laudation " ) are metrical hymns recited , chanted or sung before the Odes and Theotokia ( hymn to Mary ) . The Coptic psalis originated prior to the 9th century and are used to the present day . A doxology is a short hymn of praise to God in various forms of Christian worship , often added to the end of canticles , psalms , and hymns . Coptic music consists mainly of chanted hymns in rhythm with instruments such as cymbals and the triangle . Leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Isaiah 28:13 - 30:13 . Printed by Christoph Saur , Germantown , Pennsylvania . 225 x 156 , 7.9 " x 9.8 " ( $15.00 ) Each of the three printings of Martin Luthers German Bible by Christoph Saur and his son was a first . The first printing of 1,200 copies in 1743 was the first European-language Bible printed in America because the British insisted that English Bibles be imported from the mother country . ( The first Bible of any kind printed in America was in an Algonquin dialect . ) It took nearly 20 years for the first printing of Saurs Bible to sell out . The second printing in 1763 by Christophs son , also named Christoph , was the first Bible printed on American-made paper . The third printing in 1776 was the first Bible printed with American-made type . Legends ( generally discredited today ) have it that sheets from this third printing were ready for the binder when British soldiers invaded Germantown and used the pages as bedding for their horses and to make cartridges for their guns , thus giving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also that Christophs daughter , Catherine , managed to save only ten copies for her family . In truth , unbound sets of sheets of this printing were sold at public auction in 1778 and were mostly bound up and sold to the public in the subsequent few years . Because he was a pacifist , Christoph Saur refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new state of Pennsylvania . He was arrested and tried , and his property , including his printing shop , was seized and sold at auction .

( plus 3 additional pages from Deuteronomy ) Printed by Isaac Collins , Trenton , NJ. 246 x 175 , 8.5 " x 10.5 " ( $12.50 each page ) Bible printing began in Trenton in 1788 , when Isaac Collins , a Quaker , published a New Testament . In 1789 he issued a proposal to publish the whole Bible if he received 3,000 subscriptions . The undertaking was endorsed by the governor , William Livingston , as well as the Quaker , Presbyterian , Episcopal , and Baptist churches . It was eventually published in 1791 in an edition of 5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Bible had an address " To The Reader " by the Rev. Dr. Witherspoon , which was reprinted in many later American Bibles . Collins took unusual care to prevent printer 's mistakes with committees appointed to correct the proofs . In addition , the proofs were read 11 times by Collins ' children . It is said that only two errors were ever found after publicationone a broken letter , the other a punctuation mark . This accurate text served as a standard of correctness for many later printers .

He made every effort to insure accuracy of the Biblical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text carefully examined by several clergymen and others . Thomas was also a famous painter and patriot , publisher of Massachusetts Spy . During the war , he was forced to move from Boston to Worcester . The New Testament published by Robert Aitken in Philadelphia in 1777 and entire Bible in 1782 were the first Bibles printed in America . Two more were printed in Philadelphia in 1790 by Carey , Stewart &amp; Co . ( Catholic ) and William Young ( KJV ) , which , along with a quarto edition by Isaac Collins in Trenton , New Jersey in 1791 and both folio and quarto-size Bibles by Isaiah Thomas really got Bible publishing in America off the ground . Bible is in two volumes , folio size , printed in Roman 12-point type , double columns , 60 lines , with side scripture references in small 7-pt type . Herbert 1356 Leaf , 1801 KJV Bible , Ezekiel 17:24 - 20:13 , page 623-24 . Printed for William Durrell. by George F. Hopkins , New York . 314 x 202 , 9.4 " x 13.8 " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Massachusetts colony in 1638 , the earliest American edition of the Bible in English was printed by Robert Aitken in Philadelphia in 1782 . Before this several proposals had been made among the fifty-odd American printing shops to print a native edition of the Bible , in spite of exclusive patents granted to British printers by the Crown . None succeeded , the plans failing to interest sufficient subscribers or to secure an adequate supply of paper and type for the project . By the time this large folio version for Durrell , a paper merchant , appeared in New York , improvements in printing and paper making had finally made native production possible , though most Bibles printed in America for decades to come would be " pocket sized " or small quarto format . Folio size printed in 12-pt Roman type , double columns , 65 lines , side scripture references in tiny 6-pt type .

It is very neatly hand-written in the original Hebrew Language on deer parchment and is approximately 150-250 years old . From Yemen , this type of scroll is prized for the beauty of its soft deer parchment and its beautiful writing . The warm reddish color is due to the original color becoming deeper over the centuries . Scrolls of this age are quite rare and seldom seen in synagogues today . It is a witness to the Yemenite Jewish custom of continuing to preserve the Torah on hand-written scrolls .

Without a title page it is quite impossible to know where a Bible originated or its printing date so all we can say is that this is an attractive page from a quarto-size German Bible . Two columns of finely printed black letter type flank a narrow center column with scripture cross references . Elaborate initial capitals start each chapter . Some are hand-colored in red . Leaf , early 1800 's English pocket Bible , Nehemiah 1:9 - 4:10 . Probably printed by Sir D. Hunter Blair and J. Bruce , Edinburgh . 3.0 " x 5.2 " ( $1.00 ) A Soldiers Pocket Bible was first issued in 1643 to Cromwells army and was put in general use among his soldiers .

@@58355293 @7355293/ <p> NOTE : Answers are provided for only some of the questions . Many questions are primarily to stimulate discussion and there are no right or wrong answers . <p> 1 . What stirs up the jealousy and envy of the administrators and satraps ? How would they describe Daniel ( goodie two shoes , too good to be true , outsider , a threat ) ? <p> Actually , they had many reasons to be envious . First is the natural instinct of human nature to envy other people their success . Daniel was honest , efficient and did a good job . Second , Daniel was a foreigner in their midst who did not belong ( his customs were different , his accent was strange , he had different interests and goals , his skin color was different ) . Strangeness breeds suspicion and suspicion breeds resentment , especially if the one concerned is in a more advantageous position than we are . But Daniel was not just a foreigner , he was a Jewish foreigner ; antisemitism was just as strong then as it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy is that Daniels religion with one Lord God was quite different and somehow more powerful and fulfilling than the local " religion " of worshiping various idols , materials ( gold , silver , and bronze ) , totem poles , and gods . <p> 2 . Have you ever found that when you begin to excel , other people look for ways to hold you back and tear you down ? How should you deal with those who would cheer at your downfall and even try to hasten it ? <p> As Daniel did , conduct your whole life above reproach . Then you will have nothing to hide and your enemies will have a difficult time finding legitimate charges against you . Of course , this will not always save you from attacks and , like Daniel , you will have to rely upon God for protection . But bear in mind , the Lords protection may not be as visible and dramatic as it was in Daniels case . <p> 3 . Why did the king issue his decree ( he was outnumbered , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody would obey , he wanted to be God ) ? <p> The courtiers used the age-old device of flattery to have their way with the king . BY appealing to his pride or vanity , the king signed a law effectively making himself god for 30 days . Even today it is a continuing temptation to the powerful , not only to kings , to assume the prerogatives of God . Probably all five of the " answers " above came into play to some extent or other . <p> 4 . How would you describe Daniels response to the edict ( rebellion , perseverence , faithfulness , disregard , plea for help , courageous , throw down the gauntlet , stupid ) ? <p> Daniel did not toe the line by not praying for 30 days , nor did he play it safe by closing his doors and windows and drawing the shades . He openly acknowledged his faith in God and the more people that knew , the better . The history of the church is full of such examples of men and women who have refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of torture or death . We honor them as martyrs of the faith . <p> 5 . Are there times where a better strategy might be to close the windows , draw the curtains , and pray to God in secret ?

You could not work these miracles , unless God were with you . " <p> We like to think that proclaiming support for God publically and openly is always the best thing to do , but in fact Nicodemus came to Jesus at night .

He could , of course , pardoned Daniel ( as governors and presidents do today ) but apparently felt it was more important to keep the respect of his other advisors . Verse 16 suggests that he may have had some limited faith in the Lord God but he obviously felt that pleasing his own advisors was more important . <p> 10 . Because of the Persian custom of vindication ( an eye for an eye ) , Daniels accusers received the same punishment that they demanded that Daniel receive . Is this supported anyplace in the Bible ? ( Deut 19:21 , Isaiah 3:11 , Jeremiah 21:14 ) What do you think about punishing ( innocent ? ) family members of the accusers ? <p> Remember , were in the Old Testament here and much harsher punishments prevail than after Jesus died on the cross to take away our sins .

By experimenting and trying to get stuff working again , I learned a great deal about radios and electronics . In fact , I learned enough to set up a little after-school business repairing car radios which , in those days , were notoriously unreliable . <p> By the time I was 15 ( 1954 ) , I had saved a few hundred dollars from the business which , in those days , was a princely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oscilloscope but Herb Bushman , a friend of our family , suggested that maybe I should buy a couple of shares of stock . Well , this was a fairly radical idea . My father had all of his meager savings in the bank and in some War Bonds and the only thing he knew about the stock market was that it caused a lot of investors to wind up in the poorhouse during the depression . <p> It just so happened that right around then I had entered a contest sponsored by RCA in which you had to write in 75 words or less why you like RCA service instruments . Lo and behold , I won one of the 5th place prizes , a spanking new vacuum tube voltmeter , that was a whole lot better than the military surplus meter I was using . As a result , I put off the purchase of the oscilloscope and bought some shares of stock . I remember clearly that Herb was very emphatic about not just buying shares of one company , but buying three or four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first $500 : 2 shares of CBS ( because I used CBS Hytron tubes in my business and because CBS had the most popular shows on television , Ed Sullivan and I Love Lucy ) . I also bought 2 shares of Standard Oil Co of NJ ( for $61/share because we used Esso gas ) , 2 shares of Eastman Kodak , and 5 shares of American Sugar Refining . From these first small steps in investing , I learned four important lessons . <p> Lesson 1 : Diversify . Buying just a few shares of four stocks cost more in commissions than had I put all my money in one stock . But had I bought just one , it might well have been the wrong one . As it turned out , five years later , one of those stocks had gained just 9% while another one had nearly doubled . <p> Lesson 2 : Start investing early . Compounding is your best friend . The longer you have your money working for you , the more you will gain . During seven long years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked part time and summers and much of my income went toward college and automobile expenses . Nevertheless , I was able to add $500-600 to my investments each year during college and my two years in the Army .

I think Peter Lynch said it best when he said , " Never invest in an idea you ca n't illustrate with a crayon . " By 1965 , I owned 12 stocks in companies like Ford , Corning Glass , Holiday Inns , IBM , Purex , Koehring , Consolidated Freightways , General Foods , and Citizens Utilities .

This was beginning of the go-go years of conglomerate companies like Gulf &amp; Western , Walter Kidde , and Textron . I signed on with a new stock broker who felt that I was hopelessly out of touch with the market and came up with an aggressive plan to redo my portfolio for the 70 's . So I did a lot of buying and selling just before the horrible bear market on 1969-70 . I watched the value of my new , wonderful portfolio sink by nearly 50% , changed jobs ( nothing to do with the stock market ) , and moved to the Boston area . Again , I signed on with a new stock broker who again had totally different ideas about the movers and shakers of the market , so by the end of 1972 only one of the companies that I held four years earlier was still in my portfolio .

If everyone is talking about hot stocks , like the conglomerates back then , like internet stocks in 2000 , or like nano-technology today , you 're too late . <p> Lesson 5 : Do n't let a market slump change your long-term investment plan . Had I gotten discouraged and quit putting money in the market in 1970 ( and then later in 1974-75 ) I would have missed out on the spectacular gains of the market rebound . <p> Lesson 6 : Do n't check the price of a stock ( or mutual fund ) after you 've sold it . After you 've made a decision , stick with it . Look ahead , not behind ; remember , today is the first day in the rest of your life . The " what-if game " ( What if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) only leads to recriminations and beating yourself up over something you ca n't do anything about . <p> By late 1973 , my portfolio was worth about $46,000 , but I also had three young children who would eventually be heading off to college . And then came the 15-month grinding bear market of 1974 , a new job with AT&amp;T , and a move to New Jersey . All of which certainly did not lead to any spare change in my pockets . But remembering the spectacular recovery of just four years earlier led me to believe that it was worth some serious belt-tightening in order to continue to put some new money into the market . I had opened a college mutual fund for each of my three kids when they were about 7 years old and all of my new money went into these funds so my own portfolio did n't grow much . In fact I put some money from my portfolio into the kids ' funds . However , by the time they were college age , there was enough in their funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years . <p> Lesson 7 : Dollar-averaging ( continuing to invest the same amount of money every month ) really works . The mutual funds I signed on with for the kids required a fixed amount be put in every month ( I do n't think these type of funds are around anymore ) . By sticking with the program , and increasing the amount when I could , I met my goals and , in fact , was able to pay for five years of college for two of my kids who did n't finish up in four . <p> Lesson 8 : Do n't panic . If there was ever a time in my life to panic , 1974 was it . Looking for a new job . Move to Morris County , one of the most expensive areas in the U.S. Stock market down 40% . Committed to starting a personal computing magazine in my spare time . Marriage shaky . My parents retire to Florida and want us to come and visit . Yikes ! <p> The risk of a high fluctuation ( gain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After 5 years , the risk of a major loss is very low , after 10 years , it 's practically zero . <p> In the late 70 's , my life came almost totally unglued . The little personal computing magazine that I had started as a hobby in late ' 74 had 200,000 circulation , a staff of 20 , and was growing like topsy . I had quit my job with AT&amp;T and given up all the big-company benefits to work 16 hours a day at Creative Computing for no salary at all and , of course , no benefits . I was separated from my wife , living in a room adjoining my office , driving a car on its last legs , and pretty messed up . To make matters worse , for almost the next six years I virtually ignored my investments , made some very occasional buys and sells , put in practically no new money , and did n't even do any end-of year rebalancing . <p> I sold Creative Computing to a large publishing company in 1983 , stayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new pastures in late 1985 . It was then also that I took a close look at my stock portfolio and was dismayed with what I found . True , it had grown in value and was worth a little more than twice its value in 1973 . That does n't sound so bad until you consider that the Dow Jones had gone from about 800 to 2400 and the S&amp;P 500 had done even better . So if I had just stuck my money in an index fund , I would have been far better off . <p> Moreover , some of the stocks in my portfolio had decayed into out-and-out dogs that should have been sold years earlier . My broker had made them sound wonderful in 1972 , but they were stocks built on dreams and promises . I was so discouraged that I totally overreacted , sold almost everything , and put 80% of my money in municipal bonds for the next 8 years . Sure , I saved on taxes and it was a totally safe strategy , but I missed out on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a dope ! Sometimes , the lessons you learn are negative ones . This was one of those times . <p> Lesson 9 : Pay attention to what 's going on with your investments . No stock is safe forever . Even the bluest blue chip can turn into a cow chip . The old maxim of " buy and hold forever " does n't work very well in an economy as vibrant as exists in the world today . <p> Lesson 10 : Hold onto your winners and sell your losers . If you would n't buy more of a stock today on which you have a loss , sell it . Do n't wait to " get even . " Chances are there are better ways to invest your money . No well-managed store keeps obsolete goods in inventory ; neither should you keep losers in your investment portfolio . <p> Lesson 12 : Stick to your plan . I was incredibly foolish to abandon my long-term plan because I had let small losses grow into big ones . The market is going to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might not own the best performers , but if you are diversified and stick to your plan , in the long run you 'll make out just fine . <p> After entering data on his investment holdings , sources of income , expenses , goals , risk tolerance , etc. , the Retirement Planning Tool on the Fidelity Investments web site shows the ideal allocation of assetsfor someone about to retire compared with his actual allocation . This is a worthwhile planning tool . <p> During my career in computer magazine publishing , I travelled a great deal to Europe and the Far East . After one trip around the world I decided , almost on a whim , to make investments in ten high-quality foreign companies which I personally knew something about . These companies were in Japan , Hong Kong , Singapore , Germany , France , Sweden , and the UK . As it turned out , these investments did very well and three of them are still in my portfolio . <p> I gradually started getting back on track in the early 90 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started going downhill , and I was left to pay her bills and manage her finances . Obviously , the needs of an older person living on Social Security plus the income from an investment portfolio are far different from a 22-year-old getting out of school or someone in the middle of a work career . In her case , bonds , Treasury notes , and preferred stocks made a lot of sense , so I set out to learn as much as I could about fixed income investments . <p> One thing led to another , and I read practically every book and article on investing written in the past 50 years . I subscribed to eight investment newsletters and totally immersed myself in the field . While I had learned a lot of lessons on my own , I learned a great deal more from reports of academic studies , from the writings of great investment gurus like Ben Graham and John Templeton , and from newsletter editors like Marty Zweig and Dan Sullivan . <p> As a result of all this , I refined my plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit my investment goals , my stage in life , and my tolerance for risk . I diversified still further into bonds ( muni , corporate , and foreign ) , stocks ( doemstic and foreign ) , real estate ( mostly in the form of REITs ) , natural resources ( gold , gas , timber ) , and , of course , cash . <p> Lesson 1 ( Repeated ) : Diversify ! Your asset mix should include not just several stocks , but large and small cap stocks , growth and value stocks , and foreign stocks along with a mix of bonds , short-term investments , real estate , commodities , and perhaps even other things . <p> Lesson 13 : Be realistic about your tolerance for risk . Ask yourself , " How well will I sleep if my investments drop in value by 10% ? By 20% ? By 50% ? " If a big dip is going to get to you , as it did to me , you need to put a higher proportion of your portfolio in bonds , in utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash . <p> Lesson 14 : Get the best investment advice you can--and then think for yourself . Now I 'm not saying not to buy a stock recommended by a stock broker or a magazine article or a tip from a friend , but do n't do so blindly . Do some research on your own . There are scores of web sites with good , solid research data . Use them . <p> Stock comparison tool on the Smart Money web site let 's you compare prices and trading volume of several stocks over varying periods of time . You can also look at earnings , financial figures , earnings per share trends , along with analyst recommendations . <p> You might notice that for the most part I continued to add money to my investments through good times and bad . Over a 50-year period , there were only four times when I sold stocks or bonds to buy something else : once , when I got out of the Army to put a down payment on a house , once for the initial funding of my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishing business , and most recently , to buy a new car . But these are the reasons that you put money in the market in the first place . <p> Lesson 15 : Avoid spending the principal . Set some money aside in a savings or money market account for smaller expenses like furniture , vacations , hobbies , computers , car repairs , and babies . And do n't forget to reinvest the interest and dividends from your stocks and bonds . Mutual funds make this easy becasue reinvestment is automatic ; with individual stocks and bonds you 'll have to do it yourself . Make a mental note to yourself that when your monthly statement shows a cash balance of more than , say , $1000 , to buy some more shares of one of your holdings . <p> Lesson 16 : In investing , you 're not going to be right every time . You 're not going to always be able to buy low and sell high . But remember , the object is not to be right all the time but to make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , investing in good-quality , profitable companies , putting money into the market on a regular basis , selling losers sooner rather than later , and sticking with your winners .

Moreover , in the years that foreign markets outperformed the U.S. , they had much higher gains compared to the years when the U.S. outperformed foreign markets . Only 23% if the world 's 40,000 companies are in the United States . Looked at another way , foreign companies represent 51% of the world 's $38 trillion total market capitalization . It is vital that this be represented in every well-diversified investment portfolio . <p> Some people argue that the impact of international diversification is dimished by an increasing correlation in performance between the U.S. and international markets .

He had a dream which his own wise men were unable to interpret , so he sent for Daniel and told him the dream . 4:1015b He had seen a tree , high , beautiful , and fruitful . The tree ... reached to the heavens and spread out to the ends of all the earth .

However , after twelve months of impenitence on the kings part , the vision came to pass . For seven years he lived like a beast . At the end of that time , he turned to God and acknowledged that He is the Most High ... who lives forever . He was then restored to the glory of his kingdom . <p> 1 . Who wrote this chapter of Daniel ? <p> The first section was written by Nebuchadnezzar and was a letter from the king to all of his subjects throughout the world .

Printed early 1900s ? , 6.5 " x 9.8 " ( $5.35 ) The two Wyclif ( Wycliffe ) Bible translations in middle English were actually done by Lollard ( " mutterer " ) followers of John Wyclif , not by Wyclif himself . Both were translated from the Latin Vulgate . The first in the early 1380s was attributed to Nicholas of Hereford and others . It painstakingly preserved the Latin word order , which sometimes obscured the meaning in English . The second , completed in 1395 by John Purvey ( like this one ) , had a more idiomatic and readable text . Despite Church attempts to burn and destroy them and condemnation by Canterbury Archbishop Arundel in 1408 , about 250 Wyclif Bibles survived into the 1400s . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " original .

Replica , 1454 Papal Indulgence , Latin , Original printed by Johannes Gutenberg , 7.8 " x 10.8 " Indulgences were ( and are ) awarded by the Roman Catholic Church as a remission of sin , earned either by prayer or , especially in the later Middle Ages , through a donation of money . Letters of indulgence took the form of ready-made receipts leaving an empty space for the name of the purchaser , who was to take it to a father confessor as proof of having obtained the right to the forgiveness of sins . Gutenberg printed indulgences at the request of Nicolaus Cusanus , the prominent German cardinal , as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surviving copies are from 1454 and 1455 and are called the " Mainz Indulgences . " Gutenberg printed these letters on vellum , with dimensions varying between 6.2 " x 9.3 " and 7.8 " x 10.8 " . This indulgence ( several versions shown ) printed by Gutenberg in 1455 was used by Paulinus Chappe ( his name is on the top line ) , a Cypriot nobleman and the popes representative , to raise money to defend Cyprus against a Turkish invasion . For the printer , indulgences meant cash , paid for by the Church , much needed for other printing ventures . For the Church it meant a rationalization of an otherwise labor-intensive bureaucratic procedure : thousands of identical letters of indulgence could be required during a single visit to a town . Compared with writing them out by hand , they could now be produced at much reduced cost . Printing provided an efficient solution to a bureaucratic problem .

In the fall of 1454 , Gutenberg exhibited sample pages of his Bible at a Frankfurt trade fair . He reported that he had buyers for all of the 180 copies of the Bible then in production . The text is the revised Latin Vulgate translation produced in the early 1200s at the University of Paris .

In a very short time his invention of mass-quantity printing caused a revolution in the European publishing world . By the end of the 15th century , printing shops operating in some 250 cities and towns across Europe greatly accelerated distribution of the Bible in both Latin and vernacular languages .

Like every manuscript , each manuscript book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most contain a similar collection of texts , prayers and psalms , often with appropriate decorations , for Christian devotion . Books of Hours were usually written in Latin , although there are many entirely or partially written in vernacular European languages , especially Dutch . Thousands were produced in the 1300-1500s and tens of thousands have survived to the present day in libraries and private collections throughout the world . The typical book of hours is an abbreviated form of the breviary which contained the Divine Office recited in monasteries . It was developed for lay people who wished to incorporate elements of monasticism into their devotional life . Reciting the hours typically centered upon the reading of a number of psalms and other prayers every day . Produced in Bruges , the main center of Flemish book production .

" Back to the sources " was the watchword of the humanists as they searched for the true meaning of the Bible . The Italian Lorenzo Valla was the first of the humanists to attempt a correction of the Vulgates Latin based on the Greek original . This leaf is from a Fontiubus ex Graecis edition , " a series of corrected Latin Bibles , which claim for themselvesapparently with justicea superiority above all contemporary editions , " according to Darlow and Moule , vol .

When one hears about a textual variant in the Bible , the reaction should not be " I 've never heard of that before ! " or " That 's not in my King James Version of the Bible ! " but rather the response should be , " What was originally written by the author ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Acts of the Apostles 15:33 , wrote " And after they had stayed there awhile , they were let go in peace from the brethren to those who had sent them . " This is strongly supported by the seventh-century Papyrus #74 , the Greek Codex Sinaiticus , the Greek Codex Alexandrinus , the Greek Codex Vaticanus , the Greek Codex Ephraimi Rescriptus , the Greek Codex Bezae , the Sahidic Coptic , the Bohairic Coptic , and the Latin Vulgate ( as seen here , with the wording " ad eos q miferat illos " or " ad eos qui miserant illos , " meaning " to those who had sent them . " Instead of " to those who had sent them , " later readings have " to the apostles . " According to Bruce M. Metzger in A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament , p. 439 , the later reading " appears to be a deliberate alteration introduced by copyists in order to bring the apostolate into greater prominence .

By definition , an incunabulum ( the singular of " incunabula " ) must be printed from 1455 to 1500 .

We need to put into context the work of Christian scribes during the last 2,000 years . During these centuries scribes developed two kinds of abbreviations in the manuscripts that were copied and re-copied . The first kind of abbreviation was the shortening or abbreviation of very common words , so that it was easier and quicker to write them . These do not concern us here . The second kind of abbreviation was for the words held sacred by Christians . In the Latin tradition , and especially in the Latin Vulgate text , these were called " Nomina Sacra " meaning " Holy Names . " The common examples of Nomina Sacra are Lord , God , Jesus , Christ , Holy Spirit , the Father , and the Son . This leaf has the Nomina Sacra or Holy Name for the word " JAHWEH " or the " LORD " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appears in the abbreviated form " dns " or " dni " ( with a long line above the " n " to indicate it is a sacred abbreviation showing respect for the name ) .

His best known work is the Summa angelica de casibus conscientiae . The Summa is a reference work divided into 659 entries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictionary of moral theology . This particular page focuses on the causes of excommunication . The first edition of the Summa angelica appeared in 1476 , and by 1520 had gone through 31 editions .

This work belongs to the genre known as " cases of conscience " and the field of casuistry . Following the Council of Trent ( 1545-1563 ) , theologians systematically addressed questions regarding personal , social , political , and religious duties , specifically in terms of the relative rights of Church and State . The order of authority was first biblical ( divine ) law , next natural law ( which tended to be poorly defined ) , and finally canon law ( law of man ) .

At this time jurisdiction over Bohemia ( modern Czech Republic ) was hotly contested between Poland and Hungary .

About 600 Complutensian Polyglot Bibles were printed and only about 120 exist today in their complete form .

His life forms an important era in religious history and as long as the English tongue is spoken his memory will be imperishable . " Born around 1494 , Tyndale studied at Oxford and Cambridge , eventually taking holy orders . Deeply convicted that Scripture should be available to everyone , he sought permission to translate the Bible from Bishop Cuthbert Turnstall in London . When the request was denied , Tyndale left England for Europe . Subsidized by a layman friend , Humphrey Monmouth , by August of 1525 , Tyndale and his assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into English . After Tyndale was forced to flee from Cologne , it was published by Peter Schoeffer in Worms in smaller octavo format . By October 1526 copies were being smuggled into England , where , unfortunately , many of them were burned . Only three copies survive . Revised editions were published in 1534 and 1535 . By 1529 , Tyndale had mastered enough Hebrew to produce outstanding translations of the Pentateuch and nine other Old Testament books . These were later published in the Matthew Bible edited by John Rogers . In 1535 , Henry Philips lured Tyndale from safety in Antwerp , Belgium to Vilvoord ( near Brussels ) where he was arrested , imprisoned for nearly two years , tried for heresy , condemned , and on October 6 , 1536 strangled and burned at the stake .

William Tyndale and Myles Coverdale shared a vision of making the scriptures available to ordinary believers concerned that their authority might be undermined in a time when kings and clerics alike opposed translating them into English . John Rogers combined Tyndales and Coverdales textssupplying some translation work of his ownto create the Matthews bible .

It is a composite consisting of Tyndales New Testament of 1535 and as much of the Old Testament as Tyndale had translated before his death ( 14 books : the Pentateuch and Joshua through 2 Chronicles ) . The remaining OT books and the Apocrypha were from Coverdale . In this edition , Rogers made extensive changes to the notes of the original 1537 Matthew Bible .

As a graduate of both Cambridge and Oxford , and a Greek scholar of high repute , Richard Taverner sought to bring more " compression and vividness " to the Biblical text and often substituted a Saxon word for a Latin one . It is this translation that first introduced such words as " parable " and " passover " and other terms still in use . Many marginal notes from the Matthew Bible were omitted and some new comments added . Never officially endorsed by the church , the Taverner Bible had little influence on later revisions and ultimately became more of a curious footnote in history , and a Bible of which very few people are even aware . Printed in 12-pt black letter , double columns , 68 lines per column . References and a few sidenotes also in black letter . Contents of chapters in smaller 9-pt black letter .

It was written in a vigorous , idiomatic German prose . The New Testament was first published in 1522 , but translation of the complete Bible , containing the Old and New Testaments and Apocrypha took 12 more years , and in 1534 was published in a six-part edition . Luther reworked his translation ceaselessly for another 12 years before his death in 1546 . Thanks to the then recently invented printing press , the result was widely disseminated and contributed significantly to the development of todays modern High German language as well as to the Protestant Reformation .

Luther worked on refining the translation up to his death in 1546 , indeed he had worked on the edition that was printed that year . There were 117 original woodcuts included in the 1534 edition issued by the Hans Lufft press in Wittenberg ; even more were in later editions . They reflected the recent trend ( since 1522 ) of including artwork to reinforce the textual message . In the following 40 years Lufft printed more than 100,000 copies of the German Bible as well as most of the other works of Luther .

In 1547 he published his revised Vulgate based on Robert Stephans edition of 1540 . This leaf is most likely from that edition . Among other things , the Council of Trent ( 1546 ) declared the Vulgate to be authentic , meaning " worthy of belief , reliable , credible , truthful , trustworthy , authoritative . " But the Fathers recognized the lack of conformity between the various manuscripts and editions of the Vulgate and therefore decreed that " Sacred Scripture , and especially this well-known Old Vulgate , shall be published as correctly as possible . " Although appointed in 1561 , the commission which was instructed to publish the revision of the Vulgate did nothing for many years so earlier versions such as this one continued in use until 1587 .

It became the first English Bible authorized for public use , as it was distributed to every church , chained to the pulpit " in a convenient place so parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same and read it . " It became known as the Great Bible due to its large page size over 14 inches tall , although quarto-size ones like this one were also printed . It was withdrawn when Mary Tudor became queen 1553 and attempted to reinstate Catholicism in England . It was once again approved in 1559 after the accession of Elizabeth I to the throne .

The Tridentine Calendar is the official liturgy of the Roman Rite as reformed by Pope Pius V. This particular leaf contains the text for the mass celebrated for two or more martyrs .

But Archbishop of Canterbury Matthew Parker wanted a new translation more suitable for reading aloud in church . So in 1566 he assigned sections of the Great Bible to teams of revisers , most of them bishops . The result was a conservative and dignified translation that avoided harsh comments on the Roman Catholic Church . It went through 20 editions in 42 years and served as the official basis of the King James Version .

Whittinghams NT is based on Tyndales , compared with the Great Bible , and also influenced by Bezas Latin translation . The OT is based mainly on the Great Bible . The influence of Olivetans French Bible is also evident in that the " Arguments " to Job and the Psalms are translated almost word for word from the French edition of 1559 .

Notes from these lectures were first published in Latin in 1534 followed by a revised version in 1538 . Just over 30 years later , in 1575 , the first English edition was published , the translation being based on the second Latin edition .

He called it " my own Epistle , to which I have plighted my troth . It is my Katie von Bora . " He found in it a source of strength for his own faith and life , and an armory of weapons for his reforming work . He had twice expounded it previously : in 1519 , when he largely depended on St. Jerome and Erasmus for his exegesis , and in 1523 , when he departed from them both . In the present work he frequently expresses his dissent from St. Jerome , and occasionally takes issue with Erasmus . Luther came to think very little of his earlier commentaries and in 1531 he seems to have decided to lecture again on the Epistle because he felt that the centrality of the doctrine of justification had been somewhat obscured during the controversies of the preceding years .

Though never officially adopted , the Geneva version was the standard English translation for three generations , familiar to Shakespeare , Bunyan , and the soldiers of the Civil War .

@@58355320 @7355320/ <h> HergT Tintin PhilatelyStamps , Souvenir Sheets and Covers <p> By David H. Ahl <p> Being a major fan of Tintin since the books were first available in English in the mid 70 's and also being a stamp collector , I perked up when Belgium issued a Tintin stamp in 1979 . But as with so many subjects , it was only one stamp and certainly not the basis for any kind of topical collection like cats , the Olympics , space exploration , Amelia Earhart , or auto racing , which are other interests of mine . Tintin was a comic character created by HergT , but , wait , we need a little background . <p> Brief Background Georges Prosper Remi was born into a middle-class family in Etterbeek , Brussels on May 22 , 1907 . As a youngster , he was keenly interested in Scouting , something that would prove highly influential on his later work . He initially produced illustrations for the Belgian Le Boy-Scout magazine , including an illustrated story , Les Aventures de Totor , C.P. des Hannetons ( The Adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or Maybugs ( the more common translation ) . In1927 he began working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le XXe SiFcle , where he adopted the pen name " HergT , " based upon the French pronunciation of " RG , " his initials reversed . After Totor came a number of short-lived characters such as Tim the Squirrel , Tom and Millie ( Tim had morphed into a bear cub named Tom ) , Fred and Mile , Mr. Mops , Popol and Virginie , and Dropsy . But by far his best-known character was Tintin , the star of a series of 24 book-length adventures ( one uncompleted ) , which he wrote and illustrated from 1929 until his death in 1983 . He also created two other well-known comic book series , Quick &amp; Flupke ( 1930-1940 ) and Jo , Zette and Jocko ( 1936-1957 ) . Two pages of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets first appeared on January 10 , 1929 in black and white on the pages of Le Petit VingtiFm e a weekly youth supplement to Le VingtiFme SiFcle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran until May 8 , 1930 , chronicled the adventures of a young reporter named Tintin and his pet fox terrier Snowy ( Milou ) as they journeyed through the Soviet Union . A year later in January 1930 , Quick &amp; Flupke , two street urchins from Brussels , made their debut in what was to become a series of 310 self-contained two-page comic strips ( called " gags " in Europe ) . The Quick &amp; Flupke strips were especially clever because many of them had both a visual gag and a verbal one . This makes them somewhat difficult to translate into other languages when the verbal gag involves a pun or rhyming words in French . ( I should know , having translated 48 of these strips ) . HergT says , " I had to abandon these rascals ( in 1936 ) because they were causing me a lot of worry as I became increasingly occupied with Tintin . " Two pages of Tintin continued to appear every Thursday until May 1940 , when the Germans invaded Belgium . As the war progressed , paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four-frame strip , which meant that HergT had to introduce more frequent gags and faster-paced action . Also , in order to avoid controversy , the focus of the adventures had to be moved away from current affairs . In 1943 HergT met Edgar P. Jacobs , another comic artist , whom he hired to help update , revise , and redraw the early Tintin albums . Tintin was always credited as simply " by HergT , " without mention of Edgar Jacobs , Bob de Moor , or any of HergT 's other assistants . As Jacobs ' contribution to the production of the strip increased , he asked for a joint credit , but HergT refused . Nevertheless , they continued to collaborate until 1946 , when Jacobs left to produce his own comics for Tintin Magazine , including the widely-acclaimed Blake and Mortimer series . Almost all of the Tintin adventures have a vivid humanism and a realistic feel produced by meticulous and wide ranging research , and , of course , HergT 's drawing style . Even adults enjoy Tintin for the many satirical references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HergT died on March 3 , 1983 at age 75 , having become a prominent national hero in his native Belgium . An HergT Museum was opened in Louvain-La-Neuve in June 2009 . And to this day his work remains a strong influence on comic artists , especially in Europe . <p> The Philately of HergT For several reasons , collecting stamps and covers related to HergT and Tintin is not as easy or straightforward as might be expected . There are any number of web sites that focus on HergT and Tintin philately , most of which are woefully inadequate and incomplete . But how complete is complete ; how big a circle do we wish to draw ? Do we include the Belgian 1993 metro station postcard that depicts a mural by HergT of Tintin characters ? Of course . Do we include the Belgian 1999 block of nine stamps of the Comic Strip Museum ? Yes , because the center stamp pictures a model of Tintin 's moon rocket ship . How about the 2012 Visit Belgium Europa stamp ? Yes , it also depicts Tintin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturing shophouses in both countries ? Probably , because the low-value stamp is the Belgian Comic Strip Museum . Do we include the Algerian 2011 stamp honoring Comic Art at the 9th Arts Festival ? Possibly , because HergT hugely influenced comic art in French-speaking Algeria and nearly every cachet on First Day Covers for the stamp pictures Tintin . Do we include the Belgian stamps honoring Edgar Jacobs ? Probably not , because that would open the door to every comic artist who worked with HergT or was influenced by him . How about a stamp where HergT 's drawing of a compass is incorporated into the design ? I think not . We get into muddier waters as we look at stamps and postal stationery of China , India , Romania , and Guinea Bissau as well as personal stamps issued in Belgium , Netherlands , and Canada . There are also some " illegal " stamps issued by Angola and other entities not recognized by the UPU as well as many cinderella stamps and labels . Complicating matters further are the many varieties of postal stationery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are not cataloged . And finally , there are the out-and-out counterfeits and fakes . As of year end 2014 , there have been 29 legitimate issues by ten countries of stamps , sheets or postal stationery comprising at least 95 separate items related to HergT . If we add in the Belgian duostamps ( read on ) and unofficial items , the tally is well over 200 items . <p> Click on any image or colored text for a full-size image of the stamp or cover <p> Belgium As the birthplace of HergT , who later became a national hero of the country , we would correctly expect the most issues honoring HergT to be from Belgium . The first time an image of Tintin appeared on what appeared to be a stamp was in Tintin magazine , December 13 , 1950 ( Fig. 1 ) . The top , in French , read , " TIMBRE TINTIN " and the bottom , in Dutch , read " KUIFJE 'S BON , " in other words , " Tintin stamp . " This design was licensed for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chewing gum , chocolate , and the mailing envelope for a collection of small colored photographic scenes of Belgium . This is not an actual postal item but is interesting as being the first " stamp " designed by HergT . The first actual postage stamp was issued by Belgium on Sept. 29 , 1979 and featured a drawing of Tintin and Snowy looking through a magnifying glass at several stamps ( Fig. 2 ) . This 8-franc stamp , Scott 1036 , was issued in a sheet of 30 . Interestingly , the cachet on the official Belgian Philatelic Bureau First Day Cover picturing elements from various Tintin stories was not drawn by HergT but rather by the commercial illustrator Chesnot ( Fig. 3 ) . As mentioned above , the Boy Scout Patrol Leader Totor was HergT 's first character , so it was only appropriate that a second ceremony for the stamp took place at the BeNeLux Scouts Philatelic Convention on October 27 , 1979 ( Fig. 4 ) . In 1984 to replace telegrams , Belgium Post introduced the " Postogram , " an express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each one of which included an illustrated card . Often overlooked in Tintin philately was the 1991 Postogram illustrated with the Tintin cast of characters holding champagne flutes ( Fig. 5 ) . Also often overlooked was the postal card of a Brussels metro station issued October 16 , 1993 . Pictured on both the card and the indicia is a mural designed by HergT with a wide range of characters from various Tintin stories ( Fig. 6 ) . Dominating the entry hall of the Belgian Comic Strip Museum is a huge model of Tintin 's moon rocket that carried Tintin and his friends to the moon in 1953 , sixteen years before Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface on July 21 , 1969 . So it was only appropriate that the center stamp , Scott 1771e , of the nine-stamp block for the museum issued October 2 , 1999 depict the moon rocket ( Fig. 7 ) . An FDS of this sheet is also available . Two months later on Dec. 4 , 1999 , as part of the first of four 20-stamp mini-sheets called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a marionette being worked by Tintin , was the 19th stamp on the sheet , Scott 1779s ( Fig. 8 ) . First Day Covers of blocks of these 1999 stamps are sometimes seen , but an FDS of the entire 20-stamp sheet is more common . On the last day of 2001 , Belgium and the Democratic Republic of the Congo jointly issued a stamp with Tintin in a pith helmet and a souvenir sheet with a single stamp in the center of Tintin driving with an African boy . Tintin in the Congo was HergT 's second story and deemed by some people to be politically incorrect . In fact , the book today is sold with a wide red sealing band around it stating , " Collector 's Edition . " Obviously , the people in the Congo were n't the least bit offended if they were willing to participate in a joint stamp issue . A nice piece is the official memorial card from Belgian Post with first day cancels of both stamps ( Fig. 9 ) . Both souvenir sheets had the same design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quite high denomination of 461 Congolese francs , 2.4 times the value of single stamp ( Scott 1613 ) . The country was so proud of the stamp and souvenir sheet that nine years later they overprinted them and sold them as souvenirs of their exhibit at the 2010 Shanghai Expo ( Fig 10 ) . On July 5 , 2003 , in a series of five stamps picturing popular statues , a statue in Brussels by Tom Frantzen , De Vaartkapoen ( Officer 22 , a takeoff on HergT 's Officer 15 from the Quick &amp; Flupke strip ) , Scott 1965 , denominated at 0.49 , was the fourth stamp in the group ( Fig. 11 ) . On March 15 , 2004 , Belgium issued a souvenir sheet of five stamps , Scott 2003 , again honoring Tintin 's popular lunar voyage , although the first stamp in the strip was a photo of HergT himself ( Fig. 12 ) . A year later , Quick &amp; Flupke finally got their turn , but only as a black-and-white illustration from the strip , " A chacun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped postal card of King Albert II produced for the Tintin Festival in Brussels on July 23 , 2005 ( Fig. 13 ) . In September of 2005 , a souvenir sheet of the Comic Strip Museum was jointly issued with Singapore , which we 'll cover with Singapore . A full sheet of 25 stamps , Scott 2234 , picturing all 24 Tintin book covers ( in 24 languages ! ) plus a portrait of HergT was issued on May 22 , 2007 for the 100th anniversary of the birth of HergT ( Fig 14 ) . These stamps carried a denomination of 0.46 . FDCs on maxi-cards picturing the book cover with the matching stamp are very attractive but becoming quite scarce . On September 15 , 2007 , Belgium Railways issued a Railway Letter Stamp souvenir sheet with a single 8.50-euro stamp showing Tintin on a train . Along with its matching note card , this has become one of the most elusive Tintin items of all time . The first day usage on Sept. 15 , 2007 was on three high-speed rail routes from Brussels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey on Sept 24 , 2007 . The cancel for the trip originating in Brussels matched the design on the stamp ( Fig. 15 ) . Continuing to garner attention , another souvenir sheet for the Comic Strip Museum , Scott 2399 , was issued on October 5 , 2009 . Tintin 's moon rocket dominates the design and his distinctive swept back lock of hair is on the blank speech balloon on the stamp , but interestingly , no HergT character appears on the sheet ( Fig. 16 ) . Although produced by Belgian Post , an FDC of the stamp alone is seldom seen . To debut the release of Spielberg 's Tintin movie , a souvenir sheet of ten stamps picturing scenes from ten previous Tintin films was issued on August 29 , 2011 ( Fig. 17 ) . As part of the Europa omnibus issue , on February 13 , 2012 , Belgium issued a souvenir sheet of two stamps with the theme of Visit Belgium , Scott 2550 . In the center is Tintin 's stylized face and on the left stamp is , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This souvenir sheet is on both an FDC and FDS. Later on September 17 , 2012 , Belgium issued a souvenir sheet honoring ten different comic strips , Scott 2591 . In the center , Tintin and Snowy have the place of honor on the sheet ( Fig 19 ) . FDCs of the stamp alone are quite scarce . Starting in 2001 and continuing today , Belgium has been issuing " duostamps " for subjects such as movies , birthday parties , Disney , Harry Potter , and comic book characters , like Tintin . Each duostamp has a rectangular label with an image at the left and at the right a square stamp , usually in red and black with the Belgian Post symbol . A duostamp is good for the current letter rate , e.g. , 0.49 in 2007 , however , they are priced at slightly more than twice the face value ( 4.99 for a strip of five in 2007 ) . The labels are not for personal images or photos as in the U.S. , Canada , Australia , etc. but carry designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheetlets with 5 designs per sheet are issued per year . Some duostamps are produced in sheets of 15 ( label plus stamp ) and sold that way , but more commonly they are packaged in vertical strips of five in a plastic envelope . Some duostamps are released in conjunction with a special event ( festival , museum opening , etc. ) for which Belgian Post might have a special cancel but most are issued with little fanfare so First Day Covers per se do not exist . From 2001 through 2010 , more duostamps have been issued for HergT and Tintin than any other subject ( at least 80 designs ) . An interesting duostamp strip from 2008 pictured five of HergT 's comic strips : Totor , Tom and Millie , Quick &amp; Flupke , Jo , Zette , and Jocko , and , of course , Tintin ( Fig. 20 ) .

Compared to previous Tintin stamps , these are very simple designs with no background scenery whatsoever , just the face of the character against a single-color background . Following their usual custom , Belgian Post produced First Day Covers of the booklet ( Fig 20a ) , but the individual stamps were separated and placed in two rows of five at the top and bottom of the envelope . These were clearly produced only for collectors as there is no place for an address and there is not even a hint that the envelope could actually be mailed . A First Day Sheet ( FDS 1407 ) was also produced with the same layout of stamps as the FDC . By the way , these cost 5.25 from Belgium Post but dealers are selling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discourage anyone from collection Belgium stamps . <p> Click on any image for a full-size image of the stamp or cover .

And , indeed , on October 8 , 1999 , they were the second country to issue a Tintin stamp . The issue was somewhat complicated consisting of a booklet of five stamps plus a double tab , Scott 1893b , which pictured Tintin and Snowy on the moon ( Fig. 21 ) . A second stamp , Scott 1893a , picturing Capt . Haddock and Tintin , was coupled with the Tintin/Snowy stamp in a souvenir sheet ( Fig. 22 ) . Collectors and album producers seem to be divided as to whether to collect the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , or the souvenir sheet plus the booklet pane of five stamps plus tabs or a block of three plus tabs . Many first day covers have been produced for the Tintin/Snowy single stamp , Scott 1893b , the souvenir sheet on an envelope and the souvenir sheet on a page , but very few for the Haddock stamp , Sc 1893a . Like many other countries , the Netherlands offers personal postage stamps ( Persoonlijke Postzegels ) and at least one enterprising dealer ( Collector World ) furnished images for several high quality sets of Tintin stamps . These are sold today at usurious prices but , of course , are not official issues ( Figs. 23 ) . <p> France In France , starting in 1938 , one day each year was designated as Stamp Day ( changed to Stamp Festival in 2000 ) . Since December 1944 , La Poste ( French Postal Service ) has issued a stamp on that day which , until 1999 , focused on French postal history . However , starting in 2000 the subjects have been ones deemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes . An interesting aspect of the event is that it takes place throughout the country in every town and city with an active Philatelic Association . In the year 2000 , Tintin and Snowy running together was the single design for a new stamp ( Fig. 24 ) , but the issue was incredibly complex . The basic stamp with a value of 3.00 francs ( 0.46 euros ) , Scott 2764 , was issued in panes of 40 . A booklet of 7 stamps was also issued with the four stamps on the left side of the pane being denominated at 3.00 f and the three on the right being semi-postals of 3.00 f + 0.60 f to benefit the French Red Cross . The eighth position in the booklet was a tab simply reading " Tintin . " Thus , perhaps the most desirable First Day Cover has become one with the stamp and tab from the top of the booklet ( Fig. 25 ) . In addition , a souvenir sheet with the semi-postal stamp was issued ( Fig. 26 ) . And if that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : five in 2000 , two in 2002 , and two " luxury " ones in 2003 . Designs were on both the envelope and insert ( Fig 27 ) .

This suggests the stamps represent different stories , which they might , although they actually depict six different characters that appear in many Tintin stories . Denominated at 0.54 euros , these were issued in sheets , Scott 3329-34 , as well as all six in a single souvenir sheet ( Fig 28 ) . Some towns in France are rather lenient with the use of canceling devices at the Stamp Festivals and thus one can find covers with first day or festival cancels on fake stamps , cinderellas , labels , or even nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially cautious of covers coming from Guebwiller or Illzach , Alsatian towns near the border of Germany and Switzerland . Covers labeled " Centenaire de sa Naissance d'HergTe - 2007 " from Guebwiller or " Bedecine 2000 " from Illzach , even if they are also labeled " FDC " are almost all fakes ( Fig. 29 ) . Singapore As mentioned above , Singapore had a joint issue with Belgium on September 9 , 2005 , of four stamps depicting similar " shophouses " in both countries , two in Brussels and two in Singapore . The stamps were issued both in sheet form and as a souvenir sheet with all four stamps , Scott 1160a . The lowest value stamp for the basic letter rate ( 23 ) carries the notation " 1st Local " in Singapore and has an image of the Belgium Comic Strip Museum ( Fig. 30 ) . On a souvenir sheet of 8 stamps and 8 labels , several labels are scenes from Tintin stories . The corresponding Belgian issue , Scott 2104 , which came out a day later on Sept 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of 44 francs and two valued at 65 francs . A very nice piece is an oversize First Day Cover with all four stamps from both countries ( Fig. 31 ) . <p> Switzerland <p> As with France , jumping the gun a bit , Switzerland issued two stamped picture postcards in Geneva on May 10 , 2007 in honor of the 100th anniversary of HergT 's birth . A vertical design pictured the Hotel Cornavin with Tintin and Haddock walking up the steps . A horizontal design pictured a Swissair bus in front of the Hotel Beaujolais . First Day of Issue ( Jour d'emission ) cancels were provided in Geneva on May 10 . Pictorial cancels were also offered for L'Afere Tournesol ( The Calculus Affair ) in Bulle on May 22 , 2007 and at the Tintin Festival in Lausanne on July 7-8 , 2007 ( Figs. 32-33 ) . As with their neighbor , France , Switzerland makes cancels available on almost anything , blank envelopes included ( Fig. 34 ) . <p> Guinea Bissau A former Portuguese colony , Guinea Bissau is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the west cost of Africa . To earn some foreign exchange , they happily issue postage stamps for collectors , most of which will never see anything but a stamp album . Thus on March 10 , 2008 , they issued a colorful souvenir sheet of four stamps and two labels ( Michel 3744-47 ) honoring the 50 year anniversary of Belgium signing the Treaty of Rome . Featured on the sheet are the Nobel Peace Prize winning microbiologist Jules Bordet , the Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens , Renaissance painter Pieter Bruegel , and our friend Georges Remi , aka HergT along with a number of his Tintin characters . Alas , Guinea Bissau had not gotten permission to use these copyrighted figures from Studios HergT who came down on them like a ton of bricks and forced them to remove the bottom left stamp and sell the resulting sheet of three stamps and two labels . There are still some intact sheets around ( Fig. 35 ) , however , they command a premium price over the " official " mutilated sheet .

What comes after independence ? Home- grown comics , of course , which were first published in 1967 in the weekly Algeria News and then , in 1969 , in the newspaper El Mujahid , one of the oldest and best known papers in the Arab and African world . Until then people in Algeria had been enjoying comics from the French-speaking world like Spirou , Asterix , The Smurfs , and , of course , Tintin . Needless to say , these earlier French comics , and especially Tintin were a great influence on the young Algerian artists . Forty some-odd years later on September 25 , 2011 at the 9th Algerian Arts Festival a pair of stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was a bit surprising was that most of the artists who produced First Day Cover cachets included Tintin , either alone or as part of the design ( Fig. 37 ) thus recognizing HergT 's continuing influence on the comic art of the country . <p> Monaco The Principality of Monaco , a sovereign city state located on the French Riviera , is the second smallest and most densely populated country in the world . On November 21 , 2012 , the Casterman publishing house released the third installment of the Adventures of Tintin in the MonTgasque language . ( MonTgasque , along with other Ligurian languages , is derived directly from northern Italian languages of the Middle Ages . It is spoken in the old part of Monaco , taught in schools , and street signs are marked in MonTgasque in addition to French . ) The third Tintin book in MonTgasque called " U Tesoru de Rakamu u Russu " ( Red Rackhams Treasure ) follows " I Ori de Castafiore " ( The Castafiore Emerald ) and " U Secretu da Licorna " ( The Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp created in collaboration with Moulinsart , was issued by Monaco on the same day . The stamp , Scott 2697 , depicts Tintin and Capt . Haddock digging up the remains of the " jolly boat " on which Sir Francis Haddock came ashore on the island . This scene appears on the bottom left of page 25 of the book , Red Rackham 's Treasure . <p> Japan Five Tintin designs were printed on the face side of generic Japanese post cards with a face value of 50 yen ( domestic post card rate ) in an issue about which practically nothing is known . They were issued on June 20 , 2000 . They seem to have been produced by Japan Post but it 's possible that they were privately produced ( like the cards from China and India ) . They are listed on two web sites , japanesestamps.net and philatelics.jimdo.com , but the cards are only sold through eBay . Prices are quoted in dollars ( a rather outrageous $20 for the set of 5 , which have a face value of 47 each or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalog number of JPC 436 , but that may be a dealer stock number . I could not find them in any Japanese catalog , although I confess I do not know the language . The cards measure 5.8 " x 3.9 " and are printed on high-quality glossy stock . They come in an outer envelope with a color illustration printed , " Tintin and Snowy " and have an inside explanatory cover sheet . All in all , a very nice but curious item . <p> Abkhazia , Somaliland , and Other Self-Declared Independent States Over the years , many regions and provinces such as Quebec , Scotland , Catalonia , Croatia , Latvia , Eritrea , Puerto Rico , Greenland , Nevis , Veneto , Lugansk , and others have attempted to become independent soverign states with varying degrees of success . Some try to appear independent prematurely by issuing stamps and currency , again with varying degrees of success . Abkhazia is a disputed territory and partially recognized state controlled by a separatist government on the eastern coast of the Black Sea and the south-western flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaragua , Venezuela , and Nauru . The United Nations and most of the world 's governments consider Abkhazia a part of Georgia 's territory , though Georgia is not in control of it . Go figure . So if you 're a minister in Tbilisi and want some recognition and foreign exchange , why not issue some Tintin stamps with a denomination of 23 Russian rubles ( about 75 when issued but only 42 in late 2014 ) . And issue them they did ! There are four sheetlets of 8 different stamps each and each stamp has also been issued in an 8-stamp sheetlet by itself . There are also imperforate single-stamp " souvenir sheets . " Strangely , these stamps are seemingly not available in Abkhazia itself but only from the on-line store ( Newshop2012 ) of Celia Moreno , a friendly dealer in Valencia , Spain who lists them on the Delcampe and Bidstart auction web sites . They 're colorful , big stamps measuring 1.9 " x 1.35 " each . If the stamps have a true value of 42 to 75 , Celia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are essentially worthless , well , what can I say but caveat emptor.Somaliland is a self-declared independent state that is actually an autonomous region of Somalia . Since 1991 , the government of the territory has been seeking self-determination as the Republic of Somaliland . However , at this time Somaliland 's self-proclaimed independence remains unrecognized by any country or international organization . The Somaliland shilling , is not an internationally recognised currency and currently has no official exchange rate , which make the issuance of currency and stamps rather problematical . The actual currency in use is the Somali Shilling with a real exchange rate of about 825 per dollar . As with Abkhazia , Somaliland " stamps " are available from Celia Moreno in Spain and seemingly not in Somaliland itself . But who knows ? The 1.7 " x 2.1 " stamp images are printed on maxi-card size ( 4.4 " x 5.9 " ) heavy stock ( not cards ) , imperforate , dated 2007 , with 11 values from 100 to 1100 shillings ( 12 to $1.33 ) . The card has part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Island with the " stamp " in the upper right . Celia sells the cards , any denomination , for 5.80 each , which suggests they have no real value for postage . <p> Romania , China , India , Fakes , and Cinderellas Concurrent with the release of the Tintin movie in 2011 , about 150 different stamped postcards suddenly appeared from China with images of book covers , stills from the movie , and portions of book pages printed on the back of standard 80-yen ( domestic rate ) stamped postcards ( Fig. 38 ) . China Post prints scores of picture postcards each year , but these Tintin cards of apparently pirated images seem to be the work of four or five enterprising vendors in the People 's Republic . They are marketed heavily in Europe on the Delcampe auction web site and tend to sell for rather outrageous prices of 2 to 3 euros each . A vendor in India also produced an unknown number of postcards with designs printed in rather poor quality on the left side of the address side of the card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . A side note : it was EuroBooksIndia of Mumbai that in 2008 published the first English translations of the 11 Quick &amp; Flupke books by HergT , which are still not available in the rest of the world . In conjunction with an International Comic Strip Salon ( Exhibition ) , Romania issued a 50-bani domestic mail envelope on October 13 , 2005 with a colorful illustration on the left picturing many comic strip characters . Tintin is hiding in the right center and his moon rocket is blasting off above the crowd ( Fig. 40 ) . There are no known FDCs of this piece.Angola , a country in southwest Africa , also issues hundreds of thematic stamps . But in addition , Stampdile Ltd of the UK produces totally illegal Angola stamps including , in 1999 , a series of 4-stamp sheetlets under the banner , Countdown to the Millennium . The upper right stamp in the sheet covering the decade 1920-29 pictured Tintin , but of course the stamps are postally invalid ( Fig. 41 ) . Celia Moreno in Spain also has these sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on-line shop . Another excellent quality but totally fake souvenir sheet was probably also produced by Stampdile in 2004 . The text on the sheet in is Russian and reads , loosely translated , " 75 Years of the Belgian Hero in European Comic Books , Tintin " ( Fig. 42 ) . Some on-line sellers are optimistically pricing this fake souvenir sheet at almost $70.00 ! Over the years , stamp-like labels have been produced as chocolate bar wrappers , promotional items , and just as label sheets to sell to Tintin enthusiasts . Perhaps the best quality labels were produced in 1979 by an unknown printer for the 50th anniversary of the first appearance of Tintin in print . These very clever labels were produced to look like stamps and were produced in three sheetlets of nine each and also , with some slight revisions , in a large sheet of 28-stamp-size labels plus two double-size ones around a central large label reading , " 50th Anniversary " ( see Fig. 43 above ) . This label sheet was also produced in a very limited edition with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriter ( as a reporter would ) with Snowy sitting at the side . Kudos to the first person who can tell me in which Tintin book this image appears . Although Tintin is a reporter , it is actually rare to see him doing anything but getting involved in varous adventures.Four similar sets of nine labels in a horizontal design called " Tintin and Friends " were also produced in France in 1979 and sold for 0.50 francs per set by the Samaritaine department stores . Another group of at least ten stamp-like labels in Arabic were produced in 1958-60 in Egypt ( Fig. 44 ) . A sheet of labels was periodically included as a bonus with the comics magazine Samir . Finally , many other fake Tintin stamps abound . A 2004 article by Roland Francart in Philabulle lists more than 40 faux stamps in 9 separate issues , and the number has probably doubled since then .

Nebuchadnezzar was n't the first or the last tyrannical ruler to make absurd demands ; a modern example is Hitler , but there are many others .

The good news for us is that those who believe in God are members of his kingdom and are secure in him . <p> Read verses 46 to 49 . <p> 10 . What important message should we take away from these last few verses ?

Many questions are primarily to stimulate discussion and there are no right or wrong answers . <p> Review : In verses 3:15-24 ( which we skipped ) , Paul uses the example of Abraham to reiterate his earlier points . He says that God made a promise to Abraham and has not revoked it . God blessed the world through Abraham by sending the Messiah as one of Abraham 's descendants . The law was given to Moses many centuries later for two reasons : on the positive side it reveals the nature and will of God and shows people how to live . On the negative side , it points out people 's sins and shows them that it is impossible to please God by trying to obey His laws . Most recently , Paul was then shown the superiority of salvation by faith over trying to be saved by keeping the Jewish laws .

How do these correspond with the rights , privileges , and responsibilities we have as children of God ? <p> Some of the rights of sons and daughters include the right of inheritence ( both assets and debts ) and the right of being cared for , especially when very young . Privileges include being fed , clothed , given shelter , perhaps an education , being encouraged and loved , and possibly an allowance or monetary gifts . Responsibilities include loving and honoring your parents , obedience , providing help , and being trustworthy and loyal . Compare these with your relationship to God . <p> 2 .

Knowing what we do about the situation Paul was writing about in Galatia , why do you think he felt it was important to include this analogy ? <p> 5 . In verses 12-16 , Paul contrasts the way the Galatians treated him before with the way they are now responding negatively to his teachings .

In his claim , the lawyer stated the cigars were lost " in a series of small fires .

@@58355332 @7355332/ <p> Date and Place of Writing Paul wrote this letter from Ephesus around 55 A.D. to the church at Corinth . This was near the end of Paul 's three-year ministry in Ephesus during his third missionary journey . He notes that he plans to visit the Corinthians soon although as we see in 2 Corinthians , a letter written later in the same year , Paul did not make that planned visit . <p> Occasion and Purpose Corinth was a large , bustling , wealthy city . Because of its location , goods and people from around the world flowed in and out of its ports . It was a center for art , philosophy , and religion . It contained a number of pagan temples including large ones to Apollo and Aphrodite . The city had a reputation for vice , immorality , and debauchery . Paul spent 18 months establishing a church in Corinth during his second missionary journey ( Acts 18:1-18 ) . This letter , composed three or four years later , was written in response to reports and a letter Paul received concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth of the early church as the model for us to imitate ! Seduction by the surrounding pagan culture and a hyper-spirituality had led this church into a host of problems . As a result , 1 Corinthians is full of information about how a Christian lifestyle differs from that of the culture as a whole . At points , there is difficulty in understanding 1 Corinthians because all we possess are Paul 's responses . Thus commentators differ on whether some passages in the letter are meant as Paul 's advice , or if he is quoting from their letter before refuting that position ( e.g. 7:1 ; 10:23 ) . Structurally , the letter falls into two parts . Part One ( ch. 1-6 ) deals with four problems reported to Paul ( 1:11 ) , while part two ( ch. 7-15 ) looks at a variety of issues about which the Corinthians had written to Paul ( 7:1 ) . <p> Bible Studies on 1 Corinthians I have arbitrarily divided the 16 chapters of 1 Corinthians into 25 sections for discussion .

@@58355334 @7355334/ <p> 1 . What advantages or good results does Paul attribute to the gift of prophecy in verses 1-5 ? How do these advantages compare with the results of speaking in a tongue ? <p> A : 1 Corinthians 14:1-5 begins this section by affirming the superiority of prophecy to tongues . The reason prophecy is superior to tongues is that it is understandable . <p> The contrast between prophecy and tongues is clearly stated in verses 2-4 . People who speak in a tongue do not speak to other people but to God . Those who prophesy speak to other people . It is important to understand Paul clearly at this point . Modern Pentecostals often claim that their speaking in tongues is a " message " for the congregation . Pauls words here would not support such a claim . Whether the Corinthians thought they were talking to God or to each other is not stated . What is clear is that Paul regards speaking in tongues as not communicating anything intelligible to people . <p> 2 . Summarize Pauls point in verses 7-11 in your words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal ? <p> A : Verses 7-8 introduce a comparison . Flutes , harps , and trumpets do not accomplish their purpose unless one can distinguish between the notes they play . The distinct notes allow a melody to be played and harmony to be composed . The trumpets role is especially critical . If one can not recognize its sound how will one know whether or not to prepare for battle ? In the last several centuries bugles communicated the commanders orders to either charge or retreat to the soldiers . If one could not distinguish the sounds how would one know whether to charge or retreat ? <p> Verse 9 sums up the point . If one speaks in a tongue and the words are unintelligible it is the same as talking into the wind . <p> Verses 10-11 shift the analogy to a new front , that of foreign languages . Paul is not arguing here that the tongues-speaking done by the Corinthians is a foreign language . Rather , his point is that it is no more understandable than listening to a foreign language . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive to excel in spiritual gifts for the building up of the church . " What spiritual gift(s) should you excel in for the building up of your church ? <p> A : The point of everything in corporate worship is not personal experience in the Spirit , but building up the church itself . The building up of the community is the basic reason for corporate settings of worship ; they should probably not be turned into a corporate gathering for a thousand individual experiences of worship . <p> Almost all American expressions of worship struggle to understand the importance Paul placed on the church as a whole . We are too used to measuring everything in terms of its impact on us personally . <p> 4 . What does Paul say about the importance of the mind in worship according to verses 14-16 ? What application would you make for the way the mind is used and involved in worship today ? <p> A : In Verse 14 , Paul says if he prays in a tongue his spirit prays but his mind is fruitless . Praying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point Paul has been developing throughout the preceding verses . <p> In Verse 15 , Paul speaks of the same balance in psalm-singing . He presents his own pattern as a model for the Corinthians to follow . Pauls demand for the balance of understanding and spiritual prayer is important for our understanding of appropriate corporate worship . The need for understanding and intelligibility excludes tongues speaking without interpretation . It excludes any other activity that is not capable of being understood and explained . Paul is still developing the same point he has been working on since verse 6 . Another person can not appropriately respond to an utterance that might be a message from God if that person can not understand the words when they are spoken in a tongue . <p> 5 . What concern for outsiders and unbelievers appear in these verses ? What principle guides Pauls instructions on this subject ? How should we apply that same principle to our worship today ? <p> A : Paul asks the Corinthians not to become children in their thinking , but to become mature . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clear implication is that the Corinthians have been childish and immature in their insistence on speaking in tongues in public worship . Maturity would lead them to restrict the practice of their gift for the upbuilding of the whole church just as Paul does . <p> 6 . How would someone today know that God is present in your local church ? How would you summarize in a brief prayer what you would like God to do for your church in this area ? <p> 7 . What is the central objective in Pauls call for orderly worship in Verses 26 to 40 ? <p> A : In Verse 26 , Paul describes the way the Corinthians come together to worship . As they gather each person comes with something to contribute . He lists a psalm , a teaching , a revelation , a tongue , and an interpretation as examples of the kinds of contributions the Corinthians come planning to share . This list is not an order of worship . It is not exhaustive ; other contributions could have also been mentioned . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply stating the fact of how the Corinthians come to worship . The command and objective is the final sentence of verse 26 . All things must be done for upbuilding , strengthening , or edifying the church and its members . The edifying , upbuilding , a nd strengthening of the gathered church is the criterion that Paul uses to evaluate the all of the aspects of worship . So everything done in church must be beneficial and strengthen the faith of all the believers . <p> 8 . Explain what the statement ( Verse 33 ) , " God is not a God of disorder , but of peace , " means to you in the context of the way you believe worship should be conducted . <p> 9 . What do you think Paul had in mind in the instructions for a woman to not speak in church in Verses 34-35 ? How does 1 Corinthians 11:2-16 influence your understanding of Verses 34-35 ? <p> A : Verses 34-35 deal with the participation of women in worship . These verses forcefully forbid women to speak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their husbands at home . These verses have received intense scrutiny in recent years . They appear to contradict the assumption of 1 Corinthians 11:5 that women may pray and prophesy in church . A variety of explanations have appeared . The traditional explanation has been that verses 34-35 are Pauls standard teaching and that the material of chapter 11 must be refer to prayer meetings or some small group meeting rather than the worship service of the whole church . <p> The most popular explanation has been that the women at Corinth were involved in disruptive behavior . The common scenario supposes that the women sat together on one side of the room and the men were on the other . If women shouted questions to their husbands or defiant remarks such behavior would cause a major disruption of the order Paul calls for in this section . Such an explanation is certainly possible but we do not know if women and men were seated separately in early Christian worship or not . They were in the Jewish synagogues , but first century Christians worshipped in homes rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses 34-35 represent a quotation from the Corinthians . That would solve the problem of contradiction with chapter 11 . It also explains the very un-Pauline way of arguing in these verses . Rarely does Paul appeal to the Old Testament Law as a rule for people to obey . Talbert argues that verses 34-35 represent the position of at least some at Corinth and that verse 36 is Pauls " indignant reply . " However , the normal indicators of a quotation from the Corinthians are lacking in this passage . <p> A significant number of commentators argue that these verses were added to 1 Corinthians sometime after Paul wrote the letter . Such an approach used to be labeled " liberal " but the recent massive commentary by the very evangelical scholar , Gordon Fee , takes this position . Fee ( pp. 699-701 ) , however , argues his case on the basis of ancient manuscripts rather than the problem of contradictory ideas . <p> The number of explanations put forth for verses 34-35 shows two things . First , it is extremely difficult to understand these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of what we know Paul thought about women . Second , no explanation has been sufficiently satisfactory . We may never know with certainty the best way to explain why these verses appear in this place and what we are to make of them . In such cases a spirit of grace and tolerance is better than one of dogmatic assertion . <p> 10 . What do you think Paul is doing in verses 37-38 ? Is it fair ? Is it right ? Would a similar strategy by a pastor in our time be appropriate ? Why ? or why not ? <p> A : Paul concludes chapter 14 with a series of instructions . Verse 37 affirms that one of the tests of the Corinthians spirituality will be whether or not they recognize that his words in chapters 12-14 represent a command from Christ . Anyone who refuses to acknowledge this should not be acknowledged in the worship of the church . <p> 11 . What do Verse 39-40 represent in the context of all of chapter 14 ? What application does Verse 40 have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urges them to zealously seek to prophesy . This is the third time the verb " zealously seek " has been used in the treatment of spiritual gifts . Verse 39 also forbids the Corinthians to forbid speaking in tongues . Verse 39 thus sums up verses 1-25 . Pauls final command in verse 40 sums up verses 26-38 . All things are to be done decently and in order . Such a command is applicable to all Christians in any cultural context . The command also acknowledges the role that culture will play in determining what a group of people consider decent and orderly .

Menu will appear herewhen all imagesare loaded , but itmay take some timeespecially on a low-speed connection . <p> How They Do It <p> Ever wonder whether those funny photos you get in your e-mail and see on web sites are real ? Some are , but with the advent of easy-to-use photo touch-up software , more and more people are manipulating and combining one or more innocent images to make a brand new bizarre image . There are web sites devoted to displaying these manipulated photos ( final image only ) and other sites that provide instruction in how to use the various software packages . But here , I 'm simply displaying some widely-circulated images and showing how the manipulation , if any , was done . <p> The original photo taken in Australia was posted on an Australian web site , Ozjokes.com , and is quite funny in its own right since the poster on the bus says , " If you do n't have GIO third party property insurance , we suggest you do n't hit this bus . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us " on-line game craze , people manipulated every image in sight to insert the " Engrish " phrases used in the game . ( See examples at All Your Base Web Site . ) The manipulation of this image was fairly straigntforward : the original billboard type was replaced with solid blue , probably using a " clone " tool , and then the " All your base ... " type was drawn on in white and yellow . The photo was also cropped . <p> This photo has been circulating , sometimes with a caption , and sometimes with a long story about someone named Roger holding an 87-pound cat that is 69 " long . Accoring to the Guinness Book of World Records , the world 's largest domestic cat from Queensland , Australia , was a male tabby named Himmy who tipped the scales at just under 47 lbs . and was 38 inches long . Thus , this photo is clearly faked . In fact , according to the Ottawa Citizen , the picture actually shows an Edmonds , Washington , man named Cordell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with PhotoShop to create the effect of a feline of much larger-than-ordinary size . According to Mr. Hauglie : " My daughter wanted to send an electronic photo of her cat to her friend . I got a little carried away . When we sent it to her friend , we never dreamed anyone would believe the photo was real . " Hauglie has had many chuckles over analyses of the photo . Some viewers assert the cat appears stuffed , while others say it 's standing , not being held . Still others suggest the man in the photo does n't look as though he 's holding a 40-kilogram object . Truth is , he is n't . His son held up the quite ordinary-size cat for one photo , proving you can suspend a cat in that fashion , and Mr. Hauglie stood in the same light for the next shot . <p> One giveaway to the photo manipulation is the foliage outside the window which is generally sharp and well-defined but in the immediate vicinity of the tail becomes blurred and indistinct . <p> The left photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its similarity to the man holding the giant cat , people were tempted to also dismiss this photograph as a hoax . However , in this case the photo is genuine . Because the cat is stretched out full-length in the woman 's arms , it looks much longer than if it were posed in a normal stance . In addition , its luxurious , fluffed-out coat of hair adds to the impression of large size . <p> The feline pictured is a 2-year-old Maine Coon cat , Riley , photographed in the arms of his owner , Martha . According to Martha , Riley has lost a bit of weight recently , but he weighed about 24 lbs . at the time the picture above was taken . Below is another photo of Riley lying down and one of him with his sister , Callie . <p> The photo to the left has been circulating on the web , often with a caption indicating that it was a tense rescue off the coast of South Africa . In fact it was no such thing . The photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter while the photograph of the jumping shark was taken by underwater photographer Charles Maxwell off the coast of South Africa . An anonymous photo hacker flipped the picture of the helicopter and diver and pasted in the jumping shark . As fakes go , this one is better than most . No obvious artifacts point to digital manipulation of the picture . Unfortunately , the backing story is not of the same quality . It is badly edited and the Golden Gate Bridge in the background is at odds with the claim that it happened in South Africa . <p> In the funny sign above , the letter I in " Final " has fallen to the left creating the word anal . It has been said the photo comes from Lexington , South Carolina , but nobody seems quite sure and , in fact , there are 18 towns named Lexington in the U.S. The manipulation to aubstitute " All your base ... " is well done and while some of the letters have been cut and pasted from those in the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and U had to be cut and pasted from small elements of other letters . <p> This car interior has been used as the basis for many altered photos ( various signs through the windshield , jet plane in the rearview mirror , etc. ) , but the one above ( " How to deal with a whiny kid " ) is the most widely circulated . The image at the right is more recent ( captioned " Take Your Kid To Work Day " ) . Detail was lost , however , when the image of the boy was rotated 15 left ( e.g. , missing fingers on right hand ) .

@@58355348 @7355348/ <p> 1 . In Verse 2:47 , after Daniel explained his dream , Nebuchadnezzar seemed to honor God , saying to Daniel , " Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of Kings ... " Why then would he build a huge gold statue of himself and order that it be worshiped ? <p> First of all , note that the statue in his dream had a head of gold , chest of silver , torso of bronze , and legs and feet of iron and clay . The gold head represented Nebuchadnezzar , but it was destroyed by the silver part ( representing Persia ) which in turn was destroyed by the bronze part ( representing Greece ) , then by the iron and clay part ( representing the Roman empire ) , and finally by a huge rock representing the God in heaven . Perhaps Nebuchadnezzar thought that if made the entire statue gold , his empire would prevail over the later conquerors . With it , he was audaciously saying that his kingdom would last forever . It certainly showed that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or obeyed the God who was behind his dream . <p> 2 . Can you think of any recent or current rulers or idols that demand that people bow down and worship them ? <p> Clearly , rulers like Hitler , Saddam Hussein , Robert Mugabe ( Zimbabwe ) , Idi Amin ( Uganda ) , Mengistu Haile Mariam ( Ethiopia ) , and Kwame Nkrumah ( Ghana ) fall into this category . But are n't  there things even closer to home that demand your allegiance ; that become your idol ? How about drugs and alcohol ? How about money ? Noted artist Salvador Dali said , " Liking money like I like it , is nothing less than mysticism . Money is a glory . " Back in 450 BC , Sophocles said , " for money you would sell your soul . " <p> 3 . Nebuchadnezzar threatened death by being thrown in a fiery furnace for those who did not obey . How is this kind of fear used today ? <p> Fear of not obeying today takes the form of torture , disappearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , and death . For example , between 1968 and 1979 , Francisco Macias Nguema of Equatorial Guinea murdered one sixth of the population and drove one half of the survivors into exile . Schools , libraries , books , and newspapers were abolished in 1974 and children learned slogans such as , " There is no God other than Macias . " <p> 4 . Do you think that Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego were the only Jews who did not bow down to the Nebuchadnezzar statue ? What about the other thousands of Jews in exile ? What about Daniel ? <p> Clearly Daniel would not have worshiped the statue , but from this story , we do n't  know about the other Jews in exile . <p> 5 . Why did n't  the three men just bow to the statue of Nebuchadnezzar and tell God that they did n't  mean it ? ( Exodus 20:3 , Hosea 13:4 ) Are you ready to take a stand for God no matter what ? <p> God does not accept worshiping an idol under any circumstances . Exodus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " In 715 BC , very shortly before the events in Daniel take place , the prophet Hosea ( 13:4 ) says , " I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt . You shall acknowledge no God but me , no savior except me . " <p> 6 . The three men are given a second chance to bow to the statue . Why not use one of these excuses ? ( 1 ) We will bow down but not actually worship the idol . ( 2 ) We will worship it just once and then ask God for forgiveness. ( 3 ) The king has absolute power and we must obey him . God will understand . ( 4 ) This is a foreign land , so God will forgive us for following its customs . ( 5 ) Our ancestors set up idols in Gods temple ; this is n't half as bad ! ( 6 ) If were killed , pagan will take our high positions and wont help the Jews in exile . <p> These excuses may sound sensible at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idol , even just once , would violate Gods first commandment ( Exodus 20:3 ) . It would also erase their testimony for God forever . You can be sure that other people would see them worship the statue . How could they then talk about the power of their God above all other gods ? <p> 7 . When they say their God could save them from death in the fiery furnace , do you think they are hedging their bets a bit with their " if not " words in Verse 18 ? ( See Hebrews 7:25 ) <p> No . This is not the " if not " of doubt ; it is the " if not " of supreme faith in a God who is able to save all who draw near to him . This promise is reiterated in the NT in Hebrews 7:25 , " He is able to save completely those who come to God through him because he always lives to intercede for them . " The statement illustrates a trust in God not for what you get in return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can deliver them from the fiery furnace but that his faithful people may not , in fact , be spared and may die in the flames . But even if this is the case , there is no doubt of Gods power and love . Indeed , if God always rescued people who believed in him , Christians would not need faith . Their religion would be a great insurance policy and there would be lines of selfish people waiting to sign up . We must be faithful to God whether he intervenes on our behalf or not . Our eternal reward is worth any suffering we may have to endure first . <p> 8 . The soldiers who threw the three Jews into the furnace were killed , but the three emerged untouched . Gods deliverance of them was a great victory for the Jews in exile . If we have true faith in God , can we count on him to save us from horrible ordeals ? ( Isaiah 43:2 , Hebrews 11:1 ) <p> Isaiah 43:2 says , " When you go through deep waters and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through rivers of difficulty , you will not drown ! When you walk through the fire of oppression , you will not be burned up ; the flames will not consume you . " However , no matter how strong your faith , it does not mean that you will never be subjected to a harsh ruler or boss , or that you will never be unjustly punished , or that you will not suffer a great loss . The most devout Jews and Christians have suffered greatly throughout history . Jews suffered horrendously in the concentration camps in WWII . Christians who refused to worship the Roman emperor in the first century were dipped in tar and set alight to brighten the imperial gardens . As we saw earlier , faith is not an insurance policy against disaster . <p> Hebrews chapter 11 is the great Biblical chapter on faith . It starts , " Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see .

This is one of the major problems that missionaries have in Asian and oriental countries : people are willing to add the Lord God to their list of gods , but not to worship only the Lord God . <p> 10 . What 's the bottom line message of this chapter ? <p> FAITH ! Faith under all circumstances . Being true to God no matter how difficult the pressure , threats , or punishment . Knowing that God can deliver us from anything , but that we must be faithful whether he does so or not . Always remember that your destiny is in Gods hands . Be thankful that it is .

@@58355351 @7355351/ <p> In this part of Galatians , Paul uses the story of Hagar and Sarah as a picture of the relationship between God and man . The Jews traced their lineage through Abrahams legitimate son , Isaac , the son of Sarah , and regarded Ishmael , the son of Hagar , as an outcast . Here , Paul tells them that Hagar represents the covenant given on Mt . Sinai , which is the law that the Jews in Jerusalem pride themselves on keeping . He goes on to quote from Genesis " the slave womans son will never share in the inheritance with the free womans son " and encourages the Galatians to claim the promise made to their ancestor , Isaac , by shaking off the bonds of slavery imposed by the law . <p> 1 . What makes this such a powerful message for the Galatians ? How do you think this message made them feel ? <p> The story of Hagar and Sarah is symbolic and has a deeper meaning than first appears . The two women represent two covenants : Hagar the covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The covenant of the law given at Mt Sinai produced slavery ; thus Hagar , a slave girl , fitted that covenant . Hagar represents Jerusalem ( vs 25 ) , the center for unsaved Israelites who were still seeking to obtain righteousness by keeping the law . For Paul to link unbelieving Israelites with Hagar rather than with Sarah was a stinging characterization . True believers are born of God and faith in Jesus ( vs 28 ) but they will often be persecuted and mocked by those born of the flesh , just as Ishmael mocked Isaac ( vs 29 ) . Paul goes on to encourage the Galatians to listen to the verdict of scripture ( vs 30 ) that it is impossible to inherit God 's blessings on the basis of human merit or effort ; furthermore , those who trust in Christ have no connection with the law as a means of obtaining divine favor . They ( and we ) are the children of Sarah , the free woman . <p> 2 .

Christians must stand against those who would enslave us with rules , methods , or special conditions for being saved or growing in Christ . You have been made free by the tremendous sacrifice that Christ has made for you and in gratitude you must stand fast in the liberty with which Christ has made you free . <p> 4 . Is there anyone in your life who tries to impose a yoke of slavery on you ? How should you respond ? <p> 5 . What does Paul tell the Galatians they will be obligated to do if they comply with the requirement of the Judaizers to be circumcised ? <p> Legalism makes Christ of no value . Circumcision to Paul was not a surgical operation nor a religious observance . It represented a system of salvation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gospel of human effort apart from divine grace . It was a law supplanting grace ; for to add to Christ was to take from Christ . Christ is our only savior -- solitary and exclusive . Circumcision would mean exclusion from Christ . Legalism requires men to keep the whole law . If a person attempts to please God by being circumcised , then he is under obligation to keep the whole law . Thus , if he is under the law , Christ is valueless to him . <p> 6 . Circumcision made it easy for Jews to identify others who believed as they did .

" How , then can theyand weidentify others who hold similar beliefs ( Christians ) ? <p> Outward identity markers include things like wearing a WWJD bracelet , having a chrome fish on your car , or carrying a Bible .

@@58355354 @7355354/ <p> NOTE : Answers are provided for only some of the questions . Many questions are primarily to stimulate discussion and there are no right or wrong answers . <p> 1 . Who wrote the book of Daniel ? When did it take place ? When was it written ? <p> There is much controversy about who wrote the book of Daniel . The traditional view is that it was written by Daniel himself at the time it took place , approximately 600 BC . Another view that has gained much credence in the last 100 years is that it was passed down from one generation to the next as oral history but not set down in writing until about 165 BC . A third view is that the last 6 chapters ( the prophecy portion ) was set down by Daniel but the first six chapters ( the history portion ) was written in 165 BC . <p> If , in fact , it were written in 165 BC , that would make it the last book written in the Old Testament , although it records events that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of time to about 425 BC where Nehemiah talks of the return to Jerusalem from exile in Babylon . So from a chronological standpoint , the end of OT times are recorded in Nehemiah 13 . All of the other books took place and were written before then . <p> To better understand the point of view of those who believe that Daniel was set down in writing in 165 BC , one should consider the events that took place after the end of those recorded in the Old Testament , which ended about 425 BC . What happened next ? By 400 BC , we begin to have some secular history plus 15 semi-Biblical books called the Apocrypha . These are books like Esdras , Judith , Baruch , Maccabees , and so on . <p> When Nehemiah ends in 425 BC , Artaxerses II is in power in Persia and in Egypt one of the pharaohs is ruling . About 90 years later ( 336 BC ) , Alexander the Great comes to power over much of the Mediterranean world . His fall just 13 years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ptolemys in Egypt ( 7 of them over 207 years ) and in Persia , three families of rulers : Antiochus , Seleucus , and Demitrius . <p> After the fall of Alexander the Great Judah came under the control of Egypt where it remained until 200 BC , when the northern Arab nations of Syria and Persia again took it over . In 175 BC , Antiochus IV ( aka Epiphanes ) came into power . He was and is widely regarded as one of the cruelest and brutal rulers of all time . In Jerusalem , he sold the office of high priest to the highest bidder , build a stadium for naked athletes , confiscated huge amounts of property , looted the temple rebuilt by the returned exiles , and to top it all off , sacrificed a pig on a pagan alter in the temple courtyard . <p> This pig sacrifice was the last straw for a group of Jews called the Maccabeans who , under the leadership of Mattathias , began a running guerilla insurgency that lasted from 163 to 143 BC . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when the book of Daniel was written , primarily to encourage Jewish believers at a time when simply having a scroll with a portion of the Torah was a capital offense . ( How would you like to be arrested and put to death for having a single page of the Bible in your house ? ) <p> Another reason to believe the book of Daniel was written in 165 ( rather than between 605 and 536 BC when it took place ) is that there are some rather major blunders in the historical details . Nebuchadnezzar did not capture Jerusalem in the third year of King Jehoiakim and it was his son , Jehoiachin who was taken into captivity . There are several other mistakes which indicate that the writer was looking back over four centuries of history and was a bit hazy about it . However , the primary purpose of writing down the story was to proclaim an encouraging message to his embattled fellow Jews , not to record an accurate history . <p> Many commentators today think of Daniel as a " tract for bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gods faithful people in one of the most terrible periods in their long history . <p> More important , Daniel is also a " tract for the future " recognizing that there will always be times in every generation in which the forces of light confront the forces of darkness . Nebuchadnezzar lives today in every proud and arrogant ruler ; Daniel and his companions live today in every faithful Christian ; and God lives today and will deliver those who put their trust in Him . <p> Bottom line : who wrote it ? My opinion is that this is a question for Biblical scholars to discuss and debate . No matter when it was set down on parchment or in stone , I believe that the book , like the rest of the Bible , is the word of God and carries an important message for us today . <p> 2 . Who did Nebuchadnezzar take into captivity back to Babylon and who was left in Judah ? ( 2 Kings 24:14 , Jeremiah 24:1-10 ) <p> 2 Kings 24:14 . King Nebuchadnezzar took ten thousand captives from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldiers , craftsmen , and smiths . So only the poorest people were left in the land . <p> Jer 24:1-10 . After King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon exiled Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah , to Babylon along with the princes of Judah and all the skilled craftsmen , the Lord gave me this vision . I saw two baskets of figs placed in front of the Lords Temple in Jerusalem . 2One basket was filled with fresh , ripe figs , while the other was filled with figs that were spoiled and could not be eaten . 3Then the Lord said to me , " What do you see , Jeremiah ? " I replied , " Figs , some very good and some very bad . " 4Then the Lord gave me this message : 5 " This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : The good figs represent the exiles I sent from Judah to the land of the Babylonians. 6I have sent them into captivity for their own good . I will see that they are well treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will build them up and not tear them down . I will plant them and not uproot them . 7I will give them hearts that will recognize me as the Lord . They will be my people , and I will be their God , for they will return to me wholeheartedly.8 " But the rotten figs , " the Lord said , " represent King Zedekiah of Judah , his officials , all the people left in Jerusalem , and those who live in Egypt . I will treat them like spoiled figs , too rotten to eat . 9I will make them an object of horror and evil to every nation on earth . They will be disgraced and mocked , taunted and cursed , wherever I send them . 10I will send war , famine , and disease until they have vanished from the land of Israel , which I gave to them and their ancestors . " <p> This system forced the best people to work directly for Nebuchadnezzar under close supervision because these were the people who could contribute the most and also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten figs according to Jeremiah ) were left behind and , as a result , were very loyal to Nebuchadnezzar and willing to pay tribute ( taxes ) since they still had their homes and land . But not forever . Interestingly , God promised to protect and help those taken into captivity but not the ones left behind . <p> 3 . What advice did Jeremiah have for the Jews that were taken into exile ? ( Jer 29:4-7 ) Would this advice be easy to follow ? ( Acts 5:29 ) <p> 4The Lord Almighty , the God of Israel , sends this message to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem : 5 " Build homes , and plan to stay . Plant gardens , and eat the food you produce . 6Marry , and have children . Then find spouses for them , and have many grandchildren . Multiply ! Do not dwindle away ! 7And work for the peace and prosperity of Babylon . Pray to the Lord for that city where you are held captive , for if Babylon has peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike immigrants to the U.S. who successfully blend and commingle in our society , the Jews were to be involved in the affairs of their nation and open to its culture , yet they were not to be conformed to its ways . In their witness they were to be distinctive , not only in what they said , but in what they did and what they were . <p> Even today this relationship between Christianity and culture remains an extremely difficult one , not only for missionaries abroad , but also for the church at home . Have you ever found it difficult to do as the apostles said in Acts 5:29 when Peter and the apostles replied , " We must obey God rather than human authority . " <p> 4 . Why did Nebuchadnezzar especially want young men for training ? ( Verse 1:4 ) <p> The spoken language of Babylonia was Aramaic , but the written language of scholarship was a very complicated Babylonia language . The academic program would have included mathematics , astronomy , history , science , and magic . So Nebuchadnezzar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather young men who were able and eager to learn . <p> 5 . Why three years of training ? <p> First of all , there was a lot to learn . Second , Nebuchadnezzar was much more interested in indoctrination than in education . In a sense , this is no different from college today . Colleges and universities are all too often used to shape and bend the minds of young people to particular ideological views . Except for Christian colleges , most state and private schools are opposed to Christianity and it seems that three to four years is about the time needed to flush out Christianity and give a young person a new point of view . Its also the right age to do it ; college age kids are still in the parental rebellion stage and if their parents views are replaced with something that sounds just as good , theyll glom onto it . <p> Several reasons . Primarily , new names would help them assimilate into the culture . But also the new names were an attempt to change their religious loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Name <p> New Name <p> Daniel : God is my judge <p> Belteshazzar : Bel ( Marduk ) , protect his life . <p> Hananiah : The Lord shows grace <p> Shadrach : under the command of Aku ( moon god ) <p> Misahel : who is like God ? <p> Meshach : who is like Aku ? <p> Azariah : the Lord helps <p> Abednego : servant of Nago ( god of learning ) <p> 7 . Do religions today ever use a similar type of indoctrination ? How about the Christian church ; has it ever used these methods ? <p> Islam is the best example today of a religion that indoctrinates young people and actively promotes intolerance of other religions and cultures . But this also happens in the Christian church . In fact , back in the early days of the OT , God changed names ( Abram to Abraham , Jacob to Israel , etc . ) . Over the years , there are many examples of bigotry and intolerance to safeguard doctrine at the expense of freedom and truth . Do n't  think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he did not want to become ritually unclean ( other translations say he did n't  want to defile himself ) . So basically , he was being faithful to the dietary restrictions of the Jewish Torah . <p> 9 . Does these verses promote being a vegetarian and teetotaler ? If not , what do they promote ? <p> Although there may well be benefits in being a vegetarian and teetotaler , Daniels request had only to do with the rights and wrongs of obeying God and the Jewish dietary laws . You might ask that since the Torah only prohibits eating pork ( pig ) , why wouldnt they eat other meat like beef and lamb ? The reason is that some portion of the Kings food might first have been offered to idols . <p> Most important , these are acts ( not words ) that testify to their Jewish faith and respect of the Lord their God . These young men had been loyal to God in Jerusalem ; they would be loyal to him here also . And acting as they did , their deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor with God than men of property . <p> But they also depended upon God . They willingly submitted to a test of ten days living on vegetables and water , which would certainly need the hand of God in determining the outcome . <p> 10 . To Daniel and his friends , what was it like to maintain their diet ( easy , traumatic , frightening , spiritual , risky ) ? <p> Probably most of the above , except easy . On the other hand , it certainly helped that there were four of them . Its a lot easier to follow an unpopular course of action if you have friends and supporters . One of the main tenets of Promise Keepers is the importance of having an accountability partner . War prisoners kept in isolation do unbelievable things to establish contact with other prisoners . <p> 11 . If you were Daniel , what resource would you have appreciated the most ? ( The helpful official , my three friends , Gods sustaining power , Jewish dietary laws , knowledge and understanding from God ) <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but have you ever been in a difficult situation and felt like asking , " where is God ? " Certainly belief in God is extremely important , but in a very practical sense , Daniels three friends were equally important . <p> 12 . What do you feel when you stand up for something you believe in ( confidence , power , peace , elation , fear , freedom ) ? <p> 13 . What often keeps you from taking a stand ( lack of confidence , apathy , ignorance , time , fear , possible bad consequences ) ? <p> 14 . What is your greatest resource for taking a stand ( Gods power , my family support , financial resources , others who share the same interest , prayers of myt small group , encouragement from Scripture , other ) ?

" <p> A drunk man who smelled like beer sat down on a subway seat next to a priest . The man 's tie was stained , his face was plastered with red lipstick , and a half empty bottle of gin was sticking out of his torn coat pocket . He opened his newspaper and began reading . After a few minutes the man turned to the priest and asked , " Say , Father , what causes arthritis ? " " My Son , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , too much alcohol , and a contempt for your fellow man . " Well , I 'll be damned , " the drunk muttered , returning to his paper .

" " I do n't have it , Father . I was just reading here that the Pope does . " <p> Going over our church finances I found a receipt from a local paint store signed by someone named Christian . I was n't aware of anyone buying paint , so I called the store to point out its mistake . " I 'm sorry , " I told the manager , " but there are no Christians here at First Baptist Church .

Rounding a sharp bend in the trail , he collided with a bear and was sent tumbling down a steep grade . He landed on a rock and broke both legs . With the ferocious bear charging at him from a distance , the preacher prayed , " O Lord , I 'm so sorry for skipping services today . Please forgive me and grant me just one wishmake a Christian out of that bear that 's coming at me ! " At that very instant , the bear skidded to a halt , fell to his knees , clasped his paws together , and began to pray aloud at the preacher 's feet : " Dear God , please bless this food I am about to receive .

Suddenly , Satan appeared at the front of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate . Soon everyone had exited the church except for one elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew without moving , seeming oblivious to the fact that God 's ultimate enemy was in his presence . So Satan walked up to the old man and said , " Do n't you know who I am ? " The man replied , " Yep , sure do . " " Are n't you afraid of me ? " Satan asked . " Nope , sure ai n't , " said the man . " Do n't you realize I can kill you with a word ? " asked Satan . " Do n't doubt it for a minute , " returned the old man , in an even tone . " Did you know that I could cause you profound , horrifying , physical AGONY ... for all eternity ? " persisted Satan . " Yep , " was the calm reply . " And you 're still not afraid ? " asked Satan .

The leader was a Baptist and proud of his denomination . " How many Baptists are here ? " he asked on the first night of the revival ? All except one little old lady raised their hands . " Lady , what are you ? " asked the leader . " I 'm a Methodist , " meekly replied the lady . " Why are you a Methodist ? " queried the leader ?

A Baptist , I suppose , " the lady replied meekly . <p> A teacher was testing the children in her Sunday school class to see if they understood the concept of getting to heaven . She asked them , " If I sold my house and my car , had a big garage sale and gave all my money to the church , would that get me into Heaven ? " " NO ! " the children answered . " If I cleaned the church every day , mowed the yard , and kept everything neat and tidy , would that get me into Heaven ? " Again , the answer was , " NO ! " Now she was smiling . Hey , they 're getting it , she thought ! " Well , then , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , and loved my husband , would that get me into Heaven ? " she asked . Again , they all answered , " NO !

" <p> Inspirational speaker Dr. Wayne Dyer still remembers the card his kids gave him for his 64th birthday . The front said , " Inside is a message from God . " Pleased they finally appreciated his work , he opened it to read , " See you soon ! " <p> A new pastor was visiting in the homes of his parishioners . At one house it seemed obvious that someone was at home , but no answer came to his repeated knocks at the door .

When the offering was processed the following Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added to it was this cryptic message , ' Genesis 3:10 .

' <p> The new minister stood at the church door greeting the members as they left the Sunday moring service . Most of the people were very generous telling the new minister how much they liked his message , except for one man who said , " The was a very dull and boring sermon , pastor . " A few minutes later , the same man again appeared in line and said , " I do n't think you did much preparation for your message . " Once again , the man appeared , this time muttering , " You really blew it . You did n't have a thing to say , pastor . " Finally , the minister could stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deacons and inquired about the man . " Oh , do n't let that guy bother you , " said the deacon . " He 's a little slow . All he does is go around repeating whatever he hears other people saying . " <p> At the pearly gates , St. Peter greeted a minister and congressman and gave them their room assignments . " Pastor , here are the keys to one of our nicest efficiency units . And for you , Mr. Congressman , the keys to our finest penthouse suite . " " This is unfair ! " cried the minister . " Listen , " St. Peter said , " ministers are a dime a dozen up here , but this is the first congressman we 've ever seen . " <p> At the pearly gates again , a taxi driver and minister are waiting in line . St. Peter consults his list and says to the taxi driver , " Take this silken robe and golden staff and enter the Kingdom of Heaven .

" While you preached , people slept ; while he drove , people prayed . " <p> Big Ed seemed to always fall asleep during the Sunday sermon . His wife was fed up and decided to deal with the embarrassing situation . The next Sunday when he fell asleep , she quietly removed some pungent Limburger cheese from a ziplock bag in her purse and passed it under his nose . Groggily startled , Big Ed blurted out , " No , Helen , nodo n't kiss me now . " <p> The children were lined up in the cafeteria of a Catholic elementary school for lunch .

With great expression he said , " If I had all the beer in the world , I 'd take it and throw it into the river ! " The congregation nodded their approval . With even greater emphasis he added , " And if I had all the wine in the world , I 'd take it and throw it into the river , too ! " The people clapped and were saying " Amen .

There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community , so the Pope offered a deal : he 'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community . If the Jews won , they could stay in Italy ; if the Pope won , they 'd have to convert or leave . The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate . However , as the rabbi spoke no Italian , and the Pope spoke no Yiddish , they agreed that it would be a ' silent ' debate . On the chosen day the Pope and rabbi sat opposite each other . The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers . The rabbi looked back and raised one finger . Next , the Pope waved his finger around his head . The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat . The Pope brought out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out an apple . With that , the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever . The Jews could stay in Italy .

He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs . Then , I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us . The rabbi responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us . I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins , and the rabbi pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin . He bested me at every move and I could not continue . ' Meanwhile , the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he 'd won .

The book was controversial and the English translation did not appear in the UK until 1991 and it was not released in the U.S. until 2002 . <p> The image to the right is from the 1930 's Dutch version with the first panel showing Tintin being wished well on his trip by a group of people including Quick &amp; Flupke and Totor from The Adventures of Totor , an Herge strip from 1926-28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the right , the later version of this panel from the extensively revised Tintin in the Congo book became the ultimate cameo . Flupke is now facing Tintin on the right while Quick has his back to us on the left along with Totor , one of the first and perhaps only time we 've seen him in color . Behind the gentleman shaking Tintin 's hand is Herge himself and behind him is Edgar P. Jacobs , Herge 's assistant from 1944 on . At the far right we see the Thom(p)son twins who had not been introduced until the fourth Tintin book , Cigars of the Pharaohs , which was completed several years after Tintin in the Congo . <p> The left image below is from the book , Tintin &amp; Snowy , Album 3 , a book of games , puzzles , and activities published by Egmont in 2007 . It is an enlargement ( 11 x 16 " ) of the center portion of the frame discussed above . The center and right images below are from the story , The Shooting Star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1941 . In this panel , which appears about one third of the way through the story , Quick and Flupke can be seen running towards the docks as the expedition is about to set off . For a variety of reasons , this story required extensive revision before its later release in book form , however , the panel with the Thom(p)sons and Quick &amp; Flupke remained unchanged from Le Soir ( center ) to the book ( right ) . <p> The only other appearance that might ( or might not ) be a cameo is from The Seven Crystal Balls in which a pair of boys play a trick on Captain Haddock by hiding a brick under a hat , which Haddock kicks ( page 59 ) . We see them two pages over on page 61 and they look slightly similar to Quick and Flupke . However , given Herge 's insistence on accuracy , one might question whether this is indeed Quick &amp; Flupke as the event takes place in La Rochelle in France and not Brussels , Belgium where the boys live .

Other scholars believe it was written from Syrian Antioch between 48 and 49 to the churches in the southern area of Galatia ( Antioch , Iconium , Lystra , and Derbe ) that Paul founded on his first missionary journey . A third view holds that it was written from Ephesus or Corinth between 51 and 53 . For the purposes of these Bible studies , the when and where does n't matter ; it 's the content that counts . <p> Occasion and Purpose The Galatian churches have come into being as a result of Paul 's missionary labors . He was moved to write this letter when he learned that certain Jewish Christians called Judaizers were seeking to impose many of the ceremonial practices of the Old Testament , especially circumcision on the Gentile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a desire to avoid the criticism ( Paul says " persecution , " although that seems unlikely ) of the Zealot Jews who objected to their fraternizing with Gentiles . The Judaizers also argued that Paul was not an authentic apostle and that out of a desire to make the message more appealing to Gentiles he had removed certain legal requirements . Paul responded by clearly establishing his apostolic authority and substantiating the gospel he preached . He says by introducing additional requirements for justification ( observing the law ) , his adversaries had perverted the gospel of grace and , unless prevented , would bring Paul 's converts into the bondage of legalism . It is by grace through faith alone that man is justified , and it is by faith alone that he is to live out his new life in the freedom of the Spirit . <p> Theological Teaching Galatians stands as an eloquent and vigorous apologetic for the essential New Testament truth that man is justified by faith in Jesus Christby nothing less and nothing moreand that he is sanctified not by legalistic works but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for him , in him , and through him by the grace and power of the Holy Spirit .

Later painters came to show him as a man on the verge of middle age , with dark hair and beard , and an appearance of sorrow and compassion . However , each age has produced its own variant of the Jesus image to meet its own needs , projections , and beliefs . <p> 2 . Did Jesus have : A. Long hair B. Short hair C. Receding hairline <p> Again , the Bible does n't  say . However , in 1 Corinthians 11:14 , Paul writes " If a man has long hair , it is a disgrace to him . " It seems unlikely that Paul would have written this if Jesus had had long hair . <p> 3 . Was Jesus : A. Short B. Average height C. Tall <p> The image on the Shroud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shroud of Jesus ) is of a man variously estimated to be 5 ' 11+ " to 6 ' 2 " tall . Tremendous controversy has arisen over the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin and its origins and image are the subject of intense debate among scientists , theologians , historians and researchers . You may wish to review this at Shroud of Turin on Wikipedia . Jews who lived in the first century were quite short . Researchers have projected average heights in Biblical times at 5 ' 1 " up to as tall as 5 ' 5 " . Around 5 ' 1 " to 5 ' 2 " seems to be the best consensus . Writer William Harwood makes the point that if Jesus were really 6 ' tall ( as indicated by the Shroud ) , his height would have been so remarkable that it certainly would have been mentioned by one or more writers in the Bible . Harwood also reports , " According to Flavius Josephus , a medieval Jewish historian , Jesus was an old-looking some sources say " odd-looking " man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 135 cm ( 4 ' 6 " ) tall . " But , says Harwood , this is based on the standard 46-cm-long regular cubit , an ancient unit of measure . Using the 53-cm special cubit , Jesus height would have been about 156 cm ( 5 ' 1 " ) . <p> 4 . Was Jesus : A. Handsome B. Average C. Ugly <p> Echoing Harwood , the historian , Robert Eisler , quotes Josephus in Halosis as describing Jesus as " a man of simple appearance , mature age , small stature , three cubits high 4 ' 6 " , hunch-backed , with a long face , long nose , and meeting eyebrows , so that they who see him might be affrighted , with scanty hair ... with a parting in the middle of his head , after the manner of the Nazirites , and with an undeveloped beard . " The authors of Luke-Acts and John both equated Jesus with the suffering slave ( or servant ) described by Isaiah 52:13-53:12 . Isaiah had written of the Lords servant , " His appearance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marred beyond human likeness we should desire him . " ( 53:2 ) Even allowing that John used Luke as a source , why would either author have equated Jesus with such an unfortunate creature ? The answer that springs to mind is that they were putting the best possible spin on the reality that the physical description of Isaiahs suffering slave matched the physical description of Jesus . <p> 5 . Could Jesus read or write ? A. Yes B. Very little C. No <p> Jesus lived long before the day of printed books . Hand-copied scrolls were extremely costly and a carpenter would not have any in his home , so Jesus as the son of a carpenter certainly did not learn to read at home . But he did learn it someplace because Luke states in 4:16-17 that Jesus went into the synagogue and stood up to read the scroll of the prophet Isaiah . The scroll was most likely written in Hebrew and either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common language of the day . Jesus is frequently quoted as saying , " it is written " and " search the scriptures , " which suggests he could read quite well . Reading and perhaps writing in Hebrew and Aramaic was helpful to getting along in Jerusalem . Because of the Roman occupation of Israel , Jesus may possibly have known some Latin as well . Some people postulate that he also knew Greek , but that 's a bit of a stretch . <p> 6 . Was Jesus : A. Slender B. Average build C. Chubby <p> If he was a carpenter ( see Q 7 ) , he would have had a well-developed muscular body . He is described as eating and drinking in a wide variety of settings and we do n't  hear of any illnesses , allergies , or food preferences . He presumably had a powerful voice because he preached to large crowds . We know that no Biblical writer remarked on any special physical characteristics , skin disease , or the like , so we can speculate that physically Jesus was a fairly average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A century after Jesus died , there were many tales about his infancy and childhood . A famous Greek martyr named Justin claimed that Jesus made ploughs and yokes in his fathers workshop . Most people think that Jesus was a carpenter . Mark , in 6:3 says : " Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary " but Matthew 13:55 has a slightly different wording : " Is not this the carpenters son ? Is not his mother called Mary ? " Takumi opines that " it is highly unlikely that Jesus was a carpenter . If we examine the 48 parables that occur in the Gospels , not a single one draws upon the experiences of a carpenter . Three of them refer to buildings ( e.g. , house divided , foolish builder , unfinished tower ) , and these may offer support for the idea that Jesus father was a builder , not a carpenter . " Or Jesus may have been a builder . Margaret Starbird writes , " in the Gospels , Jesus is called a tekton , a Greek word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or furniture but a designer , construction engineer , or architect . A tekton could build a house , construct a bridge , or design a temple . " And for a view from left field , we have Stanley E. Porter who says , " ... the Greek word for carpenter in the gospels actually stands for an underlying Aramaic term that is used metaphorically in the Talmud to denote a scholar . " And then there is Upton Sinclair who wrote in 1952 , " its also possible that Jesus and his family belonged to a group known as the Sleb , a still existing band of Bedouins , found mostly in Syria , whose ancestry and customs include not only the Essenes but claim to go all the way back to Cain . This would explain the propensity to travel , which Robert Eisler ( 1931 ) has argued ( in The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist ) , claiming that Jesus family plied their trade in the timeless manner of the Sleb . Interestingly , the Sleb were known to be accomplished in carpentry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they fit well within the definitions of tekton , the name used to describe Josephs occupation . They were also known to be healers . " <p> 8 . Was Jesus : A. Poor B. Moderate income C. Rich <p> There are many people today such as Oral Roberts , Creflo Dollar , Kenneth Hagin , Tom Brown , C. Thomas Anderson , and John Avanzini who teach that Jesus was rich . Frederick K.C. Price states , " only rich people could take off for 3+ years to preach . The Bible says that Jesus had a treasurer , Judas Iscariot ; and he was stealing out of the bag for 3+ years and nobody knew it . Why not ? Because there was so much in the bag , that Jesus and the disciples could n't tell if anything was missing . If Jesus was poor and did n't  have anything , why did he need a treasury ? A treasury is for surplus . Its not for that which you 're spending . Its only for surplusto hold it until you need to spend it . " Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in a house ! ) after his birth and bringing very expensive gifts of gold , frankincense ( a fine perfume ) , and myrrh ( an aromatic oil used in healing and embalming ) . There were probably more ordinary gifts brought too but only these three costly ones are mentioned in the Bible . On the other hand , supporting the view that he was poor is the fact that Jesus was born in a stable ( although there are major questions about that ) . His parents knew the approximate time of his birth so they could have reserved a place and God could have made sure they had a room but it was to be in a humble place , possible a stable or a cave ( Luke 2:22-24 ) . Why did Mary in her praise say , " He has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty . " Archeological excavations of Nazareth show the village of Jesus day was occupied by poor agricultural people . Later , as Jesus grew up , he worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its wealth . In Luke 2:22-24 , Jesus is taken to the Temple by his parents where they offered a sacrifice of two pigeons ( the sacrifice of a poor family according to Leviticus 12:8 . ) If they had been rich , they would have had to make a larger sacrifice . If they did not and were rich they broke the law . There are many other Scripture verses that speak to Jesus not being rich , but let 's just consider his earthly end . He was buried in another mans tomb , that of a rich man . If Jesus or his family was rich , they surely would have buried him in his own family tomb . But neither his family nor his apostles had the money to buy a tomb . <p> 9 .

For more than you ever wanted to know about this , see : Origin of Jesus Name . <p> 10 . When was Jesus born ? A. December 25 B. January 6 C. In the spring D. In the fall <p> A surprising number of people believe that Jesus was born on Dec 25 . His actual birthday is unknown , although there are some indicators in the Gospels that it happened in the spring or fall . The early Christian church did not celebrate Jesus birth . It was n't until 354 AD that the church officially proclaimed December 25 as the birth of Christ . This was not based on any religious evidence but on a pagan feast . Saturnalia was a tradition inherited by the Roman pagans from an earlier Babylonian priesthood and December 25 , just after the winter solstice , was when the birthday of the sun god was celebrated . Until then , Eastern Orthodox religions celebrated his birth as late at night on January 6 . There are a number of scriptures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John the Baptist was born on 15 Nisan ( Jewish 2nd month ) which is approximately April 1 by modern reckoning . Jesus was born approx six months later , which would be approx Oct 1 . Extensive proof of this is presented at Jesus Birth Date . What year ? Jesus had to have been born either before 4 BC ( when Herod the Great died ) or in 6 AD ( when the historical Census of Quirinius was undertaken ) . Because both Gospel accounts agree that the birth took place before the death of Herod , Jesus was most likely born around 4 BC or slightly before ( 5 BC ) . Lots more at Jesus Birth Year .. <p> In North America , Jesus is most often depicted as being taller than his disciples , lean , with long flowing , light brown hair , fair skin , and light-colored eyes . Familiar as this image may be , it is inherently flawed . A person with these features and physical bearing would have looked very different from everyone else in the region where Jesus lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned such a stark contrast . On the contrary , according to Matthew ( 26:48 ) , when Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane , Judas Iscariot had to indicate to the soldiers who Jesus was because they could not tell him apart from his disciples . This suggests that he was rather ordinary . Nowhere in the New Testament is Jesus described , there are no known drawings of him , and we have neither a skeleton nor other bodily remains . Thus , our images of Jesus have been left to the imagination of artists and film makers who , in turn , were influenced by the cultures and traditions of their time and location . While Western imagery is dominant , in other parts of the world he is often shown as black , Arab , or Hispanic . And so the question remains , what did Jesus look like ?

Neave emphasizes that their recreation is simply that of an average adult man who lived in the same place and at the same time as Jesus . Not everyone agrees , of course , that Jesus would have looked like that . But it is probably a lot closer to the truth than the work of most painters and film makers .

The Jews traced their lineage through Abrahams legitimate son , Isaac , the son of Sarah , and regarded Ishmael , the son of Hagar , as an outcast . Here , Paul tells them that Hagar represents the covenant given on Mt . Sinai , which is the law that the Jews in Jerusalem pride themselves on keeping .

One important aspect of character is a good reputation . It is often said that your reputation goes before you . Notable success often results in a noteworthy reputation but the opposite is also true . <p> Think of some examples of people with a good reputation and some with a bad reputation and discuss why their reputations are what they are . ( Some suggestions : Sam Walton , Ted Turner , Michael Jackson , Bill Gates , Jon Corzine , Jane Fonda , Ted Kennedy , Hillary Clinton . ) <p> Some examples : Sam Walton 's reputation is based on Wal-Mart stores and his passion to bring everyday low prices and good customer service to the consumer . He was true to this vision for his entire career and Wal-Mart stores today carry on his philosophy . In contrast , Jane Fonda had a good reputation for her excellent acting , but she lost it completely when she went to Hanoi and spoke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer horrible torture . She now says that she has become a Christian , but most people do n't believe her or forgive her for the horrendous pain she caused . One 's reputation is sometimes based on a single incident , but more often evolves over time from a pattern of behavior . A reputation is generally based on what you do and not what you say . <p> Do you believe that the world needs men : <p> ... who can not be bought ? <p> ... whose word is their bond ? <p> ... who put character above wealth ? <p> Do you think that others in the world believe this ? <p> There are very few people in the world that would disagree with the first three statements . On the other hand , many people 's actions show that they can , in fact , be bought , that their word can not be trusted , and that they put wealth above everything else . So again , we see that reputation is based more on what you do than what you say . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's bad for you , " and you see him later lighting up a cigarette , which speaks louder , what he says or what he does ? <p> Read Philemon 1-25 . In 60 A.D. , during his first imprisonment in Rome , Paul wrote this private , personal letter to a friend , Philemon , a wealthy member of the Colossian church . Its purpose was to convince Philemon to forgive his runaway slave , Onesimus , and to accept him as a brother in the faith . ( Note that Paul does not condemn slavery , which was common in the Roman empire , but he does make a radical statement by calling this slave Philemon 's brother in Christ . ) <p> What kind of reputation did Onesimus have with Philemon , his employer , when he ran away ? <p> From the Bible passage , we do n't really know . He may have been the head chef or a skilled craftsman and had a fine reputation . However , his running away certainly ruined , or badly tainted , whatever prior reputation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've been working together for several months . You 're working on a big job and one day , one of the crew members does n't show up - no call , no nothing . And then someone reports seeing him off fishing . What happens to his reputation as a hard worker , a good crew member ? <p> Onesimus was not only a runaway employee but probably stole money from Philemon as well ( suggested in vs 18 ) . Why do you think that Paul would associate with such a disreputable person ? <p> There are many possible reasons . First of all , Onesimus made a long and ardurous journey involving at least two long passages by ship , from Colossae to Rome . Paul could not help but be moved by someone who would come this far to see him . Second , we do not know why Onesimus left . Was he being mistreated ? Did he have some sort of breakdown ? Did he go to Paul because he thought that Paul needed him ? Third , and perhaps most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and welcome anyone , whatever their reason for coming to him . In a sense , Paul was like a rescue mission today with its doors open to people who are homeless , addicted , hungry , and hurting . The mission takes them in and tends to their immediate needs , after which their crimes or other issues can be dealt with , just as Paul did with Onesimus . <p> How do you think that Onesimus must have changed so that he moved from being " useless " to " useful " ( vs 11 ) to both Paul and Philemon ? ( Colossians 4:9 ) <p> We do n't know enough to answer this definitively . Perhaps Onesimus had a special talent or was a skilled chef . One commentator suggests that this is a play on words , as the name Onesimus means " useful . " However , what we do know is that Onesimus came to be a Christian believer ( vs. 10 and Colossians 4:9 ) while he was with Paul and Paul suggests to Philemon that Onesimus , as a believer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , should be forgiven and welcomed back . <p> Why do we , along with Philemon , have a very difficult time changing our minds about the previous poor reputation of someone , a boss , employee , fellow worker , or classmate ? <p> " A reputation is like fine China - easily chipped and difficult to repair . " Our pastor recently commented that he can get 30 positive comments about a sermon and one negative one , and he 'll lose sleep thinking the sermon was lousy because of the one negative comment . When I used to live in a small town , ten years without a single homicide did not make the news , but one murder made the headlines for weeks . Reputations are like that : you can build it up for years and destroy it with one stupid action . <p> The passage does n't say whether Philemon rehired Onesimus or not .

Would you rehire this former employee ? <p> Put yourself in Philemon 's position and imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 15 or 20 employees . Let 's say that they have the same makeup as the general population so that 2 or 3 are born-again Christians and the rest are occasional churchgoers , Jews , Muslums , aethists , agnostics . One of these non-Christians leaves under dubious circumstances . You then receive a letter from Billy Graham saying he spent some time with this man , he became a Christian , and how would you like to rehire him ? Is this a no-brainer ? <p> Why do you think that this unusual letter was included in the New Testament ? <p> The easy answer , of course , is that the Bible is the inspired word of God and God wanted this letter included . But also , this small book is a masterpiece of grace and tact and a profound demonstration of the power of Christ and of true Christian fellowship in action .

@@58355428 @7355428/ <h> HergT Georges Prosper RemiCreator of Tintin and So Many Others <p> Georges Prosper Remi was born into a middle-class family in Etterbeek , Brussels on May 22 , 1907 . As a youngster , he was keenly interested in Scouting , something that would prove highly influential on his later work . He initially produced illustrations for the Belgian Le Boy-Scout magazine , including an illustrated story , Les Aventures de Totor , C.P. des Hannetons ( The Adventures of Totor , Patrol Leader of the Cockchafers ( UK ) or Maybugs ( the more common translation ) . In1927 he began working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le XXe SiFcle , where he adopted the pen name " HergT , " based upon the French pronunciation of " RG , " his initials reversed . <p> After Totor came a number of short-lived characters such as Tim the Squirrel , Tom and Millie ( Tim had morphed into a bear cub named Tom ) , Fred and Mile , Mr. Mops , Popol and Virginie , and Dropsy . But by far his best-known character was Tintin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( one uncompleted ) , which he wrote and illustrated from 1929 until his death in 1983 . He also created two other well-known comic book series , Quick &amp; Flupke ( 1930-1940 ) and Jo , Zette and Jocko ( 1936-1957 ) . Two pages of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets first appeared on January 10 , 1929 in black and white on the pages of Le Petit VingtiFm e a weekly youth supplement to Le VingtiFme SiFcle , the renamed Le XXe SiFcle . The story , which ran until May 8 , 1930 , chronicled the adventures of a young reporter named Tintin and his pet fox terrier Snowy ( Milou ) as they journeyed through the Soviet Union . A year later in January 1930 , Quick &amp; Flupke , two street urchins from Brussels , made their debut in what was to become a series of 310 self-contained two-page comic strips ( called " gags " in Europe ) . The Quick &amp; Flupke strips were especially clever because many of them had both a visual gag and a verbal one . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verbal gag involves a pun or rhyming words in French . ( I should know , having translated 48 of these strips ) . HergT says , " I had to abandon these rascals ( in 1936 ) because they were causing me a lot of worry as I became increasingly occupied with Tintin . " Two pages of Tintin continued to appear every Thursday until May 1940 , when the Germans invaded Belgium . As the war progressed , paper shortages forced Tintin to be published in a daily three- or four-frame strip , which meant that HergT had to introduce more frequent gags and faster-paced action . Also , in order to avoid controversy , the focus of the adventures had to be moved away from current affairs . Almost all of the Tintin adventures have a vivid humanism and a realistic feel produced by meticulous and wide ranging research , and , of course , HergT 's drawing style . Even adults enjoy Tintin for the many satirical references to the history and politics of the 20th century . HergT died on March 3 , 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his native Belgium . An HergT Museum was opened in Louvain-La-Neuve in June 2009 . And to this day his work remains a strong influence on comic artists , especially in Europe .

So rather than duplicating what has already been done , I 've tried to look at Herge 's work from some different angles and focus on characters other than Tintin .

@@58355437 @7355437/ <p> NOTE : Answers are provided for only some of the questions . Many questions are primarily to stimulate discussion and there are no right or wrong answers . <p> 1 . In the first four chapters , we have read about King Nebuchadnezzar . Now , King Belshazzar appears , Who is he ? What does his name mean ? <p> In verse 13 and 18 , Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as Belshazzars father , although the Aramaic term could also mean that Belshazzar was the grandson or descendant or even successor of Nebuchadnezzar . Actually , 66 years have passed since Chapter 1 and Nebuchadnezzar died after reigning for 43 years . Since his death , there were four other rulers , the current one being Nabonidus . Actually , Belshazar is Nabonidus son and he is currently serving as co-regent with his father . The name means , " Bel , protect the king . " ( Remember , Daniels new name , Beltshazzar means " Bel , protect his life . " ) Bel is another name for Marduk , one of the Babylonian gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have regarded using the gold goblets taken from the temple in Jerusalem for drinking wine at a drunken orgy at which other gods were praised ? ( 2 Samuel 6:6-7 ) <p> You almost have to be surprised that God did n't  strike everyone dead . After all , when Uzzah reached out to steady the Ark of the Covenant , he was immediately struck dead . <p> 3 . In Verse 7 , Belshazzar promises to make whoever interprets the writing on the wall the third highest ruler in the kingdom . Who were the first two ? <p> As we 've discussed , Belshazzar was co-reigning with his father , Nabonidus , so Nabonidus was the highest ruler ; Belshazzar was second , and the person who interpreted the writing on the wall would be number 3 . <p> 4 . The writing on the wall was only three words in Aramaic ( see Verse 25 ) . Why do you suppose the kings wise men ( or anyone else at the banquet ) were unable to determine what they meant ? ( Job 32:8-9 ) <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how great the reward . <p> 5 . Who was the queen who appeared in Verse 10 ? <p> Since Belshazzars wives were with him at the banquet , it was probably the wife of Nabonidus or one of his predecessors , possibly even Nebuchadnezzars wife . This makes the most sense since she would have known about Daniels ability to interpret dreams from many years before . <p> 6 . What does Daniels rejection of flattery and rewards ( verse 17 ) say about the authenticity of the man and his message ? How would you respond if you were in a similar situation ? <p> Clearly , Daniel is not doing this for the rewards . He already had a high position under Nebuchadnezzar , although he is now quite old and with four other rulers having been in power , it may well be that he has retired from active service . <p> 7 . How would you interpret the following words on a wall:DOLLAR DOLLAR PENNY QUARTER <p> 8 . What does the handwriting on the wall mean ? How is this prophecy fulfilled ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Dan 2:36-39 ) <p> The interpretation is actually a pun on the words . The words represent three coins : MENE ( or mina ) , TEKEL ( or shekel , which is one sixtieth of a mina ) , and PARSIN ( which means two half minas ) . Daniels interpretation changes the nouns to verbs so that MENE becomes " numbered , " TEKEL becomes " weighed , " and PARSIN becomes " divided . " Hence , the interpretation in Verses 26-28 . <p> The prophecy is fulfilled that same night when Belshazzar was slain and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom . <p> 9 . What contemporary examples come to mind of people mocking God by demeaning sacred things as Belshazzar did with the temple goblets ? <p> Religious ikons become household decorations or works of art . In Christmas mangers , the holy family is joined by snowmen and reindeer . <p> 10 . Then and now , does it seem that God is quick or slow to judge such sacrilegious behavior ?

Indeed sometimes God seems to let things go on today without judging at all . But if we believe the words in Habakkuk , we can be confident that eventually God will judge everyone . <p> 11 . What would you do if you were offered a position of power as a way to buy your vote or predetermine your thinking ? Does this happen today ? <p> 12 .

" Quick " was the name of a friend of Herge ; " Flup " in Flemish is the diminutive for Philip and " ke " means little so Flupke means " little Philip . " The two boys unintentionally cause trouble , often aggrivating their parents , neighbors , shopkeepers , and the police . The Quick &amp; Flupke strips ( called " gags " in Europe ) were published in black and white on the pages of Le Petit VingtiFme a weekly youth supplement to the conservative Catholic newspaper , Le VingtiFme SiFcle .

Volume 1 ( 1930 ) was reprinted as a replica book in 2011 , and two others have followed . Some of the strips were also republished in the 50 's in Tintin magazine , conceived by Raymond Leblanc , this time colored by Studios HergT . HergT eventually abandoned Quick &amp; Flupke in order to spend more time on The Adventures of Tintin , his more famous series . Over the years , most of the strips were colored by Studios HergT and published in two series of books , both titled Les Exploits de Quick et Flupke by the Casterman publishing house .

@@58355454 @7355454/ <p> In this section , Paul touches on three issues : 1 ) divisions in the church at Corinth , 2 ) marriage relationships , 3 ) proper attitudes and conduct in worship . Let 's look at each one . <p> Divisions in the church <p> 1 . In Pauls time , Jewish women always covered their heads in worship . Greek women ( Gentiles ) did not . What was Pauls solution ? What do you think of it ? <p> A : Pauls solution that all women should wear a head covering comes from his desire for unity among church members and for respect ( or appropriateness ) in the worship service . It builds on the principle in earlier chapters that if anything you do offends other people , in this case Christians , and if it divides the church , then change your ways to promote unity in the church . Thus , Paul told the women who were not wearing a head covering to wear one , not because it was a scriptural command , but because it kept the congregation from dividing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Christ . <p> 2 . Like a military chain of command , Paul lays out Gods lines of authority . What are they ? ( Verse 11:3 ) <p> A : Verse 3 : GodChristmanwoman . Most Bible translations use the word " head " to indicate authority , but the footnote in the NLT is interesting in that it equates being the head with " the source " and being " responsible to . " In order for the world to function and for the church to function , God laid out lines of authority and submission in certain relationships to prevent chaos . Paul reiterates that here . <p> Marriage Relationships <p> 3 . Paul emphasizes that a woman must not dishonor her husband ( vs 5 ) , she must reflect his glory ( vs 7 ) and show that she is under his authority ( vs 10 ) . What do you think of this ? What do you think a member of NOW would say to this ? <p> A : This is Gods line of authority , not something that Paul made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring wives , in all ways , to show respect for their husbands by submitting to their authoritynot merely by a particular style of attire but by Godly lives . After all , God made the wife out of mans body to be his helper and companion . Thus , she is to honor her husband by submitting to him as her head . Other commentators feel that what Paul was saying reflected only marriage relationships at that time in Corinth and he was writing about a temporary cultural issue of covering or not covering ones head that does not apply today . Youll have to decide for yourself which of these is correct . <p> 4 . The husband having authority over the wife implies that the wife must be submissive . Does bing submissive mean that the wife should surrender ? Withdraw ? Be apathetic ? Does it mean she is inferior ? <p> A : No , absolutely not . As I said before , God ordained submission in certain relationships so they would function smoothly and minimize confusion and chaos . Submission does not mean withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All people were created in Gods image and all have equal value . Submission does mean mutual commitment and cooperation . God calls for submission among equals . He did not make the man superior ; he made a way for man and woman to work together . Jesus is equal to God , yet Jesus submitted to God to carry out Gods plan for salvation of all of us . Likewise , although the wife is equal to her husband , she should submit to him for the sake of their marriage and family . <p> Submission between equals is submission by choice , not by force . We serve God by being submissive to our spouses , church leaders and government authorities . <p> Although there should be lines of authority in marriage , there should not be lines of superiority . God created men and women with unique and complementary characteristics . We should use our unique gifts not to belittle one another but to strengthen our marriages and glorify God . <p> Proper attitudes and conduct in worship <p> 5 . In this section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get lost in the discussion of covering ones head and long and short hair , and lines of authority and submission . What is the central principle here ? ( Verses 4 , 7 ) <p> A : In our worship , we must honor God and Christ . God made man in his image and man should show his respect for God and reflect Gods glory , especially in worship . <p> 6 . Why does Paul mention that " angels are watching " in Verse 10 ? <p> A : Angels are perhaps mentioned because they are interested in all aspects of a Christians salvation and are sensitive to decorum in worship . Michael Marlowe has an entire long page of his Bible commentary web site devoted to this one verse . He summarizes , " In Jewish tradition , and also in the early Church , angels are said to be present at sacred gatherings and sacred times , to watch over and to join with the saints in their spiritual exercises .

" <p> 7 . Answer this next question bearing in mind that Pauls letter did , in fact , focus on some specific cultural issues of Corinth that do not apply today . How do people dishonor Christ in worship services today ? <p> A : Christians must be conscious of how their actions appear in their culture in light of what is considered honorable , respectful behavior . In Guatemala , for example , where I have taken several missions trips , people are quite offended if women wear slacks , shorts , or even a short skirt to church . Here in the US , I still wear a jacket and tie to church even though others come in torn jeans and a backward baseball cap . Personally , I find that offensive and to me it dishonors God . I also find it offensive when members of our praise team appear in dirty jeans and when our pastor gives a sermon wearing a T-shirt . <p> 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , what should you do ?

It is available to everyone , not only to people who have a high IQ or college degree . Gods wisdom sounds foolish to those who do not have the Holy Spirit in them . Gods wisdom can not be earned . <p> 7 . Why did Pauls words here carry authority ? ( Verse 13 ) <p> A : Pauls words were authoritative because their source was the Holy Spirit .

( Leviticus 18:8 , Deuteronomy 27:20 ) <p> A : Incest was practically unheard of in Roman society . Also , the OT strictly prohibited such relations . Lev 18:8 - Do not have sexual relations with your fathers wife ; that would dishonor your father . Deuteronomy 27:20 - " Cursed is the man who sleeps with his father 's wife , for he dishonors his father 's bed . " <p> 2 . How can someone be proud of such immoral behavior ? Have you ever bragged about doing something wrong ? Of getting away with something ? <p> A : Perhaps they are proud of their libertya distortion of grace .

Moreover , the man was given to the devil not in some magical way but by deliberately expelling him from the church . To expel him is to put him in the devils territory , severed from any connection with Gods people , a truly horrible situation . But Paul seems confident that the man being officially ostracized from the church will cause him so much anguish that he will repent and forsake his wicked ways . <p> 5 . Paul refers to yeast in verse 6 alluding back to what law ? . How is yeast frequently referred to in the Bible ? ( Exodus 12:15 , Mark 8:15 ) <p> A : If you look ahead to the next verse , Paul refers to Christ as the Passover Lamb . So here he is probably alluding to the prohibition against the use of yeast in the bread eaten in the Passover . Exodus 12:15 - For seven days you must eat bread made without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must remove all yeast from your homes .

Jesus warned them , " Watch out ! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod . " <p> 6 . From the yeast imagery , what is Pauls concern if this situation is allowed to go on without discipline ( i.e. , expelling this man ) ? How is this consistent with the " new bread " they have become ? <p> A : Paul feels that the man is like yeast in the Corinthian congregation and his evil ways will spread . For discussion : does evil spread more easily than goodness ?

Before Communion , does the pastor of your church ever refer to the bread as representing something more than the body of Christ ? ( See Verse 8 ) <p> 9 . Why is there a difference between the way Christians relate to those in the faith and the way they relate to non-believers ? ( Verses 9-11 ) <p> 10 .

If the true Christian has intimate association with someone who does this , the non-Christian world may assume that the church approves such immoral , ungodly living , and thus the name of Christ would be dishonored . Questions could arise concerning the true character of the Christians own testimony . <p> A : The church is to exercise spiritual discipline over believers in the church ( Matt 18:15-18 ) but it is not to attempt to judge the unsaved world . There are governing authorities to do that ( Romans 13:1-5 ) and the ultimate judgement of the world is to be left to God ( Rev 20:11-15 ) . <p> Matthew 18:15-18 - If one of my followers sins against you , go and point out what was wrong .

What 's wrong with saying that ? <p> A : Paul repeats the statement ( for himself ) but observes that such freedom of action may not benefit the Christian . By saying , " I will not be mastered by anything , " Paul is effectively saying that one may become enslaved by those actions in which he freely indulges . How about drinking too much alcohol ? You 're free to do it ; there 's no law against it ; many people in our society do it ; but it can master you and be harmful to you . <p> 2 .

@@58355491 @7355491/ <p> Ephesus Ephesus was the most important city in western Asia Minor ( now Turkey ) . It had a harbor that at that time opened into the Cayster River , which in turn emptied into the Aegean Sea . Because it was also at an intersection of major trade routes , Ephesus became a commercial center . It boasted a pagan temple dedicated to the Roman goddess Diana ( Greek Artemis ) , cf. Acts 19:23-31 . Paul made Ephesus a center for evangelism for about three years , and the church there apparently flourished for some time , but later needed the warning of Rev 2:1 -7 . <p> Theological Message Unlike several of the other letters Paul wrote , Ephesians does not address any particular error or heresy . Paul wrote to expand the horizons of his readers , so that they might understand better the dimensions of Gods eternal purpose and grace and come to appreciate the high goals God has for the church . The letter opens with a sequence of statements about Gods blessings , which are interspersed with a remarkable variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul emphasizes that we have been saved , not only for our personal benefit , but also to bring praise and glory to God . The climax of Gods purpose , " when the times will have reached their fulfillment , " is to bring all things in the universe together under Christ ( 1:10 ) . It is crucially important that Christians realize this , so in 1:15-23 Paul prays for their understanding ( a second prayer occurs in 3:14 -21 ) . Having explained Gods great goals for the church , Paul proceeds to show the steps toward their fulfillment . First , God has reconciled individuals to himself as an act of grace ( 2:1-10 ) . Second , God has reconciled these saved individuals to each other , Christ having broken down the barriers through his own death ( 2:11-22 ) . But God has done something even beyond this : He has united these reconciled individuals in one body , the church . This is a " mystery " not fully known until it was revealed to Paul ( 3:1-6 ) . Now Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended for the church , namely , that it be the means by which he displays his " manifold wisdom " to the " rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms. " ( 3:7-13 ) . It is clear through the repetition of " heavenly realms " ( 1:3,20 ; 2:6 ; 3:10 ; 6:12 ) that Christian existence is not merely on an earthly plane . It receives its meaning and significance from heaven , where Christ is exalted at the right hand of God ( 1:20 ) . Nevertheless , that life is lived out on earth , where the practical daily life of the believer continues to work out the purposes of God . The ascended Lord gave " gifts " to the members of his church to enable them to minister to one another and so promote unity and maturity ( 4:1-16 ) . The unity of the church under the headship of Christ foreshadows the uniting of " all things in heaven and on earth " under Christ ( 1:10 ) . The new life of purity and mutual deference stands in contrast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who are " strong in the Lord " have victory over the evil one in the great spiritual conflict , especially through the power of prayer ( 6:10-20 ) . <p> Author , Recipients Traditionally . the letters to the Ephesians , Philippians . Colossians , and Philemon were assumed to have been written by Paul during his imprisonment in Rome ( Acts 28:16-31 ) , and were consequently called " captivity epistles . " The attribution of all of these to Paul , and the recognition that references to imprisonment and the imperial guard do not necessarily mean imprisonment in Rome because there were detachments of the emperor 's guards at various places , have led most scholars to abandon this interpretation . Despite the traditional title , therefore , and the references to sender and recipient in 1:1 ( with further reference to the sender in 3:1 ) , most scholars doubt that Ephesians is by Paul , and many doubt that it is in fact a letter . The similarity of this text to the letter to the Colossians , which is also of uncertain Pauline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pseudepigraphy ) ; in addition , its theology and vocabulary do not reflect Pauls concerns , especially in presenting resurrection as a current rather than a future event ( 2:1-2,6 ; cf. Rom 6:5-8 , Phil 3:10-11 ) . It mentions " heavenly places " ( 1:3 , 20 , 2:6 ; 3:10 ; 6:12 ) and speaks of Christ as " the head " of the church , which is " his body " ( 1:22-23 ; 4:11 , 15-16 ) , key theological expressions absent from the undisputed Pauline epistles . Nor does it deal with the relationship of the community to Torah , a major focus of Pauls writings in Galatians and Romans . The texts connection to Ephesus is also problematic : the words " in Ephesus " ( 1:1 ) are absent from some of the best early manuscripts . Defenders of Pauline authorship argue that the letter was written late in Pauls ministry for a different audience .

Maybe I should have listened to my father-in-law whose motto was " spend your money on toys and tools and the future will take care of itself .

The cost of the M37 plus out-of-pocket expenses for vehicle parts and services came to more than $12,000 . Add in the cost of labor ( myself and friends ) at minimum rates , and the amount I had in it was $18,000 plus , far more than anyone would pay for it , even if it were the best M37 on the planet ( which I like to think it was ) . <p> Uh , oh .

@@58355515 @7355515/ <p> A Sure Sign of Life The book of James , controversial because of its emphasis on " good works , " is perhaps best understood through the analogy of motion . In both the physical realm as well as the spiritual realm , where there is life there will be motion . When a person becomes a Christian , new life begins , and inevitably that life must express itself through " spiritual motion , " or good deeds . In James ' words , " What good is it ... if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds ? " ( 2:14 ) Movement does not cause life , but it does inevitably follow life . It is a sure sign that life is present . Similarly , genuine faith in Christ should always result in actions that demonstrate faith . <p> Does James Contradict Paul ? James is not writing about how to become a Christian , but rather how to act like one . Having all the correct beliefs about God will hardly suffice : even demons believe in God . Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no words in describing the specific spiritual actions expected of Christians . Christian thinkers , notably Martin Luther , have struggled to reconcile the message of James with that of Paul , who so firmly warned against slavish legalism . But Paul never belittled holy living . When he wrote to carousers , such as his letter to the Corinthians , he railed against immorality as strongly as James . Evidently , James ' readers were not even flirting with legalism . They lived at the other extreme , ignoring the laws that God had clearly revealed . James had a simple remedy : " Do not merely listen to the word .... Do what it says . " ( 1:22 ) <p> Straight to the Point Unlike the apostle Paul , James was no urbane man of letters . He was a simple , homespun preacher , perturbed at people who were not living right . His letter covers a wide range of topics , applying the Christian faith to specific problems , and commanding readers to live out their beliefs . Be humble ! James orders . Submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an Old Testament prophet ; it is hard to miss his point . Modern readers of James face the same dilemma as the first recipients of this unsettling letter . His words are easy enough to understand , but are we doing as he says ? What kind of motion characterizes our spiritual lives ? As Luther himself said , " You are saved by faith alone , but if faith is alone , it is not faith . " As leader of the headquarters church in Jerusalem , James knew how to speak with authority . You do n't have to look for hidden meanings in this book . James tells you clearly how you should act in 54 direct commands . Note that many of these have parallels to Jesus ' Sermon on the Mount . As you study these verses , keep in mind the diverse audience he was addressing which included the rich and the poor .

For most of the lessons , there is a supplemental sheet of questions for discussion in small groups . ( My main group is fairly large , about 25 men , and we break up after the main lesson into small groups of 3 to 5 men each . ) You 'll find that many of the questions are designed to be a springboard to further discussion and there is often no truly right or wrong answer .

@@58355538 @7355538/ <p> A man was in an accident ( work accident , not car accident ) , so he filled out an insurance claim . The insurance company contacted him and asked for more information . This was his response : <p> I am writing in response to your request for additional information for block number 3 of the accident reporting form . I put ' poor planning ' as the cause of my accident . You said in your letter that I should explain more fully and I trust the following detail will be sufficient . I am an amateur radio operator and on the day of the accident , I was working alone on the top section of my new 80 foot tower . When I had completed my work , I discovered that I had , over the course of several trips up the tower , brought up about 300 pounds of tools and spare hardware . Rather than carry the now un-needed tools and material down by hand , I decided to lower the items down in a small barrel by using a pulley , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tower . Securing the rope at ground level , I went to the top of the tower and loaded the tools and material into the barrel . Then I went back to the ground and untied the rope , holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the 300 pounds of tools . You will note in block number 11 of the accident reporting form that I weigh only 155 pounds . Due to my surprise of being jerked off the ground so suddenly , I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope . Needless to say , I proceeded at a rather rapid rate of speed up the side of the tower . In the vicinity of the 40 foot level , I met the barrel coming down . This explains my fractured skull and broken collarbone . Slowed only slightly , I continued my rapid ascent , not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley . <p> Fortunately , by this time , I had regained my presence of mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pain . At approximately the same time , however , the barrel of tools hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel . Devoid of the weight of the tools , the barrel now weighed approximately 20 pounds . I refer you again to my weight in block number 11 . As you might imagine , I began a rapid descent down the side of the tower . In the vicinity of the 40 foot level , I met the barrel coming up . This accounts for the two fractured ankles , and the lacerations of my legs and lower body . The encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell onto the pile of tools and , fortunately , only three vertebrae were cracked . I am sorry to report , however , that as I lay there on the tools , in pain , unable to stand and watching the empty barrel 80 feet above me , I again lost my presence of mind .

The first is the gift of faith in Jesus Christ , his work of redemption , and thus forgiveness of sin . The second is the gift of one or more special abilities , which are to be used for the purpose of unifying the body of Christ and for the growth of God 's Kingdom . These abilities are called spiritual gifts given to us by God . Like other presents , it is impossible to fully appreciate and make use of our spiritual gifts until they have been opened . <p> The Apostle Paul addresses the presence of spiritual gifts in three main sections of scripture : Romans 12 , 1 Corinthians 12 , and Ephesians 4 . Peter also verifies their existence in I Peter 4:10 . Through these sections of scripture , we learn that all Christians have been given at least one spiritual gift .

@@58355541 @7355541/ <p> 1 . In Verse 1 , Paul says " men ought to regard us as servants ... " Who is he referring to as " us ? " <p> A : Look back to verse 3:21 and youll see that Paul is not talking about himself or Apollos or Cephas . He is speaking of all Christians . <p> 2 . He goes on to say that says that you 've been entrusted with the " secret things of God . " What are the secret things is he talking about ? ( 1 Timothy 3:16 ) <p> A : Paul is speaking of things that human wisdom can not discover but are now revealed by God to his people . The so-called mystery religions of Pauls day used the Greek word mysterion in the sense of something that was only to be revealed to the initiated , but Paul used it to refer to something formerly hidden or obscure but now revealed by God for all to know and understand . Paul spells out the meaning of this mystery in at least five places such as Romans 11:25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained in 1 Timothy 3:16 . <p> " Here is the great mystery of our religion : Christ came as a human . The Spirit proved that he pleased God , and he was seen by angels . Christ was preached to the nations . People in this world put their faith in him , and he was taken up to glory . One commentator concluded that this mystery has 5 steps : 1 ) the miraculous incarnation , 2 ) the death of Christ , 3 ) Gods purpose to sum up all things in Christ , 4 ) the change that will take place at the resurrection , and 5 ) the plan of God by which both Jew and Gentile after a period of disobedience by both , will by his mercy be included in his kingdom . <p> 3 .

In verses 3 to 5 , can you explain what Paul says about judging himself ? ( I do n't  care if others judge me . I do n't  judge myself . I have a clear conscience but I may be guilty . Do not judge before the " appointed time . " ) ( Habakkuk 2:3 ) <p> A : Pauls judgement , like the judgement of other people , is only human and even his conscience may be mistaken . Only God can see the true motives in your heart . Can you see the distinction between a " clear conscience " and being " innocent ? " Habakkuk 2:3 " explains " abaout the " appointed time . " At the time I have decided , my words will come true . You can trust what I say about the future . It may take a long time , but keep on waitingit will happen ! <p> 5 . Corinthian factions judged one another by the reputation of the leader they followed . What then does Paul mean by the saying he quotes in Verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) ? How does this apply today ? <p> A : There seem to be two meanings here . First , he is saying , do not go beyond what is written in Scripture . The rabbis added huge volumes of interpretation to the OT law . Today , religions like the Mormons and Islam add the writings of their founders to the Bible . <p> Second , Paul has quoted several passages earlier in this letter ( 1:19 , 1:31 , 3:19-20 ) which reinforce his view that our view of man should be Biblical . That is , we should recognize mans weaknesses and limitations . And we should recognize that pride causes divisions in the church . <p> 6 . Pride is a theme that runs through much of Pauls writings . Verses 4:6-7 are the second time in this book that Paul mentions pride ( also in 1:26-31 ) . How would you sum up how a Christian should view pride ? ( Proverbs 11:2 , John 13:14-17 @ @ @ feet .

Now that you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them . <p> 7 . It is important to understand Verses 8 and 10 in the way Paul intended . These are ironic and sarcastic statements ( ironic means happening in the opposite way to what is expected ) . Why does he do this ? <p> A : First let 's read the verses with the sense of irony and sarcasm . Leader : re-read the verses . <p> Paul uses irony and sarcasm here to get the Corinthians to see how poor they really are because of their haughtiness and spiritual immaturity in comparison with the apostles . In Verse 9 , he pictures the apostles being brought into a gladiatorial contest in an arena at the end of the procession as all the world and even the angles look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight to the death . <p> Then in verse 10 , he goes back to sarcasm to effectively say , the apostles are the heroes here and you should want to be like them , but instead , you think you 're better than they are . You 're the real fools , not the apostles . <p> 8 . In verses 11 to 13 , Paul gives a graphic description of his three years in Ephesus from his arrival there right up to the writing of this letter to the Corinthians . In contrast to the self-centered , power-oriented message that some Corinthians believed and followed , what does Pauls life exemplify ? <p> 9 . If all people were in a line between Corinthians ( prideful , self-centered , power-oriented ) on one end and Paul ( humble , persecuted , slandered , scum of the earth ) on the other end , where would you be ? Would you like to be in a different place than you actually are ? Is it easier to be like Paul or the Corinthians ?

@@58355549 @7355549/ <p> 1 . Why might some of the Corinthians thank it was best not to get married ? ( Vs 1 ) <p> A : There is no definitive answer here . Perhaps with so much promiscuity some of them thought it would be better not to have to commit to just one person . Perhaps there is another reason . We just do n't  know . <p> 2 . In Verse 2 , Paul says that being married should keep you from doing something immoral . What would that immoral thing be ? ( See vs 6:9 , 15-16 ) <p> 3 . In a recent episode of Wife Swap , a strong Christian couple strongly believed that in all things in the household , the man rules . What do you think Paul would say about that in light of verses 4 and 5 ? <p> A : Paul says in no uncertain terms that sex is a two-way street . Verse 4-5 : A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself , and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you agree not to have sex for a little while , in order to spend time in prayer . <p> 4 . What would Paul ( or you ) say to a strongly Christian woman who says that sex is permissible only in a dark room under the covers in the missionary position and only when everything is totally okay between she and her husband ( which only happens about once every six months ) ? <p> 5 . In Verses 10-11 , Paul reaffirms the principle that divorce is wrong among Christians . ( Matthew 5:32 , 19:3-9 ) How do you feel about that ? How about divorce among non-Christians or mixed couples ? ( Verse 15 ) <p> A : Matthew 5:32 - But I say that a man who divorces his wife , unless she has been unfaithful , causes her to commit adultery . And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery . <p> Matthew 19:3-9 - Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question : " Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife for just any reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus replied . " They record that from the beginning God made them male and female. And he said , This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife , and the two are united into one. Since they are no longer two but one , let no one split apart what God has joined together . " " Then why did Moses say in the law that a man could give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away ? " they asked . Jesus replied , " Moses permitted divorce only as a concession to your hard hearts , but it was not what God had originally intended . And I tell you this , whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adulteryunless his wife has been unfaithful . <p> However , in verse 15 , Paul says if you are married to a non-Christian and he or she wants a divorce , then you should agree to it . <p> 6 . Many Christians strongly believe they should only marry another Christian . What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? <p> A : Paul advises a Christian married to a non-believer to stay with the person and try to win him or her over by ones actions . Whether he would suggest a Christian marry a non-believer in the first place is not mentioned , but he clearly sees that it has happened and will happen again . Falling in love with someone may or may not have anything to do with their faith . And what about two non-Christians who get married and then one becomes a Christian ? <p> 7 . In the paragraph on obeying the Lord ( Verses 17 to 24 ) Paul repeats his basic premise three times ( vs 17 , 20 , 24 ) . In your own words , what is it ? <p> A : Remain in the situation where you were when God called you . I have a saying that I 've tried to live by : " when good fortune comes and you earn more , continue to live as you did before . " Well , here the Paul is saying something similar : you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Lord . That does n't  mean that you should drop everything and go to seminary and become a pastor or missionary . Maybe you will eventually , but Paul says you should stay what you were . <p> 8 . What are some reasons you should stay what you were when God chose you ? <p> A : Your personal testimony to those who know you will be very powerful . You can probably have far more impact among people who know you than among strangers or foreigners . He is specifically saying to the Gentiles that there is no reason to get circumcised like the Jews , that outward signs do n't  matter ; its what 's in you that matters . To slaves , he says there is nothing wrong with trying to improve your condition , but to be content at every stage . <p> 9 . So Paul says that Christians should be content , stay the way they were when God chose them , and what else ? ( Verses 19 , 22 ) <p> A : Verse 19 - The important thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave of Christ , i.e. , your ultimate allegiance is to Christ , not to man or to someone else . <p> 10 . On a contentment scale of 1 to 10 ( 1 = " I hate getting up each day " and 10 = " life couldnt be better " ) where do you fall ? Why ? 
@@58355551 @7355551/ <p> So far in 1 Corinthians , Paul has focused mainly on divisions among Christians and in the church . He spoke of the fact of the divisions in 1:10-17 and the causes of the divisions in 1:18 to 4:13 , specifically : 1 . A wrong conception of the Christian message ( 1:18-3:4 ) 2 . A wrong conception of Christian ministry and ministers ( 3:5-4:5 ) 3 . A wrong conception of the Christian person(4:6-13) He ends this part of his letter by urging Christians to end the divisions among themselves and in the church . <p> 1 . After writing so harshly in the first 3+ chapters , why is Paul now sounding so gentle ( " I do n't  want to embarrass you " and " my own dear children " ) ? <p> A : According to Matthew Henry , In reproving for sin , we should distinguish between sinners and their sins . Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn , are likely to reform . Though Paul spoke with authority as a parent , he would rather beseech them in love . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : Do n't  minimize or overlook core problems . But do n't  keep bashing people over the head with them either . Remember , the Corinthians had written to Paul with several questions and he has n't  even mentioned them yet . In the first 3+ chapters , he has pointed out in a very direct way the basic problems these people have with the Christian message , with the Christian ministry and ministers , and with themselves . He s not downplaying these issues at all . But now he s saying , " I do n't  want to make you feel bad . I want to help you . But before we can get on to the things that are bothering you , you 've got to face up to these basic issues . " <p> What does this mean to you and me ? here 's an example . A friend of mine called me recently and asked me if I thought the laptop computer on sale the day after Thanksgiving at Wal-Mart was a good deal . I could have easily answered the question and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , " but the much more important issues that had to be dealt with first were : 1 ) my friend , you have a serious spending problem , 2 ) your marriage is about to collapse if you do n't  get control of your finances , and 3 ) what on earth do you need another computer for ? I laid those issues out in a non-nonsense way , but after laying them out if I had continued to bash him over the head with them , he would have walked away so I said , " hey , we 've been friends for a long time . You asked my opinion because you valued it . And although I 'm not telling you what you want to hear , maybe you should think about these issues first . " I 'm happy to say that he did , and he did NOT buy the computer . <p> 3 . In 4:16 , Paul says , " I want you to be like me . " What is he looking for ? How do you personally measure up to Pauls standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses of Chapter 4 , he is looking for Christians to be servants of Christ , to recognize that they have been given a trust , and to be faithful with it . He wants Christians to be humble , to endure persecution , and to be " fools for Christ . " He wants Christians to set an example as they follow Christ in both faith and deeds . <p> 4 . Who do you admire for putting their faith on the line ? Mother Teresa ? Billy Graham ? Desmond Tutu ? Martin Luther King ? Some " lesser known " believer who is faithful in hard times ? <p> Leader : have a good example of your own . Mine was Gladys Guitz , founder of Potter 's House , an organization that helps the 10,500 people living in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump . <p> 5 . Explain verse 20 . ( Gods kingdom is n't just a lot of words . It is power . ) <p> A : First of all , " Gods kingdom " refers to what ? It refers to Gods present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christ . the new has come ! ) This kingdom is n't just idle , empty talk , but it has the real power of the holy spirit then for the Gentile . ) <p> 6 . How would Paul respond to the idea , popular today , that " God wants you to be happy , rich , and successful " ? <p> Leader : If you can find it , there is an excellent 8-page piece in the Religion section of Time magazine , Sept. 18 , 2006 , titled , " Does God Want You to be RICH ? " It is about the growing number of Protestant evangelists ( T.D . Jakes , Joe Osteen , Joyce Meyer , Creflo Dollar , Kirbyjon Caldwell , and others ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is poison to other , more mainstream pastors . What do you think Pauil would say to that idea ? For more on the Christian Prosperity movement , see Osteen 's book , " Your Best Life Now . " <p> 7 . Read verse 4:21 . If Paul came to visit us here today , would he come with a whip , in love , or with a gentle spirit ? Why ? How would you like him to come ?

@@58355561 @7355561/ <p> THE FESTIVAL The First Philadelphia Computer Music Festival was held August 25 , 1978 as part of the Personal Computing 78 show . It was organized by Dick Moberg of the Philadelphia Area Computer Society . Steve Levine handled technical matters and the recording of the performances . The concert featured more than 30 musical compositions performed on ten computer synthesizers . The LP record made of the concert included 17 musical pieces performed on seven different computer synthesizers , representing programming by 11 people . In addition , a 15-year-old recording of computerized speech by Bell Labs was on the record . <p> THE PERFORMERS The RCA COSMAC numbers were performed in the concert by a team from the RCA David Sarnoff Research Center including Philip Baltzer , Andrew Modla , Jef Winsor and Gooitzen van der Wal . The ALF numbers were programmed by John Ridges and performed by Carl Helmers of Byte Magazine . Desiree was performed by Malcolm Wright of Solid State Music ( SSM ) . Wanhals Rondo was performed by Dorothy Siegel of Newtech Computer Systems . Bachs Toccata &amp; Fugue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining SSM , Software Technology , Schertz and Bell Labs numbers were performed by David Ahl of Creative Computing . <p> RCA COSMAC VIP SYSTEM The RCA COSMAC VIP system had 4K of memory with a Super Sound board plugged in . Each Super Sound board yields two separate sound channels . The music is implemented with a program called PIN-8 , ( Play It Now ) written by Joe Weisbecker , who also designed the Super Sound board . Music is encoded from sheet music with note pitch and duration being described with a single 8-bit byte . PIN-8 is structured so that unique measures need only to be encoded once and can be used in any sequence . The amplitude envelope of a note can be controlled to have one of 16 values for each of 16 time segments of a notes duration . The program is interrupt-driven and the determining interrupt signal defines the tempo , which is controlled by the potentiometer on the Super Sound card . It is a simple matter to take the interrupt signal from one VIP system to synchronously drive as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIP systems synchronized together . <p> ALF SYSTEM The ALF System uses up to eight music synthesis boards ( each one voice ) and a control board which connects between the microcomputer and the synthesis boards . Each board can produce one tone ( any of 96 pitches ) and volume level ( 256 ) . Each board also gives the programmer extensive control of the waveform and envelope ( 256 rise rates with times from .004 to 1.3 seconds , 256 fall rates with times from .004 to 7.8 seconds , and 256 sustain levels ) . Driving the music system was a S-100 bus micro computer with 16K RAM . <p> SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM The Software Technology Music System is principally a software based system with a small board that plugs into a SOL-20 computer ( or other S-100 bus system ) with 8K or more memory ( see photo and schematic below ) . Sheet music is programmed in using a high-level language called " Music . " The synthesizer has a bit more than a 4-octave range and can play three voices simultaneously . It provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it does provide for staccato notes , various articulation times , durations and tempos . Each board provides output to only one channel , so for stereo , two boards are required . Yankee Doodle Dandy on this record is in monaural . <p> SOLID STATE MUSIC SYSTEM The Solid State Music System had five SB-1 synthesizer cards plugged into an S-100 microcomputer with 32K RAM . Each card provides one channel of music , with control over the envelope and waveform shape , volume , and pitch of the note played over an 8-octave range . Music for the SB-1 is written in MUS-X1 , which allows high-level control of the SB-1s special features and simplified encoding of the music . The MUS-X1 interpreter is also able to play " inverted " music from a normally encoded song . <p> NOTRAN SYSTEM The Toccata and Fugue was realized in 1970 using a music software system called NOTRAN , which is a derivative of the words NOte TRANslation . I developed this as a semester project for a music appreciation course I took while an under graduate student at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambilog 200 which is a rather obscure 30-bit word minicomputer ( photo at right ) equipped with a 14 bit digital-to-analog converter and two IBM style tape drives . Except for the DAC , there was no other sound generation hardware . Unlike other systems represented on this record , the NOTRAN , system did not produce sound in real time . Thus , the program " ran " for a much longer time than the duration of the piece . During this time , about 3.5 hours , a series of over 15 million 12-bit numbers was computed . Each number represented the composite sound waveform for a period of about 30 microseconds which means that 32,000 such numbers are needed for each second of sound . As the numbers were computed , they were written onto the tape drive . When the piece was complete , a different " playback " program read the tape at the rate of 8,000 numbers per second and sent them out through the digital-to-analog converter . The resulting audio signal , which was still too slow by a factor of 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape recorder . Finally the tape was replayed at 60 inches per second and recorded on a standard audio tape recorder . The primary advantage of such a system is that the sound complexity and detail possible is virtually unlimited since the synthesis program is allowed to run at its own rate . The primary disadvantage , of course , is a substantial waiting period before results are heard . Although many thousands of dollars worth of university owned equipment was used in realizing this piece , any hobbyist system with dual floppy disks ( preferably double density ) and a digital-to-analog converter could do the same although somewhat more slowly ( the Ambilog had hardware multiply/divide ) . Several features of the system should be apparent while listening to the piece . Since a pipe organ was being simulated , different voicing was used for the great , swell , and pedal keyboard parts . Each part in turn could have several notes sounding simultaneously . In particular , when the decay of one note overlaps the attack of the next , both will be sounding simultaneously for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices themselves were an ad-hoc mixture of sawtooth , triangle , rectangle , and sine waves at 1 , 2 , and 4 times the fundamental pitch . In addition , the attack , decay , and relative loudness of each voice could be specified . Near the middle of the piece the voicing is changed several times . Even the reverberation is computed by the NOTRAN system by simulating a tapped audio delay line in software . Hal Chamberlin <p> SCHERTZ COMPUTER MUSIC SYSTEM The Schertz System was completely built from kits and surplus parts such as the DEC Flip Chip modules shown at the right . The synthesizer allows for up to 25 parameters to control the note for each of three voices . These parameters include pitch , wave form , attack , sustain , decay , volume , staccato , percussion , tremolo , vibrato , etc . An S-100 bus microcomputer with 20K RAM is used to control three voices in Red Wing . <p> NEWTECH SYSTEM Newtechs music card for the S-100 bus is essentially a digital-to-analog converter controlled by an output port on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard . This approach to computer music synthesis is extremely flexible since hypothetically any possible sound can be created . In actual practice the performance of the music circuitry is somewhat limited by the speed of the host computer . Each card can produce up to three voices output to one channel . Newtech 's music software consists of a BASIC program , which converts music into binary tables , and a machine-language interpreter to play the music with three voices and different envelopes . The piece on this record uses three cards each playing one voice . <p> BELL LABORATORIES COMPUTER SPEECH To produce synthesized speech , the computer continuously produces nine control signals such as voice pitch , loudness , lip opening and other variables . The program uses 34 phonetic sounds ( 22 consonant and 12 vowel sounds ) . This historic recording was made by P. H. Van Lenten in 1962 as part of a series of experiments at Bell Laboratories to understand the nature of speech and hearing . It is even more remarkable considering that each of the nine controls for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a two-part program to produce a magnetic tape . This was then converted by a second program into an audio tape . <p> THE RECORDING One would think that with the music being produced by digital means that the recording could utilize the computer digital outputs , or at least the amplifier outputs . Unfortunately , this was not the case as some of the performances had live accompaniment and those recordings were made with two microphones ( for stereo ) . This fed into a studio-quality 1/4 " tape recorder . Also a few of the performers brought their own audio systems , so there is a difference in the quality , levels and balance of the various performances . Lastly , the recording system ( borrowed by the Philadelphia Area Computer Society ) had a glitch that resulted in the right channel being recorded at a distinctly lower level than the left . In an effort to preserve the music as accurately as possible , virtually no corrections were made between the original tape recording and the 12 " stereo record issued by Creative Computing in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right channel was given a bit of a boost to bring the two channels to nearly the same level . More importantly , the levels of the individual pieces were adjusted to compensate for the nearly 50% difference between the loudest and softest pieces in the originals . As this was done digitally , no distortion was introduced and the performances are still pure to the original . Tempting as it was , neither an equalizer nor loudness compensator were used . Unfortunately , as the CD was made from one of the master records ( the original tapes had long since disappeared ) , there are a few pops and clicks , although far fewer than one might expect given that the record was originally pressed in 1978.

It is made out to Ciao , David Aw and has a remitter 's name of Jonathan Ben . <p> I note that several things look " wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmed squarely with the border . Second , under a magnifying glass , the micro-print signature line is blurry and indistinct . Third , the paper does not have a watermark or thermochromic icon as it should . <p> Nevertheless , I take it to my bank and ask for a second opinion . The teller sees no problem with it , nor does a bank officer ( which in my humble opinion is a sad commentary on typical bank employees today ) . I point out the problems I see in the check and the bank officer reluctantly offers to call Peoples Bank of Kentucky to check on it . After two phone calls and an on-line check with the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions , we learn that Peoples Bank is defunct and has been acquired by the Bank of Kentucky . Will they honor this check ? No one seems to have a definitive answer , but the sense I 'm getting is " probably not . " I 'm reluctant to deposit it since a bounced check will cost me $20 . But " Jeff " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the following e-mail on 6/16/04 . <p> Hi Jeff : I received your cashier 's check for $9,500 today for my Chevy 1-1/2-ton USAAF Wrecker . The check is made out to " Ciao , David Aw " instead of to my name which is " David Ahl " but I think I 'll be able to cash it . When do you want to pick up the truck ? ( By the way , " ciao " is an Italian word of greeting or parting that I often use in my letters and e-mail because my daughter lives in Italy . ) Best regards , David Ahl <p> Two days later on 6/18/04 I receive this reply : <p> Thanks for your respond now as will agreed before that you will deduct your own $4900 and send the balance of $4,600 to my shipping company for the pick up of the Chevy Wrecker so now i will send you my shipping company address in which the balance will be sent to , and note they will be expecting cash not cashier cheque , made the cash sent today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduct the cost of sending the money to my shipping copmany from the excess funds.Please do send it rigth now because you know the transaction is already been delayed for sometimes back and my shipping company have been hurried .

That amount of cash ( $4,600 ) , even in hundred-dollar bills , is quite a wad , almost 1/4 " thick . I know people who are reluctant to send even $5 in cash to the next state and his fellow thinks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs fly .

They 're not interested in a " low value " fraud and tell me to report it to the Internet Fraud Complaint Center www.ic3.gov . But since that web site is generally for frauds that have already take place and this one is still in progress , so to speak , I decide to report it to the " Submit a Tip " page of the FBI web site https : //tips.fbi.gov <p> I explain the scam and provide all the details and offer to turn over the fake check and envelope it came in along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I receive this response from the FBI . <p> Dear Mr Ahl THIS IS NOT AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE <p> Thank you for your submission to the FBI Internet Tip Line . In as much as the FBI receives reports of this type of activity on a regular basis there is no need to forward any such additional emails to us . <p> A review of the information you provided revealed that you are being approached over the Internet to participate in one of many variations of an advance fee scheme being perpetrated by individuals from various West African nations , particularly Nigeria . This scam has also become popular and perpetrated by individuals all over the world , including in Korea and the UK . Victims have lost substantial funds in the past and all requests for travel to foreign locations should be ignored . The United States Secret Service ( USSS ) has developed an excellent , detailed description of this fraud scheme , which can be accessed at **36;99;TOOLONG .

Your continued cooperation in this and other matters is greatly appreciated . <p> Although the FBI identified this as an " advanced fee fraud , " it is NOT and the Secret Service web site noted , while interesting , has no relevant information about this type of fraud . <p> Jeff still has n't given up . On 7/7/04 he sends me this . <p> Hi , I called you on yesterday but your phone was on voicemail this is the number i called 973-285-0716 pls give me your cell phone and hope you have through for now so do as we agreed ealier to my shipping company . <p> Hope to hear from you asap . <p> He calls again and I attempt to talk to him but his speech is garbled and unintelligible . I 've heard that sometimes in this scam after the seller sends the money for shipping the buyer attempts to back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hi Jeff : Sorry , I have been very busy and had some family problems . But I finally deposited your check in the bank and took out the cash to send to you . Even in large bills , $4,600 is a very large packet of cash , but I packaged it carefully and will put it in the mail tomorrow to your agent . <p> So you can expect it soon . When do you want the Chevy truck ? <p> Regards , Dave Ahl <p> Uh oh , now he does n't want cash ; he wants it by Western Union . And we have the " Question and Answer " business again , but now it makes sense because Western Union requires the recipient of money to answer a question provided by the sender . Also , the recipient must have the 10-digit Money Transfer Control Number ( MTCN ) in order to receive the cash . He sends this on 7/11/04 : <p> Hi David , Thanks for your response since all these while anyway hope you have through with your family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen again in the name of GOD . <p> Well conrcerning the delaying it happen like that sometimes that is business you said the money will be sent to my shipping company today please do that immediately and as soon as they receive the money they will come for the pick up instantly also to remaind you that you have to send the money through western union transfer and get back to me with the following information as soon as you send it so that they can be able to collect the money with the information you send to me here is the infromation below ..... 1 . SENDER NAME 2 . MTCN NUMBER 3 . QUESTION AND ANSWER <p> A day later on 7/12/04 this anxious reminder arrives : <p> Hi David , I have been expecting your response since you said you will send the money to my shipping company today , so i contacted them immediately and now they just call me that they have not recieved the payment , please try to send it right now so that they can come for the pickup of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed here in my stores . <p> Just to remind you that you will send the money by western union transfer and get back to me with the information i told you , like sender name mtcn number question and answer <p> . Hope to hear from you asap . <p> Now he 's calling two and three times a day . My wife ( a linguist ) listens to the messages and opines that he is speaking Arabic with a few English words thrown in . Since no law enforcement agency has taken any real interest , I decide it 's time to pull the plug . So on 7/13/04 , I send him this . <p> Hi Jeff ( or whatever your name is ) : Your cashier 's check is FAKE ! You 're trying to CHEAT me . I 've turned over everything to the FBI and I 'm sure you be hearing from the FBI or from Interpol very soon . Why do n't you get an honest job instead of trying to cheat people out of their money ? <p> And do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dim view of cheating and fraud . Here is what the Bible says about fraud in Micah 2:1-3 . Woe to you who lie awake at night , plotting wickedness ; you rise at dawn to carry out your schemes ; because you can , you do . You want a certain piece of land or someone else 's house ( though it is all he has ) ; you take it by fraud and threats and violence . But the Lord God says , " I will reward your evil with evil ; nothing can stop me ; never again will you be proud and haughty after I am through with you . " <p> Do not call or contact me again . David Ahl <p> Scam is widespread all over the world . <p> The auto buying scam surfaced around 2002 with the first " offers to buy " coming from Nigeria . It seems somewhat more believable than the money transfer scam that offers you millions of dollars if you 'll just allow some ill-gotten gains to be transferred into your bank account . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of money is not totally outrageous . Second , it is a response to your ad rather than an e-mail out of the blue . Third , your bank will give you immediate access to cash when they receive a cashier 's check from another bank . It then takes a good bit of time for the actual check to be physically processed through the Federal Reserve system , sent to the issuing bank , found to be fraudulent , returned through the system to your bank , and notification sent to you . This process can easily take two weeks or more . <p> On 11/4/03 , the Internet Fraud Complaint Center posted this warning : " The scheme targets individuals that use Internet classified ads to sell merchandise . Typically , an interested party located outside the United States contacts a seller . The seller is told that the buyer has an associate in the United States that owes him money . As such , he will have the associate send the seller a cashier 's check for the amount owed to the buyer . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the merchandise , and the seller is told the excess amount will be used to pay the shipping costs associated with getting the merchandise to his location . The seller is instructed to deposit the check , and as soon as it clears , to wire ( Western Union ) the excess funds back to the buyer , or to another associate identified as a shipping agent . In most instances , the money is sent to locations in West Africa ( Nigeria ) . Because a cashier 's check is used , a bank will typically release the funds immediately , or after a one or two day hold . Falsely believing the check has cleared , the seller wires the money as instructed . In some cases , the buyer is able to convince the seller that some circumstance has arisen that necessitates the cancellation of the sale , and is successful in conning the victim into sending the remainder of the money . Shortly thereafter , their bank notifies the victim that the check was fraudulent , and the bank is holding the victim responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea how many people have been taken in by the scam , but it has spread all over the world and has morphed into many variations .

I was going to the bank when I saw this . I went home , got my wife , Linda , and came back with a camera . Below is my best , though inadequate , attempt to share the experience with you ... <p> The above picture was taken on the mall in front of the Sandy , Utah city hall . Scroll sideways to see the whole thing . I pasted the photos together to try and help show just how big this thing was , but even with that , the photos do n't do it justice . There was very little publicity about this , but it was a real traffic stopper . People would park and get out and walk among the flags . Some brought bundles of flowers and left them at the base of a flag . Others came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of the terrible loss that we suffered one year ago . We all know over 3000 people lost their lives , but seeing this display , and walking among it , helps put perspective on just how big a number that is . <p> To the left is a close-up of the one of the signs placed around the perimeter of the display . There were also some international flags on display representing some of the various foreign nations whose citizens dies that day . Interestingly , this whole display was done by a local company ( Colonial Flags ) that manufactures and distributes flags and flag display equipment ... and I saw not a single sign bearing their name in the display . People walked through , and all you could hear was the sound of the flags blowing in the breeze . A reverent silence prevailed over the display as those who came each reviewed his or her experiences of that fateful day a year ago . <p> I saw many families while I was there . It was hard watching adults struggling to cope with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to understand the significance of the flags around them . Too the credit of the children , I did n't see any who could not somehow sense that this was a special place . For a few moments , everyone who came , young and old , male and female , families , and even a group of mentally handicapped individuals stopped their busy daily lives to remember . If those who caused this pain only knew how much stronger we have become , and how terribly their comrades have paid , and will continue to pay , for this horrible crime , I wonder if they still would have done what they did . <p> It 's hard to picture mentally just how big this thing is . As I walked among the rows , I was reminded of rank on rank of soldiers standing at attention , guarding us even now . <p> Some brought flowers , small flags , notes etc . The flags did n't have individual names on them so I do n't know how people picked out where they would leave these tokens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who has ever shed a few tears at THE WALL ( the Viet Nam Veterans memorial in Washington DC ) or during the changing of the guard at The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington , VA , this display is every bit as moving in its sheer power to remind those who come of just how deeply we all experienced the cowardly attack on innocent civilians in our own homeland . <p> The display was originally conceived by Paul Swenson . He and his brother Dave , the owners of Colonial Flag , decided that rather than putting it up outside their company ( where it might be considered a promotional display ) , they would put it up on a public square downtown . The photo below was furnished to me later by the company .

@@58355568 @7355568/ <h> Gospel of MarkChristian Bible StudyIntroduction and 35 Lessons <p> Introduction from the NIV Study Bible <p> Help build a house for aneedy family in Guatemala . <p> Author Although there is no direct internal evidence of authorship , it was the unanimous testimony of the early church that this Gospel was written by John Mark ( " John , also called Mark , " Acts 12:12,25 ; 15:37 ) . The most important evidence comes from Papias ( c. a.d. 140 ) , who quotes an even earlier source as saying : ( 1 ) Mark was a close associate of Peter , from whom he received the tradition of the things said and done by the Lord ; ( 2 ) this tradition did not come to Mark as a finished , sequential account of the life of our Lord , but as the preaching of Peterpreaching directed to the needs of the early Christian communities ; ( 3 ) Mark accurately preserved this material . The conclusion drawn from this tradition is that the Gospel of Mark largely consists of the preaching of Peter arranged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament It is generally agreed that the Mark who is associated with Peter in the early non-Biblical tradition is also the John Mark of the NT . The first mention of him is in connection with his mother , Mary , who had a house in Jerusalem that served as a meeting place for believers ( Acts 12:12 ) . When Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch from Jerusalem after the famine visit , Mark accompanied them ( Acts 12:25 ) . Mark next appears as a " helper " to Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey ( Acts 13:5 ) , but he deserted them at Perga in Pamphylia to return to Jerusalem ( Acts 13:13 ) . Paul must have been deeply disappointed with Marks actions on this occasion , because when Barnabas proposed taking Mark on the second journey , Paul flatly refused , a refusal that broke up their working relationship ( Acts 15:3639 ) . Barnabas took Mark , who was his cousin ( Col 4:10 ) , and departed for Cyprus . No further mention is made of either of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Colossians written from Rome . Paul sends a greeting from Mark and adds : " You have received instructions about him ; if he comes to you , welcome him " ( Col 4:10 ; see Phm 24 , written about the same time ) . At this point Mark was apparently beginning to win his way back into Pauls confidence . By the end of Pauls life , Mark had fully regained Pauls favor ( see 2Ti 4:11 ) . <p> Date of Composition Some , who hold that Matthew and Luke used Mark as a major source , have suggested that Mark may have been composed in the 50s or early 60s . Others have felt that the content of the Gospel and statements made about Mark by the early church fathers indicate that the book was written shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem in a.d. 70 . <p> Place of Origin According to early church tradition , Mark was written " in the regions of Italy " ( Anti-Marcionite Prologue ) or , more specifically , in Rome ( Irenaeus ; Clement of Alexandria ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel with the apostle Peter . The above evidence is consistent with ( 1 ) the historical probability that Peter was in Rome during the last days of his life and was martyred there , and ( 2 ) the Biblical evidence that Mark also was in Rome about the same time and was closely associated with Peter ( see 2Ti 4:11 ; 1Pe 5:13 , where the word " Babylon " may be a cryptogram for Rome . ) <p> Recipients The evidence points to the church at Rome , or at least to Gentile readers . Mark explains Jewish customs ( 7:24 ; 15:42 ) , translates Aramaic words ( 3:17 ; 5:41 ; 7:11,34 ; 15:22,34 ) and seems to have a special interest in persecution and martyrdom ( 8:3438 ; 13:913 ) subjects of special concern to Roman believers ( and to Peter as well ; cf. 1 Peter ) . A Roman destination would explain the almost immediate acceptance of this Gospel and its rapid dissemination . <p> Occasion and Purpose Since Marks Gospel is traditionally associated with Rome , it may have been occasioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c. a.d. 6467 . The famous fire of Rome in 64probably set by Nero himself but blamed on Christiansresulted in widespread persecution . Even martyrdom was not unknown among Roman believers . Mark may be writing to prepare his readers for such suffering by placing before them the life of our Lord . There are many references , both explicit and veiled , to suffering and discipleship throughout his Gospel ( see 1:1213 ; 3:22,30 ; 8:3438 ; 10:30,3334,45 ; 13:813 ) . <p> Emphases <p> The cross . Both the human cause ( 12:12 ; 14:12 ; 15:10 ) and the divine necessity ( 8:31 ; 9:31 ; 10:3334 ) of the cross are emphasized by Mark . <p> Discipleship . Special attention should be paid to the passages on discipleship that arise from Jesus predictions of his passion ( 8:349:1 ; 9:3510:31 ; 10:4245 ) . <p> The teachings of Jesus . Although Mark records far fewer actual teachings of Jesus than the other Gospel writers , there is a remarkable emphasis on Jesus as teacher . The words " teacher , " " teach " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus in Mark 39 times . <p> The Messianic secret . On several occasions Jesus warns his disciples or others to keep silent about who he is or what he has done ( see 1:34,44 and notes ; 3:12 ; 5:43 ; 7:36 ; 8:30 ; 9:9 ) . <p> Special Characteristics Marks Gospel is a simple , succinct , unadorned , yet vivid account of Jesus ministry , emphasizing more what Jesus did than what he said . Mark moves quickly from one episode in Jesus life and ministry to another , often using the adverb " immediately " ( see note on 1:12 ) . The book as a whole is characterized as " The beginning of the gospel " ( 1:1 ) . The life , death and resurrection of Christ comprise the " beginning , " of which the apostolic preaching in Acts is the continuation . <p> Bible Study on Gospel of Mark I have arbitrarily divided the 16 chapters of Mark into 35 segments for discussion . I have found that in small groups ( 6 to 20 people ) each unit takes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion questions the week before or at the time of the study .

If a mans gift is prophesying , let him use it in proportion to his faith . <p> 1 Cor 1:7 - Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed . <p> 1 Cor 14:1-2 - Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts , especially the gift of prophecy .

In verse 13 , the word " baptized " does not refer to a traditional water baptism . What does the word mean here ? <p> A : The second meaning of baptism is " an act , experience , or ordeal by which one is purified , sanctified , or initiated . " So the verse effectively says that the Holy Spirit acted on each of us and united us with Christ as part of his church . Paul emphasizes in this verse that in Christ there is no distinction by race , color , social position , but that God has given all of his people the Holy Spirit to dwell in them . <p> 3 . The first section ( roughly Verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 26 ) are addressed to two different audiences . How would you describe each audience ? ( Knowing the two audiences will help you understand each section better . ) <p> A : The first section is addressed to those people who feel their gifts are inferior and unimportant . Apparently the more spectacular gifts such as speaking in tongues had been glorified in the Corinthian church , making those who did not have them feel inferior . <p> The second section is addressed mainly to those who feel their gifts are superior and most important . <p> 4 . Have you ever felt like an unneeded or unimportant part of a group or team ? What did you do about it ? What would Paul have told you to do ? <p> A : The temptation when you feel left out or unimportant is to sulk , or tune out , or even leave the group . Paul would recommend that you exercise your gifts or effectively use your position for the good of the whole .

( 1 Peter 5:1-3 , Hebrews 10:24-25 ) <p> A : As a Christian , you 're probably thinking be humble , help others , remember that you are just one part of the whole . This is definitely important and you most certainly have an obligation to be aware of those people who might feel unimportant or left out . You should encourage and walk along side them . <p> 1 Peter 5:1-3 - And now , a word to you who are elders in the churches . I , too , am an elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ . And I , too , will share in his glory when he is revealed to the whole world . As a fellow elder , I appeal to you : Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you . Watch over it willingly , not grudginglynot for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are eager to serve God . Do n't  lord it over the people assigned to your care , but lead them by your own good example the Day drawing near . <p> Butand this is a big butyou must also do the job that you have been given and use the gift you 've been given . For two seasons , we had a softball coach at the Mission who did n't  want anyone to feel left out so he put second and third string players into key positions such as pitcher , shortstop and first base . And he put poor batters early in the lineup . As a result , the Mission went from being a winning team to end the seasons he coached with records of 2-10 , 0-12 , and 1-11 . Using Pauls body analogy , it was if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ear the job of running . This goes right back to spiritual gifts : first , you 've got to know your gift ( or gifts ) and second , you 've got to use it . <p> 6 . How could you illustrate the truth of Verse 26 from your own body ? From your own church ? <p> A : Heres a double illustration . On our missions trip in Guatemala , we had work teams of five people , each with different construction skills . On the second day , my carpenter ate something that disagreed with him . It really only affected his stomach , but he said that he felt so bad all over that he could n't go to work . He , in fact , missed two full days of work . The second effect was on our team . We had me ( the leader and one who was measuring and cutting the concrete blocks ) , my wife Betsy ( who was mixing and pouring concrete ) , Ken ( who was helping build the concrete block walls ) , and Victor ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wall uprights ) . But now we did n't  have a carpenter , so I had to do some multi-tasking and we had to use a young , inexperienced guy from Guatemala for some of the grunt work . We were missing a vital part , we came up with a makeshift solution , but as a result our house construction fell behind schedule and was n't quite finished by the time we had to leave . ( I should mention that the two other crews also had problems and the third house was at least two days behind us at the end of the week . ) <p> 7 . In some Bible versions , in Verse 28 , Paul orders the gifts : first are apostles , second are prophets , third are teachers , then those who do miracles , those who have the gift of healing , those who can help others , those who have the gift of leadership ( or administration ) , those who speak in unknown languages . <p> Two questions : 1 ) do you think this list ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustive or all-inclusive ? 2 ) Is there any significance in the ordering , i.e. , first , second , etc. ? If so , what ? <p> A : As we saw from our discussion of spiritual gifts two weeks ago , the list is definitely not all-inclusive . There are many other spiritual gifts such as the gift of music , craftsmanship , building , giving , and many others . This list is just a starting point with some examples . <p> Second , as to the ordering , there is perhaps a hierarchy , just as we would be inclined to list the bodily sense of seeing above the sense of taste or smell , or the hand above the foot , but the real crux of the section is found in verses 20 and 25-26 . <p> Verse 20 : It takes many parts to make a single body . <p> Verses 25-26 : God did this to make all parts of the body work together smoothly , with each part caring about the others . 26 If one part of our body hurts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is honored , the whole body will be happy . <p> 8 . What lesson do you take away ( for YOU personally ) from this section of scripture ?

It is a striking departure from the earlier books in tone and subject , as well as in style ; rather than being set in the usual exotic , action-packed environment this story is largely played out in the world of modern art . HergT worked on the book until his death in 1983 . It was published posthumously ( despite its unfinished status ) in 1986 by Casterman in association with the HergT Foundation . The foundation republished it in 2004 with further material . Because it did not have a cover by HergT , many artists tried their hand at disigning a suitable cover .

The S&amp;P 500 suffered its largest loss since 1974 , declining 40% from the market peak in March 2000 through the end of 2002 . <p> 2003 was the best year for large cap stocks since 1997 and the best year for international stocks since 1986 . It was also the first time since 1997 that all of the asset categories depicted on the Table enjoyed positive returns . <p> 2003 marked the fifth year in a row that small cap stocks outperformed large cap . Small cap growth topped the performance rankings among all asset categories , rising from the ashes of a last place finish in 2002 . It is interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed from 2002 , the level of equity returns swung from double-digit losses across the board to double-digit gains . Large cap growth ranked last among all equity categories with a return of 25.66% . <p> Value outperformed growth in both large and small cap equity markets following the bursting of the technology bubble in March 2000 . While value remained on top in large cap during 2003 , growth won the race in small cap.The huge disparity in performance between the two styles , seen during 1997-2000 for large cap and from 1996-2002 for small cap , has disappeared . <p> Fixed income ranked last in 2003 after ranking first in 2002 and second during the two previous years.The bond market suffered one of its worst months in July and recorded its lowest annual return since 1999 . Investors who clung to the relative safety and quality of bonds following the three-year decline in the equity markets paid dearly for their protection . <p> The table highlights the uncertainty inherent in all capital markets .

Different reasons are given for the extra amount , usually for shipping the vehicle to a foreign country or because someone owes SB some money .

It is made out to Dewey Bluffum and has no remitter 's name . <p> As forgeries go , this is n't too bad . But under closer examination , it starts to fall apart . The trim is n't quite even . The left side is 3-31/64 " wide , the center is 3-30/64 , and the right side is 3-31/64 " . The black printing is not quite straight , about 1/64 " off in alignment , and there is a dropout in the type in the center of the logo . By themselves , both of these are probably tolerable . However , the microprint signature line , which should read " AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE ONLY " over and over , is completely muddy and unreadable . Incorporated in the blue pattern are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check is photocopied . You can see the words by holding the check at an angle , but they do not work correctly with a photocopier . The artificial watermark on the back , which reads " CHECK PROTECT " is actually there , which is a minor accomplishment , except for the fact that every other word " PROTECT " is upside down ! <p> Pertaining to the information typed in , one would expect that a bank in Tennessee would type " 00 CENTS " and not " 00 CENT . " Also , one would expect the date to be in U.S. fashion , i.e. , " JAN 13 , 2005 " and not European fashion , " 13 JAN 2005 . " Also , the amount should be " $10,000.00 " not " $10,000:00 .

Many questions are primarily to stimulate discussion and there are no right or wrong answers . <p> Introduction : This passage refers to what was probably Paul 's third trip to Jerusalem in the 14 years since his conversion . He tells us ( v. 1 ) that he was traveling with his two good friends , Barnabas and Titus . He goes on to say that he contacted his travel agent only after a revelation in which God told him to go and confer with church leaders in Jerusalem about the message that he was preaching to the Gentiles . <p> Review : What was that message ? <p> 1 . This meeting probably prevented a major split in the early church . Why ? ( Acts 15:1-5 ) <p> The converted Pharisees still felt that the Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses before they could become Christians and be saved .

Give an example of a time when you did or did not discuss your plans . What happened ? <p> 4 . Apparently , the leaders in Jerusalem agreed that Titus did not have to be circumcised ( v. 3-5 ) . Why does Paul include this information ? <p> When Paul took Titus ( a Greek ) to Jerusalem the first time , the Judaizers said that he must be circumcised . Paul adamantly refused to give in to their demands . The Apostles agreed that circumcism was an unnecessary rite for Gentile believers . Remember , this is letter is being written to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Gentile , did not have to be circumcised certainly shows that it was not necessary for the Galatians either . <p> 5 . We normally think of " taking a stand " as something we do when someone is trying to lead us into immoral behavior , but Paul is taking a hard line against people who appeared to be and thought that they were super-moral . Why did the Judaizers consider themselves better than others ? <p> These false brothers were from the party of the Pharisees . They were the strictest religious leaders of Judiasm , some of whom had been converted to believing in Christ 's teaching . They had more education and were the church leaders and teachers . <p> 7 . In verse 6 , Paul says that " God does not judge by external appearances . " What message(s) should we take from that statement ?

This originally appeared in the MTA Messenger , newsletter , but I decided that as long as I had written it , I might as well put it on my web site too . It 's not very interesting , but , heck , why not waste a few minutes reading about what life was like back then . ( In the military , it has n't changed much . ) Enjoy ! Any comments ? E-mail me at SwapMeetDave@aol.com and I 'd be glad to hear from you . <p> When I went off to college at Cornell University in 1956 , just three years after the end of the Korean War , it was more-or-less expected that one would serve in the military one way or another . ROTC seemed like the most painless choice at the time .

I got a more-or-less automatic deferment to complete a masters degree in engineering at Cornell and an MBA at Carnegie-Mellon . But then the inevitable day came , July 5 , 1963 , to report for active duty which commenced with three months of Infantry basic training at Ft . Benning . Do you know what the swamps of Georgia are like in July and August ? That was followed by two months at Intelligence Staff officer School at Ft . Holabird , MD after which I reported to my duty station , the 313th ASA Battalion , a support unit for the XVIII Airborne Corps at Ft . Bragg , NC . The ASA is the electronic ears of the Army and they listen to enemy radio traffic to get an idea of the disposition and location of ground units before the main units are committed to battle .

In actual fact , I was made the Battalion S2 which in the ASA means security : security of the installation , of the equipment , of the code books , security clearances , and so on . I was also assigned such odd jobs as the assistant adjutant , test control officer , court martial appointing officer , re-enlistment officer , message classification officer ( a huge pain in the butt ) , and , of course , officer of the day ( OD ) on a rotating schedule .

Also as the new kid on the block , I was asked ( well , told ) that since the unit did not have enough jump slots for everyone , I would not get one . Having a jump slot had pros and cons . Pros : an extra $110 per month and the thrill of jumping out of a perfectly good airplane . Cons : risking your life to jump out of a perfectly good airplane .

Dress up in starched fatigues and spit shined boots , report for duty at 0700 , inspect everything that should be locked up , push around papers , another inspection , lunch mess , take care of ancillary duties , more paperwork , end-of-day inspection , hit the O-club , go home .

Every time I asked for some leave , there was some reason that I could n't get it .

" Thus it was that my wife and I took a space available flight to Europe , traveled around for six weeks , and came back to find myself transferred to an administrative out-processing unit .

@@58355604 @7355604/ <h> Gospel of Luke Christian Bible StudyIntroduction and 50 Lessons <p> Author The authors name does not appear in the book , but much unmistakable evidence points to Luke . This Gospel is a companion volume to the book of Acts , and the language and structure of these two books indicate that both were written by the same person . They are addressed to the same individual , Theophilus , and the second volume refers to the first ( Acts 1:1 ) . Certain sections in Acts use the pronoun " we " indicating that the author was with Paul when the events described in these passages took place . Luke was probably a Gentile by birth , well educated in Greek culture , a physician by profession , a companion of Paul at various times from his second missionary journey to his final imprisonment in Rome , and a loyal friend who remained with the apostle after others had deserted him ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ) . <p> Recipient and Purpose The Gospel is specifically directed to Theophilus ( 1:3 ) , whose name means " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular person rather than to lovers of God in general . The use of " most excellent " with the name further indicates an individual , and supports the idea that he was a Roman official or at least of high position and wealth . He was possibly Lukes patron , responsible for seeing that the writings were copied and distributed . Such a dedication to the publisher was common at that time . Theophilus , however , was more than a publisher . The message of this Gospel was intended for his own instruction ( 1:4 ) as well as the instruction of those among whom the book would be circulated . The fact that the Gospel was initially directed to Theophilus does not narrow or limit its purpose . It was written to strengthen the faith of all believers and to answer the attacks of unbelievers . It was presented to displace some disconnected and ill-founded reports about Jesus . Luke wanted to show that the place of the Gentile Christian in Gods kingdom is based on the teaching of Jesus . He wanted to commend the preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke , the longest book in the New Testament and the most comprehensive of the four Gospels , presents the works and teachings of Jesus that are especially important for understanding the way of salvation .

The writing is characterized by literary excellence , historical detail and warm , sensitive understanding of Jesus and those around him . It is the only Gospel in chronological order . <p> Bible Study on Luke I have arbitrarily divided the 24 chapters of Luke into 50 sections for discussion .

What two forces are constantly fighting in your life ? <p> The Holy Spirit and our sinful nature , which includes both evil desires that come from Satan as well as inclinations that stem from our bodies . Paul is saying here that the Holy Spirit is infinitely stronger than our sinful nature and if we try to overcome our sinful nature by our own willpower , we will fail . We must call upon the Holy Spirit and let ourselves be led by the Spirit . <p> 2 . Why does Paul say that if you follow the Holy Spirit , you are no longer subject to Moses ' law ?

@@58355615 @7355615/ <p> 1 . Does Paul think that all Christians should get along together and not have disputes with each other ? What does this mean for you ? <p> A : No . His concern is not that the Corinthians have disagreements or even that those disagreements need resolution by a " judge . " Rather , his protest is that they place the matter before the judicial system of Corinth rather than handling it within the church . <p> 2 . With your background and attitude , if you were a judge , what kind would you be : Hanging judge ? Lenient ? Pushover ? Known for creative sentencing ? Why ? <p> 3 . Both verses 2 and 3 begin with the phrase , " do you not know ... " or " do n't  you realize ... " Did Paul think that the Corinthians really did n't  know what he was stating ? <p> A : He begins with two " do you not know . . . " questions . This expression was commonly used in the Greek world and in Greek letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul will mention in verses 2 and 3 and he assumes that they should have drawn the same conclusion that he drew . <p> 4 . Explain verses 2-3 in which Paul says , first , that saints ( or believers ) will judge the world and second , that you will judge the world ( or angels ) ? ( see Daniel 7:22 ) <p> A : Verse 2 asks if the Corinthians do not understand that Christians will someday judge the world . Daniel 7:22 says , " Then God Most High , the Eternal God , came and judged in favor of his chosen ones , because the time had arrived for them to be given the kingdom . " saints possessed the kingdom . " ( KJV ) <p> Verse 3 simply enlarges on this thought by extending it into the future when Gods kingdom has come and we Christians will actually judge angels . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even when Gods kingdom finally does comewhat we think of as heaventhere will still be disputes that must be judged . Think about that ! <p> The bottom line here is that Paul views believers as competent to judge cases where Christians have claims against each other , because they view matters from a Godly vantage point . Compared to our future role in judging the world and angels , judging things of this life is insignificant . <p> 5 . What point does Paul make in Verse 6 that applies to you today ? <p> A : When you have disputes with other Christians , it makes Christianity unattractive to non-believers . They look at us as hypocrites ( i.e. , people who say one thing but do another ) . Note that Paul is NOT saying that Christians wont have disputes , but he is saying do n't  air your dirty laundry in front of non-believers , and especially , do n't  ask them to judge your disputes . <p> Do you ever do that ? You have a dispute with your wife or a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian ) and tell your side of the story to get some support . <p> 6 . What does Paul mean in verse 7 when he says " lawsuits with one another are a defeat for you ? " ( Matthew 18:21-22 ) <p> A : He probably means that you are defeated by greed , retaliation , and vengeance . Does n't  the world tell us that we should get even ? How about that popular movie from last summer , " V is for Vengeance ? " Or books like " Getting Even " and " The Complete Revenge Kit ? " He means we are not forgiving one another as Jesus tells us to do . <p> Paul says that we should be willing to accept the injustice and leave it at that . Jesus said to forgive , to turn the other cheek . <p> Matthew 18:21-22 - Then Peter came to him and asked , " Lord , how often should I forgive someone who sins against me ? Seven times ? " 22 " No , not seven times , " Jesus replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this next paragraph ( verses 9-11 ) , Paul identifies a number of wrongs ( or sins ) that will prevent people entering the Kingdom of God . The first category is sexual sin . What are the four types of sexual immorality he lists here and in Romans 1:26 ? <p> A : 1 ) Adultery . 2 ) Male prostitute . 3 ) Male homosexual . 4 ) Female homosexual . Romans 1:26 - That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires . Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other . <p> 8 . Does that mean that if you committed adultery or had sex with a man you can not enter Gods Kingdom ? <p> A : No . God will forgive you if you truly repent and ask for forgiveness . Notice that Paul uses the present tense of the verb which implies that those who are continuing to indulge in sexual sin or continue to commit adultery are the ones he is speaking about . In fact , Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once like that , but you were cleansed ; you were made holy ; you were made right with God . " How ? By calling on the name of Jesus Christ and by the ( forgiving ) spirit of our God . <p> 9 . In addition to those who practice sexual immorality , what other types of people does Paul say will not enter the Kingdom of God ? <p> It is interesting to look at different Bible translations of verse 10 as several add even more sins . For example , the Amplified Bible says , " Nor cheats ( swindlers and thieves ) , nor greedy graspers , nor drunkards , nor foulmouthed revilers and slanderers , nor extortioners and robbers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God . " The Contemporary English Version adds , " anyone who curses . " The 21st Century King James and Youngs Literal add , " extortioners . " <p> 10 . Paul seems to have gone well beyond the Ten Commandments here ( Exodus 20:1-17 ) . What justification does he have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , it was Jesus who first enlarged the meaning of the ten commandments when he said in Matthew 5:21 , " You have heard that it was said to the people long ago , ' You shall not murder , and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment .

Again , anyone who says to a brother or sister , Raca ( Empty-head ) , is answerable to the Sanhedrin . And anyone who says , You fool ! will be in danger of the fire of hell . 23 " Therefore , if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember go and be reconciled to that person ; then come and offer your gift . 25 " Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court .

The city became the headquarters for the Gentile church and was Paul 's base of operations . Peter came for a visit , and Paul let him know he ( Paul ) disapproved of some of Peter 's actions . Review : The Judaizers accused Paul of allowing Gentile converts to ignore the law so that he would be more popular with them . Paul , in turn , accused the Judaizers of nullifying the power of Jesus ' sacrifice by adding conditions for salvation .

Rather than being portrayed as malevolent monsters , however , the recently deceased are attempting to return to their previous lives in the local community . A pilot was produced in 2007 for CBS with elements of black comedy as well as drama , but the network declined to pick up the show . <p> In October 2013 , Babylon Fields was resurrected by NBC , which ordered a new pilot from 20th Century Fox TV . The Cuesta brothers , Gerald and Michael , are back in their original roles as writers as is Michael Atkinson as director . The current resurgence in zombie interest , kicked off in 2010 with AMCs The Walking Dead , may bring new life to this pilot as well . Virginia Madsen plays Rhonda Wunch , the mother of a Centers For Disease Control scientist Thomas Wunch ( played by Kyle Schmid ) that she tries to lure back to Babylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal themselves ( and their family issues , presumably ) , foretelling what " might be the next step in human evolution , " according to The Hollywood Reporter . The show will also feature Skeet Ulrich ( familiar with small-town troubles from his turn in Jericho ) , playing both a minister and his twin brother , a junkie who returns from the dead . Our little group of military vehicle drivers was involved with Day 6 of the shoot ( Monday , March 24 , 2014 ) , which took place not in Babylon , but in Hempstead along Millburn Avenue by the large Greenfield Cemetery . The morning shoot at Location 1 was supposed to be in the cemetery itself but wound up being shot across the street in an open part of the fire department training center . As for us , we had been given a call time of 6:00 a.m. , which for me meant leaving my house in Morristown , NJ at 4:30 a.m . It was a bitterly cold day , in the teens at 4:30 and never got over the mid-20s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so darned cold , we all huddled in the large " base camp " tent ( 80 x 50 feet ) which had one midget propane heater along one 80-foot wall . And then at 8:30 , the generator cut off leaving the tent with no lights , heat , or coffee . As it appeared that no one knew what to do about it , I found a can of gas , refilled the generator and got it going again . I repeated this at 11:00 a.m. but warned a guy who seemed to have a modicum of authority that there was no more gas and the generator would quit for good around 1:30 unless someone found some more fuel . By that time , however , we military vehicle drivers ( Tom Stark and Angelo Passerini of the Long Island MV Club and me ) were out on Millburn Ave . on the overpass above Southern State Parkway at Location 2 where the blockade was to be set up . Why a blockade ? Well apparently the townsfolk in Babylon had seen the recently resurrected zombies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from the town . But National Guard troops all dressed up in white hazmat suits with sinister black breathing masks and M16s had set up a blockade to prevent the residents from leaving . I 'm not privy as to why they might want to do this but I 'm sure it will all be explained in the pilot . The troops had erected a heavy barricade fence across the road backed up by our two HMMWVs and a deuce . When the townsfolk tried to storm the barricade , the troops waved their guns around and kept announcing , " there 's nothing to be afraid of ; its not airborne . " But seeing the troops all in their hazmat suits and masks was probably not very reassuring . Around 1:30 p.m. a couple People In Authority started positioning our vehicles for the blockade scene . They got us arranged in a way that they liked and said , " okay , were done . " But then some other People With More Authority arrived and decided that the arrangement would " not look good on camera " so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place a half hour later . And then at 3:45 The Director arrived and decided that it was All Wrong and we were rearranged yet again , this time with two large back vans inserted between my HMMWV and the deuce . No explanation . It now looked more like a haphazard parking lot than a roadblock , but one does not argue with The Director . Despite our 6:00 a.m. call time , the blockade shoot did not finally begin until 4:00 p.m. because the director was unhappy with the morning shoot and ordered it to be redone . The blockade shoot was a big production : four lanes of 8 cars in each were lined up behind the barricade . During the shoot , drivers had to exit their vehicles and run up to the barricade and fruitlessly argue with the troops to remove it . As a result , many camera angles were required to get the people leaving their vehicles , running to the barricade , arguing with the troops , and so on . How many shots were made ? I lost count at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 in total . Each one lasted about a minute-and-a-half , of which maybe 30 seconds will survive on TV , and then everything had to be reset , which took anout 4 or 5 minutes .

Finally at 7:20 p.m. we heard the magic words , " its a wrap " which was the signal for us to go back to base camp , turn in your costume , if you had one , recover your paperwork , have it checked with the time out put on and signed , and finally head for home . The only good news was that at 8:00 p.m. , there 's a lot less traffic than at 5 or 6 , but driving the HMMWV at night on the narrow Long Island parkways had me so tense that when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day began , it was all I could do to collapse on the sofa with a glass of brandy . What ever happened to the planned 3rd shot of the day at Location 3 , " an open field " a short way south of Southern State Parkway ? Who knows ? Not me .

With an outstanding narration by F. LeGard Smith , this Bible helps you discover the Bible as the extraordinary epic it is . Spanning the events from the creation through the apocaplse , this Bible reads like a novel , weaving the Old and New Testaments into one continuous account of Gods interaction with man . All the prophets , major and minor , are where they belong and you can clearly see how Pauls missionary journeys spread Christianity in the early years . It also has a comprehensive summary of the events between the Old and New Testaments . For those who want to read the entire Bible in one year , it is organized into 365 chronological readings . The narrative portion is shaded in gray and it has scores of cross references if you want to dig deeper . <p> Complete Harmony of the Scriptures . The laws of Moses occur in several books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code arranged by subject .

" Why not ? " I thought , so I called him and accepted the gig . " Why not ? " Actually , if I had given it a few minutes thought , I would have five or six good reasons why not to do this . First , I 've been having problems with the HMMWV Protective Control Box that periodically refuses to pass any juice to the starter motor . Two alligator clips on a lead provide a work-around for this problem . Then there was the tiny leak I noticed a few weeks ago of some kind of liquid ( antifreeze , brake fluid , washer fluid , or fuel ? ) . And then I ran out of diesel fuel Monday and could n't get the vehicle restarted . Which led me to put out an emergency cry for help on the MTA List . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys in the MTA ! ) with suggestions of how to bleed the fuel system and get the vehicle restarted . Which I did . I then filled up with $100 of diesel and watched with dismay as the fuel leaked out through a **32;256;TOOLONG hole in the fuel pump . Another emergency post to the MTA List asking where can I find a new fuel pump fast ! Which was solved when Steve Vidam handed me a new fuel pump at the Monday night MTA meeting . <p> Steve warned me when installing the pump to make sure the pushrod hit the cam lever in the right place and to be very careful to not strip the brass threads . This was the day before the shoot , so I opted to take it to a truck mechanic who assured me he had installed " hundreds of fuel pumps just like this one " and thenyou guessed itproceeded to strip the threads . So then he has to fabricate a new fuel line and guess who got to pay for all this ? Yep , yours truly . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid in Morristown . ) Another " why not ? " It seems out that the TV scene manager wanted all the vehicles in place by 5:00 a.m . Yikes ! And still another " why not . " The shoot is at Silver Point Beach Park in Atlantic Beach out in Nassau County on Long Island . That 's a two-hour drive in the HMMWV at 55 mph ( which was actually possible on the Cross Bronx and Van Wyck at 4:00 a.m . ) . Jumping ahead , getting home was a totally differentand longerstory at 7:30 p.m . Yes , I was there on Atlantic Beach for 14+ hours ! The TV shoot was for the new show , Elementary , which airs on CBS at 10:00 p.m . Thursday nights . In this new series , Sherlock Holmes ( Jonny Lee Miller ) , a former consultant to Scotland Yard , developes a drug and alcohol addiction and travels to New York City to check into a rehabilitation center .

The other major character is Captain Tobias Gregson ( Aidan Quinn ) of the New York City Police Department . This particular episode involves the crash of a small twin engine plane on Atlantic Beach , a few miles short of Kennedy Airport . Five scenes ( about 15 minutes of air time ) were shot at the crash site . Initially , local police and fire fighters responded to the crash . Later , NTSB investigators arrive . As the investigation progresses , Sherlock is called in , examines the scene , and declares , " This was no accident . It was premeditated murder !

Camera angles were adjusted to show just the appropriate vehicles . Since the HMMWV played an extremely minor role of simply bringing three National Guard members to the site , it was parked way , way down the end of the site where its highly unlikely to show up in the finished shoot at all . Its quite amazing to see the elaborate set-up for just a one-day TV shoot : immense mess tent , kitchen , 18-wheelers of sound and video equipment , a fleet of quads , construction trailer , etc .

At lunch , I briefly spoke to and got the autographs ( yes , tacky , tacky ) of Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu . Throughout the day , I had some interesting chats with members of the crew , prop people , bit players , and Millers stand-in/stunt man . He says this job is a piece of cake because Sherlock does n't  do anything really dangerous and mostly what he has to do is stand in a spot for the cameras to get positioned and focused . Trivia : All the weapons they use these days are Airsoft . All the police and military uniforms have the rank of captain . Bit players wear their own shoes ( occasional exceptions ) .

My knuckles were still white when I finally backed the thing into the garage at home . And I can tell you that next time , I 'll think extra long about " why not . "

In 1778 , Portugal ceded some off-shore islands , and also the commercial rights to a part of the African coast that included present-day Rfo Muni , to the Spanish . Hoping to export Africans as slaves to their American possessions , the Spanish sent settlers to the islands , but they died of yellow fever , and by 1781 the region was abandoned by the Europeans . In 1963 , Spain finally granted the country ( renamed Equatorial Guinea ) a limited amount of autonomy , and on Oct. 12 , 1968 , it received complete independence .

Knowing very little French , I set out on a quest to find people willing to translate the books from French into English . Caleb of CTD Productions , another HergT fan , tanslated three of the books and I translated Haute Tension by Johan de Moor . Compounding the translation problem is the fact that many of the strips actually have two " gags , " the visual one , which you often can understand from the drawings alone , and a second verbal or language gag . These do not translate easily , or sometimes at all . It 's like translating Inspector Clouseau 's scenes from the Pink Panther films into Frenchit just does n't work . For example , in the strip , " Competition , " on pages 14-15 in Haute Tension , Flupke is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one T or two so the sign will be correct . But then he misspells the word " chez " ( home ) as " chF " which , for some reason , is hilarious to a native French speaker , but is completely incomprehensible and impossible to translate into English . ( In my translation , I changed the word gag altogether . ) This is not a money-making project by any means , it is a labor of love . However , the translated books are certainly worth something , so I 'm making all four of them ( 48 pages each ) available as four PDF files ( NOT paper books ) for just $5.00 , payable by PayPal .

@@58355791 @7355791/ <p> The beginning of the Ragdoll breed is quite confusing and full of contradictions , some parts of it even proven to be impossible . It is generally accepted that the original Ragdolls were the kittens of a non-pedigree cat called Josephine that was injured in an automobile accident in 1965 . They were raised by Ann Baker , a breeder of Persians , thus the confusion that the Ragdoll came from Persian stock . Some breeders believe that Ragdolls are a cross between a Siamese and Birman , which may or may not be correct . Ann Baker 's very strict breeding policies coupled with some rather strange beliefs caused some breeders to break off from Ann 's registry , the International Ragdoll Cat Association , and form a second Ragdoll registry , now known as the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International .

The main title should use the " Tintin " typeface or something close to it unless you 're imitating a cover with a distinctive type font of its own like King Ottokar 's Sceptre or Le Secret la Licorne . Images ( . jpg and . gif ) of the Tintin type font can be downloaded below . 4 . The cover should involve another comic character . My personal preference is that it be the Smurfs , Hello Kitty , or Wonder Wart-Hog . I 've included a bunch of images of all of them below ; you can click on any one to see a larger image , which can be downloaded if you wish .

@@58355810 @7355810/ <p> 1 . Does n't  the message of Christs dying 2000 years ago for the sins of all humans from the beginning to the end of time sound a bit foolish today ? <p> A : To a believer who God has called , this is the absolute truth . We believe that Jesus died for us , that he rose from the dead , and that he will save us and give us eternal life to those who have faith , not to those who try to do good deeds to earn his gift . <p> However , to a non-believer , this seems ridiculous . It sounds too simple . ( Leader : Give a personal example if you can . ) Our society worships power , influence and wealth . <p> Even some believers have a tough time with this concept . I know several people in our church that truly believe that the way to heaven is by being good and following Gods laws . <p> A : A lot of non-believers would certainly agree that Christianity is totally irrational , not at all logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Christians should not use their minds to weigh the evidence and make wise choices . What he is saying is that no amount of human knowledge can replace or bypass Christs work on the cross . <p> 3 . The end of this chapter ( vs 26-31 ) has two interwoven messages . They are closely related but significantly different and it is important that we understand both of them : A ) the source of our righteousness , i.e. , being right with God and B ) the key Christian quality of humility . What do these mean to you personally ? <p> A : The way to receive salvation is so simple that any person who wants to can understand it . Skill and wisdom do not get a person into Gods kingdomsimple faith doesso no one can boast that his or her achievements helped him or her secure eternal life . Salvation is totally through God through the death of Jesus . There is nothing we can do to earn our salvation ; we need only accept what Jesus has already done for us . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for yourself , but for the Lord . Much of the hostility between the various factions in the Corinthian church stemmed from attitudes of pride and boasting . Paul challenged them to put away their pride and arrogance and live in humility . He countered their pride in worldly wisdom with the simple , life-changing message of Christ crucified . Knowing that some were proud of their spiritual gifts , Paul urged them to build up the church in humility and boast only in the Lord . The church still struggles today with the sin of pride and its unity still depends upon each members commitment to humility . <p> A : Note in verse 30 , Paul finally admits that wisdom is not a bad thing to have , but he says that our belief and union with Jesus results in our having Gods wisdom and knowledge ( Colossians 2:3 ) , having a right standing ( righteousness ) with God ( 2 Corinthinas 5:21 ) , being holy ( 1 Thess 4:3-7 ) , and having the penalty for our sins paid by Jesus ( redemption , @ @ @ @ the new has come ! <p> Wisdom and knowledge Col 2:2-3 .

Why does Paul emphasize in 2:1-5 that he did not speak to the Corinthians before with eloquence or persuasiveness but he came in weakness and trepidation ? ( Romans 1:16-17 ) What is the message here for us today ? <p> A : Part of the answer is found in Verse 5 when he says he did not want their faith to be as a result of mans wisdom and persuasive speaking but on the gospel and Gods power written : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Refers to Habakkuk 2:4 ) <p> Remember , Paul was a brilliant scholar and could have overwhelmed his listeners with intellectual arguments . Instead , he shared the simple message of Jesus Christ allowing the Holy Spirit to guide his words . In sharing the gospel with others , we should follow Pauls example and keep our message simple and basic . The Holy Spirit will give power to your words . <p> On the other hand , Paul was not saying that it was not important to study and prepare for preaching . The Holy Spirit will definitely assist you when you speak , but do n't  use Pauls statement as an excuse not to study or be prepared when you speak will heal their land . 
@@58355811 @7355811/ <p> 1 . In Verse 18 , Paul speaks out against divisions in the church , but then in Verse 19 , he allows that some divisions in church are okay . Explain . <p> A : As Paul stated in earlier chapters , divisions resulting from a wrong conception of the Christian message or ministry , laxity in church discipline , lawsuits among believers , marriage issues , sexual immorality , propriety in worship ( head coverings ) , and from asserting ones freedom as a Christian that might cause another to stumble were deplorable and should be done away with . However , in Verse 19 , he points out that factions or divisions serve one good purpose in that they distinguish those who are faithful and true in Gods sight from hypocrites and non-believers . <p> 2 . Eating a meal vs. partaking of the Lords supper was a major issue 2,000 years ago , but is largely not an issue today . However , rich and poor factions ( vs 21-22 ) do exist today . What would Paul say about them ? <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feast in connection with the Lords Supper . We do n't  know much about this , but perhaps is was like a potluck supper in which people brought food to share , the rich bringing more and the poor bringing less , but because of their cliques , the rich ate well and the poor were left hungry . On the surface it is not a major issue today except from the standpoint of rich churches not sharing with the poor or rich factions within a church keeping to themselves and not mingling with the poor . Obviously , Paul would come down hard on not Christians sharing with the poor . <p> A : With respect to the Prosperity movement , rather than the verses above , Paul would probably be more likely to quote Psalm 49:16-20 , Matt 6:19-20 , Luke 12:33 , James 5:1-3 . ( Leader : Refer to your Bible for the verses and to the Time article , " Does God Want You to be RICH ? " of Sept. 18 , 2006 for more on the Prosperity Movement . ) <p> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's look specifically at Verse 25 in which Jesus says , " This cup is the new covenant ... " What exactly is meant by the phrase , " new covenant ? " ( Jeremiah 31:31-34 ) <p> A : In the old covenant with God , the people could only approach God through the priests and the system of sacrifices . Jesus death on the cross ushered in the new covenant ( or agreement ) between God and us . Now , all people can personally approach God and communicate with him . God established the old covenant with Abraham and enlarged on it after the Exodus ( Ex 24 ) . The new covenant completes rather than replaces the old covenant , fulfilling everything the old covenant looked forward to . <p> Jer 31:31-34 - " The day is coming , " says the Lord , " when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah . This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved them as a husband loves his wife , " says the Lord . <p> 33 " But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day , " says the Lord .

And they will not need to teach their neighbors , nor will they need to teach their relatives , saying , You should know the Lord. For everyone , from the least to the greatest , will know me already , " says the Lord . " And I will forgive their wickedness , and I will never again remember their sins . " <p> 5 . Remembrance ( vs 24-25 ) , proclamation or announcement ( vs 26 ) , and participation ( vs 10:16 ) are three realities of the Lords Supper . How would you explain to a non-believer how the Lords Supper accomplishes each of these ? <p> 6 . Many churches have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see 9-year-old children participating . Other churches require one to be confirmed or sign a statement of belief before receiving communion . How do you feel about this ? <p> A : Pauls answer would be that you should examine yourself before partaking in communion and that you should understand the three aspects of the Lords Supper in Question 4 ( remembrance , proclamation , participation ) . Is a 9-year-old mature enough to do this ? I do n't  know ; after all , Mozart wrote his first symphony when he was 8 . But maybe its not my position to judge others at the communion table . <p> 7 . There is not much support in the Bible for Pauls view in Verses 29-30 that if you partake of communion without honoring Christ , God will judge you and punish you with sickness and death . How do you feel about this ? <p> A : As the question says , this is a pretty isolated viewpoint . On the other hand , if you as a Christian participate in communion but dishonor Christ by thinking about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss the kickoff , or you participate thinking about getting revenge against someone else instead of forgiving them , you definitely risk Gods judgement and punishment . <p> 8 . In Verse 32 , Paul softens his view a bit in that he now speaks of being judged and disciplined ( rather than punished ) by the Lord . Is this a good thing ? ( Psalm 94:12 , 118:18 , Proverbs 3:11-12 , Hebrews 12:7-10 , Revelation 3:19 ) <p> A : Just as a father disciplines his children and looks for improvement , so the Lord disciplines us . Actually , we should be very pleased that the Lord loves us and cares enough about us to discipline us . <p> Psalm 94:12 - Blessed is the man you discipline , O LORD , the man you teach from your law ; you grant him relief from days of trouble , till a pit is dug for the wicked . <p> Psalm 118:18 - The LORD has chastened me severely , but he has not given me over to death . <p> Proverbs 3:11-12 - My son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resent his rebuke , because the LORD disciplines those he loves , as a father the son he delights in disciplined by his father ? If you are not disciplined ( and everyone undergoes discipline ) , then you are illegitimate children and not true sons . Moreover , we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it . How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live ! Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best ; but God disciplines us for our good , that we may share in his holiness . <p> Revelation 3:19 - Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline . So be earnest , and repent .

What do you think of this attitude ? <p> A : There are two issues here . First , the athlete in competition should train and compete with an eye to winning the prize , the gold medal . The second issue is that if someone has been disciplined in their training and competed to the very best of their ability and " only " won a silver medal , or came in 10th place , or even in last place , that does not mean that person is a loser . <p> 2 .

Moving into Chapter 10 , Paul recalls some lessons from the Exodus .

( Exodus 32:1-10 , Numbers 13:26 - 14:12 , 14:20-24 ) <p> A : God is looking for faith , not deeds . The people did not have faith that Moses would return from his meeting with God on Mount Sinai .

Now leave me alone so my fierce anger can blaze against them , and I will destroy them . Then I will make you , Moses , into a great nation . " <p> B.

In speaking of the fifth benefit , he expressly mentions Christ ; and in speaking of the fourth sin , he shows it was committed against Christ . <p> " As some of them tempted him " - This sin of the people was peculiarly against Christ ; for when they had so long drank of that rock , yet they murmured for want of water .

Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting , and the LORD said to Moses , " Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once . " And they fell face down . 46 : Then Moses said to Aaron , " Take your censer and put incense in it , along with fire from the altar , and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them .

After all , Jesus was tempted ( Matthew 4:1-11 ) Mt 4:1 - " Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil . " However , yielding to temptation IS sin . <p> 8 .

In fact , I 'm not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted Gods church . <p> 2 .

Does your faith have an impact on others ? Are you helping others to change their lives and grow spiritually ? How ( be specific ) ? <p> 4 . Jesus said to his disciples that they ( and other workers ) deserve their wages ( Luke 10:7 ) . What does this mean to you as a Christian and/or church member ? <p> A : Luke 10:7 - Do n't  move around from home to home . Stay in one place , eating and drinking what they provide . Do n't  hesitate to accept hospitality , because those who work deserve their pay . <p> Paul echoes this thought in verses 4 to 10 and says it is the responsibility of Christians and church members to care for and pay their pastors , church staff , teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that all those serving in the church or as missionaries are fairly and adequately compensated . <p> 5 . Sometimes church leaders abuse their right to receive support from members ( and others ) . Give an example . How can we guard against this ? <p> A : A church might expect a member who is a contractor to work on a building or perform repairs for free . Or expect a printer to donate printing services . Or a lawyer to draw up a contract without compensation . It is one thing if a church member freely offers his or her services free or at a deep discount , but quite another if the church puts pressure on someone to donate those services . As church members , we should make sure that everyone in the church and outside is fairly compensated . <p> I recently donated about a week of time planning and executing a team-building event for our church leaders . In addition to the time , I also paid for printing , supplies , prizes , and some other items . ( From a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) One of the top leaders said to me afterward , " This was great !

Oh , ho . <p> 6 . What does Paul mean by the adage from the Law of Moses , " You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain " ? ( Duet 25:4 ) <p> A : Duet 25:4 - " You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain . " <p> Paul elaborates on what he means in verses 10 to 12 when he says that soldiers protect the country and others pay their salary and upkeep .

In verses 16-18 , Paul says he is compelled by God to preach the gospel . On a scale of 1 to 10 , where are you ? ( 1 = I do n't  share the gospel with others because Im afraid or I do n't  know enough . 10 = I preach to anyone who will listen . ) <p> 8 . Preaching the gospel was Pauls gift and calling and he could n't stop preaching even if he wanted to . He was driven by the desire to do what God wanted , using his gifts for Gods glory .

In verses 19-22 Paul says at times he lived like a Jew , other times he lived like a Gentile . In verse 22 , he says , " I have become all things to all men . " That sounds kind of wishy-washy , like he has no personal convictions . True ? <p> A : Not at all . In effect these verses say that being a witness calls for courtesy and wisdom , not for compromise . " I have become all things to all men " means Paul used his very strong convictions to build bridges , not walls . If he seemed inconsistent , it was only because people did not look deep enough . His one great desire was to bring people to Christ , and it governed his every decision .

What do the verses 1-3 say about the value of spiritual gifts ? Paraphrase what Paul might have said to communicate the same truth with regard to your own spiritual gift(s) . <p> A : For a spiritual gift to be of value , it must be accompanied by love . About my gift for teaching , Paul might have said , " If I had the gift of teaching and had studied all the books in the library and read all of the commentaries on the Internet , but did not love others , I would be of no more value than a cartoon guru on an inaccessible mountain in Tibet .

What is the difference between lust and love ? <p> A : Lust is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean strictly sexual lust , although it is also common to speak of a " lust for life " , " lust for blood ( bloodlust for short ) " , or a " lust for power " or other goals . As a moral term , lust implies a sexual desire for its own sake , an erotic arousal and wish , or intense physical or sexual attraction or craving . In contrast , Love , as Paul is speaking of here is , in the Greek , known as agape , which does not refer to emotional love , but to seeking the best for the other person without regard to the closeness of relationship with that person . If we are honest with ourselves , this kind of love goes against our natural inclinations . It is possible to practice this kind of love only if God helps us set aside our own desires and instincts , so that we can give love while expecting nothing in return . The more we become like Christ , the more love we will show others . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward you personally ? What factor(s) enabled that person to demonstrate such love for you ? What changes do you need to experience to demonstrate this kind of love for others ? <p> 7 . What is taught about spiritual gifts and eternity in verses 8-10 ? <p> A : Love never fails , but spiritual gifts will cease and in eternity be unnecessary and useless . Paul take of three of the greatest spiritual gifts : prophecy , speaking in tongues , and knowledge , all of which will are partial and incomplete , and will all be unnecessary when complete understanding comes . When will this be ? Verse 12 implies that a Christian will understand everything completely and will know the Lord just as God now knows meand this will happen when at Christs second coming . <p> 8 . On the basis of verse 11 and your own experience , what role does maturity have in ones ability to love ? Describe how mature love differs from childish love . <p> A : Clearly , agape love is not something that comes naturally to a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows in you as you turn over more and more of your life to the Holy Spirit . Childish love has elements of lust , of being thankful for protection , warmth , or a gift , and of showing love for what you get in return . <p> 9 . What does verse 12 teach you about Christian hope ? ( Hebrews 11:1 ) What are some things you " see in a mirror dimly " now that you someday hope to see more clearly ? <p> A : Side note : mirrors in Pauls day were polished pieces of bronze and even the best mirror was dull compared to seeing the real thing . Christian hope is an absolute certainty if you have faith . Heb 11:1 - Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see . 
@@58355827 @7355827/ <p> What Is Computer Music ? Computer music can be defined as a type of electronic music which is produced either directly by a computer or indirectly by a computer-controlled synthesizer . Computers can produce a sound directly by storing the waveform of that sound as a series of varying numbers in its memory and then converting these numbers to voltages to drive a speaker . The string of numbers can be manipulated by the computer at very fast speeds which accounts for the amazing flexibility of computer synthesized music . Although , theoretically , any sound could be produced in this manner , the programming can get rather tedious . But computers are also being used to sequence and to control the parameters of conventional synthesizer circuits . This is much easier , but perhaps a bit less flexible , than directly computing each waveform . This latter technique is the most popular today and accounts for most of the music on this album . <p> The Personal Computer Music Revolution I often wonder what music will be like after the microelectronics revolution puts a computer in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until this time music listening has been just thatpassive listening to recordings of music . But with computers we all become " sound explorers " because we can now take an active part in changing the music we hear or to compose our own . We can master any instruments sound without the years of tedious practice or we can create our own " instruments ; " combinations of conventional ones or entirely new ones . The technology to do all this is here today and the mass production and availabilityof personal computers is being felt by the public as never before . We are truly at the dawn of the personal computer music revolution . Just as the radio brought music listening to the masses , so will computers bring music composition and exploration to them too . <p> About The Personal Computer Music Festival Early in 1978 , 1 received a call from John Dilks asking me if there were anything that our Computer Society wanted to do for his show . John was organizing the Personal Computing ' 78 Show which our Society was hosting in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music with their computers so I suggested we have a computer music concert . John OKd the idea and we went to work calling our friends and urging them to perform . By summer the local response was not as great as we had anticipated . Many of the computer musicians were reluctant or too shy to perform at a computer music concert , something they had never heard of before . But word of the concert had spread and a steady stream of calls from all over the country began to come in . Hal Chamberlin , one of the early computer music pioneers , agreed to come as did Carl Helmers ( editor of Byte Magazine ) , Dave Ahl ( publisher of Creative Computing ) , and Malcolm Wright ( engineer at Solid State Music in California ) . Dorothy Siegel called from New York to say she was arranging a piece for computer and clarinet specially for the concert ! Rick Simpson from RCA had a number of pieces to play on their new computer and some would be accompanied by an " engineer-flutist " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond what we had originally anticipated . Fortunately , we acquired some very talented volunteers from the Computer Society to meet the new demands placed upon us . The dedication of this small group made the Festival the success it was . The concert was finally held in oneof the larger ballrooms of the Sheraton Hotel . Our borrowed sound system was set up and sound checks made for the recording . We opened the doors to the crowd outside to find several hundred more people than the room could hold . Many sat on thefloorsof the halls as the music filled the hotel . Hal Chamberlin had set up an oscilloscope that would project the waveform being played on a screen . The result was a fantastic synchronized light show ! Part of the concert was filmed by TV Ontarios Fast Forward Office for use in a special series on personal computing . This was perhaps the first concert to be held which featured music synthesized using personal computer systems . The concert lasted close to three hours and the room was still packed when the last piece was played . 
@@58355836 @7355836/ <p> 1 . What false teaching was being spread among the Corinthians ( Verse 12 ) ? <p> A : Most Greeks did not believe that peoples bodies would be resurrected after death . They saw the afterlife as something that only happened to the soul . According to Greek philosophers , the soul was the real person , imprisoned in a physical body , and at death the soul was released . <p> 2 . In this chapter , Paul argues the issue of the resurrection from many angles and presents his arguments several times over . Why ? <p> A : The resurrection of Christ is the center and cornerstone of the Christian faith . <p> 3 . Summarize the seven " if-thens " in Verses 12 to 19 from first to last . ( Some are repeated ; there are actually just three of them . ) <p> A : <p> IF <p> THEN <p> 1 . Dead are not raised2 . Christ is not raised3 . Your faith is futile <p> Christ is not raisedPreaching is uselessWe are to be pitied more than all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements in a positive way : IF Christ was raised from the dead , THEN , what are the implications of this ? <p> A : If Christ rose from the dead as both he and the prophets promised , then we know what he said is true . If Christ was raised , then we know he is the son of God . If Christ was raised , then we know that he lives and represents us to God . If Christ was raised , we know our sins are forgiven . If Christ was raised , we know we will all be raised . In Christ was raised , our preaching is worthwhile . If Christ was raised , our faith gives us hope . If Christ was raised , we believers are the most blessed of all men . <p> Can you see from this why the resurrection is the center element of Christianity ? <p> 5 . In Verse 19 , why does Paul say that believers should be pitied if Christianity only had earthly value ? What is the implication of this today ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person persecution , ostracism from his family and society , and , in many cases , poverty . There were few tangible benefits from being a Christian 2000 years ago . <p> More important , especially for today , is the fact that if Christ had not been resurrected , Christians would not have their sins forgiven and would have no hope of eternal life . If you do not believe that Christ was resurrected but you believe in God , you should be a Jew , still looking for Christ the savior . <p> 6 . What are " firstfruits " ( Verses 20 , 23 ) ? Why does Paul make the analogy of Christ with firstfruits ? ( Leviticus 23:10-20 ) <p> A : Firstfruits were the first part of the harvest that faithful Jews brought to the temple as an offering . In Lev 23:10 , God instructs Moses saying , " Give the following instructions to the people of Israel . When you enter the land I am giving you and you harvest its first crops , bring the priest a bundle of grain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verses go on to describe offering young male lambs , goats , and loaves of bread as peace offerings to the Lord . <p> Paul says Christ is like the firstfruits as he is the first one to rise from the dead and never die again . ( Lazarus and others that Christ raised from the dead then died a natural death later on . ) So Christ is the forerunner for us and the proof of our eventual resurrection to eternal life . <p> 7 . Pauls thoughts in Verses 20-28 about Adam and Christ are also expressed in Romans 5:12-20 in a slightly different way . How would you summarize these verses ? <p> A : Actually , the single verse of Romans 5:19 is many will be made righteous . <p> 8 . What does Paul mean in Verses 31-32 when he says , " I die every day " and " I fought wild beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever felt that life is futile ? <p> A : Paul is speaking of his daily exposure to danger as a Christian and facing opposition to his Christian teaching . While today we may not experience physical danger or open hostility from being a Christian , there are many people who are not receptive and do n't  want to hear about it . How do you feel about politicians that represent themselves as Christians and behave in decidedly non-Christian ways ? <p> 9 . Paul cites a reference from Isaiah in Verse 32 and what looks like a proverb in Verse 33 but is actually a quote from the Greek poet Menander . What is his point ? Does this apply today ? <p> A : Keeping company with people who say , " let us eat , drink , and make merry , for tomorrow we die , " and with people who do n't  believe in Christs resurrection could corrupt good Christian character . Obviously , this is just as applicable today as it was in Pauls day . <p> 10 . When you are with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal say " bon appetite rather than grace , who are morally good people but not Christians , who are ignorant of God ( vs 34 ) , how do you behave ? A. Do n't  make waves , talk about non-controversial subjects . B. Tell them that they are going to hell in a handbasket . C. Tell them about Gods love . D. Excuse yourself and find another group . E. Something else LONG ... 
@@58355837 @7355837/ <p> NOTE : This discussion is on the long side and you may wish to divide it into two sessions , the first ending at verse 6:5 and the second picking up with verse 6:6 . As usual , answers are provided for only some of the questions . Many questions are primarily to stimulate discussion and there are no right or wrong answers . <p> 1 . If you belong to Christ ( vs. 5:24 ) does that mean you will no longer have any sinful desires ? <p> No . As Christians we still have the capacity to sin and we will still sin , but we have been set free from sin 's power over us . However , we must daily confess our sins to God and commit our sinful tendencies to God 's control , and moment by moment draw upon the Holy Spirit 's power to overcome them . <p> 2 . Does verse 25 mean that God is mainly interested in the spiritual part of our lives ? <p> Not at all . If we live by the Holy Spirit as Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our lives to God emotional , physical , social , intellectual , vocationl . Paul says that because we 're saved , we should live like it . The Holy Spirit is the source of your new life , so keep in step with his leading . Do n't letanything or anyone else determine your values and standards in any area of your life . <p> 3 . Do you want to win the approval of other people ? ( Philippians 2:3 ) <p> Did you give the " Christian " answer of " no ? " If so , you 're deceiving yourself because everyone needs a certain amount of approval from others . If you go out of your way to win honors or win popularity because of your own selfish ambition , that 's bad , that leads to being conceited and it also leads to you feeling envious of others who are more popular or have receive more honors than you . Certainly , we should look to God for approval and feel absolutely wonderful about his love for us , but that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help from others . This works two ways : just as you need approval and help from time to time , do n't forget that others do too , so be generous offering approval and help to others . <p> 4 . What is the danger of correcting someone else 's sin or wrong ? <p> Paul says one danger is that you may also be tempted to sin . For example , if someone tells you a nasty little secret about someone else , you may say to your friend , " you know , you really should n't gossip about Bill like that . " But then you get to thinking , " that 's a really juicy little morsel ; I 've got to tell someone about it . " Or if a friend is looking at a picture in a porn magazine or on the Internet , you may approach him to say , " hey , that 's not really good for you , " but then he says , " yeah , but take a look at this . You 've never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The second danger of correcting someone else is that you get to feel that you 're better than he is . I know a woman who grew up in a home with a mother who was an alcoholic , kind of unusual , and today she is a gentle but persistent crusader against drugs and alcohol . I have the utmost respect for her she sets a good example , she 's not in your face about it , and she has a powerful testimony of the problems that alcohol can cause in a family . But this woman has an unrelated but serious problem of her own and until very recently , any efforts to bring it to her attention , even very gently and lovingly , were met with an attitude of " that 's not important ; look at all these things I do ; I 'm better than that . " <p> The third danger is putting a barrier between you and the other person . Of making him reject Christ and Christians . <p> 5 . Do you ever think it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island ? <p> No Christian should ever think that he is totally independent and does n't need help from others , and no one should feel excused from the task of helping others . The body of Christ the church functions only when all the members work together for the common good . <p> 6 . Why is it important to have Christian friends ? <p> Someone to gently point out your sins . Someone with the same Godly values and standards that you have , not living by earthly values . Someone to give you encouragement and help . Someone that you can encourage and help . <p> 7 . Do you ever compare yourself to someone else ? Why ? ( Vs. 6:4 ) <p> People look at the flaws in someone else to feel better about themselves . Others simply want reassurance that they are doing well . When you 're tempted to compare yourself with someone else , compare yourself with Jesus for a dose of humility . His example will inspire you to do your very best and his loving acceptance will comfort you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the material needs of their teachers . It is easy to receive the benefit of good Biblical teaching and then take our spiritual leaders for granted , ignoring their physical and financial needs . We should care for our teachers with a generous spirit and show them honor and appreciation for all they have done . <p> 9 . Do you believe that you reap what you sow ? ( Vs. 6:7 , Job 4:8 ) <p> It is a natural law that you reap what you sow . If you plant corn , I think you 'd be surprised to find a field of pumpkins five months later . Likewise , every action has a result . If you gossip , you 're going to lose friends . If you lie , you 're going to be known as a man of no integrity . Even though your sins and wrong may not be punished here , today , you can be sure that God is watching and there is no escape from His justice . <p> 10 . Do you find it hard to keep doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least I do ) . That 's one reason it 's important to have some Christian friends to offer an occasional word of encouragement or thanks . In Verses 9-10 , Paul challenged the Galatians to continue to do good and not get weary " for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up ... we will reap eternal life . " <p> 11 . In Verse 6:11 , Paul says , " see what large letters I use ... " What the meaning of this ? <p> Up to this point , Paul had dictated the letter and now he was writing the closing in his own hand . He did this with his other letters too to add emphasis to his closing words and to validate that the letter was genuine . It was very much like a signature and a hardwritten P.S. today . Did you know that a P.S. in a direct mail letter is read by seven times as many people as read the body of the letter itself ?

@@58355843 @7355843/ <p> A : This is food offered on pagan alters . Meat left over might be eaten by the priests or even by the offerer and his friends at a feast in the temple . Some might even be sold in a public meat market . Some Christians felt if they ate such meat they participated in pagan worship and compromised their testimony for Christ . <p> 2 . In 50AD at the Council at Jerusalem , there was much discussion about what should be required of Gentiles to become a Christian . Peter , Paul , James , and the others finally agreed on four requirements for Gentiles . They are ... ( Acts 15:20 ) <p> A : James sums up the discussion in Acts 15:20 - " Instead , we should write and tell them to abstain from eating food offered to idols , from sexual immorality , from eating the meat of strangled animals , and from consuming blood . " Thus , some early Gentile converts to Christianity felt they could not eat food that had been offered to an idol even if later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians . <p> 3 . Summarize what Paul is saying verses 8:1-3. ( 1 Timothy 6:4 ) <p> A : 1 Tim 6:4 - " Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding . Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words . This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy , division , slander , and evil suspicions . " In other words , your limited knowledge can puff you up with false pride and cause you to get into disagreeable arguments over relatively minor matters and lose sight of Christian love for one another . <p> From the Message : " The question keeps coming up regarding meat that has been offered up to an idol : Should you attend meals where such meat is served , or not ? We sometimes tend to think we know all we need to know to answer these kinds of questionsbut sometimes our humble hearts can help us more than our proud minds . We never really know enough until we recognize that God alone knows it all . " <p> 4 . Verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most important verse of all . Explain . ( Psalm 1:6 , Jeremiah 1:5 , Galatians 4:9 , 1 John 4:7-8 ) <p> A : Psalm 1:6 - For the Lord watches over the path of the godly , but the path of the wicked leads to destruction . <p> Jeremiah 1:5 - " I knew you before I formed you in your mothers womb . Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations . " <p> Gal 4:9 - But now that you know Godor rather are known by Godhow is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles ? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again ? because God is love . <p> The bottom line here is that a person who tempers his knowledge with love toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God as one of Gods own children . <p> 5 . Verse 8:6 is a basic statement of Christianity . Let 's trace this building of the Christian faith from the Old Testament to the New Testament . ( Deuteronomy 4:35 , Isaiah 46:9 , Malachi 2:10 , John 1:3 , John 13:13 , 1 Timothy 2:5 , Ephesians 4:5-6 ) <p> A : Duet 4:35 - You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God ; besides him there is no other . <p> Isaiah 46:9 - Remember the former things , is none like me . <p> Malachi 2:10 - Have we not all one Father ? Did not one God create us ? Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers by breaking faith with one another ? <p> John 1:3 - Through him all things were made ; without him nothing was made that has been made . <p> John 13:13 - Jesus said , " You call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what I am . " <p> 1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus , <p> Ephesians 4:5-6 - one Lord , one faith , one baptism ; 6 one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all . <p> 6 . Pauls central theme in Verses 7 to 13 might be summed up as " Freedom with Responsibility . " How would you explain this in your own words . ( Romans 14:13 ) <p> A : Eugene Peterson in the Message says , " say you flaunt your freedom by going to a banquet thrown in honor of idols , where the main course is meat sacrificed to idols . Isnt there great danger if someone still struggling over this issue , someone who looks up to you as knowledgeable and mature , sees you go into that banquet ? The danger is that he will become terribly confusedmaybe even to the point of getting mixed up himself in what his conscience tells him is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . Would n't you at least be willing to give up going to dinner for himbecause , as you say , it does n't really make any difference ? But it does make a difference if you hurt your friend terribly , risking his eternal ruin ! When you hurt your friend , you hurt Christ . " <p> Romans 14:13 - So let 's stop condemning each other . Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall . <p> 7 . What are some similar situations today ? In other words a situation where one Christian thinks it is wrong to do something , you " know " it is not wrong , but doing it in front of the other person might cause him to stumble . <p> A : Drinking alcohol , smoking , dancing , going to the movies , etc . There are many things that some Christians have been taught or come to believe is wrong , things that are not prohibited by the Bible or any of Gods laws . <p> 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians behave in a way that conforms to the beliefs of the " weakest " one , is n't that like everyone having to slow down to the speed of the slowest car on the road ? Should we " knowledgeable " ones try to educate the other believers ? ( Matthew 18:6 , Romans 14:21 , Galatians 5:13 ) <p> A : Matthew 18:6 - But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin , it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea . <p> Romans 14:21 - It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble . <p> Galatians 5:13 - For you have been called to live in freedom , my brothers and sisters . But do n't  use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature . Instead , use your freedom to serve one another in love .
