As Wake County prosecutors worked Tuesday to portray Amanda Hayes as a wife who was angry and resentful toward the woman she is accused of killing , defense attorneys put forth their own image of their client 's husband , who they say controlled and manipulated her to the point that she was forced to help him get rid of the body . <p> Amanda Hayes , 41 , is charged with first-degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder in the July 13 , 2011 , death of Laura Jean Ackerson . The 27-year-old Kinston woman 's remains were found in a Texas creek 1,200 miles from the Raleigh apartment , where authorities say she was killed and dismembered . <p> Hayes ' husband , Grant Hayes " the father of Ackerson 's two young sons " was convicted of murder in the case in September and is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole . <p> Amanda Hayes ' defense attorneys say she is not guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death until much later , when Grant Hayes threatened to kill her and his children if she did n't persuade her sister to help in disposing of Ackerson 's remains . <p> But the state said in opening statements Monday that Amanda Hayes , who , along with her husband , was involved in a bitter custody fight with Ackerson , not only knew about the crime but admitted to her sister that she hurt Ackerson and that Ackerson was dead . <p> Amanda Hayes resented Ackerson so much , prosecutors contend , that she treated her as if she did n't exist " something Ackerson wrote about in a diary she kept that documented all her interactions with the Hayeses . <p> Lolita Chapman , a special agent for the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation , read entries from the log in which Ackerson expressed concerns about Amanda Hayes becoming increasingly upset with her when they met to pick up and drop off Ackerson 's children for custody visits . <p> " She told me that she was responsible for my kids now , because I 'm psycho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 , diary entry .

" <p> Ackerson also had concerns that the Hayeses were n't encouraging the children " ages 2 and 1 at the time " to talk with her when she called , leaving her feeling " irrelevant . " <p> " They act as though I do n't exist . I have done nothing to Amanda , " she wrote on Sept. 10 , 2010 . " But to them , I am psycho crazy .

Just the other day , as snow and ice covered the ground , I saw a tween boy trudging through the snow in shorts on his way to get frozen yogurt . <p> Is there something going on internally that makes them hotter than the rest of us ? Or is it just cool to be cool ? <p> I checked in with Dr. Sarah Ryan at Rex Pediatrics to get some answers . Before our interview , Ryan , mom of a nine-year-old daughter , polled her own Facebook friends to get their take on the topic and was surprised to see the quick response . <p> Ryan said you can probably blame the kids ' maturity level on their fashion choices . It 's no longer cool to dress the way mom wants . <p> " They are starting to have their independence from parents , they are starting to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ryan also points out that kids are typically more active than the rest of us so they may not legitimately be getting cold . In other cases , it might be comfort . Maybe they just do n't like the feeling of pants on their legs , she said . And , in some cases , especially for the kids on the autism spectrum , it could be a sensory issue , she added . <p> If it 's 30 degrees or even 20 degrees and kids are running from car or bus into the school entrance , naked legs are probably something parents do n't need to worry too much about , Ryan said . The kids should be fine . ( And , let 's face it , in many cases , kids have their Nike Elite socks pulled up so high that really only their knees are exposed ) . <p> But parents do need to worry about prolonged exposure to the cold , she said . Wearing shorts in sub-freezing temperatures on a long walk home from school probably is n't the best idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they might do if they get stuck in a broken down school bus or car and have to wait in the cold for help . <p> Parents also can use the experience as a lesson for their kids . If kids do n't dress warmly , they 'll eventually learn that they do need to don more jackets and pants and fewer shorts when it 's cold , she said . <p> That 's what happened with Ryan and her daughter . Her daughter refused to wrap up for an outdoor , cold weather soccer practice one week despite her mother 's requests . She got cold . The next week , she bundled up on her own . <p> But , if you 're still worried about your kids being too cold , Ryan said the fight should n't be over pants . Focus on a hat . <h> srynFeb 8 , 2014 <p> Thank you LuvstoQ for bringing this up--I researched this further . Many sites still list high percentages of heat loss through the head . This stems from a military study done in the 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations in people wearing arctic survival suits with their heads exposed . Some more recent studies in people wearing swim suits exposed to the cold , only 7-10% of heat loss comes from the head . However , the face , chest , hands and feet are more sensitive to the cold . Also , the younger the child , the larger surface area of the head in proportion to the rest of the body , so more heat is lost . Although the absolute percentage of heat loss is variable , it still makes sense to wear a hat to prevent heat loss from the body , especially if one 's legs are exposed ! Here is one site that gives a brief synopsis : LONG ... Ryan , MD <h> glargFeb 7 , 2014 <p> " A good compromise might be to have a child pack a pair of pants in their backpack for emergencies " <p> Emergency Pants ? <p> And kids today do n't  have any space left in their backpacks . Especially not for optional clothing . <h> beaupeepFeb 3 , 2014 <p> View quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter never wears a coat ! I do make her keep one in her car but she never puts it on . She says she does n't like coats and she 's not outside long enough for it to matter anyway when she goes in and out of school or other places . She 's a smart girl with a good head so even though it aggravates me , I do n't fight that battle . If she gets cold enough , she 'll put one on and if she breaks down somewhere or finds herself outside for longer than usual , at least she has one available ! Pick your battles .

I was n't even aware of it until the Chorus teacher referred to him as " Legs " because he wore shorts all winter . He left for school shortly after I left for work &amp; he was home when I got off work . We still tease him to this day ! <h> RGMTRocksFeb 3 , 2014 <p> Hahahahaha ! ! ! This is not only a tween/teen kid issue .
