The game changed and consumers now had a choice of long-distance providers " however , not everything was equal . So a group of visionaries came together and formed a company to build a communications network and hub that would provide one central location for all the long-distance carriers and independent telecommunication companies to connect . This innovative idea was the birth of Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Access ( CEA ) network in the United States . <p> The INS network delivery model has not only survived , but thrived ; - all in the midst of industry regulation and change . And change- the industry did . As the calendar continued to turn , technologies and the way people communicated began to expand exponentially and the needs of both the independent telecommunication companies and the end user began to alter . <p> The old way of doing business was no longer necessarily the best way of doing business . Once again , there was a driving force to reinvent . INS chose to leverage their historic connectivity to small- and mid-sized businesses to ensure the success of the company moving forward . To do so meant to continue to diversify beyond the realm of telecommunications and find new ways to help clients enhance revenues , simplify their operations and keep people connected . <h> Necessity is the Mother of Invention <p> A common theme fueled the diversification strategy : unify business support solutions in order to help clients handle the complexities of doing business , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The talent , technology and tools were the core tenants that defined each business . <p> Collectively , these traits served each individual business well . But to fully realize the value of all this diversification , and to move into the future with purpose and clarity , we needed only to look back to our own unique history for guidance . <p> Multiple connections . One central hub. - <p> Aligning synergies to increase efficiencies. - <p> With that purpose , Aureon was born " with one unified workforce , focused on collaboration , common processes and technologies .

@@121230400 @10230400/ 221979 @qwx1081979 <h> Why Your Social Media Interactions Are So Important <p> It 's a busy morning . You have a meeting in five minutes , but your child had an electronic gadget malfunction last night . Being a great parent , you reassured them you would take care of the issue in the morning . If you 're like me , you do n't even have time to make a phone call or write an email when you 're at work . A quick and easy way to report the issue is by using social media . - <p> Twitter is becoming a popular channel to report issues . Why ? Because the experience is easy and does n't take the consumer a lot of time . All it takes is a simple Tweet to the company . Organizations should pay as much attention to the consumers on social media as they do incoming calls , chats , and emails . Fast , accurate , and warm responses have as much of an impact as being greeted with a smile and friendly voice when checking into your favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done a great job with social media interaction . The three organizations mentioned below respond quickly to tweets and the customer service they provide to their customers is second to none . <h> NO TWEET FORGOTTEN <p> Alex &amp; Ani , a jewelry brand , makes it a point to respond to every tweet and message they receive on Twitter . It does n't matter if it is positive or negative ; when someone tweets at them , they make time to reply . It creates a positive impact on the customer to know that the brand listens and values each of them . In today 's busy world , this is rare , especially when you have thousands of Twitter followers . <p> Slack , a communication tool designed for the workplace , is another good example of social media moderation and response . A look at their Twitter feed shows a clever blend of wit , friendliness , helpfulness , and emojis . They reply to many tweets , showing they 're dedicated to helping their customers stay productive with their chat tool . While writing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they replied to two people in that span . It 's great to respond to your customer 's questions , and it 's even better to do so in a friendly way that is both professional and casual at the same time . Slack does both , and does it in a way that shows they are approachable and appreciative . <p> Royal Dutch Airlines has a Twitter presence unlike any other I 've seen . They came up with the idea of putting the estimated response time in their Twitter account header image . As I 'm writing this , their response time is 16 minutes , which is n't instantaneous , but the fact that the response time is listed in the first place is a testament to their brand . This shows they care about their customers and desire to keep their customers happy . This kind of moderation is exemplary , and is a dedication to exceptional customer service . <h> KEEP IT CONSISTENT <p> These three organizations have their Twitter moderation running smoothly , and they have two things in common : timely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media moderation today is consistency . With goals of delivering great customer service every single time , moderation needs to be done on a consistent basis and every reply needs to represent the company 's brand . This may take extra effort , but in the end , it 's worth it . At the end of the day , we all want our businesses to be successful and our customers to be satisfied with their service . <p> Does your organization need help handling its social media accounts ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Bobbie Jo Barry has more than 18 years of contact center experience in multiple areas , including designing client facing solutions , managing day to day operations of two contact centers , leading workforce management and contact center managers to success , managing client relationships , and providing employees with a foundation for success .

Put paid parental leave on the list . According to an Ernst &amp; Young Study , millennials value workplace flexibility and paid parental leave more than other generations . Why is this emphasis on millennials important ? Because in 10 years , 75 percent of the workplace will be millennial . <p> Paid parental leave is also gaining popularity among organizations . According to a SHRM study , 16 percent of employers offered paid maternity leave in 2011 and 21 percent in 2015 . A number of states and cities have also enacted paid sick leave or paid family leave regulations . <h> SETTING THE STANDARD HIGH <p> The following organizations have recently made headlines after announcing new or updated parental leave policies . <p> Netflix- recently instated a policy that allows salaried employees to take as much paid time off as they want in the year after the birth or the adoption of a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks for birth mothers and 12 weeks for all parents of new children .

In addition , parents of newborn or adopted children get a year break from business travel . <p> Hilton Worldwide- recently stated that all new parents will get two weeks of paid leave , and new birth mothers will get 10 weeks of paid leave . <p> Johnson &amp; Johnson-- offers new parents eight weeks of paid leave to use at some point in the first year of the birth or adoption of a child . <h> WHY IT 'S IMPORTANT <p> Family-friendly benefits are a key differentiator for employers competing for top talent . An organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Offering paid family leave benefits positively impacts employee turnover and retention over time .

Put paid parental leave on the list . According to an Ernst &amp; Young Study , millennials value workplace flexibility and paid parental leave more than other generations . Why is this emphasis on millennials important ? Because in 10 years , 75 percent of the workplace will be millennial . <p> Paid parental leave is also gaining popularity among organizations . According to a SHRM study , 16 percent of employers offered paid maternity leave in 2011 and 21 percent in 2015 . A number of states and cities have also enacted paid sick leave or paid family leave regulations . <h> SETTING THE STANDARD HIGH <p> The following organizations have recently made headlines after announcing new or updated parental leave policies . <p> Netflix- recently instated a policy that allows salaried employees to take as much paid time off as they want in the year after the birth or the adoption of a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks for birth mothers and 12 weeks for all parents of new children . Parents are also allowed to split the leave into two segments and return to the workplace slowly . <p> Wells Fargo- began offering paid parental leave for the first time in June 2016 , and just recently changed it to 16 weeks for a primary caregiver and four weeks for a non-primary caregiver following a birth or an adoption . <p> Accenture- increased their maternity leave to 16 paid weeks and also offers paid leave for secondary caregivers . In addition , parents of newborn or adopted children get a year break from business travel . <p> Hilton Worldwide- recently stated that all new parents will get two weeks of paid leave , and new birth mothers will get 10 weeks of paid leave . <p> Johnson &amp; Johnson-- offers new parents eight weeks of paid leave to use at some point in the first year of the birth or adoption of a child . <h> WHY IT 'S IMPORTANT <p> Family-friendly benefits are a key differentiator for employers competing for top talent . An organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Offering paid family leave benefits positively impacts employee turnover and retention over time . Research suggests that women are more likely to continue working after having a child when paid leave is offered , so organizations offering this benefit are more likely to retain workers they have invested significant time and expense into developing . - <p> Think of it this way : the several weeks or months that it would take to find a replacement for the new parent , along with the costs to recruit , interview , train , and develop a new employee , usually outweighs the cost of providing paid leave . <p> Is it time for your organization to rethink paid parental leave ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> As a Human Resources Business Partner for Aureon HR , Sarah Charlier engages directly with Presidents , CEOs , and Executive Leadership in organizations to identify and execute strategic human resources initiatives .

Most people automatically think of innovation as major advancements in technology that change our lives instantly . Things such as your smartphone , streaming video , and social media come to mind as examples . Our world is always coming up with a new and better way of doing things , and oftentimes technology is the means to do that . <p> Interestingly enough , most innovation does n't happen overnight . You may have innovative ideas every day without even realizing it . Solving problems using a new technique , thinking of a way to optimize operations , or making improvements in customer service are all forms of innovation . What seems like small , everyday actions can actually be a form of micro innovation . Several of these steps together can become the fabric of what propels an organization into the future. - <p> Here are three ways your organization can become more innovative . <h> CREATE AN INNOVATIVE ENVIRONMENT <p> Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuring out what your employees are good at , and then remove any obstacles getting in the way of them achieving their best . When people are motivated and happy , this usually spurs creativity and outside-of-the-box thinking , which leads to bright ideas . <h> INNOVATE HOW YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS <p> Another way to be innovative is to come up with a new and better way of doing things at your organization . This could be coming up with a new process that is more efficient or brainstorming a solution to a constant problem . <p> One example I think of is car2go . They had to innovate to figure out how to provide great customer service in the face of extreme growth . Their business was expanding at an unexpected rate , and they had to find a way to handle the increase in customer service demands . In the end , they decided to work with a partner to handle their customer service . In doing this , they positioned themselves more effectively for growth and allowed their staff to focus on larger initiatives , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought leadership of trusted partners is certainly a form of innovation. - - - <h> USE SOCIAL MEDIA IN AN INNOVATIVE WAY <p> A third way to be innovative is to use technology that is already there , but spinning it to benefit your organization in an innovative way . Social media is a good example of this . Think of how you can use social media to reach your customers . Just be sure you have the right processes in place to moderate the interaction or it could backfire. - <p> There are countless other ways that organizations can innovate their brand and culture that I did n't even mention . In the end , it 's as much about how you innovate as what you innovate . Successful bits of innovation matter , because if you 're successful in brainstorming and implementing the innovation , then it will encourage others to speak up with their ideas about further ways to enhance your organization . Good ideas and plans take time , and usually that means taking it step by step . <p> How has your customer @qwx1081991 221981 @qwx1081981 221986 @qwx1081986

It should be customized to your position , utilizing key words or phrases from your position description . This will tell you whether they are really interested or just applying to apply . If it includes a summary section about his or her work experience , education , achievement , and skills , it could be helpful to you , because it paints a better picture of the candidate and how they view himself/herself . <h> CLEAR , CONCISE , AND CORRECT <p> Most jobs require excellent communication skills , which makes it very important that a candidate 's resume is clear , concise , and correct . Resumes that practice this should only be one or two pages long . This means no spelling or grammar errors , not too wordy , and clear sentence structure that gets to the point quickly . Someone that can communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detail and a dedication to doing things right the first time . <h> GREAT FORMATTING <p> Another essential piece to a resume is excellent formatting , because it makes the resume easy to read and skim . It should have clear and distinct sections and headlines that stand out , and short bullet points that have important keywords that relate to the open position . Above all else , make sure the resume format is consistent . <h> TOO MUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION <p> Some candidates will try to make their resume stand out by including extremely personal information , such as their interests , hobbies , or family details . While these things may play an important part in the candidate 's life , it is n't professional or relevant . A resume that keeps it professional and sticks to work experience is a good sign that the candidate has a high level of common sense . However , work related or college related activities are appropriate , especially if they demonstrate leadership or management abilities. - <h> LYING ON RESUMES <p> Believe it or not , lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookout for gaps in employment , false statements about their education or degree , or wrong employment dates . While you want to believe the best in people , little lies like this can happen frequently , so it 's best to double check everything . <p> Going through resumes may not be the most exciting part of your job , but it 's still an important task to find the right fit for your organization .

This can both simplify your business processes and give you the opportunity to save money and increase customer satisfaction . Here are a few scenarios where outsourcing your help desk might make sense for your organization . <p> Happy Customers : Whether your help desk is servicing your end consumer , your employees or some other individual the fact is that the person contacting you is your customer. - An unhappy customer base can have a significant and measurable impact on your business. - If this is an area you are struggling , help desk outsourcing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are available 24/7 for your customers . Professional help desks train support technicians to align with your company 's voice and function as an extension of your brand , helping to solve even the most difficult challenges . This not only increases first-call resolutions , but decreases the stress among your internal employees and helps them focus on tasks that are core to your businesses success . <p> Cost Savings : Another common challenge with the help desk is controlling costs while balancing the need for proper coverage. - When hiring a professional help desk , you eliminate extra costs that can be utilized elsewhere to profit your company . Salaries and employee training create costs that add up quickly and may often render the prospect of having an internal help desk impractical and uneconomical . When you add to this other benefits such as PTO , insurance and retirement plans it can become even more of a challenge . The cost of outsourcing is not only a way to ensure your costs are consistently mapped to demand , but can amount to only a portion of the costs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By using an outsourced provider all of that effort can be focused on other priorities that have a more direct impact on driving your business forward and growing revenue . <p> Knowledge Is Power : One of the largest challenges with running a help desk is to ensure you are keeping up with industry trends and best practices. - Between running the day to day operations and handling the other priorities that are commonly part of the role , sometimes just keeping the operation running is the only thing you can focus on. - Outsourcing provides you with professionals who are constantly trained on the latest advancements and best practices in in the field . Knowledge is power " in this case , the knowledge is being provided by the thought leadership that an outsourced provider can deliver. - This power provides you with the confidence to know your help desk is running at a high level. - Oftentimes , this knowledge can also be used in other portions of the operation that do not even fall within the scope of the outsourced provider because you are freed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across other functions . Professional help desks provide their employees with the latest training and technology to create happier customers , shorter wait times and overall efficiency . <p> Rapid Response : As a company , one of your goals should be to engage your customers in a timely fashion . This is one of the most common challenges I hear in the marketplace. - Outsourcing guarantees that a trained team will be ready to engage your customers and their needs whenever duty calls . For outsourced help desks , the customer in need is n't just their top priority , he 's their only priority . Without any other issues to get distracted by , the help desk can focus solely on the struggling customer and guarantee them an efficient and helpful experience every time . This helps to improve call wait times , decrease customer stress and improve customer satisfaction . <p> With years of experience and unlimited possibilities to outsource , Aureon is one of the best in the business .

One of the biggest areas where recruiting is changing is with social media . Millennials and Gen Z use social media constantly , as it seems like they are always connecting , posting , and sharing their life experiences online . <p> But it 's not just millennials and Gen Z using social media . These days , everyone has a social media profile , even your grandparents ! And although your grandparents are n't using social media to find a new job , this shows that social media is now a part of everyone 's life on a daily basis . <p> To reach this segment of social media job seekers , you need to be actively recruiting on social media by filling your pages with ads , videos , and more . In addition to recruiting ads , you also should be using social media to build your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together leads to an effective recruitment strategy that reaches the modern workforce . <h> POST ADS <p> The main way to reach candidates on social media is to post job advertisements . However , you have to do it the right way , so that you can reach and engage more people with your ads . Go beyond plain text posts by using an image . Research shows that social media posts that have a visual element to them are shared 40 times more than text posts . <p> Another factor to consider is the regularity of your posts . How often are you posting about your open positions ? While not every social media post should be a job ad , you should be consistently broadcasting what positions you 're hiring for . Promoting certain job ads is another way to reach a broader audience on social media , and can boost brand awareness , as well . <h> TRY VIDEOS <p> Organizations are relying on video recruiting more and more . Whether it 's video interviewing , posting videos about company culture , or utilizing video job descriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends , and appeals to millennials and Gen Z. <p> A- study by Ongig- shows that job-seekers spend more than triple the time watching video job ads ( three minutes ) than they do reading a text job ad ( 55 seconds ) . More research reveals that video job ads attract 40 percent more interest . This captures the candidate 's attention for a longer period , so they get a deeper understanding of your organization . <h> DO RESEARCH <p> Recruiting on social media not only allows you to reach more potential candidates , but it also let 's you look at candidates ' social media profiles . You can gain more information about the candidate by looking at their LinkedIn page , seeing their endorsements and connections , and reading additional details about their work history . This gives you a better picture of how they interact and present themselves online , and can separate out the top candidates. - - <p> However , doing research on candidates on social media can also be dangerous . One of the biggest potential risks with social media is the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees ' social media profiles . The risk lies in the fact that , by checking out their profile page , employers can learn information ( religion , race , or disability ) about the employee that could impact their perception or treatment of the person . Employees also often use social media as a forum to complain about pay , working conditions , and treatment by management , all of which are protected under federal law when two or more employees are involved ( or give the post a thumbs up " likes and emojis count ! ) . Additionally , several states have implemented laws which prohibit employers from making employment decisions based on certain off-duty conduct such as tobacco use , legally using alcohol or legal drugs , political activity , and being arrested . <p> So , while doing research and getting more information about your candidate is beneficial , be careful that you are n't violating any laws by doing this . <h> BUILD YOUR BRAND <p> Your brand is another way to engage candidates and attract top talent to your organization through social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages portray your values and show your organization 's culture . <p> According to- iCIMS " a leading applicant tracking system , 94 percent of job seekers said they would be more likely to apply for a job if the organization is on top of their brand online . <p> Post employee-centered photos from company events or volunteer activities . Show them smiling , having fun , and making a difference . <p> These kinds of posts build your brand and establish an identity that your organization can continue to use and grow . <p> Your recruitment ad messaging should also reflect what your organization cares about . Make sure that you 're presenting a consistent brand message through all mediums and in person when the candidate comes in for an interview . <h> PROMOTE YOUR CULTURE <p> To help structure your brand , social media presence , and employee engagement , create a culture that promotes and proves a sense of community , belonging , and acceptance . This will have a big impact on your employees , your overall brand , and your potential candidates . <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid to show pictures of them on Facebook . Have an employee-run culture committee ? Share photos of their activities on Instagram . <p> A strong culture centered around employees and making a difference shown on social media engages your current employees and encourages potential candidates , since they see that your organization is lively , active , and exciting . <h> A SOCIAL STRATEGY <p> With more millennials and Gen Zs entering the workforce every day , having a social media strategy to effectively recruit them to your organization shows that you understand them , you 're up on the latest trends , and you have the culture to make them successful for the long run . <p> Are you currently recruiting candidates on social media ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Katie Roth has been in a leadership role in the employment industry for the majority of her career .

With constant advancements in mobile technology and software , it seems this trend will only continue to increase . <p> As more organizations embrace the need for mobile technologies , the more employees are able to share and access sensitive data outside the corporate network . While mobility can lead to increased productivity and efficiency , there are also risks associated with it . <p> Even though organizations are often aware of this liability , they continue to struggle with solutions to minimize their risk . These statistics reflect the importance of having an effective strategy in place when it comes to managing mobile devices . Here are some ways you can start forming a solid strategy and limiting inappropriate usage of sensitive data . <h> MANAGE YOUR MOBILE DEVICES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile device management is to protect the data on employee devices . This reduces the risk of a mobile device being compromised , and better protects your data , should the device be lost or stolen . Most mobile device management systems allow you to manage the users ' devices , establish a user policy , and wipe or reset the device in certain cases . <p> Today , more and more organizations are adopting a Bring Your Own Device ( BYOD ) mentality , where the employee uses their own tablets , smartphones , and laptops . While this has cost-saving potential , it also comes with its own set of challenges . One big issue surrounding BYOD " and personal technology as a whole " has to do with privacy and security . Whether it 's through apps , training , or just well-worded policies , you need to ensure that your employees are n't sharing confidential information about your business or your customers . Likewise , you should have a plan in place that preserves employee privacy and does n't leave your company liable to charges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process around employee transitions that includes what happens to the employee 's mobile device when they leave your organization . Does the phone get wiped , and does the employee know what to do with it when they leave ? This goes hand-in-hand with mobile device management , and can benefit your organization in the long run ( especially if an issue does occur ) . <p> Another aspect to consider is mobile application management , which is similar to mobile device management . Mobile application management let 's you manage and control specific apps on mobile devices . For example : you could delete or deny access to their email account , or an app they use for work , but leave the rest of the phone untouched . This method keeps your organization 's data secure , and it also let 's your employees feel safe using their mobile devices . <h> CREATE A DATA POLICY <p> A data security policy should be used to define approved methods to securely transfer or share data and define restricted methods to help stop the use of unsupported or unsafe services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable and not acceptable for all employees . They should include information about email policies , mobile devices , social networking , and internet usage . These policies should be documented , communicated ( multiple times ) , enforced , and periodically reviewed and updated . <h> COMMUNICATE , COMMUNICATE , AND COMMUNICATE SOME MORE <p> Managing your mobile devices and implementing a data policy are important steps to take to protect your data , but they are useless without your employees being on board . It is absolutely essential to communicate your policies and preferred method of data sharing with all of your employees on a regular basis . Your employees are smart , but if they do n't know how to go about sharing and accessing data the right way on their mobile devices , then there 's a good chance they could be creating unnecessary risk to your organization without even knowing it . These directives should be driven from the top down , and upper level management needs to be fully invested and leading the way . Take the time and clearly express the correct way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data from being out in the open for anyone to steal . <p> As mobile devices in the workplace increase , it 's important to be proactive and intentional with strategies to face mobility challenges . <p> How is your organizations addressing the IT challenges of a mobile workforce ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Scott D.

@@121230507 @10230507/ 221979 @qwx1081979 <h> The Seven Keys To Strategic Planning - Part 1 <h> STRATEGIC PLANNING SERIES #3 <p> Want to be more profitable ? Be more strategic . A study by OnStrategy , a leader in on-demand strategic planning services , found that businesses that use strategic planning are 12 percent more profitable . All organizations , no matter the size or kind , need strategic planning at some level . Without it , the organization will lack focus and a goal , allowing the workforce to simply exist instead of moving forward in a unified direction . <p> Strategic planning is having a vision for what you want both to look like in the future , and having a plan to make it happen . To achieve an effective strategic plan that has a well thought-out vision and involves all employees , consider these seven key areas of inquiry . <h> 1 . PURPOSE <p> Why does your organization exist ? Why do you do what you do ? What is your value to the world ? <p> These questions attempt to get to the bottom of why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose helps answer all of the questions that follow , and it helps an organization reflect on why they matter and gives a chance to refocus . <p> I work with businesses all the time to help them figure out their purpose and overall strategic plan . One example of a purpose statement was from a senior living organization , which basically stated that their purpose was to enhance the quality of senior living every day . <h> 2 . VALUES <p> What standards do your organization live and work by ? What do you want to be known for ? What values do you need each employee to emulate ? <p> Whether an organization realizes it or not , there are standards and values that inform every decision . Determining the most important values and communicating them to all employees is essential for the success of a strategic plan , because it creates a similar benchmark for everyone to follow . If they are n't communicated , then the standards are useless . <p> When I 'm helping organizations through this , I ask them what they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . What do you like about them ? After that , think about organizations you do n't like , and why you do n't like them . This will get you on the right track to think about your organization 's values . <h> 3 . VISION <p> What is your one- , three- , and five-year vision for your organization ? What does it look like today compared to what you want it to become ? <p> The strategy here is to have a clear and well thought-out plan for what you should be striving for as an organization . If you have a vision of how you want to grow and succeed , you can more easily tap into that as you make the tough decisions . <p> For that same senior living organization that I helped determine their purpose , we worked out clear values and a clear vision . Their vision was based around their products and services , and their resident , employee , and family experience .

In fact , finding the best hire is like matchmaking and finding a mate . You would n't decide to marry someone based only on information they could fit on a page , right ? You should like each other , have mutual respect , trust each other , have a compatible work ethic , and be committed to the same cause . Since finding the right candidate is like matchmaking , then a resume is like a first date . The candidate is putting their best foot forward , often regardless of the truth. - <p> To figure out if you and your candidate are a good match , you must spend time with them . Hiring people is one of the riskiest decisions in business , but we spend the least amount of time on it . Take the time to get to know your candidate , to ensure that you are making the right decision . To do this , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the candidate thinks and operates . <h> WHY YOU SHOULD GET IT RIGHT <p> Before we go into how to effectively evaluate candidates , it helps to understand why it 's essential to choose the right person and why it 's worth putting in a little extra time . <p> First off , it 's costly to hire the wrong person . If the employee leaves or is let go after a month or two , it costs businesses with less than 500 employees $11,000 . For business with more than 1,000 employees , a bad hire costs $24,000 . If this happens frequently , it can begin to affect your organization 's bottom line very quickly . <p> Bad hires impact other areas besides cost . Our research found that bad hires can leave a negative mark on the business and their team . The top three non-financial costs of bad hires are : <p> Loss in productivity . <p> Compromised quality of work . <p> Negative morale . <p> In addition to these factors , bad hires also cost human resources staff and managers time , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a replacement . <p> There are many strategies to avoid bad hires and ensure a candidate is a good fit , but first and foremost , use common sense and follow your instinct . Here are several red flags to look for from the start : <p> Does not produce the proper level of work . <p> Has attendance issues . <p> Co-workers file complaints . <p> Does n't work well with others . <p> A lot of times the initial feeling you get about a certain candidate is accurate . Work on developing specific questions that will reveal these red flags , so that you do n't find out these issues once you 've hired the person . In addition to instinct , there are other ways to identify the right candidate , such as specific interview questions , pre-hire assessments , and candidate evaluations . <h> INTERVIEW SUCCESSFULLY <p> One way to hire the right person the first time is to interview your candidates successfully . This starts by establishing a consistent set of questions that you ask each candidate . If you do n't ask all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oranges problem . You wo n't be able to compare their answers and how they respond to the same question or situation . Instead , you should have one list of questions that you ask each candidate . It may seem tedious during the interview process , but it will pay off when it comes time to evaluate your top candidates . <p> What should these set of questions include ? To determine that , we need to use the behavioral interview method as our guide . <p> The purpose of the behavioral interview is to identify how an applicant behaved and handled a real-life situation , based on their experience . The applicant should be able to identify and explain the actions they took to find a resolution to the situation . This method increases your chances of hiring employees that will be a good fit for your organization , because it goes deeper than the usual surface level interview questions and gets to the root of the candidate 's behavior to determine how the candidate would act in future situations . Remember , past performance is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some common behavioral questions : <p> Describe a major challenge issue you have faced and how you solved it . <p> Give an example of when you had to deal with a team member that was n't carrying his or her weight . <p> How did you feel ? <p> What did you do ? <p> What were you thinking ? <p> What was the result ? <p> When is it okay to miss work ? How many unscheduled absences did you have in the last six months ? - <p> Describe a time you had to go above and beyond. - <p> Implementing these types of behavioral questions in your candidate interviews helps predict future behavior , but it also can show if a candidate is prepared or not . If it seems like their answer is n't comprehensive or seems far-fetched , then chances are they were n't expecting these questions . Look for honest , specific answers that have a clear beginning , middle , and end . <p> In the end , having a consistent set of questions that include several behavioral questions can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since you know how they react to difficult situations . <h> USE PRE-HIRE ASSESSMENT TOOLS <p> Another way to identify the right candidate is through pre-hire assessments . Pre-hire assessments are 35 percent accurate , and can help make your decision easier and help you feel more confident in your decision , since you have data to back it up . <p> Pre-hire assessments should n't be the only form of evaluation for hiring someone , but it can be very effective when used in conjunction with interviewing , once you 've narrowed down the candidates . <p> There are four types of pre-hire assessments that are beneficial : cognitive ability , personality , integrity , and job knowledge . Let 's break them down one by one . <p> Cognitive Ability Assessments : Cognitive ability tests use questions or problems to measure the candidate 's ability to learn quickly and use logic , reasoning , reading comprehension , and other enduring mental abilities that are fundamental to success in many different jobs. - Cognitive ability tests assess a candidate 's aptitude or potential to solve job-related problems by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mathematical reasoning , and perceptual abilities , like speed in recognizing letters of the alphabet. - - - <p> Personality Assessments : Some commonly measured personality traits in work settings are extraversion , conscientiousness , openness to new experiences , optimism , agreeableness , service orientation , stress tolerance , emotional stability , and initiative or proactivity. - Personality tests typically measure traits related to behavior at work , interpersonal interactions , and satisfaction with different aspects of work . These kinds of assessments are often used to determine whether candidates have the potential to be successful in jobs where performance requires a great deal of interpersonal interaction or working in team settings. - - - <p> Integrity Assessments : Integrity tests assess attitudes and experiences related to a candidate 's honesty , dependability , trustworthiness , reliability , and pro-social behavior . These tests typically ask direct questions about previous experiences related to ethics and integrity OR ask questions about preferences and interests , from which conclusions are drawn about future behavior in these areas . Integrity tests are used to identify individuals who are likely to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> In addition to these four pre-hire assessments , there is also a DiSC assessment , which can be beneficial to more accurately gauge a candidate 's behavior . This test focuses on four different behavioral traits : dominance , influence , steadiness , and conscientiousness . By asking how you respond to specific challenges and rules , and preferred work pace , it determines what personality type you are . You should n't make hire or fire decisions based on a DiSC , however , it can help you evaluate for compatible attributes and find the right fit . It also allows you to get to know the candidate at a deeper level . <p> These different kinds of assessments help you determine which candidate possesses the right skills and behavior that fit the job and your company 's culture . Using these tools can reduce the risk of making a bad hire , and demonstrate how the candidate thinks , which wo n't change when you hire them . Assessments are also a good management tool for after the hire , and can help you identify how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVALUATIONS <p> In addition to successfull interviewing and pre-hire assessments , you also need to complete the traditional candidate evaluations , such as : <p> Criminal background check . <p> Reference checks . <p> Social security verification . <p> When it comes to reference checks , think outside the box . Use social media , especially LinkedIn , to see who they know and reach out to their important connections to get an extra opinion of the candidate . When you visit their LinkedIn profile , view their endorsements and see who has endorsed them . This gives you a peek into their influence and effectiveness in their past positions . <p> You may have a candidate picked out , but if they do n't pass these evaluations , it can be back to the drawing board . Ensure that every candidate goes through these processes , to avoid finding out a few months into the job that the employee has past criminal charges or is unfit to do the job . <p> Another type of evaluation is a job shadow . If you have the luxury of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hours with a potential co-worker . This allows the candidate to get a feel for the position and , many times , the candidates will self-select out . This also allows your staff to evaluate the candidate , and analyze if they would be a good fit for the position and the team . <h> THERE 'S A LOT TO IT <p> There 's no question that a good resume is essential to the hiring process , but you need to know that there 's more to it than just words on a page . Successful interview questions , pre-hire assessments , and standard evaluations can reduce the risk of hiring the wrong person , and give you peace of mind that the person you choose for the job can do the work efficiently and effectively . <p> Hiring people is time-consuming , difficult , and frustrating , but hiring the right person for the job is priceless . <p> How does your organization vet and evaluate candidates ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Andy Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find great people for great organizations .

Even though a lot of people dread their review , I actually enjoy it , as it always makes me think about my professional career , and the goals and objectives that I have set for myself . <p> Professionally , I am always striving to better myself and focus on how I can improve as a co-worker and leader . I set goals for myself every year , because there is always room for improvement . <p> Do you have personal goals for yourself ? Is it to lose a certain number of pounds ? Or is to learn how to code ? <p> Professional ( and personal ) development is important for every person , no matter what profession or business you 're in currently . If you do n't have any currently , consider taking some time out of your work day to reflect on what your goals could be . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and setting goals also applies to the help desk world . Setting goals and striving for better results is a great way to enhance the overall help desk experience . It also helps boost the culture and provides a visible benchmark for the metrics and results you want to reach as a team . I 've come up with three goals that your help desk could adopt and work on , but these do n't have to be your only focus . As you read through them , be thinking of other ways that your help desk could continue to improve and stay outcome-focused . <h> Goal #1 : Strive for first-call resolution . <p> The Ascent Group reported that 44 percent of companies that recorded first-call resolution results for a year or longer had considerable improvement in their performance rates . If your help desk struggles with first-call resolutions , then a good goal would be to work towards raising your first-call resolution percentage by 10 percent by the end of the next quarter and recording the results . Setting a benchmark and encouraging your agents to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to start . Another way to help increase first-call resolution is to have higher level agents available immediately , rather than creating a ticker for a follow-up . <h> Goal #2 : Work on reducing response times . <p> Another area to improve upon could be cutting down the response time for calls , emails , or social media ( whatever medium your help desk currently uses ) . A few practical ways to do this is to assign the help ticket ( this could be an automated response ) and then provide an estimated resolution time for the case number or ticket , or know your help desk 's typical call volume , arrival patterns , and length , in order to optimize staffing plans . When there 's a higher call volume than normal , and there 's not enough staff to get to all the calls , consider implementing a hold message that gives the caller an estimated wait time . If customers know what to expect and how long until their call is answered , they will be more understanding of high call volume wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've noticed that surveys are underrated in the help desk environment . Surveys are a great way to get an accurate picture of how your customers/callers view your help desk and it shows you what you are doing right or wrong . When you 're looking for more ways to improve your help desk , send out a survey and ask the people on the other end of the line for feedback . <p> Some questions to ask are : <p> Did the help desk resolve your problem ? <p> Was the help desk prompt and professional in responding to your problem ? <p> Were you happy with the help desk service you received ? <p> You can always get more detailed and specific than that , but these questions are good starting points to see where your help desk is currently , and areas to improve upon . <p> In the end , setting goals for yourself or for your help desk originates from a drive to be the best . I focus my goals on areas I 'm passionate about , so I can get better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals you set and whatever your passion is , go all out and work on improving yourself . As for your help desk , look for the areas that your agents or your service is struggling with , and work on finding a solution by setting attainable goals . <p> What are your personal and professional goals ?

Try Anytime The IT Support Team Needs You <p> As much as I would like my life to revolve around a set schedule , where I go to work from eight to five , come home , hang out with my family for a while , go to bed , and then do it all over again , that is just not the reality for me and most professionals in today 's world . It is much more common that I go into a day with the best plans for productivity and things turn out any number of ways differently than anticipated . We all know that to help lead a successful organization we have to be flexible and move at the speed of our marketplace . <p> This makes me think of the business we are in and how critical matching corporate IT support hours to the working hours of your team can be . Think of an example where one of your crew members is in an airport , their plane is delayed , and it 's 11:30 p.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to use this delay to prepare . However , when they try to access information on their PC , they ca n't get to it because of an authentication issue . Can they reach anyone in tech support ? <h> UN-SET THE SCHEDULE <p> Today 's workplace is becoming more flexible , which means that there are more employees who set their own hours or work beyond the typical eight to five shift . In fact , a FlexJobs survey found that out of 1,500 workers , 74 percent of them wanted/needed flexible work options in order to maintain a healthy work-life balance . The help desk has to realize this and ensure that they create a way for their services to be available at all hours of the day when customers are working and consuming resources . Easy enough , right ? Not so much. - <h> WHAT THIS MEANS <p> Expanding the hours of operation for the help desk to meet these changing needs can cause challenges . It can create stress for current agents , as they are asked to change their schedule . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some , because there can be a lot of variability in terms of the volume on any given day .

This can help your organization maintain control of the overall experience and strategy , but transfers the operational responsibility to experts experienced with working in an environment that demands flexibility all the time . The most important aspect here is being available for your customers . <p> Having a help desk with extended hours and potentially 24/7 support , enhances the customer 's experience by accommodating their needs and schedule . In the end , that 's what the help desk is all about : helping customers get their issues resolved , when they need it , with quality service . <p> Personally , when that late night airport need comes to pass , I want my organization to be there for support .

@@121230519 @10230519/ 221979 @qwx1081979 <h> The Network Security Blind Spot : Mobile Devices <p> How often do you use mobile devices ( such as phones and tablets ) for work purposes like checking and responding to emails , forwarding attachments , or even accessing corporate data ? <p> If you 're like me , your answer is probably quite often ! With constant advancements in mobile technology and software , it seems this trend will only continue to increase . <p> As more organizations embrace the need for mobile technologies , the more employees are able to share and access sensitive data outside the corporate network . While mobility can lead to increased productivity and efficiency , there are also risks associated with it . <p> Even though organizations are often aware of this liability , they continue to struggle with solutions to minimize their risk . These statistics reflect the importance of having an effective strategy in place when it comes to managing mobile devices . Here are some ways you can start forming a solid strategy and limiting inappropriate usage of sensitive data . <h> MANAGE YOUR MOBILE DEVICES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile device management is to protect the data on employee devices . This reduces the risk of a mobile device being compromised , and better protects your data , should the device be lost or stolen . Most mobile device management systems allow you to manage the users ' devices , establish a user policy , and wipe or reset the device in certain cases . <p> Today , more and more organizations are adopting a Bring Your Own Device ( BYOD ) mentality , where the employee uses their own tablets , smartphones , and laptops . While this has cost-saving potential , it also comes with its own set of challenges . One big issue surrounding BYOD " and personal technology as a whole " has to do with privacy and security . Whether it 's through apps , training , or just well-worded policies , you need to ensure that your employees are n't sharing confidential information about your business or your customers . Likewise , you should have a plan in place that preserves employee privacy and does n't leave your company liable to charges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process around employee transitions that includes what happens to the employee 's mobile device when they leave your organization . Does the phone get wiped , and does the employee know what to do with it when they leave ? This goes hand-in-hand with mobile device management , and can benefit your organization in the long run ( especially if an issue does occur ) . <p> Another aspect to consider is mobile application management , which is similar to mobile device management . Mobile application management let 's you manage and control specific apps on mobile devices . For example : you could delete or deny access to their email account , or an app they use for work , but leave the rest of the phone untouched . This method keeps your organization 's data secure , and it also let 's your employees feel safe using their mobile devices . <h> CREATE A DATA POLICY <p> A data security policy should be used to define approved methods to securely transfer or share data and define restricted methods to help stop the use of unsupported or unsafe services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable and not acceptable for all employees . They should include information about email policies , mobile devices , social networking , and internet usage . These policies should be documented , communicated ( multiple times ) , enforced , and periodically reviewed and updated . <h> COMMUNICATE , COMMUNICATE , AND COMMUNICATE SOME MORE <p> Managing your mobile devices and implementing a data policy are important steps to take to protect your data , but they are useless without your employees being on board . It is absolutely essential to communicate your policies and preferred method of data sharing with all of your employees on a regular basis . Your employees are smart , but if they do n't know how to go about sharing and accessing data the right way on their mobile devices , then there 's a good chance they could be creating unnecessary risk to your organization without even knowing it . These directives should be driven from the top down , and upper level management needs to be fully invested and leading the way .

Some organization was found liable for not complying with a regulation , and now they have to pay thousands of dollars in fines . <p> While something like that may seem like it wo n't or ca n't ever happen to you , statistics tell a different story . According to research from the 2017 NSBA Small Business Regulations Survey one in 10 small businesses will be fined for regulatory noncompliance at some point . So , even though it may seem highly unlikely that you 'll ever be issued a citation , it 's actually quite possible . <h> MORE STATISTICS ON REGULATORY FINES <p> The ten percent of businesses that were fined definitely felt the consequences of liability . The NSBA reported : <p> 72 percent of those that were fined were only fined once in the past five years , and 23 percent were fined two to five times . <p> Only five percent were fined more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses that had been fined , 57 percent of them said the citations were for the same rule . <p> It 's interesting that the out of the one in 10 businesses that were fined , over half of them said the citations were for the same rule , meaning that they had been fined once , implemented no changes , and then were punished a second time . - <p> If you 're not already concerned about staying compliant , the average cost of each citation was $30,651.14 . That 's a significant amount of money to have to pay for noncompliance . And if you were fined that more than once , your organization could be in financial trouble in a hurry . <h> HOW TO AVOID THE FINES <p> It 's most likely that these small businesses were n't trying to rebel against regulations , and they definitely did n't want to be fined .

The Cloud : How To Choose The Right Solution <p> As organizations continue to find new ways to stay connected , the trend to move to cloud services continues to rise . IDG Enterprise reported that 48 percent of enterprises are moving to the cloud to replace on-premise , legacy technology , and 25 percent of total IT budgets were allocated to cloud computing in 2016 . The following Microsoft Business Blog provides quality advice and information about the various cloud platforms an organization can consider to meet the future demands of their business . <p> Not every business has moved its IT operations to the- cloud , nor should we expect that to be the case . There are legitimate reasons to adhere to the on-premises IT approach , not the least of which is the fact that it assures that your IT infrastructure and all the data in it is under your control . <p> Nonetheless , no IT leader today can reject the cloud out of hand . The benefits of increased functionality , flexibility , low cost , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , there are degrees of commitment to the cloud , and there are multiple cloud models to consider . You should familiarize yourself with all the options before making any decision . <p> The pressure to make a decision will be steady , as IT leaders are continually challenged to find answers to very reasonable questions , such as : <p> Does such an approach favorably position the enterprise to rapidly exploit emerging tools , techniques , and technologies that might be more effective in driving innovation ? <p> How can we retain control of our proprietary/strategic IT assets and still find ways to make our IT investments more productive year over year ? <h> FINDING THE BEST APPROACH <p> A continuously improving IT asset management strategy is important to the success of the business . For that reason , you should constantly ask yourself whether your on-premise approach is truly optimal . <p> A candid assessment of that approach should unearth some inherent less-than-optimal aspects of it , including : <p> Investing in technical capacity is risky : Needed computational capacity must be estimated well in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra computational capacity goes unused , or worse , is n't available when it 's needed . <p> Effectively investing in computational capacity also requires a deep understanding of projected needs , technology trends , and technical life cycles . <p> Keeping skills current in keeping with career path growth is a difficult-to-predict expense and a never-ending management challenge . <p> Additionally , it can be very difficult for small to medium-sized businesses to be able to afford top technical talent , especially if there 's only room in the budget for one staff member . Finding someone that is an expert in every area of technology is next to impossible , even though that 's what most organizations want . <p> Needed uptake of new technologies is inconsistent : The process of awareness , trial , adaption , and adoption of new technologies is unstructured , reactive , and slow . <p> IT research is usually not part of IT management expense . <p> For competitive purposes , business units , not the IT function , normally direct technological change . <p> Introducing business change is not encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Updating existing systems to make them more responsive to business needs is considered a cost instead of an opportunity business case . <p> The pace of making improvements in business unit processes is limited by aging applications that are expensive to change . <p> It is worth repeating that moving to the cloud is not an all-or-nothing proposition . A cloud approach to IT management is compatible with either retaining some on-premise IT or eliminating it entirely . Finding the right fit is a matter of assessing what will bring you the most business benefits . But a deeper understanding of cloud options is where the matchmaking process is best begun . <h> THE PUBLIC CLOUD <p> The- public cloud- is a typical starting point for many businesses ' journey to the cloud IT management option . It 's easily available to even the smallest businesses , from some of the best-known vendors . Take Microsoft Office 365 , for example . The cost benefits are clear . With the traditional , on-premises deployment of the Microsoft Office suite , every employee who will use the software must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But if the business scales back its head count , it retains those licenses that were already paid for . With the public-cloud Office 365 approach , you pay month-to-month for only the licenses you need at the time . And for most companies , that would be recorded as an operational expense , not a capital expense . <p> Naturally , this approach is good for cash flow . Instead of making a major purchase and depreciating it over three years , the cost is spread out . <p> The public cloud has a downside , of course , most notably that most of the available applications are not very customizable . If you have enhanced security or compliance requirements , for example , or the desire for more control or customization in your environment , you may want to step up to the private cloud . <h> THE PRIVATE CLOUD <p> Because a- private cloud- is dedicated solely to your company , run either by your own staff or a third party , you have more freedom for customization and can shape it to suit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually not the case in the public cloud . <p> A private cloud is also a much more protected environment . In many cases , you do n't have any administrative-level access to the environment ; you only have the ability to configure the applications that you use . Companies that need to comply with Dodd-Frank or HIPAA , for example , where very clear controls and security measures are required , often find the private cloud a much better option . <p> On the downside , it 's a more expensive option than the public cloud . <h> IaaS VIA THE CLOUD <p> Companies that do n't want to build and maintain a data center can turn to **27;141;TOOLONG ( IaaS ) offerings . Building a data center can be a very large capital expense , especially for a data center that can withstand severe weather and has several redundancies for electrical power and computational capacity . Once it 's built , the data center has to be physically secured , and it requires 24/7 staffing . <p> Besides all that , you have to figure out how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power necessary to operate your business . You also need storage for maintaining your important data and documents . <p> IaaS offerings remove the need to anticipate your needs ; expansion ( or contraction ) is easily accomplished , with no costs incurred until the additional capacity is needed . And IaaS also allows for varying degrees of control . An organization may want its IaaS provider to replace its server room but let the organization 's own staff administer the replacement site . Others might cede administration duties to the provider , allowing them to reduce their head count or redeploy those IT workers to areas where they are more needed . <p> Some businesses can benefit by using multiple cloud approaches . You may have a highly proprietary business application that is better kept on-premises , but you also use Office 365 in the public cloud and maintain your accounting system in the private cloud . <p> Your IT management team or technology adviser can help evaluate the technology you are using , build a business case for each of your cloud and on-premise applications , and determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily based on security and controls , as well as on the extent of your IT team 's skills and abilities . If you have a small IT team , you may not be able to manage a data center or your accounting system in a private cloud environment . However , an IT adviser can guide you in implementing these enhanced capabilities . <p> Although hybrid environments can be complex , your users need n't be overwhelmed by that , since all the complexity is behind the scenes . With single sign-on , a hybrid environment can feel to them like a single server maintained and dedicated for their needs at your site . <h> LISTEN TO THE BUSINESS DRIVERS <p> Several business drivers steer organizations to the cloud , but three have emerged as the most important for organizations of all sizes and in all industries : <p> A preference for operating expenditures over capital expenditures : As mentioned earlier , transitioning to an operating expenditure model provides more cash on hand and more financial flexibility for the business . <p> Compliance concerns : A business that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audits , and headaches . All those woes can be alleviated by working with a private cloud provider with demonstrated , current security and controls . <p> IT staffing and competencies : The technology competencies required to run a secure , reliable IT environment have become so varied and complex that no individual can do it all . Talent has become increasingly expensive and very difficult to find and keep . <p> Technology advances quickly , and the capabilities of the cloud are no different . With the depth of solutions currently available and the inherent flexibility of varied and combinable cloud solutions ( through virtualization ) , there is very likely a cloud platform arrangement that will help meet the needs of your business . Task your IT management team or secure a technology adviser- to help you develop a comprehensive cloud solution to align with your business goals and existing capabilities at a predictable and more optimal monthly operational ( not capital ) expense . <p> Is it time for you to make the switch to the cloud ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.

@@121230557 @10230557/ 221979 @qwx1081979 <h> On-Premise Vs . The Cloud : How To Choose The Right Solution <p> As organizations continue to find new ways to stay connected , the trend to move to cloud services continues to rise . IDG Enterprise reported that 48 percent of enterprises are moving to the cloud to replace on-premise , legacy technology , and 25 percent of total IT budgets were allocated to cloud computing in 2016 . The following Microsoft Business Blog provides quality advice and information about the various cloud platforms an organization can consider to meet the future demands of their business . <p> Not every business has moved its IT operations to the- cloud , nor should we expect that to be the case . There are legitimate reasons to adhere to the on-premises IT approach , not the least of which is the fact that it assures that your IT infrastructure and all the data in it is under your control . <p> Nonetheless , no IT leader today can reject the cloud out of hand . The benefits of increased functionality , flexibility , low cost , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , there are degrees of commitment to the cloud , and there are multiple cloud models to consider . You should familiarize yourself with all the options before making any decision . <p> The pressure to make a decision will be steady , as IT leaders are continually challenged to find answers to very reasonable questions , such as : <p> Does such an approach favorably position the enterprise to rapidly exploit emerging tools , techniques , and technologies that might be more effective in driving innovation ? <p> How can we retain control of our proprietary/strategic IT assets and still find ways to make our IT investments more productive year over year ? <h> FINDING THE BEST APPROACH <p> A continuously improving IT asset management strategy is important to the success of the business . For that reason , you should constantly ask yourself whether your on-premise approach is truly optimal . <p> A candid assessment of that approach should unearth some inherent less-than-optimal aspects of it , including : <p> Investing in technical capacity is risky : Needed computational capacity must be estimated well in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra computational capacity goes unused , or worse , is n't available when it 's needed . <p> Effectively investing in computational capacity also requires a deep understanding of projected needs , technology trends , and technical life cycles . <p> Keeping skills current in keeping with career path growth is a difficult-to-predict expense and a never-ending management challenge . <p> Additionally , it can be very difficult for small to medium-sized businesses to be able to afford top technical talent , especially if there 's only room in the budget for one staff member . Finding someone that is an expert in every area of technology is next to impossible , even though that 's what most organizations want . <p> Needed uptake of new technologies is inconsistent : The process of awareness , trial , adaption , and adoption of new technologies is unstructured , reactive , and slow . <p> IT research is usually not part of IT management expense . <p> For competitive purposes , business units , not the IT function , normally direct technological change . <p> Introducing business change is not encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Updating existing systems to make them more responsive to business needs is considered a cost instead of an opportunity business case . <p> The pace of making improvements in business unit processes is limited by aging applications that are expensive to change . <p> It is worth repeating that moving to the cloud is not an all-or-nothing proposition . A cloud approach to IT management is compatible with either retaining some on-premise IT or eliminating it entirely . Finding the right fit is a matter of assessing what will bring you the most business benefits . But a deeper understanding of cloud options is where the matchmaking process is best begun . <h> THE PUBLIC CLOUD <p> The- public cloud- is a typical starting point for many businesses ' journey to the cloud IT management option . It 's easily available to even the smallest businesses , from some of the best-known vendors . Take Microsoft Office 365 , for example . The cost benefits are clear . With the traditional , on-premises deployment of the Microsoft Office suite , every employee who will use the software must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But if the business scales back its head count , it retains those licenses that were already paid for . With the public-cloud Office 365 approach , you pay month-to-month for only the licenses you need at the time . And for most companies , that would be recorded as an operational expense , not a capital expense . <p> Naturally , this approach is good for cash flow . Instead of making a major purchase and depreciating it over three years , the cost is spread out . <p> The public cloud has a downside , of course , most notably that most of the available applications are not very customizable . If you have enhanced security or compliance requirements , for example , or the desire for more control or customization in your environment , you may want to step up to the private cloud . <h> THE PRIVATE CLOUD <p> Because a- private cloud- is dedicated solely to your company , run either by your own staff or a third party , you have more freedom for customization and can shape it to suit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually not the case in the public cloud . <p> A private cloud is also a much more protected environment . In many cases , you do n't have any administrative-level access to the environment ; you only have the ability to configure the applications that you use . Companies that need to comply with Dodd-Frank or HIPAA , for example , where very clear controls and security measures are required , often find the private cloud a much better option . <p> On the downside , it 's a more expensive option than the public cloud . <h> IaaS VIA THE CLOUD <p> Companies that do n't want to build and maintain a data center can turn to **27;170;TOOLONG ( IaaS ) offerings . Building a data center can be a very large capital expense , especially for a data center that can withstand severe weather and has several redundancies for electrical power and computational capacity . Once it 's built , the data center has to be physically secured , and it requires 24/7 staffing . <p> Besides all that , you have to figure out how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power necessary to operate your business . You also need storage for maintaining your important data and documents . <p> IaaS offerings remove the need to anticipate your needs ; expansion ( or contraction ) is easily accomplished , with no costs incurred until the additional capacity is needed . And IaaS also allows for varying degrees of control . An organization may want its IaaS provider to replace its server room but let the organization 's own staff administer the replacement site . Others might cede administration duties to the provider , allowing them to reduce their head count or redeploy those IT workers to areas where they are more needed . <p> Some businesses can benefit by using multiple cloud approaches . You may have a highly proprietary business application that is better kept on-premises , but you also use Office 365 in the public cloud and maintain your accounting system in the private cloud . <p> Your IT management team or technology adviser can help evaluate the technology you are using , build a business case for each of your cloud and on-premise applications , and determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily based on security and controls , as well as on the extent of your IT team 's skills and abilities . If you have a small IT team , you may not be able to manage a data center or your accounting system in a private cloud environment . However , an IT adviser can guide you in implementing these enhanced capabilities . <p> Although hybrid environments can be complex , your users need n't be overwhelmed by that , since all the complexity is behind the scenes . With single sign-on , a hybrid environment can feel to them like a single server maintained and dedicated for their needs at your site . <h> LISTEN TO THE BUSINESS DRIVERS <p> Several business drivers steer organizations to the cloud , but three have emerged as the most important for organizations of all sizes and in all industries : <p> A preference for operating expenditures over capital expenditures : As mentioned earlier , transitioning to an operating expenditure model provides more cash on hand and more financial flexibility for the business . <p> Compliance concerns : A business that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audits , and headaches . All those woes can be alleviated by working with a private cloud provider with demonstrated , current security and controls . <p> IT staffing and competencies : The technology competencies required to run a secure , reliable IT environment have become so varied and complex that no individual can do it all . Talent has become increasingly expensive and very difficult to find and keep . <p> Technology advances quickly , and the capabilities of the cloud are no different . With the depth of solutions currently available and the inherent flexibility of varied and combinable cloud solutions ( through virtualization ) , there is very likely a cloud platform arrangement that will help meet the needs of your business . Task your IT management team or secure a technology adviser- to help you develop a comprehensive cloud solution to align with your business goals and existing capabilities at a predictable and more optimal monthly operational ( not capital ) expense . <p> Is it time for you to make the switch to the cloud ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.

It seems like there 's always something new to think about , plan , and implement . One thing that may seem like a constant worry is cybersecurity , and related planning to keep your business secure . <p> But it 's also important to be knowledgeable about the different layers of cybersecurity , and how they can further protect your organization from unsolicited attacks and hackers. - <h> TECHNOLOGY LAYER <p> Your organization is dependent on your data . Making sure your data is protected with the right hardware and software tools is essential . <p> In order to help keep it safe and secure from data breaches and attacks , consider these two options : <p> Implement essential technology services . Services such as anti-virus , firewall protection , network monitoring , and wireless security are all extra layers of defense that help give you state-of-the-art protection . Having a network that is protected behind a firewall and an elaborate network system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being hacked and being safe . <p> Encrypt your data . To ensure maximum protection , it 's a good practice to encrypt your data while in transit and at rest . Encryption renders information unreadable when accessed without proper authorization . Having a process in place that ensures sensitive devices are encrypted and that files and emails are being properly sent is imperative. - <h> PERSONAL LAYER <p> Being a victim of identity theft affects more than just your credit . It takes all of your information , which can be used at will . This is why data breaches to companies are so harmful , and the company may be liable if this happens . <p> If a company suffers from a data breach and personal information is stolen , it can be a long and stressful process to recover this data . - <p> To help with the restoration process , there are identity theft protection services , which can help you monitor your information , accounts , and data for any suspicious activity . These services can also help you recover from a breach . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can help you prepare for one and get you back on your feet . <p> One good example of this is IDShield , which offers a monthly fee to protect your information . <p> Security Policies and Corporate Communications <p> Even though an organization might have the most advanced technology , untrained employees can leave an organization vulnerable to malicious attacks . Using social engineering tactics , cybercriminals rely on human interaction to trick people into breaking normal security procedures. - <p> Examples of- social engineering- attacks include emails that look normal but actually contain hidden links with viruses , pretexting phone calls where the cyber criminal acts like a trusted source and then engages the employee to divulge sensitive information , and searching unlocked trash and recycling bins to discover valuable information that could be used in a future attack . <p> In order to avoid a social engineering incident , organizations must educate their employees , and the three areas below are a good place to start : <p> Have a data security policy ( and communicate it ) . A data security policy should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and define restricted methods to help stop the use of unsupported or unsafe services and applications . They should include information about email policies , mobile devices , social networking , and internet usage . These policies should be documented , communicated ( multiple times ) , enforced , and periodically reviewed and updated . <p> Understand user agreements . All data hosting services have user agreements that outline their terms and conditions . While these may be arduous to read , it 's important to understand the fine print . You need to be careful you are not consenting to allow the provider to directly access your business data and customer information . <p> Conduct security awareness trainings . Creating a culture around data security can help prevent a lot breaches . One way to start is to make security awareness training a mandatory event for employees . This training should not only show employees the different kinds of cyber and social engineering attacks , but also show them how to thwart the attacks . Give concrete examples of actual threats , and possibly set up a test/false attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcomes . Once employees know how to stop these strikes before they even happen , the risk of a cyberattack decreases , and will validate the criticality of your organization 's data . - <h> INSURANCE LAYER <p> Another layer of protection is cybersecurity insurance . This is designed to help you mitigate losses when a cyberattack occurs , and provides protection from the costs associated with : <p> Data theft <p> Extortion <p> Hacking <p> Denial of service attacks <p> Crisis management <p> Legal claims <p> Cybersecurity insurance does n't replace your security best practices . However , it can help provide more peace of mind to an organization . While it may not be possible to be fully prepared for a breach , you can take certain steps to alleviate some of the risk involved . - <p> Does your organization have a strategy around cybersecurity ? <p> Join us in Kansas City on March 2 for a cybersecurity seminar on keeping your organization secure in an unsecured world . <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Account Executive role for Aureon Technology , it 's his understanding that he 's really in a people business , not a technology business .

Because by 2020 , millennials will be half of the global workforce . However , attracting and retaining millennials to your organization requires a better understanding of their motivations and drivers . - <h> WHAT DO THEY LOOK FOR IN A JOB ? <p> First , you need to understand what they want from a career , and then offer opportunities for them to accomplish their goals . It 's evident that many employers have not yet figured this out , as millennial turnover is costing the U.S. economy $30.5 billion a year . <p> Without looking at the list below , most people would assume that money is the top driving factor when it comes to finding a job . Surprisingly , it 's been passed by another need , showing that millennials are n't what you might expect . Here are the top five things millennials look for in a job : <p> Opportunities for career advancement . According to Workplace Trends , - 91 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Offering ways for employees to climb the career ladder and explore different positions and paths can help retain them and keep them engaged . <p> Money . Even though it 's not the number one factor in looking for a job , salary is still very important . Offering competitive pay can be the difference between working for your senior living organization or another . <p> Training and development . Millennials want to constantly improve and develop their skills , and that happens through additional training , feedback , and manager involvement . <p> Benefits . With a country-wide emphasis on health care accessibility going on right now , millennials want security with their benefits . To attract millennials with benefits , offer quality health care coverage with good benefits , such as paid time off , 401(k) , and maternity leave . <p> In addition to the five areas above , another aspect to consider is your senior living organization 's technology . Studies have shown that 59 percent of millennials also base their job decision on the employer 's technology , and if it is state-of-the-art or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications and electronic processes , are just two examples of ways you can attract millennials and show that you have the technology they are looking for . Other areas include Wi-Fi that covers the whole campus and the use of mobile devices , such as tablets and laptops . <h> WHAT MAKES THEM STAY AT THEIR JOB ? <p> Attracting millennials to the senior living industry is one thing , but how do you keep them engaged and ensure they 'll stay ? <p> Ultimately there are five main reasons that make them stay : <p> Professional development and growth. - Eighty-seven percent of millennials said professional development and growth opportunities are important to them . Provide training and opportunities for employees to develop their skills and learning . <p> Workplace environment. - Seventy-eight percent said workplace environment factors into their decision to stay at their job . Take a look at your organization 's culture , and determine if there are any aspects that you think might need changed to improve your workplace environment . <p> Making an impact . Millennials want to make a lasting impact and contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek work that makes them feel valued and has a sense of purpose . This can lead to employee engagement , as- 71 percent that know what sets their organization apart and what it stands for also plan to stay at their organization for at least a year . Your senior living organization should implement ways for millennial employees to impact others , such as engaging with seniors on a regular basis . This will help them see how their work truly impacts the residents , and can help attribute their day-to-day tasks to a higher purpose . <p> When you put these five areas into practice , it leads to millennials that are active and engaged in their workplace . These may not seem like a big deal to Gen Y , Gen X , and Baby Boomers , but they make a big difference in the daily work lives of millennials , and heeding these factors can make a big difference in your senior living organization , as well . <h> WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF ENGAGED MILLENNIALS ? <p> Once you have engaged and contributing millennials at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits that you can expect to see ? <p> First off , you can expect more effort and productivity . A study conducted by the Corporate Executive Board found that employees most committed to their organizations put in 57 percent more effort and are 87 percent less likely to resign , than employees who consider themselves disengaged . If your millennial employees know how their work can make a positive impact on the lives of your residents , it can lead to even better work . <p> Engaged millennials also help solve your workforce shortage . At some point , your current leaders are going to leave or retire . The Social Security Administration reports that , on average , 10,000 baby boomers retire every day . Attracting and retaining millennial workers can help prevent workforce shortages and allow you to focus on serving your residents and maintain occupancy rates . <p> Working to implement these preferences , technologies , and best practices show that you 're working towards the future .

Sometimes things can and do go wrong . Projects can become disorganized , employees do n't always hold up their end of things , and teams can break down under pressure . This is when you can step in , micromanage things for a short period of time to get things back to where they should be , then step back out . <h> A customer demands your presence . <p> There are often customers who feel comfortable dealing with someone in charge , rather than always going through several junior employees . This can be for a number of reasons . The customer may be a big buyer and therefore deserves the extra attention from you .

It 's better to protect an important customer relationship than worry about upsetting a subordinate . <p> While micromanagement can be disruptive in the workplace , there is sometimes a time and place where it is actually beneficial .

But sometimes in the midst of growth , the recruitment and hiring process can feel rushed and hasty , especially when business is brisk and the open position needs to be filled sooner rather than later . <p> When you rush things , mistakes are made and details are overlooked . When it comes to hiring , that 's a big deal . It can mean the difference between finding just a candidate rather than the right candidate . - Failing to hire for fit brings up a myriad of other challenges , but that 's a blog for another day . <p> Just like you 'd trust an IT professional to manage your organization 's technology , it 's in your best interest to have an HR professional take care of your hiring process . People who have been trained in HR understand the legal consequences that come with hiring new employees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really want to know . Without an HR professional involved in your company 's hiring process , we often see mistakes that cost your organization a lot of time and money . Here are the top five : <p> Not holding phone interviews to narrow your candidates . When you have dozens of resumes to comb through , it can be hard to determine which candidates are the best fit for the job . Instead of bringing everyone in for a formal interview , it 's worth your time to spend 15-20 minutes doing phone interviews first . You 'll be able to tell quickly which individuals are worth pursuing further . <p> Having no consistency in your interview questions . If you do n't ask all candidates the same questions , you face the classic apples and oranges problem . You wo n't be able to compare their answers and how they respond to the same question or situation . Instead , you should have one list of questions that you ask each candidate . It may seem tedious during the interview process , but it will pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Asking the wrong questions . Companies ca n't choose to hire , or not hire , individuals on the basis of race , religion , sex , disability , age , and a variety of others . It may seem obvious not to ask these questions directly , but you do need to tread carefully and make sure that none of your questions , however innocuous , can be interpreted as such . Staying away from personal questions helps avoid legal troubles with candidates that do n't make the cut . <p> Using social media to research your candidates an influence your decisions . For the same reasons that asking the wrong questions can blur the ethical line , vetting candidates on social media can also get you into murky waters . It 's best to avoid searching for candidates on social media platforms in general , despite how tempting it may be . <p> Talking more than you listen . You bring in applicants to learn more about their experiences and how they would fit in the position . So , let them talk . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Keep details about the position and company brief at the beginning and expand on them when the candidate asks at the end of the interview . This way , you spend the majority of the allotted time hearing the information you wanted " getting to know the candidate . <p> If hiring a full-time HR professional to take care of your employment and other HR needs is n't in your organization 's budget , consider bringing in experts rather than trying to handle it yourself .

Administering these benefits can be a frustrating and time-consuming effort for HR departments . <p> Here are six ways to make benefits administration pay off : <h> Provide Quality Benefits <p> Aflac reported 96 percent of employees that are satisfied with their employer 's benefits are also more likely to be satisfied with their jobs , but one-third of employees are only somewhat satisfied with their current benefits . This shows that providing quality benefits matters to employees , but not many organizations are getting it right . Poll your employees to see what they think of your current benefits , and see if there is room for improvement . Providing the right mix of benefits is likely to keep your top talent satisfied and improve your employee retention rates. - <h> Make Enrollment Easily <p> One way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration is to implement employee online self-enrollment .

Removing separated employees and reduced hourly employees is not usually a high priority , so conduct a premium audit to make sure you 're only paying premiums for current , eligible employees . - <h> Consider Outsourcing <p> Outsourcing employee benefits can be cost-effective , taking the burden off of your HR workers ' shoulders . Working with a professional employment organization ( PEO ) like Aureon can simplify benefits administration while offering benefits packages to the small to medium-sized businesses that were likely not available before . <h> Use Automated Software <p> Automated systems allow employees to log in and access their benefits from anywhere they want .

Creating a culture around data security can help prevent breaches . To start , make security awareness training a mandatory event for employees . This training should not only show employees the different kinds of cyber and social engineering attacks , but also show them how to thwart attacks . Provide concrete examples of actual threats , and set up a test/false attack to identify employee behaviors and then provide additional training , if needed . Once employees know how to stop these strikes before they even happen , the risk of a cyberattack decreases , and will validate the criticality of your organization 's data . - <h> IMPLEMENT A CYBERSECURITY POLICY <p> When was the last time your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? In a NetEnrich study of more than 150 IT professionals , - 40 percent said their company had been a victim of cyberattacks , and- 43 percent said they could 've been prevented- with a better company-wide cybersecurity policy . <p> If you do n't have one in place , a good cybersecurity policy should cover these five things : <p> How to detect scams , such as phishing and other social engineering tactics . <p> Guidelines on password management . <p> Guidelines on proper internet usage . <p> The standards for installing software updates and patches . <p> Standards on how to keep sensitive data safe . <p> It 's not enough to just have a policy . The- CEB- reported that- 90 percent of employees violate their organization 's cybersecurity policy , and that 's mostly because they do n't know the policy . Communicate and do multiple trainings to explain the expectations with data security , so that your employees are well-equipped and on the lookout for potential attacks . <h> USE A VPN OR UNIFIED THREAT MANAGEMENT <p> Using a Virtual Private Network ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are , whether at home , a coffee shop , or in the airport . A VPN encrypts your connection , making anyone else on the same Wi-Fi network unable to intercept your traffic . A quality , business-grade firewall will have VPN capabilities . In addition , there are many hosted services that offer VPNs . <p> Going one step further is Unified Threat Management . This is a more comprehensive approach , where multiple security functions work within a single platform . A firewall is part of Unified Threat Management , but it also includes : network intrusion detection/prevention , anti-virus , gateway anti-spam , VPN , content filtering , load balancing , data loss prevention , and reporting . <h> BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DISASTER RECOVERY <p> How you handle an outage , recover from it , and prevent it from happening again are crucial factors for your organization. - Infrascale reports- that one hour of downtime can cost small businesses $8,000 and large companies $700,000 on average . These are big numbers , and it can be alarming to think this could happen to your organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system uptime and availability to serve clients and drive sales , then just running a daily backup may no longer be enough . Many organizations are seeking redundant internet connections and automated failover solutions , should an outage occur within their primary systems or network . Having a- business continuity plan- and the associated technology can significantly protect your bottom line . <h> IMPLEMENT ESSENTIAL TECHNOLOGY SERVICES <p> Services such as anti-virus , firewall protection , network monitoring , and wireless security are layers of defense to give you state-of-the-art protection . Having a network that is protected behind a firewall and an elaborate network system is becoming a necessity , and can be the difference between being hacked and being safe . <p> Most organizations have a firewall , but not all of them are using their firewall to its full potential . A firewall is the foundation to protecting your network from unauthorized access . A business-class firewall can perform additional services like blocking dangerous or unproductive websites , running in-depth reports showing which websites your employees are visiting , bandwidth consumption , and other information that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a managed security service because it provides more time for internal resources to focus on core business functions and initiatives , and allows them to run everything through a single vendor . With a managed service provider constantly monitoring and updating your network , your organization will improve efficiency and productivity . <h> ENCRYPT YOUR DATA <p> To ensure maximum protection , it 's best practice to encrypt your data while in transit and at rest . Encryption renders information unreadable when accessed without proper authorization . Having a process in place that ensures sensitive devices are encrypted and that files and emails are being properly sent is imperative. - <h> MANAGE YOUR MOBILE DEVICES <p> An important place to protect when it comes to passwords and your organization 's security is your employees ' mobile devices . At a basic level , the goal of mobile device management is to protect the data on employee devices . This reduces the risk of a mobile device being compromised , and can help secure your data , should it become compromised . Most mobile device management systems allow you to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wipe or reset the device in certain cases . <p> Today , more and more organizations are adopting a Bring Your Own Device ( BYOD ) mentality , where the employee uses their own tablets , smartphones , and laptops . While this can save the organization money , it also comes with its own set of challenges . One big issue surrounding BYOD " and personal technology as a whole " has to do with privacy and security . Whether it 's through apps , training , or just well-worded policies , you need to ensure that your employees are n't sharing confidential information about your business or your customers . Likewise , you should have a plan in place that preserves employee privacy and does n't leave your company liable to charges that you 're using technology intrusively . You should also have a process around employee transitions , and what happens to the employee 's mobile device when they leave your organization . Does the phone get wiped , and does the employee know what to do with it when they leave ? This goes hand-in-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run ( especially if an issue does occur ) . <h> HAVE A DEFENSE IN DEPTH APPROACH <p> To properly secure your network , construct a layered security approach through segmentation . Think of it like an onion : there are many layers that keep peeling back to eventually reveal the core . Your organization 's systems/servers should be restricted within their own network or layer , and access to each one should be defined by a strict whitelist , where only explicitly configured address objects and services should be allowed . This ensures that communication is only happening on secure channels . <h> UNDERSTAND USER AGREEMENTS <p> All data hosting services have user agreements that outline their terms and conditions . While these may be arduous to read , it 's important to understand the fine print . You need to be careful you are not consenting to allow the provider to directly access ( or share ) your business data and customer information . In doing so , you could expose sensitive information that is n't meant to be shared . It 's also important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third-party hosting service . <p> To help you understand these agreements , consider downloading the printer-friendly version and take the time to read through it . If you find words or phrases that you do n't understand , look them up or get advice from an industry expert . It 's better to be safe than sorry. - - <h> HAVE AN EFFECTIVE PASSWORD POLICY <p> For businesses , passwords are everything . If just one employee is careless with their password , it could have devastating consequences to your organization . To stop this from happening , organizations must enforce complex password requirements . <p> Tips for creating an effective password include : <p> Password best practices , such as a minimum length of eight characters , no password hints , and a common password ban list . <p> Require a unique passphrase with special characters , so that it 's more difficult to crack . <p> Set up a policy limiting the number of consecutive incorrect access attempts . <p> Consider using Two-Factor Authentication ( 2FA ) . <h> ACTIVELY MONITOR YOUR SECURITY <p> You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Information and Event Management ( SIEM ) is one effective strategy that delivers a centralized view of all network data . From that data , it can identify any threats and track them throughout your organization 's system . SIEM consolidates all logs and provides a clearer picture of what 's happening in your network . <p> Fortunately , SIEM is n't something that you have to handle on your own. - Managed security service providers ( MSSP ) , - like Aureon , offer 24/7 security monitoring that 's affordable and effective . These services let you know right away when security incidents occur , and include log monitoring reports and network analytics , to help you see exactly what 's going on in your organization 's network . <h> CREATE A DATA POLICY <p> In today 's day and age , there are a variety of free or low-cost hosting services available for data storage . Many are designed for the consumer market and not suited for business use . Such services can pose security risks to an organization . To combat this , it 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all employees are aware of , fully understand their obligations , and follow . It is important for your employees to know what the risks and implications are , should a data breach occur . <p> A data security policy should be used to define approved methods to securely transfer or share data and define restricted methods to help stop the use of unsupported or unsafe services and applications . Policies should be very specific on what is acceptable and not acceptable for all employees . They should include information about email policies , mobile devices , social networking , and internet usage . These policies should be documented , communicated ( multiple times ) , enforced , and periodically reviewed and updated . <p> As cybersecurity breaches continue to rise , organizations must revisit their IT and security infrastructure to make sure they are doing everything they can to prevent their organization from a breach .

They simply view them as independent ways for a customer to get service when they need it . First-class customer focused organizations know that it is not just important to make channels available to customers ( multi-channel ) , but it is equally important to think about how those channels are integrated together to build a seamless , consistent customer experience ( omnichannel ) . <p> Many organizations believe multi-channel and omnichannel mean basically the same thing . This is , of course , not the case and both are becoming more critical as consumers choose to interact via several channels , sometimes simultaneously , to get service. - <h> Multi-channel <p> Let 's start with multi-channel first . Multi-channel is the idea of providing your customer the ability to connect with you via several methods , such as phone , chat , email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods may be available to customers , there is little thought given to how they work together . They are viewed as independent contact channels , with the experience lacking consistency of branding , policies , and quality . <p> Internally , these channels are sometimes managed by different groups completely , which means there is not a lot of cross-pollination in terms of knowledge and expertise about how one channel works with another . It is important to have a multi-channel approach , for sure , but thinking about how all of these channels work together with today 's customer is critical. - <h> Omnichannel <p> Omnichannel , on the other hand , is the same as multi-channel in the sense that several methods of communication are available , including phone , email , chat , social media , and others , but there is one very significant difference . The channels are set up and managed in a way to create a consistent brand experience at all times , no matter how the customer chooses to interact . This is critical because today 's consumer is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their one preferred method . Further , today 's consumer may communicate via several channels at the same time . <p> For instance , the other day I was online looking through some information on my mobile phone account . I ended up calling customer service to get more information , but remained with my account online . The agent was able to tell me exactly how to find the information I needed online and even shared some other things about the site to make my experience better in the future . I can give you endless examples of this , and I know this is how the consumer of today wants to be serviced . He or she expects to get the information they need wherever they want it , and they expect it to be consistent across any channel. - - <p> Other research like this shows an omnichannel approach is increasingly beneficial to contact centers , however , the biggest task is having to handle and manage all of the channels at the same time .

Many employers have already made their decisions regarding which positions to re-classify as non-exempt , which salaries to increase , and how to effectively manage overtime for employees not accustomed to punching a clock . If you have n't nailed down your organization 's plan yet , now is the time to do it. - <p> The normal human emotional response to change like this is likely the most overlooked and unanticipated consequence of moving employees from an exempt role to a non-exempt role . Many employees perceive the change as a loss in status or flexibility and believe they will be expected to do the same work in fewer hours . Reduced morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with this group of affected employees. - <h> Expect and Anticipate Emotional Reactions <p> While emotional reactions certainly ca n't be eliminated , you can take steps as an organization to mitigate their impact and ensure employee concerns are anticipated and addressed . Organizations making these transitions can expect some or all of the following reactions : <p> Relief : Some employees may be relieved to either be paid overtime for working more hours or because they will be working less hours for the same amount of pay , with more time to spend with their family . <p> Anger or Resentment : A certain status is attached to being a salaried or exempt employee . Although the law may dictate that an employee can no longer be exempt from overtime , some employees are still likely to hold the decision against their employer . Others may see justification for the decision the company made to classify them as a non-exempt worker . <p> Fear : Change often results in at least some fear from all parties involved . Employees ( and managers , for that matter ) may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how after-hours emergencies will be handled if remote access is removed , the elimination of flexibility , and increased stress . <p> Disappointment : A perceived change in status can result in an employee feeling disappointed or under-valued by their employer . Disappointment may be magnified for employees who also undergo changes to benefits , remote system access , and/or flexibility , in addition to the status change . <p> The key : anticipate reactions and create responses in advance . You know your employees and can be ready to respond to their concerns . <h> Communicate Individually and Check in Often <p> The conversation regarding transitioning from exempt to non-exempt status can be a delicate one . Managers or leaders should have this conversation with each affected employee prior to an email being sent or the matter being addressed in a team meeting . Employees should have the opportunity to share concerns and ask questions privately . <h> Make the Administrative Burdens of the Change as Easy as Possible <p> The administrative piece of being a non-exempt employee can be laid out for transitioning employees well in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overtime policies , or train your managers to walk affected employees through the changes and requirements individually , there should be no surprises here for newly non-exempt workers . This is a good time to look deeper at leveraging timekeeping technology if you have n't yet done so . Electronic timekeeping systems can offer flexible options to employers , including options for electronic time punches on personal PCs and mobile devices . <h> Get Creative <p> Being an hourly employee does n't automatically equate working eight to five at a workstation , which is a common assumption . Strategies , such as changing your seven-day work week to Friday through Thursday , re-allocating job duties , implementing staggered work schedules , hiring temporary or part-time employees for project work , and establishing more formal flexible work policies can help mitigate overtime expenses and improve employee morale . <p> Transitioning an employee from exempt to non-exempt requires a delicate balance of empathy and clarity .

It 's probably a lot , right ? While people are n't sure the exact number , marketing experts estimate that the average American sees around 4,000 ads daily . <p> For organizations that want to post a recruitment ad , it can be extremely difficult to differentiate their ad from the rest of the noise . <p> This is why coming up with an ad that is creative , attention-grabbing , and unique is essential if you want your organization to stand out . <p> However , this is easier said than done . To help you get started brainstorming your creative recruitment ad , take a look at what these companies have done . <h> VISUALLY APPEALING <p> The LEGO Group- is getting visually creative with their recruitment ads , by featuring images of LEGOs ( surprise , surprise ) . Even though the words are n't attention grabbing , the visuals more than make up for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , so it 's very important to choose an image that will entice people to read what you have to say . <h> SPEAK TO YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE <p> When it comes to creating an ad , you have to know what kind of audience you 're targeting . For example , take a look at the Microsoft- ad below . They were seeking software developers , so they made an ad that only people with a certain set of skills could decipher . The point here is that it 's always a good idea to appeal directly to your main audience , whoever they may be . <h> PLACEMENT IS KEY <p> One of the often overlooked aspects of a recruitment ad is where to publish and promote it . Most organizations stick with the basics and use Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and job sites to promote the ad . But , depending on your target audience , there could be other areas for your recruitment ad that would be more effective . <p> Take the ride-sharing company Lyft- for example . Instead of a typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billboard that was visible from the interstate , since their target market is mainly drivers . <p> Where else could your organization be advertising ? That can be a difficult question to answer , but it can be very rewarding if you figure it out and tap into a new space . <h> TRY VIDEOS <p> Have you considered posting jobs with videos ? A study by Ongig shows that job-seekers spend more than triple the time watching video job ads ( three minutes ) than they do reading a text job ad ( 55 seconds ) . This gives you more face time with the potential candidate , and let 's you explain your company and the job in more detail . <p> Does your organization need to get more creative when it comes to recruitment ads ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> As a Direct Hire Recruiter with Aureon Staffing , Nick Wells is passionate about attracting top talent for top organizations .

It 's probably a lot , right ? While people are n't sure the exact number , marketing experts estimate that the average American sees around 4,000 ads daily . <p> For organizations that want to post a recruitment ad , it can be extremely difficult to differentiate their ad from the rest of the noise . <p> This is why coming up with an ad that is creative , attention-grabbing , and unique is essential if you want your organization to stand out . <p> However , this is easier said than done . To help you get started brainstorming your creative recruitment ad , take a look at what these companies have done . <h> VISUALLY APPEALING <p> The LEGO Group- is getting visually creative with their recruitment ads , by featuring images of LEGOs ( surprise , surprise ) . Even though the words are n't attention grabbing , the visuals more than make up for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , so it 's very important to choose an image that will entice people to read what you have to say . <h> SPEAK TO YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE <p> When it comes to creating an ad , you have to know what kind of audience you 're targeting . For example , take a look at the Microsoft- ad below . They were seeking software developers , so they made an ad that only people with a certain set of skills could decipher . The point here is that it 's always a good idea to appeal directly to your main audience , whoever they may be . <h> PLACEMENT IS KEY <p> One of the often overlooked aspects of a recruitment ad is where to publish and promote it . Most organizations stick with the basics and use Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and job sites to promote the ad . But , depending on your target audience , there could be other areas for your recruitment ad that would be more effective . <p> Take the ride-sharing company Lyft- for example . Instead of a typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billboard that was visible from the interstate , since their target market is mainly drivers . <p> Where else could your organization be advertising ? That can be a difficult question to answer , but it can be very rewarding if you figure it out and tap into a new space . <h> TRY VIDEOS <p> Have you considered posting jobs with videos ? A study by Ongig shows that job-seekers spend more than triple the time watching video job ads ( three minutes ) than they do reading a text job ad ( 55 seconds ) .

If your employees were asked if they think their employer loves them , what would they say ? <p> The truth is , you should love your employees . And , perhaps more importantly , you should show them that you appreciate them . Here are a few ways you can show them some love . <h> RECOGNIZE THEM <p> One of the best ways you can show your employees that you value them ? Recognize them when they do something good and valuable . <p> A survey by David Novak and Harvard Business Review found that 82 percent of employed Americans feel that their contributions are n't recognized enough by their managers , and 40 percent say they would be more engaged and motivated if they received more recognition . <p> It feels great to be recognized by a manager , but it 's also nice to know your co-workers recognize when you do a good job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond , or simply doing a good deed . You can also send out a weekly email showcasing the employees that have been nominated to be recognized . <p> Another way to do this is to have your employees set goals at the start of the year , and accomplish them throughout the calendar year . If an employee completes a goal , it 's another good opportunity to recognize them and share their accomplishments . <h> REWARD THEM <p> Along with the goals and recognition , it 's also important to reward your employees , whether that 's a gift , a raise , or a bonus . These rewards show employees that you value them and that they are important to the organization . <p> Ann C. Dzuranin , an assistant professor at Northern Illinois University , and Nathan Stuart , an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin , Oskosh , conducted a research study by observing a group that was performing for cash incentives and another group that was performing for non-cash incentives . The non-cash incentive group outperformed the cash incentive group , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't necessarily have to reward your employees with money , and in fact , it may be better if you do n't . <p> Your rewards do n't have to be huge or costly , but a little goes a long way . From a handwritten letter to a holiday bonus , your employees will feel appreciated . <h> TRAIN THEM <p> Another way to show appreciation for employees is to offer professional development and coaching . Along with expanding their knowledge , it also gives them insight into other areas that they may be interested in . <p> According to Gallup , 87 percent of millennials say that professional development is important for their job , and 69 percent on non-millennials agree , too . Recognizing their talents by sending them to a conference or seminar improves confidence and supplements their expertise . <h> RETAIN THEM <p> Showing recognition and rewarding employees for exemplary performances all helps retain them and keep them satisfied and engaged . If you value your employees , you 'll want them to stay , and if you show that you value them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider the following factors that help keep employees engaged : <p> A culture of respect . <p> Constructive feedback and mentoring . <p> Advancement and professional development . <p> Fair and appropriate rewards and recognition . <p> Availability of effective leadership . <p> Clear job expectations . <p> Adequate tools and resources to complete work . <p> High levels of motivation . <p> How do you show love and appreciation to your employees ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Erin Green is a Director of Business Development at Aureon HR .

" <p> Let me explain : We initially- achieve success because we- focus on the trees . The trees are what we 're good at and what we like to do. - But when we get to management and leadership , our tree is no longer important . Instead , we have to focus on the big picture and see all of the moving parts , which is the forest. - <p> This is where strategic planning comes in . Strategic planning is focusing on the forest ( the big picture ) , having a vision for what you want your organization to look like in the future , and then coming up with a plan to make it happen . <p> Do fully develop a successful strategic plan , let 's look at the last four key areas . <h> 4 . GOALS <p> What tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fulfilled ? <p> Goals are similar to vision , but they should be more specific . These are the stepping stones to reach the vision and maintain that level of success . Make these actionable to make them work . <p> For example , these goals could be providing great customer service or valuing and appreciating employees . <h> 5 . PLANS <p> How are you going to achieve your goals and fulfill your mission ? What plans must you consistently execute to achieve success ? <p> This is the part where everything is put into action . While this can be the hardest part to figure out , it 's also the most rewarding in the end , and will give your employees the sense of purpose and success . <p> The best way to go about this is to take your goals and work on what you need to do to accomplish them . So if your goal is to provide great customer service , then focus on coming up with a plan to achieve that level of service . <h> 6 . PROCESSES <p> What processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , achieve your goals , and fulfill your vision ? <p> Processes can be difficult to nail down . The best way to determine a step-by-step process is to go through each plan and goal . Then , document how to implement each one , while still considering your standards and ultimate vision . <p> This is the nitty gritty of the whole thing . It 's one thing to write down your purpose , values , and vision , but it 's a whole other beast to actually plan and process out how you 're going to accomplish everything . I always tell people to be as specific as possible , so that there is nothing unclear about what you plan to do . <h> 7 . PEOPLE <p> Are you setting your people up for success with clear goals , roles , communication , and processes ? <p> If people are n't communicating well , then goals probably are n't being reached , and an organization 's strategic plan is not succeeding . All employees should know the organization 's purpose , values , vision , goals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives consistently communicating these to everyone . <h> PUT IT INTO ACTION <p> Developing a strategic plan is no easy task , but in the end it 's worth it . It not only gives organizations a clear vision and purpose , but it also allows employees to have a bigger objective than just their day-to-day work . Along with a clear purpose , it also creates the ability for organizations to better serve its clients and customers , because the action items are there to accomplish everything . <p> Why are organizations that use strategic planning more profitable ? Because they know what they need to accomplish , and they have the tools to accomplish it . In the business world , people feel more confident when they know their purpose and end-goal , and strategic planning let 's organizations decide their future and aim towards success . <p> - <p> - Does your organization have a strategic plan in place ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Jason Kiesau has been studying personal , professional and leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leadership and Talent Development Manager for Aureon , he travels the country working with leaders in the areas of self-management , relationship building , strategic thinking , and development of high performing teams .

There is a level of pride that ca n't be out matched which , ultimately , generates a level of quality that is second to none . I travel all over the country and in every area I visit this is brought up to me as a critical reason why organizations like doing business with companies in the Midwest. - <h> LOW OVERHEAD <p> The overall cost of living and cost of doing business are less expensive in the Midwest .

As such , the trend toward cloud services continues to be on the rise . IDG Enterprise reported that 48 percent of enterprises are moving to the cloud to replace on-premise , legacy technology , and 25 percent of total IT budgets were allocated to cloud computing in 2016. - <p> Aureon has helped hundreds of businesses migrate to cloud applications and different hosting platforms , including the Aureon Cloud . With the demand for hosted solutions also comes the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to part of- its 5,500+ miles of extensive , state-wide Fiber optic network each year . <p> We expect this trend to increase as more and more organizations start to trust the cloud , and see the potential benefits it offers them . <p> Another trend on the rise is a heightened focus on network and data security . The reports and trends on cybercrime are alarming . For example , from 2014 to 2015 , there was a 38 percent rise in cyberattacks , according to PricewaterhouseCooper . A NetEnrich study revealed that 40 percent of the respondents said their company had been a victim of cyberattacks , and 43 percent said they could 've been prevented with a better company-wide cybersecurity policy . <p> A good cybersecurity policy should at least cover these five things : <p> How to detect scams , such as phishing and other social engineering tactics . <h> HR <p> Providing HR solutions for 28 years . <p> Recently , the HR world has been full of delays and anticipation .

It can be challenging for organizations to determine what to do and what plan of action to take for now , while things still have n't been decided . Here are some tips from our HR experts . <p> FLSA <p> Since the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) overtime regulations have been blocked by the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas for the time being , it 's important to know where you stand and what you should do in the meantime . <p> Do you continue with the planned changes , or do you change your plans ? <p> Recently , there 's been a lot of talk about the government repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) .

If any changes are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals ' health plans all across the country . How would it affect premiums ? How would it affect your organization ? <h> CONTACT CENTER <p> In the contact center world , the two biggest things we 've noticed have been the need for omnichannel support , and the resurgence of onshoring . <p> Omnichannel <p> The need for omnichannel stems from knowing what your customers want and how they want to communicate with you .

NPR reported- that at least 200 companies have returned to the U.S. in recent years , and that number is growing . The technical term for this is reshoring , and for the past few years it 's been gaining traction . Why ? Mainly because of poor customer satisfaction rates , which were spurred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with offshore call centers . <h> STAFFING <p> Our staffing company has more than 25 years of industry experience . <p> Because of low unemployment rates , last year 's labor pool was very small , making it hard to find quality candidates . In fact , most employers tell us the person they are looking for is not looking for them . These are passive candidates . They may be open to a new opportunity , but do n't have their resume on the internet boards , and are n't actively looking . <p> According to Gallup , more than- two-thirds of U.S. employees- are disengaged from their current job . That 's a lot of opportunity to find employees who want to be challenged , engaged , and rewarded at their job . <p> Social media has made it easier than ever to find passive candidates . LinkedIn , Facebook , industry associations and clubs , purchased lists in your industry , licensed professionals , your employees ' friends , neighbors , and relatives are all good places to start . You need to reach out to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail , telephone , email , and personal contact . Then help them understand why you present a better opportunity , and make sure that when they DO become unhappy ( and why ) , they call you first . Unfortunately , all of this takes time " a lot of time ( and that is why you hire recruiters ) . - <h> PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER <p> All of these trends throughout our different business channels point towards an eagerness to grow , change , and succeed .

They are another way- to present an organization as a qualified and exceptional brand . <p> It 's important to realize that help desks are n't just call centers , they are another way to present an organization as a qualified and exceptional brand . They should show the customers who contact them that they care and work to provide a unique and positive experience for them . It is also not easy to maintain and manage your own help desk internally without proper support and staff . Consistently negative experience can leave callers with a bitter taste in their mouth . In order to keep an organization 's help desk thriving and providing exemplary- customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drive a great overall help desk experience . <p> 1 . SERVICE EXPERIENCE AND QUALITY <p> When dealing with customers , it 's important to provide- them with not only answers to their questions , but go beyond their basic needs to deliver an exceptional experience that shows that the help desk cares about them and wants to continually provide them with excellent service . This level of quality and assurance builds loyalty and let 's customers know that they are valued. - <p> Accomplishing this- can take a fair amount of time and effort . It would be nice and easy if great help desk service happened overnight , but that is n't reality . A consistent and exceptional help desk experience starts with the managers and team leaders developing standard processes and developing attitudes that show how to treat customers and questions nad how to handle difficult situations with poise and professionalism . Many organizations conduct employee training that clearly lays out the guidelines and goals of the help desk experience . Genesys Global Survey discovered the two biggest things that make a customer 's experience satisfying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 percent ) . Both of these factors when implemented and used correctly , can boost a help desk 's service quality and overall experience . Another issue that some organization 's help desks have is the false reality that they are already providing quality service . A study conducted by Lee Resources stated that 80 percent of companies say that they- produce exceptional service , but only 8 percent of their customers agree . To get an accurate gauge of service levels , send out the- surveys and heed the responses . <p> - <p> 2 . KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE <p> In managing the help desk experience , people play a big role in how everything operates . Choosing the right people for the job is paramount , since they will be the ones representing the organization . According to the Help Desk Institute , individuals who have excellent customer service and problem-solving skills are the most sought-after people in a help desk workplace. - <p> Both of these skills are necessary for the job , but help desk agents also need to be knowledgeable about what they are problem-solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are helping the customer with every step- of the way leads to a better experience for the caller and increases the chances of a satisfied customer. - <p> In order to have knowledgeable agents , they have to be trained . There are several areas to focus the training on and it is important to ensure that the most critical areas are covered . Here are five of the most common types of training that help desk agents receive , according to the Help Desk Institute : <p> The technologies used to provide support. - <p> Help desk service skills . <p> The technologies used by customers. - <p> Problem-solving skills . <p> General- communication skills . <p> 3 . HOURS OF OPERATION <p> Most help desks are only available during business hours , and this is extremely inconvenient for the people that work late hours or ca n't call or email in until after they get off work . Today 's workplace is becoming more flexible , which means that there are more employees who set their own hours and work beyond the typical shift . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of them want flexible work options in order to maintain a healthy work-life balance . Help desks need to realize this and create a way for their services to be available at all hours of the day when customers are working and consuming resources . <p> This may lead to hiring more help desk agents , or even outsourcing the help desk services to a partner company , in order to let people call in anytime they want . Having a help desk with extended hours- and potentially- 24/7 support further enhances the experience by accommodating the customers ' needs and schedule . <p> 4 . INDEPENDENT WORKERS <p> It is not enough to just have knowledgeable agents and be content with that . Having workers that are independent is the next logical step . This will allow the help desk managers and leaders to focus on bigger things , and not have to micro-manage the help desk agents all the time . These workers must be able to execute correctly and make decisions that are in line with the overall goals and customer experience objectives . This- type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work " on " the help desk framework and not have to work " in " it all the time . This leads to a better help desk experience and one that is focused on constant improvement. - <p> To cultivate employees that exemplify these traits , consider the elements of a successful work culture from a Help Desk Insitute report that surveyed help desk employees , desktop support employees and management . Even though this report does n't call out independent workers specifically , all of these factors apply to what goes into developing trusted employees , which leads to more qualified and independent agents . The surveyed employees deemed that the following were very important : <p> 5 . OUTCOME FOCUSED <p> The final component to the help desk experience is always staying focused on the outcome , and producing results that will enhance the overall help desk service for end-users . Here are three main ways to be outcome focused : <p> Strive for first-call resolution.No matter who is on the other end , customers want an answer to their question right away . Make it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem as quickly as possible , - because a high first-call resolution rate is directly associated with high caller satisfaction . Sometimes the initial agent just does n't have the knowledge or tools to solve a customer 's inquiry . In these cases , be sure to have higher level agents available immediately rather- than creating a ticket for follow up . It 's also important to record when a first-call resolution happens , as the Ascent Group reported that- 44 percent of companies that recorded first-call resolution results for a year or longer had considerable improvement in their performance rates. - <p> Reduce response times.In order to boost satisfaction , work on cutting down the response time for calls , emails , or social- media . Speed is n't the most important goal , an extraordinary experience is , but it certainly factors into how the customer views an organization . There are a few ways that help desk agents can respond quickly to the customers to let them know that their problem is being handled , such as assigning a help ticket ( this could be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that case number or ticket . Phone calls are a different situation since the caller will be on hold waiting for an agent topick up the phone . According to Harris Interactive , 75 percent of callers think that it takes too long to talk to an agent . It is important to have a very clear understanding of typical call volume , arrival pattern , s and the length in order to optimize the staffing plans in advance . Sometimes things wo n't go according to plan , but they will be more open if a plan is in place . When there 's a higher call volume than normal , and there 's not enough staff to get to all the calls , consider implementing a hold message that gives the caller an estimated wait time . If customers know what to expect and how long until their call is answered , they will be more understanding of high call volume wait times . <p> Conduct surveys. - Surveys are a great way to get an accurate picture of the help desk experience . Some questions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did the help desk resolve your problem ? - <p> Was the help desk prompt and professional in responding to your problem ? <p> Were you happy with the help desk service you received ? <p> Measure the survey on a five-point scale and instead of looking at average survey score only , measure it in terms of " top two boxes " and " bottom box . " That is to say , measure the percentage of respondents that rated their experience as exceptional or very good and the percentage of respondents that rated the experience as poor . There are various thoughts on this , but a typical best practice is to expect more than 85 percent to fall in the top two boxes and less than 4 percent to fall into the bottom box. - <p> Also , be sure to follow up on every single bottom box rating . Determine if there is an action item to correct a potentially systemic issue and decide if there is additional follow-up required for that specific customer. - <p> Each of these outcome-focused points are important to improving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made . <p> CONCLUSION <p> All of these components that make up the help desk experience can be complicated to implement correctly and maintain . So how do organizations go about aligning them properly ? Some organizations have the- expertise and resources to accomplish this internally while others turn to professional help desk providers to get access to the resources and thought leaders needed to accomplish it . Both- approaches can make sense depending on an organization 's specific circumstances . The key is to ensure that the appropriate time is taken to assess the current environment and determine- which course of action is best . <p> Even though the core help desk components remain constant , the ideal experience looks different for every organization , depending on environment variables and size . By focusing on these unchanging help desk pillars , organizations can work to create an entire help desk experience that not only meets their customers ' needs in a timely manner , but always creates a positive impression for their brand . <p> PRESENTED BY <p> Aureon is a business solutions provider who connects possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for organizations " small and large .

Try using the behavioral interview when questioning candidates to increase your chances of hiring employees that will be a good fit for your organization and stay long-term . <h> WHY USE THE BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEW ? <p> The purpose of the behavioral interview is to identify how an applicant behaved and handled a real-life situation from their past experience . The applicant should be able to identify and explain the actions they took to find a resolution to the situation . <p> Here are examples of common behavioral questions : <p> Describe a major issue you have faced and how you solved it . <p> What class did you like the most ? What did you like about it ? <p> Give an example of when you had to deal with a team member that was n't carrying his or her weight . <p> How did you feel ? <p> What did you do ? <p> What were you thinking ? <p> What was the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A GOOD CANDIDATE <p> During the interview process , it 's also important to know what type of answers you 're looking for , so you can identify good candidates . Here are four ways to tell if a candidate is prepared : <p> Each situation has a beginning , middle , and end . Does it make sense and come to a satisfying conclusion ? If a candidate is n't prepared , it wo n't make sense or will skip around . <p> The result is a positive one . It 's easy to think of difficult situations where it was hard to accomplish work , but it can be tough for candidates to recall a time when the ending was positive . A prepared interviewee will share a situation where the end result was positive for them , and wo n't focus too much on the hardships . <p> They are honest . When a candidate is not prepared for these kinds of questions , they may make up a story on the spot . While it can be hard to tell if a candidate is telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the full story . If they 've been honest with you , it should be easy for the candidate to elaborate . <p> They are specific . This goes hand-in-hand with being honest . A well-prepared candidate will be able to go into great detail about the situation , showing that they have a good grasp on the story and thought through their answer before responding . <p> When you implement behavioral interviewing , you 're examining the candidate 's past behaviors to show how they would react in the future at your organization .

@@121230768 @10230768/ 221979 @qwx1081979 <p> With an increasing amount of data moving to the cloud , it 's essential for organizations to evaluate their remote data security risks . The following questions and answers ( along with some of my own thoughts and observations ) from the Microsoft Business Blog are designed to help bolster your cloud security and get you thinking about areas where your organization could improve . <p> As cloud computing and the Internet of Things ( IoT ) continue to transform the global economy , securing enterprise data must be viewed as an ongoing process . Securing the ever-expanding volume , variety , and sources of data is not easy ; however , with an adaptive mindset , you can achieve persistent and effective cloud security . <p> The first step is knowing the key risk areas in cloud computing and IoT processes and assessing whether and where your organization may be exposed to data leaks. - File sharing solutions- improve the way people collaborate but pose a serious point of vulnerability. - Mobile workforces- decentralize data storage and dissolve traditional organizational perimeters . <p> SaaS solutions- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic . Second , it 's worth developing the habit " if you have n't already " of reviewing and adapting cloud security strategy as an ongoing capability . To that end , here are nine key questions to revisit regularly . <h> 1 . IS YOUR SECURITY BUDGET SCALING APPROPRIATELY ? <p> Security teams routinely manage numerous solutions on a daily basis and typically monitor thousands of security alerts . At the same time , they need to keep rapid response practices sharp and ready for deployment in case of a breach . Organizations must regularly verify that sufficient funds are allocated to cover day-to-day security operations as well as rapid , ad hoc responses if and when a breach is detected . <h> 2 . DO YOU HAVE BOTH VISIBILITY INTO AND CONTROL OF CRITICAL DATA ? <p> With potential revenue loss from a single breach in the tens of millions of dollars , preventing data leaks is a central pillar of cloud security strategy . Regularly review how , when , where , and by whom your organization 's data is being accessed . Monitoring whether permissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as for different types of data must be constant . <h> 3 . ARE YOU MONITORING SHADOW IT ADEQUATELY ? <p> Shadow IT is any hardware , software , or application that is n't approved or endorsed by an organization 's IT department . Sometimes users will violate policies , or go around what 's been approved , and attempt to access or download unapproved applications on their own . <p> Today , the average employee uses 17 cloud apps , and mobile users access company resources from a wide variety of locations and devices . Remote and mobile work coupled with the increasing variety of cloud-based solutions ( often free ) raises concerns that traditional on-premises security tools and policies may not provide the level of visibility and control you need . Check whether you can identify mobile device and cloud application users on your network , and monitor changes in usage behavior . To mitigate risks of an accidental data breach , teach current and onboarding employees your organization 's best practices for using ad hoc apps and access . <h> 4 . IS YOUR REMOTE ACCESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a direct channel between external users and your apps , and that makes it risky to publish internal apps to external users . Your organization needs a secure remote access strategy that will help you manage and protect corporate resources as cloud solutions , platforms , and infrastructures evolve . Consider using automated and adaptive policies to reduce time and resources needed to identify and validate risks . <p> IT aims to help employees who are n't aware of data security risks " or how they contribute to them " to learn best practices to mitigate risk factors , like using multi-pronged approaches for sharing sensitive information and how to detect malicious emails . <p> To expand on this , a lot of breaches can be prevented if all employees are educated and trained on different ways hackers might try to manipulate them . There are numerous strategies to evaluate and implement , but here are two that are very effective : <p> Security Awareness Training- <p> Making security awareness training a mandatory event for employees will be a huge benefit over time . Let this training time be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of cyber and social engineering attacks , but also show them how to thwart the attacks . Give concrete examples of actual threats , and possibly set up a test/false attack to identify employee behaviors and then additional training based on the outcomes . Once employees know how to stop these strikes before they even happen , the risk of a cyberattack decreases , and will validate the criticality of your organization 's data . - <p> Another method to create awareness with employees is to post signs around the office with cyber tips and information . Short bullet points that get their attention posted on doors and within common areas , such as break rooms or kitchen areas , can keep this information top of mind . <p> Social Engineering Assessment- <p> An additional way to make sure you 're protected from social engineering attacks is to have an external social engineering assessment done. - Aureon Technology- can aid in these assessments by sending security consultants to perform exploratory research . The consultants use the internet and other investigative methods to gather a great deal of organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how easy it is to gain access to the organization 's data . - <p> All of these tests are done to determine how and where an organization is vulnerable to a social engineering attack . After the assessment is completed , organizations can take the necessary steps to mitigate exposure to many of the most common types of cyberattacks on their systems , communicate to employees how to make their workplace more secure , and reiterate the information through additional training sessions as needed. - <h> 6 . HOW DO YOU PROTECT FROM IDENTITY COMPROMISE ? <p> More often than not , attackers access your network by compromising user credentials . User and entity behavioral analytics can help you identify suspicious activities that could indicate a breach . <p> Mobile users access corporate resources from various locations and devices , so it 's difficult to ensure who 's accessing your organization 's resources in the cloud . In fact , 35 percent of respondents said Two-Factor Authentication ( 2FA ) is a company-wide requirement for employees ' devices , but another 31 percent said it is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2FA is a process designed to ensure the security of sensitive information by means of requiring users to provide two forms of identification when attempting to access an account . Examples of 2FA include : <p> Receiving a text message , phone call , or email with an access code . <p> Having to type in the associated phone number or email . <p> Answering security questions . <p> Choosing the correct image . <p> Typing in a phrase from an image . <p> Using a one-time token . <p> Asking for a fingerprint . <p> This is just another way to ensure that the person accessing the account is the right person . <h> 8 . IS MONITORING AND LOGGING GOOD ENOUGH ? <p> Many tools provide insights into possible threats , but getting huge amounts of raw data , even if consolidated in monitoring tools , requires time and people to identify and validate the risks , and act for every piece of information . It 's stated that 79 percent of global organizations are interested , planning , or already have a risk-based/context-based authentication solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced threats : By using automated , risk-based adaptive policies , you can respond to threats before they start and more effectively allocate your resources . <p> One example of an automated solution like this is Advanced Threat Protection ( ATP ) , which is a combination of different security solutions designed to prevent cyberattacks , malware , and hackers from stealing private and sensitive data . There are some differences in ATP solutions , depending on the company , but the most common solutions include : <p> Network devices . <p> Email gateways . <p> Centralized management console . <p> Malware protection . <p> Endpoint agents. - <p> An effective ATP can prevent , detect , and mitigate threats , so you do n't have to constantly be on the lookout for potential breaches and threats . <p> Another option is to actively monitor your network activity for security threats . Security Information and Event Management ( SIEM ) is one effective strategy that delivers a centralized view of all network data . From that data , it can identify any threats and track them throughout your organization 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of what 's happening on your network . <p> Fortunately , SIEM is n't something that you have to handle on your own . Managed security service providers ( MSSP ) , like Aureon , offer 24/7 security monitoring that 's affordable and effective . These services let you know right away when security incidents occur , and include log monitoring reports and network analytics , to help you see exactly what 's going on in your organization 's network . <h> 9 . IS YOUR IT DEPARTMENT ABLE TO STAY ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ? <p> It 's very easy for IT departments to get bogged down with day to day user requests and reactive activities . This might hinder their ability to respond to issues in a timely manner . It might also impact their ability to focus on more strategic activities , which may involve larger projects that align with the long-term vision and direction of the company . - <p> Some IT teams can benefit from supplemental resources to keep the day to day activities moving along . A Managed Service Provider ( MSP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , and the services can often be scaled up or down to match the ebbs and flows of your organization . <h> WRAP UP <p> The goal of these questions is to provide a guide to follow when it comes to your organization 's cloud security , and give you a list of solutions that you could start implementing right away . <p> Can Aureon answer your- cloud security questions ? - <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Based in Omaha , Bob has been a part of the technology community for 25+ years , from a customer IT Executive to 15 years with a major IT Manufacturer .

Look for one-time and repeat opportunities , evening and weekend time slots , and chances for individuals , whole families , or teams to participate .

Try using the behavioral interview when questioning candidates to increase your chances of hiring employees that will be a good fit for your organization and stay long-term . <h> WHY USE THE BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEW ? <p> The purpose of the behavioral interview is to identify how an applicant behaved and handled a real-life situation from their past experience . The applicant should be able to identify and explain the actions they took to find a resolution to the situation . <p> Here are examples of common behavioral questions : <p> Describe a major issue you have faced and how you solved it . <p> What class did you like the most ? What did you like about it ? <p> Give an example of when you had to deal with a team member that was n't carrying his or her weight . <p> How did you feel ? <p> What did you do ? <p> What were you thinking ? <p> What was the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A GOOD CANDIDATE <p> During the interview process , it 's also important to know what type of answers you 're looking for , so you can identify good candidates . Here are four ways to tell if a candidate is prepared : <p> Each situation has a beginning , middle , and end . Does it make sense and come to a satisfying conclusion ? If a candidate is n't prepared , it wo n't make sense or will skip around . <p> The result is a positive one . It 's easy to think of difficult situations where it was hard to accomplish work , but it can be tough for candidates to recall a time when the ending was positive . A prepared interviewee will share a situation where the end result was positive for them , and wo n't focus too much on the hardships . <p> They are honest . When a candidate is not prepared for these kinds of questions , they may make up a story on the spot . While it can be hard to tell if a candidate is telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the full story . If they 've been honest with you , it should be easy for the candidate to elaborate . <p> They are specific . This goes hand-in-hand with being honest . A well-prepared candidate will be able to go into great detail about the situation , showing that they have a good grasp on the story and thought through their answer before responding . <p> When you implement behavioral interviewing , you 're examining the candidate 's past behaviors to show how they would react in the future at your organization . This kind of interview can help you pick the right candidates that fit into your culture . <p> How does your organization interview potential employees ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Kristin Lowe is a direct hire recruiter for Aureon Staffing , specializing in placing only the top 20 percent of high performing Human Resource , Sales , Accounting and Finance , and Executive Administration professionals with some of the most successful companies in central Iowa . 221978 @qwx1081978 221982 @qwx1081982 221993 @qwx1081993 221994 @qwx1081994

Customer credit card numbers , employee social security numbers and other sensitive personally identifiable information is stolen , resulting in a decrease in consumer confidence . Needless to say , no matter what industry you 're in , information security must be one of your top priorities . <p> Contact centers house massive amounts of company and customer information ; sometimes for one organization and other times for multiple ones . Between employee snafus , hackers and Mother Nature , there are plenty of potential threats to your organization 's sensitive information . So when you 're searching for a contact center solution or partner , it 's critical to understand the processes and procedures surrounding information security in their facilities . Here are four information security must-haves that you should look for : <p> Employee training and security " The last thing you want is to have employees who are in a position to access and misuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , execute confidentiality agreements , ensure building security , and restrict access to sensitive information through various layers of security . During onboarding , employees need to receive proper training on information security processes , expectations and compliance . <p> Limited access to data " Contact center agent and supervisor access to information should differ based on their roles and responsibilities , keeping the number of people exposed to sensitive data to a minimum . The only information the employee should have access to is what they need to do their job . This not only promotes security , but can also help prevent malicious behavior . <p> Risk mitigation " Because of the amount of information that may be available through their networks , contact center employees may often encounter cybersecurity and identity theft threats . The staff needs to be trained to spot and combat these attacks and know how to respond or report the attempt should it happen . <p> Business continuity and disaster recovery plans " No one can predict or prevent when a human or natural disaster will strike , but it 's something all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or business continuity plans can expose protected information if not properly thought through . Does your contact center have a plan in place for when these events should occur ? Be sure to ask how and where information is backed up , how long it will take for the building to come back online after a disaster and what will happen in the time in-between . If a plan is in place , it should be reviewed regularly and tweaked as needed to make sure clients experience little , if any , downtime in the event of a disaster . <p> Ignoring information security can create serious challenges and costs for your organization . Knowing your contact center partner is prepared to take on any threat to your business 's data gives you one less thing to worry about .

That means flexible work hours , working from home , or just the ability to work outside their cubicle for a couple hours . In fact , the International Data Corporation predicts that by 2020 , mobile workers will account for 72 percent of the total U.S. workforce .

The conference is put on by NTCA - The Rural Broadband Association- and NRTC , to focus on the evolution of broadband networks in rural areas and the IP applications that run on them . There were three parts to the conference : transformation , businesses and technical . <p> My panel was titled Achieving the IP Vision- and along with Leo Staurulakis , executive vice president and chairman of JSI Capital Advisors , and Bill Gerski , vice president of sales for Huawei Technologies USA , we discussed how new technologies , business models , and opportunities for collaboration are being leveraged by broadband providers to serve their communities .

There 's been significant transformation in video recently " in terms of what customers are looking for and what 's available , to name a few .

Part of the benefit of our new name is that it does n't limit our services in the minds of anyone who sees the company name . Long before we rebranded , we used the INDATEL Network to deliver services outside the State of Iowa . INDATEL allows us to participate in the Rural Ethernet Exchange , so our fiber is connected among the total 90,000 route miles to provide Ethernet connectivity to rural and metropolitan areas across the country . We also use channel partners to expand our Competitive Local Exchange Carriers ( CLEC ) footprint outside the state . <p> The conference reinforced my previous conclusion ; - that all companies big and small are looking for ways to transform themselves to stay viable .

Have you ever worried that your immediate staffing needs may be too much to handle by yourself ? <p> Sometimes , there 's not enough time in the day to accomplish everything , and the stress may start to build , causing you to worry about your capacity . It could be that you 're trying to find the wrong kind of candidates . This is where a staffing agency may be useful to your organization . They can step in and alleviate the burden of finding qualified candidates for different positions , which allows you to get your work done with less stress . <p> When choosing a staffing company , make sure they know how to conduct the following three types of evaluations. <h> 1 .

That means flexible work hours , working from home , or just the ability to work outside their cubicle for a couple hours . In fact , the International Data Corporation predicts that by 2020 , mobile workers will account for 72 percent of the total U.S. workforce . Allowing employees to be mobile workers ( also known as telecommuting ) , whether full-time , one day a week or the occasional afternoon , can help increase productivity and decrease office overhead . <h> What You Can Do to Make Your Workplace More Mobile Friendly <p> Making your workforce more mobile friendly does n't have to mean completely re-hauling your business structure . There are many individual factors that go into adapting your workplace for the mobile era , and they can be grouped into three categories : <p> Technology " Having the right technology goes a long way . This may include a combination of remote access software and cloud-based systems such as Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it easier for employees to collaborate and communicate even when they 're not in the room . - Reliable Internet services with the proper amount of bandwidth will be critical to allowing your remote staff to work efficiently . Also , the right technology plays a significant role in ensuring your organization meets industry data regulations and can maintain security . <p> Communication " Just because someone works outside the building does n't mean that communication should drop off . If anything , having multiple ways to talk to a coworker becomes more important . Phones , email and instant messaging " and the occasional web meeting ( even better with video ) , make it easier to keep all employees in all locations on the same page . The right communication methods and tools will enable your remote staff to still be effective at building relationships with coworkers they do n't see every day and ca n't catch up with over lunch or in the break room . <p> Workplace Culture " If your company culture is one that encourages work-life balance , moving toward a friendlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage the quality of work and results versus time physically spent in the office .

The benefit for all employees working within one network is that it may be more easily monitored , managed and safeguarded by your IT department or IT provider . While remote access using VPN ( virtual private networks ) can help increase security for off-site workers , there are some additional risks accessing data and systems remotely . The good news is there are many solutions to secure your organization 's data . Also , make sure your organization has defined and documented security policies , approved software applications , and implemented regular data security trainings so employees can spot and report phishing or other malicious scams . <p> For more information on remote workforce solutions , including cloud computing , contact the experts at Aureon Technology- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design a solution that is efficient , secure and built around your organization 's needs . <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... 221988 @qwx1081988 221978 @qwx1081978 221984 @qwx1081984 221985 @qwx1081985 221980 @qwx1081980

Have you ever worried that your immediate staffing needs may be too much to handle by yourself ? <p> Sometimes , there 's not enough time in the day to accomplish everything , and the stress may start to build , causing you to worry about your capacity . It could be that you 're trying to find the wrong kind of candidates . This is where a staffing agency may be useful to your organization . They can step in and alleviate the burden of finding qualified candidates for different positions , which allows you to get your work done with less stress . <p> When choosing a staffing company , make sure they know how to conduct the following three types of evaluations. <h> 1 . IN-DEPTH CANDIDATE EVALUATIONS <p> A competent staffing company should conduct the following types of evaluations when assessing candidates : <p> Evaluation testing . <p> Face-to-face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two employment reference checks . <p> Social Security Verification using E-Verify . <p> After it 's determined that the candidates possess the knowledge , skills , experience , and attitude , they are submitted for review to the client , which is you . <h> 2 . CONDUCT SKILL EVALUATIONS <p> A good staffing company will also evaluate the technical skills of potential by using different programs , such as Prove It ! - by Kenexa- . This kind of software gives staffing companies the power to identify and select the most talented candidates and employees . <p> It also can perform assessments , which ranks candidates as a percentage against a global average and also can discern whether the potential employee has basic , intermediate , or advanced level skills . <h> 3 . BEHAVIORAL EVALUATIONS <p> Evaluating for skills and interviewing are two essential parts of recruiting , but there is another that is necessary for a complete understanding of candidates : behavioral evaluations . <p> One of the most widely used and respected behavioral assessment evaluations is from Innermetrix . They use a combination of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on : <p> What natural talents does he/she have ? <p> Why he/she is motivated to use them ? <p> How does he/she prefer to use them ? <p> The 70-page evaluation offers insight on how your prospective candidates are wired and can be a great management tool after you hire the candidates . <p> These evaluations are important to look for and ask about when considering a staffing company or trying to boost your organization 's recruiting strategies .

They might be too angry , not very talkative , or uncooperative . These situations can be frustrating , and can be detrimental to your employees , your overall customer service , and the customer 's experience . <p> What if I told you that there was a way to better deal with customers and with each other ? <p> That 's the basis of Social Styles- , which is the world 's leading behavioral style model . Founded by the Tracom Group , it 's been used by thousands of organizations around the world to help improve relationships , leadership performance , and sales . <p> There are four unique social styles : Analytical , Amiable , Driving , and Expressive . <h> THE FOUR SOCIAL STYLES <p> Analytical Style- people are thinkers . They need a lot of information before making decisions , so they often ask a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to be right , and their biggest area for growth is making a point to speak their mind . <p> Amiable Style- people are focused on relationships . They openly show emotions and are often seen as friendly and warm . Amiable people need personal security , and struggle at initiating things . <p> Driving Style- people prefer to control their emotions and are often seen as efficient and assertive . Driving people need results , and they are quick to act but slow to listen . <p> Expressive Style- people are creative and enjoy sharing their ideas and perspectives with others . Ultimately , they need personal approval , and thrive off of spontaneity . <h> WORK ON YOURSELF <p> These Social Styles help you understand how to best manage your own attitude and understand why others respond the way they do to a given situation . Armed with this understanding , it allows for people to work more in tune with each other , catering to strengths and avoiding weaknesses . <h> WORK WITH EACH OTHER <p> These four Social Styles aim to help co-workers get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where each person is coming from and how they communicate . This provides value in the contact center world as well , since working together and functioning as a team of agents is imperative for quality customer service . <p> For example : A Driving has a disagreement with an Amiable , because the Driving is acting without listening to the Amiable , and the Amiable has been hiding how they feel about this until now . However , both co-workers know their own Social Style , so they resolve their issue because the Driving takes the time to listen to the Amiable , and the Amiable finally is able to say what they were feeling . <h> WORK WITH CUSTOMERS <p> We are social people . Think about when customers call in , email , or chat with their problems . To resolve their issues , it takes some type of social interaction . Social Styles impact every social interaction and the customer experience as a whole . With an understanding of these Social Styles , it 's easier to identify how customers communicate , how to effectively manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer at ease and give them a great experience . <p> For example : An agent is having an interaction with a customer that is asking question after question , and the agent knows this line of dialogue is not leading to a resolution . As the interaction continues the agent becomes marginally confrontational in an innocent attempt to gain control of the conversation . When the customer does not respond well to this and continues the questions , the agent realizes this could be due to the customer being Analytical Style . By recognizing this , the agent knows to begin answering the questions directly and to provide other context he or she knows will resolve the issue . Understanding the customer 's social style leads to an experience that is aligned with the customer , rather than the company or agent needs. - <p> At the end of the day , it 's all about understanding where people are coming from , being cooperative with each other , and putting yourself in their shoes in a more deliberate way. - <p> This is the kind of insight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact center partner . By understanding and applying the Social Styles across multiple industries and personalities , we become more skilled in our ability to build and execute on a customer experience strategy that is aligned with your company needs and , more importantly , your customer 's needs. - <h> Subscribe <h> Share ... 221989 @qwx1081989 221978 @qwx1081978 221991 @qwx1081991 221981 @qwx1081981 221986 @qwx1081986

@@121230826 @10230826/ <p> Since its inception more than 26 years ago , Merit Resources has been providing HR-centric PEO services for small to mid-sized businesses in Iowa , the Midwest , and other select markets . Based in Des Moines , Iowa , Merit Resources was founded by entrepreneurs who fully understood the challenges associated with growing and managing a business " because they had experienced them . They embraced the bundled package of essential products , services , and risk protections afforded within the PEO model and correctly anticipated that competition and employment complexity would only accelerate , thus fueling growth for the PEO industry . Our history can be segregated in three distinct phases . Each phase has allowed for the opportunity to evaluate , rationalize , refine , and invest in our people , processes , technology , and distribution to assure alignment with growth objectives and strategic direction . <p> Phase 1 : Foundation-Setting " Early Leadership Establishes HR-focused Service Delivery Merit 's early leadership saw the value of high-touch , HR-centric service delivery . While many in the industry took a **27;253;TOOLONG approach through aggregating clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ' compensation , and taxes , Merit found greater opportunity in distinguishing itself through services that allow business owners to attract , retain , and manage top talent while mitigating employment risk . This initial service delivery direction and leadership has been a guiding force in our strategy to this day . <p> Phase 2 : Claiming Values , Purpose , and Perpetuation Planning As the organization has evolved and grown , we have evaluated people , processes , and technology at different thresholds to assure alignment with our strategy , trajectory , and scale demands . Whether it was the business deployment side of the house or the operational side , growth and intentionality in strategic direction was required and will continue to require evaluation and rationalization of those elements . <p> To this point , Merit has relied on an internal sales force , along with client referrals , to drive growth organically . With 5,000 worksite employees ( WSEs ) and 40 corporate staff members serving a concentrated geography in the Midwest , we began to think about how we could best meet the demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to show weaknesses . While staying true to our foundation of solution-oriented HR delivery , we embarked on redefining ourselves " thinking differently about the possibilities was critical to moving forward . This was inspired by our redefined corporate values of Profit , Respect , Innovation , Dedication , and Excellence ( PRIDE ) and our simplified purpose of " Making Employment Easy . " Our purpose was our Lean Six Sigma . In each internal process and interaction with clients and prospects , we began to ask " Was that easy ? " If not , the corrective action was , " Let 's make it easier . " <p> This allowed for process improvements and greater consistency in service delivery , thus creating greater sales confidence , which began to improve sales results . During this phase , we developed a specific vertical market focus " for that specific niche , we separated operations and sales ( not in a separate building , but virtually ) to be fully dedicated to each niche . Today , that vertical represents approximately 40 percent of our total revenue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also began to frame our historic HR-centric service delivery around the elements of the traditional employee lifecycle . <p> Whether you 're Zappos , - Amazon , - or a 30-person small business , you must address talent selection and onboarding , talent relations , talent development , talent management , and talent transitions at some level . Many flavors exist in deploying HR strategy and services , but at their core , each strategy must address and rationalize the elements of the traditional employee lifecycle . Our business development managers ( salespeople ) use the employee lifecycle to navigate the sales process , while our HR business partners use it to manage the client relationship and develop specific service delivery plans . <p> While HR services , both administrative and strategic , are a baseline of our value proposition , we do rely on the administrative , compliance , and cost efficiencies created in our master group medical , ancillary benefits , 401(k) plans , and workers ' compensations programs to augment our HR message . We maintain high-percentage participation from our clients in each of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility and vividly demonstrate to prospects , clients , partners , and vendors our commitment to operational integrity , we chose to become Employer Services Assurance Corporation ( ESAC ) -accredited and workers ' comp and risk management certified by the Certification Institute ( CI ) during this time . Our efforts were rewarded as we grew from approximately 5,000 worksite employees in 2007 to more than 12,500 in 2013 . Our internal staff grew to 90 . While our geographic presence expanded , we maintained our centralized operations center in Des Moines . Again , with growth comes the opportunity to plan , evaluate , and anticipate both the internal business demands into the future and the market demands . The ownership , the Board of Directors , and I began to ask , " How do we assure and plan for the successful perpetuation of the organization ? " <p> Phase 3 : Business Perpetuation , Collaboration , and Continuous Improvement Watching the growing complexity of federal regulation , specifically the impact of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , along with rapid innovation in the delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsourcing , and growing maturing and market acceptance of the PEO model , we chose to explore options to further accelerate growth , invest in technology , and perpetuate the business . <p> For some time , we believed our evolutionary path was to not only be a provider of HR solutions , but to also use the partnership and connectivity created under the PEO relationship to offer expanded business solutions . This process took us down several paths ( i.e. , we kissed a bunch of frogs ) until we found an organization that shared and complemented that vision . <p> In April of 2013 , Iowa Network Services , an Iowa-based telecommunications solutions provider , acquired Merit . The result of this acquisition aligned Merit with an organization rich in culture and shared core values , and it was also the partnership needed to advance several key initiatives . We are now part of a family of companies that provides outsourced talent , technology , telecommunications , and in-bound call support solutions . We are excited to offer this unique palette of solutions to address the talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The family of companies is headquartered in Des Moines and has 750 corporate employees serving more than 5,000 enterprise clients , primarily focused in the Midwest , but with a national presence . <p> Today , we are fueled by increased resources to capitalize on opportunities at an accelerated pace . Merit Resources alone serves more than 600 clients and 15,000 worksite employees . Our growth and evolution call for continued evaluation and refinement . The next several years will be dedicated to investments in technology , organic distribution channels , and select merger/acquisition opportunities . As we continue to evolve , our focus remains on customer intimacy , HR-centric service delivery , and providing a diversified portfolio of solutions to meet our clients ' needs . <p> Joel D.

@@121230827 @10230827/ 221979 @qwx1081979 <h> How Do You Know if HR Outsourcing is the Right Model for You ? <p> As employment continues to grow in complexity , risk and importance , the role of a human resources department continues to evolve to include more and more complex functions . For a growing number of workplaces , HR is no longer a single , physical place that an employee can visit to pick up a form , ask a question or lodge a complaint . <p> Increasingly , HR departments need the financial , marketing , risk management and analytical skills to help lead their organization in a strategic , forward-thinking way . That is why more organizations , small and large , are beginning to turn to outsourced HR to help manage those challenges , so they can instead focus on their core business . So how do you know if HR outsourcing is right for your organization ? <p> The first step is identifying the two main types of outsourced HR solutions and their differences . <p> Professional Employer Organizations ( PEOs ) , operate under a model called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your employees for insurance and tax purposes . Your organization maintains day-to-day independence , but the PEO can handle all the aspects of your HR department . PEOs also generally have access to better insurance programs and rates- so that small businesses can offer competitive benefits packages , which are great tools for attracting top talent . PEOs can also work alongside office managers to help with recruiting , applicant tracking and onboarding , along with offering professional development programs . Many PEOs are accrediated and have financial assurance programs to confirm the PEO 's financial reliability and compliance with regulatory rules and industry best practices. - <p> Another option is to take the Administrative Service- Offering ( ASO ) route , which does n't use a co-employment model . Think of this as more of an a la carte option . In this arrangement , the outsourced company can still provide services such as payroll , benefits administration and workers ' compensation , but you make all of the final decisions while also assuming the liability risks . <p> The employment model that works best for your business simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the use of a PEO- makes the most sense for businesses that are looking for alternatives to hiring a- full-time human resources staff or do n't have the time to dedicate to the administrative responsibilities of HR . ASOs are often used by larger companies to help supplement internal HR staff and take on tasks that the client does n't have the bandwidth or expertise to handle themselves. - <p> Both models offer a significant amount of value to employers of all sizes , including : <p> Lessened administrative burden. - When you do n't have to spend your time focusing on tasks like payroll and benefits administration , it frees up hours to focus on running your business . <p> Fewer mistakes. - For many small businesses , the rules and compliance issues surrounding payroll , benefits and tax reporting are often complex and outside their expertise . It 's an outsourced HR partner 's job- to make sure nothing falls through the cracks . <p> Whatever you decide , you should always make sure that you 're looking for a partner in the process , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance are becoming massive industries in and of themselves , so you should make sure you are partnering with a trusted partner who will help you navigate these complexities and look out for your best interests , not just their bottom line .

@@121230828 @10230828/ 221979 @qwx1081979 <h> Closing the Workplace Generation Gap with Generosity <p> An older colleague of mine once remarked to me that as he neared the traditional retirement age of 65 , he was actually enjoying the freedom to work more than he was looking forward to the freedom from work . As older workers remain in the workforce longer than in years past , and work well past that traditional 65 benchmark , the office age gap continues to widen . For the first time , companies are experiencing four generations in the workplace all at once , which presents its own unique set of challenges and opportunities . <p> For the Traditionalists born before 1946 , meaning they lived through WWII " the respect is earned . Baby Boomers were active in civil rights and do n't believe in the need for rewards . Generation X strive on independence and like to do their own thing without being micromanaged . And Generation Y , also known as the Millennials , wo n't ever remember life without the Internet and tend to prefer groupthink , while valuing culture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindsets , skillsets and views on things like work ethic and loyalty . So the question then becomes : how do you reconcile all of these different attitudes , break down the silos , debunk the common generational myths and leverage each one 's strengths for the greater good ? To do a deep dive into the complexities of those relationships probably requires a book rather than a blog post , but here are a few simple steps that will get you started on the road to creating an engaged , productive team and will help draw a finish line , not battle lines . <p> Leverage each skill:With four generations in the workforce , there are many unique skills to be shared and learned . It 's just a matter of helping to facilitate that process . Management needs to encourage different departments and positions to make concerted efforts to share their knowledge , whether it 's through lunch and learns , informal job shadowing or team building exercises . <p> For example , tech savvy Millennials can help the older generation become more comfortable with new technologies through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more institutional knowledge that they can pass on to the younger set , along with teaching the soft skills that they 've learned over the years through trial and error , so that the younger generation can avoid some of their mistakes . This also helps with succession planning when an older worker leaves . Each generation has something to teach the other . Instead of cringing at four generations in one workplace , take advantage of the fact that you have so much knowledge under one roof and spread the wealth . <p> Redefine rewards for each generation : Each generation has its own set of values and style that help keep them motivated and happy at work . Instead of trying to have a one-size-fits-all approach to motivation , it 's important to recognize these differences and tailor the environment accordingly . This might mean redefining what a promotion looks like for the younger generations , in order for them to feel like their career is still moving along , and they 're not just in a holding pattern until someone finally retires . That could mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that big jump . And while the older generation values their title and recognition , for the Generation X , it might be something as simple as giving them more freedom with work life balance . Or for Millennials , giving them meaningful work and holding them accountable for it . Regardless of the different tactics and messages used to motivate , the most important thing is that performance be measured equally and fairly , regardless of age . <p> Attitude is everything:Rather than the focus solely on skills and experience , try searching for workers who display certain behaviors or attitudes . No matter the age , you can always teach a skillset . With that said , it is essential to target what ca n't be changed : attitude . To create a relaxed and successful environment , find co-workers who will blend well together rather than just hiring the person with impressive resume . A conversational company setting allows for a more comfortable environment for each worker to share ideas and give input , no matter the generation gap . <p> With simple exercises and strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , big happy family , spanning multiple generations . Take advantage of the opportunity , rather than stressing over the obstacles . With the right employees and attitude , the generation gap will close from generosity . <h> Subscribe <h> Share ... <p> Matt Nuetzman is Director of Business Development at Aureon HR where he has worked since 2012 .

For many organizations , you also use it to promote your products or services . So it comes as no surprise that your customers also use social media to share their feedback about you , whether positive or negative . Better yet , these platforms do n't have typical office hours , so even though you leave your desk for the day , consumers still expect a timely response to their questions and concerns . <p> Managing social channels can be a challenge for many organizations. - In some cases it 's an issue of workload management where this role competes with other priorities. - In other cases it is more about a lack of understanding and knowledge of how to listen and engage with these channels in a way that does not seem too intrusive but also ensures your brand integrity is maintained. - - Regardless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked. - - Your customers are going to communicate about your company using these channels whether you pay attention or not .

Consider this : 81 percent of Americans check their friends ' social media posts for help making purchasing decisions , and 53 percent of Twitter users recommend companies or products on the platform , according to Spredfast .

This is where the moderation ( versus just monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion , answering a question or just engaging with a happy customer , these interactions make an impact . Social media moderation does n't replace traditional customer service , but it certainly enhances it . <p> Consumer sentiment around your brand . Monitoring what people are saying about your organization on social media is an easy way to gain an understanding of how your brand is perceived . It can uncover areas you may need to address or work on , and it can highlight what it is about your products or services that people love . This can also alert you to potential issues and allow you to proactively jump in to the conversation when needed . <p> User-generated content . If your organization asks for users to share or submit their own content to your social media pages , you want to make sure all submissions are desirable .

But whether you 're planting a tree or laying fiber , there 's a long list of things you need to know before you jump in with your shovel to dig . For instance , there are more than 100 billion feet of underground utilities in the U.S. according to data compiled by CGA . Calling 811 allows you to find out where these lines are and helps prevent damages to these utilities such as gas , electric , water and communications ( your internet ! ) . <p> Here are five things you should not do when it comes time to dig . <p> DO N'T forget to call 811 before starting your project.First of all , it 's required by law to call Iowa One Call , or your local 811 organization , at least 48 hours prior to excavating , excluding weekends and holidays . This allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where underground facilities are located so you wo n't damage them . <p> DO N'T lose your job request number.This is a serial number that contains all the information about your call and needs to be kept with any other records for the property or project . Some states only retain the information for a limited amount of time , so plan ahead if you 're going to need that number again . <p> DO N'T ignore the potential depth of underground facilities.When Iowa One Call marks your area , they only note the horizontal location of the facilities , which includes an area of 18 inches on either side . Keep this in mind as you plan short and long term for your project . <p> DO N'T mark all over your site . Leave all the markings to the underground facility personnel , unless you 're doing an excavation . In that case , you should outline your perimeter in white paint , white flags or white stakes . It 'll help minimize confusion . <p> DO N'T underestimate your project.Some utilities are buried only a couple inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to plant bushes or flowers " not just major excavation projects " could potentially cut the utility lines . <p> As an internet provider and organization that has plenty of experience laying fiber and other communications lines , we can assure you that we 've been called out to fix damaged lines in the past . This creates more of a hassle than just calling 811 beforehand , so plan ahead and make the call .

The focus was to provide experts in the field with a forum to discuss challenges , solutions , and best practices in the area of alumni support . We had an excellent group of attendees including representatives from Michigan State , Dartmouth , MIT , Princeton , Northwestern , Notre Dame , Lehigh , and Harvard , to name a few . It was not hard to keep the conversation going as representatives from these institutions share many of the same challenges and are hungry for new ways to provide support to their alumni . We covered a tremendous amount of ground , but mainly focused on four different areas during the two-hour session:1. - - - Defining the scope of alumni support . 2. - - - Common challenges in meeting support requirements . 3. - - - Volunteer support management . 4. - - - The alumni help desk and the impact on engagement . <h> Here are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Institutions are Facing : - Ensuring alumni are trained , have adequate online help available , and feel there is support when needed are common challenges nearly all of our attendees are facing . Keeping volunteers throughout the country informed about the latest technologies available to bolster alumni engagement is daunting to say the least . Keeping online help up to date is a critical , yet complicated and time-consuming task . Providing support for the right applications at the right time is also important when the first two do not provide what the alumni volunteer needs . These challenges can have key personnel at the institution focused on putting out fires rather than thinking of proactive ways to improve the experience for all alumni . <p> Best Practices to Consider : Some institutions include a certification program as part of their training . Volunteers must complete all training and pass certain protocols to make sure they are as qualified as possible . Others have started using videos to provide a more robust and interactive help option . This can be a challenge as well , as the alum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need is one 10-second clip to answer their question . Other institutions are considering extending hours of operation to ensure proper support is available during evenings and weekends when alumni activities are typically in full swing . - <h> Impact on Alumni Engagement : <p> The discussion turned towards the impact that the support desk can have on alumni engagement . One institution 's analysis showed that a very large percentage of alumni contacting the support desk did not have any other form of engagement with the university at all . This opened the eyes of some key staff , uncovering that the support desk is not simply an operating entity , but can be viewed as a key opportunity to move a disinterested alum to a higher level of engagement .

Or so it would seem , as the impact of technology and big data has affected every sector of business , including contact centers . It 's not just about answering phones and solving the problem at hand ( although that 's still part of it ) . It 's about forming lasting relationships with the customer and establishing brand loyalty . And often times , it 's what happens off the phone that informs what needs to happen on the phone going forward . Here are three contact center trends that are becoming more and more prevalent . <h> Moving Into the Cloud <p> According to a recent study by IDG Enterprise , 48 percent of enterprises are moving to the cloud to replace on premise , legacy technology , and 25 percent of total IT budgets will be allocated to cloud computing in 2016 . Whereas cloud security used to be a primary concern for many businesses , the perception is slowly changing to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of using cloud-based services . <p> For contact centers , cloud technology allows them to become more agile , scalable and able to react to changes in customer behavior faster , in order to gain a competitive advantage . It means they can scale back or add agents easily . Instead of having to build , assimilate and oversee on premise hardware , they can use integrated cloud solutions and make changes without using developers . This allows for greater growth within the contact center by increasing the level of service that companies are able to offer . According to recent surveys , 18% of contact centers moved to a cloud-based solution by the end of 2015 . Expect those numbers to continue to rise as cloud technology becomes the preferred platform going forward . <h> The Need for Omni-Channel Support <p> It used to be , if you had a problem or a question about a service , you 'd just pick up the phone . Today , customers are increasingly turning to electronic forms of communication as an alternative , from email to social media to live chats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 95 percent of customers use more than one channel to contact customer support and 55 percent of customers now prefer automated self-services ; a number that has doubled over the past five years . <p> And yet , it 's not enough to just offer the customer more than one way to reach out and engage with the brand . These different channels need to integrate seamlessly and intuitively not only with each other , but also the customer support model . - If a brand offers a mobile app , but it does n't offer a practical way to engage with customer service , it 's a missed opportunity . Engaging customers in a personalized way across channels allows for a deeper connection and increased loyalty within customer relationships . <h> Big Data , Big Results <p> Today , there are more advanced analytics , numbers and customer data than ever before . With social media , clickstream data and behavioral analytics , there is a whole new world of data and customer insights out there . The key is making sense of it all . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the data can become overwhelming and lack clarity . <p> Going forward , businesses will look to marry customer feedback with more structured analytics , in order to best address the needs of the customer . This means thinking more strategically and becoming more forward thinking in order to understand the voice of the customer and create a customer experience that mirrors their needs ; anticipating not only what the customer 's needs are now , but using the data to anticipate future needs . <p> Consider this : $41 billion is lost by US companies each year following a bad customer experience . That 's one analytic no one is aspiring towards . Customer experience has a tangible impact on our business success. - Staying on top of today 's trends , as well as key emerging ones , is a critical @qwx1081991 221981 @qwx1081981 221986 @qwx1081986

Instead , you 're usually worried about hiring employees , growing your organization , and making a profit . <p> Nevertheless , research from the 2017 NSBA Small Business Regulations Survey reveals that within the first year , small-business owners start to realize the costs and headaches associated with regulations . With the burden of regulations weighing down on the owner , it can impact the growth of the organization and hinder business investments . Read on to find out just how much of an impact regulations truly have . <h> A ROUGH START <p> Starting a business is no easy feat , and regulations make it even more difficult for small-business owners . When small-business owners were asked how big a concern they thought regulatory costs and compliance were when they started their business , here 's what they said : <p> 23 percent said it was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concern . <p> 31 percent said it was not a very big concern . <p> 20 percent said it was n't a concern at all . <p> In fact , more than half of small businesses said they became worried about regulations within the first year of business . <p> Perhaps the most frightening statistic is how much money start-ups have to pay to comply with all the regulations . On overage , the regulatory start-up costs for small businesses is $83,019.23 . That 's a lot of money for a brand-new organization to have to shell out in their first year . <h> GROWING PAINS <p> The impact of regulations goes beyond the wallet ; it also attacks organizations ' ability to grow and invest . <p> 53 percent of small businesses said regulations have made businesses hold off on implementing growth strategies , 52 percent said regulations have made them hold off on hiring new employees , and 50 percent said regulations have made them hold off on giving salary increases . <p> The uncertainty of regulations also has been a hindrance to the growth and expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very significant impact , 37 percent said the expectation of new regulations make a very significant impact , and 29 percent said existing regulations make a very significant impact . <h> A NECESSARY EVIL <p> Even though dealing and complying with regulations is time-consuming , expensive , and sometimes frustrating , it 's a necessary part of running a successful organization . It may not be the most fun way to spend your valuable time and money , but it is something that must be accomplished to avoid major fines . While some regulations are seen as necessary and helpful , they could be doing more harm than good in the eyes of business owners . 60 percent of small-business owners believe that regulations covering their industries are not necessary , which means they either do n't see how they are helpful , or there are too many regulations for small businesses to comply with .

There 's been a lot of talk about Baby Boomers , Gen X 's , and millennials , but there has n't been much discussion yet about the latest generation to enter the workforce : Gen Z. <p> You need to understand who Gen Zs are , how they think , what they look for in a job , and how to accommodate for them , so that you can effectively recruit and retain them . <p> As we continue to unpack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they are .

Since Gen Z grew up in the digital world , their preferred communication method is also digital , through social media , texting , and applications . This means that organizations need to be actively engaging potential candidates on social media , and have a strong brand presence on all social media platforms . It also requires organizations to offer several ways for employees to interact , not just face-to-face interactions . <p> They 're problem solvers.Like the millennials before them , Gen Z likes to solve things on their own . Because they 're so familiar with technology , when something goes wrong , they try everything they can to fix it . This is an appealing trait , and shows that they 're independent and capable of solving complex issues on their own . However , they may not always follow standard protocols or utilize your help desk services . <p> They 're hard workers.Unlike the millennials who wanted a good work-life balance , 58 percent of Gen Zs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nights and weekends . On top of that , they also have an entrepreneurial spirit , as 17 percent said they want to start their own business . Starting a business takes a lot of time and effort , and Gen Z have the dedication and the work ethic to work hard for what they want . <p> They 're willing to relocate.According to Small Business Trends , 74 percent of Gen Zs are willing to relocate for a job . This bodes well for organizations trying to recruit talent out of state . However , it also reveals that Gen Zs are n't as attached to where they live or where they currently are . <h> WHAT DO THEY WANT IN A JOB ? <p> Enabling Gen Zs to succeed at work starts with offering what they want and need . To do this , you have to know what they look for in a job and what they want out of their career . Let 's take a look at the following areas . <p> They want quality health benefits . Health insurance is Gen Z 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even over salary and a qualified boss . In today 's world where health insurance can be expensive and uncertain , it makes sense that Gen Zs would seek this traditional benefit over everything else . <p> They want to make an impact.Gen Zs want to work somewhere they can make a difference and contribute to the greater good . Monster reports that 74 percent believe their jobs should have more meaning than just making money . Make sure that your organization has a clear vision that impacts the world and clearly shows how employees can contribute to the overall goal . <p> They want growth , change , and promotions.Gen Zs are used to change , and are able to adapt quickly . They expect their workplace to evolve regularly , and are n't bothered by sudden changes in locations or responsibilities . They also have clear goals of what they want their career to be , and want the opportunity to grow and advance quickly . Showing Gen Z employees a clear path for advancement is a good way to keep them engaged and motivated . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to use technology at work . Monster reveals 57 percent of Gen Zs think technology makes them more productive , and 45 percent believe it makes them mobile . Additionally , 39 percent think smartphones are necessary . This reliance on technology proves that business mobility and cloud applications are n't going anywhere , and will be relied on even more in the future . <p> They seek a two-way relationship with their manager.Like millennials , Gen Zs need constant feedback and interaction with their boss . They want their managers to be honest and transparent , and they prefer regular meetings over annual reviews . <p> They want transparency and equality . Gen Zs are bold , and they stand for what they believe in . What they believe in is equality , and if people are n't being treated equally , then they will fight against it . This socially aware generation does n't sweep anything under the rug , and will stand for what they think is right at work . To appeal to this aspect , work on building a strong culture that promotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a strong brand.Before they go into an interview , it 's pretty much a given that a Gen Z candidate will look up your organization on Google and social media . They 're looking for organizations that have a strong brand presence that is consistent across all platforms , and clearly states who they are and what they do . <p> These seven areas give an overview of what Gen Zs want out of a job and a career , and show they are uniquely different than any other generation so far . <h> HOW CAN YOU PREPARE FOR GEN Z ? <p> This understanding of what Gen Zs want in a job can benefit your organization 's recruiting and retention strategies , which can happen in a number of ways as you seek to prepare for Gen Zs in the workplace . <p> Work on implementing high quality benefits that give employees a wide variety of reliable and affordable health options . Additionally , you should also ensure that you 're offering competitive salaries . Both of these areas will increase your attractiveness to Gen Zs and top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development courses and skills training , to allow Gen Zs to continue to improve themselves and stay engaged in your organization . Engagement can also be improved by promoting internally , communicating , and providing that clear career path . It should be easy and clear how an employee can sign up for courses , what courses he/she should take , and the expectations for promotion and career development . <p> Fostering a culture of collaboration and two-way relationships can also lead to engaged and satisfied Gen Zs . Have managers meet on a weekly basis with their employees , so they can develop trust and respect , and allow for a consistent flow of feedback . <p> To satisfy the Gen Zs need for technology , install and implement business mobility technologies that allow employees to work remotely and access email and other functions on their smart phones or tablets . Deploy technology platforms to onboard them , monitor their benefits , and allow them access to perks offered by the organization . <p> When it comes to your brand , ensure that you have a consistent message and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media channels . Since Gen Zs are so digital , it can also be beneficial to reach them through online video ads that showcase your organization and open positions . <h> DO N'T SLEEP ON GEN Z <p> With this solid understanding of who Gen Zs are , what they need in a job , and how you can prepare for them , adopting a strategy that includes these things will lead to your organization being able to effectively attract promising Gen Zs and keep them engaged . They may not be applying for your open positions right now , but it takes time to change your organization 's culture and processes . As an organization , you can prepare for Gen Z now , so that you stand out when they hit the job market . <p> However , it 's not just Gen Z that you have to try and attract and retain . With so many generations in the workforce , it can be difficult to appeal to all of them at once . To help with this , create more options , not barriers and restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you can improve your chances of attracting top talent in every generation . <p> With all of this in mind , it 's important to remember that everyone is different . Not every Gen Z person fits into these characteristics , so do n't assume that everyone is the same . It 's best to have an open mind about these things , and know that some wo n't follow these trends . <p> Does your organization have an active strategy to attract the Gen Z audience ? <h> Subscribe 221992 @qwx1081992 <p> First Name <p> Last Name <p> Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> As SVP of Corporate HR for Aureon and SVP of Aureon Staffing , Smith is responsible for developing and implementing world-class strategic and operational human resource systems .

On top of the useless emails we get , there 's also malicious activity , such as malware attacks or phishing , which try to trick you into clicking on fraudulent content . <p> What does this mean ?

@@121230888 @10230888/ <p> While it is extremely important to have an effective password policy in place for all employees , this should n't be your only defense . It 's best if a strong password is only the first layer of your organization 's security , not the only one . That way , even if one employee makes a password mistake , your organization is still protected . Here are some additional ways beyond the password that your organization can implement . <h> MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT <p> In addition to what we covered in our previous post , another important place to protect when it comes to passwords and your organization 's security is your employees ' mobile devices . At a basic level , the goal of mobile device management is to protect the data on employee devices . This reduces the risk of a mobile device being compromised , and can also help secure your data in the rare instance it does become compromised . Most mobile device management systems allow you to manage the users ' devices , establish a user policy , and wipe or reset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more organizations are adopting a Bring Your Own Device ( BYOD ) mentality , where the employee uses their own tablets , smartphones , and laptops . While this can save the organization money , it also comes with its own set of challenges . One big issue surrounding BYOD " and personal technology as a whole " has to do with privacy and security . Whether it 's through apps , training , or just well-worded policies , you need to ensure that your employees are n't sharing confidential information about your business or your customers . Likewise , you should have a plan in place that preserves employee privacy and does n't leave your company liable to charges that you 're using technology intrusively . This goes hand-in-hand with mobile device management , and can benefit your organization in the long run ( especially if an issue ever does occur ) . <h> DATA LOSS PREVENTION <p> Another layer of protection can be added with a data loss prevention strategy . A data loss prevention strategy should include prohibiting employees from sharing , uploading , or emailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certain applications can help enforce these measures . <p> In addition , having specific locations for storing sensitive data can help ensure your data is protected where it 's supposed to be . <h> MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION <p> Previously , we talked briefly about Two-Factor Authentication , but it 's helpful to know specific ways that organizations implement another layer of authentication . Here are some common ones : <p> Receiving a text message , phone call , or email with an access code . <p> Having to type in the associated phone number or email . <p> Answering security questions . <p> Choosing the correct image . <p> Typing in a phrase from an image . <p> All of these features can be instrumental in ensuring peace of mind when it comes to securing your organization 's data .

Without the best hires , your business will never reach maximum potential . There are many tactics that focus on successfully recruiting and hiring the employees who will take your business to the next level . Our HR professionals broke the process down into five important and simple steps for companies who are on the hunt to hire : <p> Consider Past Candidates : It is crucial to build relationships and follow up with each prospect candidate , even if you do n't hire them the first time around . If a possible candidate is n't the right fit for the current position but a perfect fit for the company , maintain your relationship with her for future job possibilities within the company . The more relationships you consistently connect with , the better chance you will have to efficiently fill needed spots with a quality candidate . <p> Social Networking Sites : Searches on professional social networking sites like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find quality prospects . According to US News , 90% of recruiters use Linkedin to search , contact and vet candidates. - With the breadth of information that can be included on a candidate 's LinkedIn page , employers have the ability to learn about the prospect before they spend time on an in-person interview . This not only saves your company time and money , but results in a swift hiring process . <p> Importance of Culture : - According to a survey completed by Corporate Responsibility Magazine , 75 percent of Americans would not work for a company with a bad reputation even if they were unemployed . The importance of company culture is undeniable . The numbers outside of the company do n't mean anything unless there is a positive , internal culture . Word of mouth about internal culture is important , but it is also essential in job descriptions . Make it routine to use vibrant language to explain open jobs . When you portray excitement about a position , prospective candidates will be excited , too . <p> Website Prominence : Recruiting is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates , they are most likely exploring your company , too .

Post about projects and accomplishments the company has achieved together , which shows success and teamwork " two major characteristics every job seeker wants to see . Make sure your company 's website has a careers page that can house this type of information , as well as the positions you have open at any given time . <p> Employee Referrals : Not only do internal referrals reflect a positive outlooks on company culture , but they also frequently result in prospects who are a good fit with the characteristics of your organization . To receive more referrals from employees , create an incentive program that rewards them for referrals that results in a new hire .

I recently attended the IOT Evolution Expo in Las Vegas and it was more than just bright lights , shows , and gambling .

Now , more than ever , wireless security is important , as hackers are frequently trying to access and steal organizations ' private information . <h> THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 'S TIPS <p> Turn the encryption on . Wireless routers often come out of the box with the encryption feature disabled , so be sure to check that encryption is turned on shortly after you or your service provider installs the router. - <p> Change the network 's default network name , also known as its service set identifier or " SSID. " - When a computer with a wireless connection searches for and displays the wireless networks nearby , it lists each network that publicly broadcasts its SSID . Manufacturers usually give all of their wireless routers a default SSID , which is often the company 's name . It is a good practice to change your network 's SSID , but to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of family members . <p> Change the network 's default password . Most wireless routers come with preset passwords for administering a device 's settings ( this is different from the password used to access the wireless network itself ) . Unauthorized users may be familiar with the default passwords , so it is important to change the router device 's password as soon as it is installed . Again , longer passwords made up of a combination of letters , numbers , and symbols are more secure . <h> FOUR MORE TIPS <p> The unidirectional nature of Wi-Fi signals necessitates the use of encryption to prevent neighbors or malicious parties from spying on your online activities . Even though the option is still available for legacy reasons , avoid WEP encryption as it can be cracked in minutes. - Use only WPA2 , which introduces a new AES-based encryption for better security over WPA .

But circulating the static passphrase to everyone is bad security. - Instead , set up a separate wireless network under a second SSID , a feature supported by an increasing number of wireless routers .

Disallowing administrative access from the wireless network should keep any successful hacker from wreaking further havoc by making changes to the configuration of your Wi-Fi router .

But the added protection is worth the hassle . <p> Though this is n't meant as an exhaustive guide to protect yourself against all possible security risks of a Wi-Fi network , adhering to the above tips should make you significantly safer .

Without the best hires , your business will never reach maximum potential . There are many tactics that focus on successfully recruiting and hiring the employees who will take your business to the next level . Our HR professionals broke the process down into five important and simple steps for companies who are on the hunt to hire : <p> Consider Past Candidates : It is crucial to build relationships and follow up with each prospect candidate , even if you do n't hire them the first time around . If a possible candidate is n't the right fit for the current position but a perfect fit for the company , maintain your relationship with her for future job possibilities within the company . The more relationships you consistently connect with , the better chance you will have to efficiently fill needed spots with a quality candidate . <p> Social Networking Sites : Searches on professional social networking sites like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find quality prospects . According to US News , 90% of recruiters use Linkedin to search , contact and vet candidates. - With the breadth of information that can be included on a candidate 's LinkedIn page , employers have the ability to learn about the prospect before they spend time on an in-person interview . This not only saves your company time and money , but results in a swift hiring process . <p> Importance of Culture : - According to a survey completed by Corporate Responsibility Magazine , 75 percent of Americans would not work for a company with a bad reputation even if they were unemployed . The importance of company culture is undeniable . The numbers outside of the company do n't mean anything unless there is a positive , internal culture . Word of mouth about internal culture is important , but it is also essential in job descriptions . Make it routine to use vibrant language to explain open jobs . When you portray excitement about a position , prospective candidates will be excited , too . <p> Website Prominence : Recruiting is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates , they are most likely exploring your company , too . It is important for you to attractively portray your company online . Make it a recruiting goal to have potential candidates leave your website on a mission to work for your company , just like they should feel after an in-person interview . Post about projects and accomplishments the company has achieved together , which shows success and teamwork " two major characteristics every job seeker wants to see . Make sure your company 's website has a careers page that can house this type of information , as well as the positions you have open at any given time . <p> Employee Referrals : Not only do internal referrals reflect a positive outlooks on company culture , but they also frequently result in prospects who are a good fit with the characteristics of your organization . To receive more referrals from employees , create an incentive program that rewards them for referrals that results in a new hire . Whether the reward is a monetary compensation or extra vacation day , this type of program makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with welcoming a new employee to your company . <p> Recruiting top talent is only the beginning of the story .

Having said that , from time to time my kids will mention something I have not heard of and pique my curiosity . Why ? Because they are the first to adopt the newest trendsor at least are more curious than I am on certain things . Oftentimes , when I consider this , I 'm thinking about how it impacts me as a consumer , but I also think about it in terms of how it relates to the professional side of things . Take Instagram for example . Teens ( and younger ) were the first to try out the app , and made it into a global phenomenon . Businesses , on the other hand , were slow to catch on , and have only recently begun to use it . <p> As our world becomes more reliant on the internet and social media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including contact centers . These morph into preferences in how we like to communicate as customers , such as email , self-service , video chat , and social media . <h> WHAT 'S POPULAR <p> Fonolo , a leading provider in cloud-based call-back solutions , determined the most popular ways that consumers like to communicate . Here are their results : <p> Website : 85 percent <p> Call Center : 75 percent <p> Email : 65 percent <p> Live Chat : 58 percent <p> Mobile Web : 32 percent <p> Social Media : 21 percent <p> It 's interesting that website has overtaken call center/phone as the preferred way for consumers to get answers to their questions . However , this should n't be too surprising , as our culture is spending more time on the internet and mobile devices . In fact , Salesforce predicts that mobile app support requests will increase by 38 percent in the next 12 to 18 months . <h> WHAT 'S HERE AND NOW <p> Since websites are the first thing that many consumers turn to , it 's vital for organizations to integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way for consumers to get their problems resolved . While a website is a good starting point for the consumer , it may not be able to solve their issue . Organizations need multi-channel support , which gives them the ability to easily guide the consumer from their website to a phone call , email , or live chat , etc. , whichever is the consumer 's preferred way to communicate . Furthermore , the need for omni-channel support has become a prevalent consideration as well . Consumers may not only want to use multiple channels but , in fact , may use several of them during the same inquiry . For example , I commonly find myself going to a website , and then calling to get support on something that ca n't be resolved online . While I 'm on the phone with the agent , we work together with the online components to make sure my experience is as enriched as possible . This is the omni-channel experience , where a consumer is demanding multiple channels at the same time. - <p> This support model is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex as consumers demand additional ways to solve any inquiry they have. - <h> WHAT 'S AHEAD <p> A major preference that 's on the rise is self-service . People want their problem resolved as quickly and painlessly as possible , and sometimes that means looking for a way to solve it themselves . Salesforce ran a report that determined that 72 percent of people think using self-service features is a fast and easy way to solve their issue . Another statistic from Microsoft states that 90 percent of customers now expect self-service support , and 60 percent have a more positive view on an organization if their self-service support is mobile-responsive . <p> As demand for self-service applications rises , it is important to ensure the other channels are integrated into that experience , so that a customer can get help when needed. - There needs to be representatives managing it and making sure that customers are getting their problems resolved . Another important statistic to consider is that 75 percent of users think that calling is still the most effective way to get a quick response ( New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's gaining traction , talking over the phone is still the main way that customers get their issues resolved . This is likely to transition from phone to chat , SMS , and social over time but , either way , the consumer will still demand personalized support when needed. - <p> The bottom line is that customers want support when they want it and in the fashion they choose at that moment . In this sea of ever-changing contact preferences , it is important to pull from your own experiences and have trusted advisors to help ensure your customer experience is ready for the customer preferences of today and tomorrow . Working with a company who understands the nuances of customer experience management in today 's omni-channel environment is something to consider as a solid way to ensure your strategy has all the right parts. - These organizations can help add to your own experiences and may even be a good option to consider when you decide how to execute on the omni-channel approach , so that it stays top of mind and scales appropriately as needed. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer service could change to accommodate @qwx1081991 221981 @qwx1081981 221986 @qwx1081986

However , it is now the fastest-growing method for transporting high bandwidth data worldwide because fiber optic cabling works very well for transmitting bandwidth-heavy applications , spanning long distances and ensuring the integrity and network security of the transported data . These inherent characteristics make optical fiber the ideal platform for wide area networks ( WANs ) , broadband Internet connectivity , optical Ethernet and all other next-generation networking methods such as multiprotocol label switching ( MPLS ) and virtual private LAN ( VPLS ) technologies . <p> In other words , it 's the fast , flexible and scalable way to connect businesses to vendors , customers and other digital resources. - <p> Here are the key advantages of fiber optic networks : <p> 1 . Extremely High Bandwidth <p> No other cable-based data transmission medium offers the bandwidth capability of fiber optics . The capacity of any type of transmission cable increases with frequency . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , copper cabling has a bandwidth capability of a few MHz . By contrast , fiber optic cabling has a bandwidth capability of 400MHz or greater . This enables fiber optics to provide data transmission performance up to 100 Gbps with the hardware that is now available , and allows for easier bandwidth upgrades in the future . <p> - While fiber optic cabling does not have infinite bandwidth , it 's certainly superior to copper cabling . It 's true that 10 Gbps copper applications are on the market ; but copper can only transmit 10 Gbps for about 50 feet over high-cost copper wire " a distance that 's practical only within the confines of a data center . While Ethernet-over-Copper ( EoC ) data solutions are considered by some to be the way of the future , these applications are not as reliable and only deliver about 15 to 20 Mbps of actual bandwidth . <p> 2 . Greater Transmission Distances <p> Fiber optic cabling allows data to be sent far greater distances than copper cabling and performs this without nearly as many repeater pieces of gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the copper path to regenerate the signal . <p> The higher the bandwidth needed , the greater the number of repeaters that are required in the copper path ; this can prove to be very costly . With fiber optics , conventional electrical data signals are converted into a modulated light beam ( laser ) , introduced into the cable and transported via a very , very small diameter glass or plastic optical fiber to a receiver that coverts light back into electrical signals . This process allows the data to be sent greater distances . In fact , as custom fiber optics have advanced over time , new long-reach lasers have been developed that reduce the number of regeneration sites even further . So fiber optics allow transmission of a signal over greater distances at a much lower cost than copper so rural businesses have better bandwidth options , and organizations with multiple offices can take advantage of the same network . <p> 3 . Easily Scalable Bandwidth <p> Thanks to recent generations of fiber optic cabling , your provider can increase bandwidth capacity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the need to replace the fiber . Optical technology called Dense Wave Division Multiplexing ( DWDM ) has the ability to turn on multiple light streams that travel down the same optical fiber , which greatly increases the bandwidth carrying capacity . By contrast , high bandwidth copper technology usually requires that the old copper cabling be replaced with higher performance copper cabling . This means fiber optics can easily allow your network to grow as your business grows , without huge capital expense of new copper cabling . <p> Fiber optic cabling is an extremely secure transmission medium since there is no way to detect the data being transmitted by listening in ' to the electromagnetic signal , as is possible with traditional copper transmissions .

It is important for your employees to know what the risks and implications are , if a data breach was to occur . <p> A data security policy should be used to define approved methods to securely transfer or share data and define restricted methods to help stop the use of unsupported or unsafe services and applications . Policies should be very specific on what is acceptable and not acceptable for all employees . They should include information about email policies , mobile devices , social networking , and internet usage . These policies should be documented , communicated ( multiple times ) , enforced , and periodically reviewed and updated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emailing it to your employees . Set up meetings and/or training sessions to regularly educate them about the reality of data security , and their role in keeping information safe. - <h> UNDERSTAND PHYSICAL AND CYBERSECURITY CONTROLS <p> If your organization is considering moving to a cloud or hosted service for data storage , data backup , or application hosting , it 's important to understand the physical security controls and cybersecurity controls leveraged by the service provider . <p> Physical security controls : Is a badge required to get into the building ? Or even better , a fingerprint ? Are there multiple doors that you have to go through ? Are there cameras ? <p> Along with understanding the different security measures , it 's also necessary to understand the provider 's Service Level Agreements ( SLAs ) for uptime and system availability . In addition , you should understand their policy around data breaches . How do they rectify such an incident ? What does the contract say ? Reading and understanding everything about what the provider is expected to do is important , and can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your business 's data . <h> WHAT IT MEANS TO BE IN THE CLOUD <p> Many virtual hosting platforms offer failover and redundancy options , so if a disaster strikes you can potentially be back up and running within minutes or hours , and without losing important transactions , data , or communications in the meantime . <p> Here are some important data center features to look for when considering offsite hosting options : <p> Controlled building access with 24/7 monitoring . <p> Redundant features , such as backup generators and multiple data connections . <p> Geographic location of the building and the structural design of the building . <p> While the above features are good to use as a guide for selecting a data center , you also need to have a level of trust and faith in the company that owns , manages , and operates the facility . Other best practices to follow include taking a tour of the data center , reviewing the contract terms and SLA documents , and seeking a few references . <p> Have you considered an offsite hosting environment ? <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Email 221990 @qwx1081990 <h> Share ... <p> Scott D.

Overall , businesses both large and small continue to be targeted at increasing rates . However , there are some major companies that have failed to protect themselves , and have had massive amounts of data stolen . <h> YAHOO ! TM <p> One of the attacks that was recently announced was Yahoo ! . A hacker stole information from more than 500 million accounts , making it one of the largest breaches ever . This actually happened back in 2014 , but Yahoo ! just recently made it official by confirming the swelling rumors that started in August . <p> The mysterious hacker stole email addresses , passwords , phone numbers , dates of birth , and answers to security questions . It 's yet to be determined how this happened , but the FBI is looking into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users were hacked . <h> INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ( IRS ) <p> The IRS was another security breach victim this past spring . They announced that hackers stole data that exposed more than 700,000 people , such as Social Security numbers and other personal information . <h> LINKEDINTM <p> Similar to Yahoo ! , a hacker stole information from 167 million LinkedIn accounts back in May and posted the data on the dark web , which acts like an online black market . LinkedIn was also hacked back in 2012 , and had 6.5 million encrypted passwords stolen . <p> The good news : security breaches are preventable .

The CEB reported that 90 percent of employees violate their organization 's cybersecurity policy , and that 's mostly because they do n't know the policy . Communicate and do multiple trainings with them to explain the expectations with data security , so that your employees can be well-equipped and on the lookout for potential attacks . <p> In addition to taking the proper steps to help prevent attacks , companies should also spend time preparing for how they would handle a cybersecurity " crisis " or breach , should something unexpected happen .
