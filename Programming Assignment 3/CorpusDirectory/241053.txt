Two weeks earlier , the shipyard workers had gone out on strike for higher wages to accommodate rising postwar prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the strike on February 6 as the labor press urged unity and orderly protest . City newspapers predicted chaos and condemned the strike as a Communist ( " Red " ) threat to American freedomsa potent and immediate anxiety fueled by the 1917 Communist revolution in Russia . ( Coverage of the strike often shared page-one headlines with news of Communist military activity in Europe . ) On February 11 , the unions voted to end the sympathy strike ; union cohesion was weakening , and the American Federation of Labor had urged the General Strike Committee to end the strike before the labor cause was seriously harmed . Yet the Committee claimed victory in maintaining order and modeling a new form of labor protest . The newspaper coverage in this collection highlights pro- and anti-strike positions that would be repeated through numerous strikes in the decade ; it is compiled in single-page items to facilitate classroom distribution and discussion .

" Struggling to identify his own political stance , Babbitt finds himself caught between his newly adopted liberal views and his business colleagues ' unequivocal condemnation of the strikers .

Appearing from 1907 to 1982 , Mutt and Jeff was one of longest-running comic strips in the U.S. , and by 1916 animated Mutt and Jeff shorts were favorite theater offerings .

Coincidentally , Parliament had begun debating repeal on March 5 , the day of the Boston Massacre . After the repeal , colonial merchants abandoned the non-importation agreements , and commerce with Britain returned to normal .

The Pacifists <p> While religious pacifists strove to live peacefully and often separately in the American coloniesas depicted in the pastoral scene at right of a Moravian settlement in Pennsylvaniatheir principled opposition to war would be harshly challenged during the Revolution . As the colonies mobilized for war , they required able-bodied men to serve in the militias , allowing them to hire substitutes ( who would still have to fulfill their own service ) . But to the pacifist churches , hiring substitutes was still contributing to war and thus unacceptable to God . And beyond direct military service , they struggled to define just what constituted support for the war effort . Could one repair equipment for the army ? pay the fine for refusing to join a militia unit ? close one 's business as required on official days of prayer for the war ? use the state 's paper money issued to fund the war ? The answer often was no , and they supported each other in maintaining fidelity to their beliefs .

What emotions would lead a band of farmers to confront a professional army ? What must it have been like to see your son and those of your neighbors march off to confront the British ? The people of Bedford could have treated the Lexington militiamen as hotheads who deserved what happened to them , or they could have waited for more information .

Thomas Jefferson and John Dickinson tried to encompass the polarities of the Congress in the documents known as the Olive Branch Petition and the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms . The petition , issued on July 5 , was a final plea to King George that affirmed the colonies ' loyalty to Britain and urged him to undo the damage done to their allegiance by the " delusive pretenses , fruitless terrors , and unavailing severities " of the king 's cabinet since 1763 .

Jefferson and Dickinson begin the Declaration with a rather sarcastic slap at Great Britain . If God had meant for the British to hold " unbounded power " over the Americans , at least Parliament could have told them so . They review the colonies ' devoted service to the mother country , ending with an enumeration of the ways in which Great Britain has betrayed colonial loyalty . Yet , Jefferson and Dickinson claim , even in the face of " despotism , " the colonies remained polite and respectful ; in response , the British sent troops .

William Franklin , address to theNew Jersey Assembly , 1775 <p> In the 1770s the term civil war , not revolution , was used to describe the spectre of outright war with Britain . After all , it was a conflict within the British empire , between the mother country and its colonies over internal issues of rights and power . Often lost in a study of the Revolution are the " horrors of civil war " among Americans themselvesamong supporters of independence ( Patriots/Whigs ) , opponents ( Loyalists/Tories ) , and the ambivalent Americans who were angry with Britain but opposed to declaring independence . In this theme , REBELLION , we explore several aspects of these " civil wars " as resistance evolved into full rebellion by the self-declared " free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Crown . " <p> Sections 1-4 consider the civil war between Patriots and Loyalists , focusing on the Loyalist experience at the outbreak of war . For most Loyalists , writes historian Catherine Crary , " Loyalism was an evolutionary and painful process , even as the transfer of allegiance to a new government was not easy for many rebels . " 1 <p> Section 5 views the struggles of religious pacifist groups , primarily in Pennsylvania , as they sought tolerance for their beliefs as conscientious objectors to war . <p> Section 6 examines the debate over slavery at a time when white men , including slaveholders , were demanding their " natural rights " and declaring that " all men are created equal . " <p> Sections 7-8 focus on the critical year of 1776 when many Americans made a final irrevocable transition . They abandoned hope for reconciliation with Britain and embraced the radical goal of independence from Britain . Two documents of inestimable influence encompass this transitionThomas Paine 's Common Sense of January 1776 and the Declaration of Independence of July 1776 .

After the Battle of Lexington and Concord in April 1775 , any toleration for Loyalists vanished . Patriot Committees of Safety required citizens to pledge support for the cause of American independence or be deemed " inimical to the liberties of America . " Violence toward Loyalists increased , leading many to leave the country for Canada , Britain , or the West Indies . " For these British subjects living on the American side of the Atlantic , " writes historian Crary , " the struggle was a bitter civil war with the issue cutting across lines of family , of friendships , of neighbors , and even of husbands and wives .

If you were a Loyalist in America in the 1770s , you tried to explain to yourself and others why your Patriot neighbors were turning the paradise of America into " an endless Hell " by objecting to what was , in your view , the benign , enlightened , and gentle rule of Great Britain . Such sentiments motivated Loyalist Myles Cooper to publish anonymously a 34-page poem in 1775 titled The Patriots of North America , in which he accuses them of committing " treason in mask of liberty .

" Cooper 's rhetoric grows more frenzied as he delivers verse after verse condemning Patriot leaders for their frenzied rhetoric . As such , the poem is a stark example of the hardened political divide in 1775 . Cooper 's satire drips with condescension and disdain , but even so he summons enough sympathy to lament the tragedy of a civil war : <p> In summer 1775 Cooper fled an angry mob to seek refuge on a British ship in New York harbor and soon sailed for England , permanently .

To view the crucial miscegenation scene , we direct you to the 1936 film adaptation that closely recreated the stage production . In the scene , the town sheriff arrives to arrest the interracial couple , Steve and Julie , for violating Mississippi 's anti-miscegenation law . Alerted to the danger , Steve , who is white , cuts the finger of his wife , a mixed-race woman who had been passing for white , and swallows some of her bloodthus enabling him to claim truthfully that he " had Negro blood " in him . The sheriff departs after the showboat captain stands up for Steve , but the couple is immediately fired from the showboat troupe . For the time , this singular scene would prove sufficiently unsettling , especially to southern audiences , that it was omitted from the 1929 silent film version .

Did the Constitution need a bill of rights ? In general , Federalists said no and Anti-Federalists said yes . If so , should it be added before or after the Constitution was ratified ? Adding it before ratification meant a second constitutional convention , a calamitous prospect to most Federalists . Thus when five states proposed amendments at their ratifying conventions , they did so with the clear message that their vote to ratify committed the first Congress to submit a bill of rights . Which it did , with James Madison 's leadership , on September 25 , 1789 .

In contrast , France adopted the Declaration of Rights at the very beginning of its ill-fated revolutionjust six weeks after the storming of the Bastille in Paris in July 1789with no historic scaffolding , no tradition of monarchs gradually relinquishing power .

@@36939012 @5939012/ <p> " The man who builds a factory builds a temple ; the man who works there worships there . " This sentiment , attributed to Calvin Coolidge , conveys the awe generated by a modern sprawling industrial complex.1 And none was as awe-inspiring as the Ford complex on the Rouge River near Detroit , begun in 1915 and completed in 1928 as Ford prepared to introduce the new Model A. Unlike the original Highland Park factory , it was more than an assembly plant . It was an empire , containing within its thousand acres a power plant , steel mills , blast furnaces , cement plant , machine shop , sawmill , paper mill , glass plant , the largest foundry in the world , and , of course , the auto assembly plant . " America 's Mecca , " wrote Vanity Fair that year , " the most significant monument in America . " MONUMENT . And from a 21st-century perspective : " It was big . It was bold . It was breathtaking .

Let us examine this monument , this " temple , " through photographs , paintings , and films that portray it as the apex of the Machine Age . <p> Works of Charles Sheeler . In 1927 the photographer and painter Charles Sheeler was hired by Ford 's advertising agency to create a series of photographs of the Rouge complex for its Model A marketing campaign . The photographs became almost as famous as the car , published first in Vanity Fair ( February 1928 ) and still widely available for purchase . Captivated by the Rouge , Sheeler later depicted its robust monumentality in paintings of the precisionist style , of which he was a forerunner , which employed precise commanding lines , stark geometric shapes , little detail , no texture , and rarely included a human being . Three of the most famous paintings are American Landscape ( 1930 ) , Classic Landscape ( 1931 ) , and River Rouge Plant ( 1932 ) . What response did Sheeler intend to evoke in the viewer ?

In A Tour thru the Rouge Plants , we join an airplane and bus tour of the complex ; intertitles ( black-panel text ) describe its massive scale and productivity : <p> - " The Rouge Plants have an area of 1096 acres , 14 miles of roadways , 92 miles of railroad tracks , and 11/3 miles of docks . " <p> - " You are looking at the enormous turbines used to generate power for the plants operations . " <p> - " Everybody out please .

" <p> If the film had a sound track , it would consist of blasting horns , a driving bass , and insistent percussions . The second film , The Source of the Ford Car , shows us the transport of resources to the Rouge plant from the Ford-owned Brazilian rubber plantations and Great Lakes coal mines and forests . We see close-up views of machine tooling , the auto manufacturing process , and the workers who man the machines .

We want to know what Thomas Jefferson would think of affirmative action , or George Washington of the invasion of Iraq .

In this seminar we will study events like " The Freedom Train , " " On Our Way , " " The Berlin Industries Fair , " and " The Europe Train " to explore the complicated process by which governments on both sides of the Atlantic sifted through the rubble produced by WWII to find the building blocks for a postwar world based on a unified Europe , an Atlantic alliance , and a renewed faith in the promise of capitalism and democracy . 
@@36939209 @5939209/ <h> About the Seminar <p> The story seems familiar . A North American colonial empire , firmly established since the 1500s , is , by the 1700s , funneling great wealth to the mother country in Europe . The colonies are ethnically , ecologically , and geographically diverse . Slavery , an important part of the colonial economy , is widespread ; yet some of the African-descendant population live as free people . Village-dwelling indigenous peoples maintain their community traditions , but along parts of the frontier nomadic tribes live beyond colonial dominion , and the relations between native inhabitants and colonists are tense at best , hostile at worst . By the mid-1700s the colonists are chafing under royal rule . Revolution is in the air . <p> We are , of course , referring not to the British Atlantic seaboard , but to the Spanish empire in what is now the American Southwest . In the eighteenth century the Spanish , like the British , struggled to hang on to their North American colonies .
