@@118546040 @7546040/ <p> Does your little one throw food on the floor or do the dreaded hand shimmy to fling food all over the place ? I can attest to what a mess that creates . But do n't  worry . Its all- normal . <h> How Much Should My Child be Eating ? <p> This is such a common question and concern . <p> At this point , your new toddler is slowing down in growth , which can slow down his appetite . He- does not need to eat as much as he- did before he- turned one- because he does n't  need the same amount of energy to grow as he- did before . <p> During the- first year of life , on average , a baby grows 10 inches ( 25 centimeters ) in length and his- body weight increases by 300% ! So you can see why your little one- needed to eat so often throughout the first year . <p> From ages 1-2 , growth dramatically slows down and for infants . Your baby- might only grow 2-4 inches . This is why his- appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He Eats Everything , Sometimes Virtually Nothing <p> You will see some days where it looks like your toddler is sustaining himself on air and other days he eats- everything on his- plate . It 's related to the amount of energy he- needs to grow . <p> Generally , toddlers should be eating 1 TBSP of food- from each of the main food groups per meal per year of life . So if your child- is 18 months , he should be eating 1.5-2 - TBSP of protein , carbs , fruits , and vegetables . <p> It is completely normal if he- eats 3- TBSP or even 4- TBSP of one food group and not eat anything from the other food groups during a meal . Studies show that it evens out throughout the week and it is completely normal and healthy . So no need to be concerned . <p> As the parent , just keep offering him- healthy food options with each meal . Personally , I did n't offer my twins carbs until they started to- slow down eating the protein and vegetables . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to serve it . I selectively bring out food for them . <h> Make Meals Enjoyable <p> The big focus on your meals should be enjoying a meal together as a family ! Make meals enjoyable , even when they are not . If you 're frustrated at their refusal to eat what you served them , do n't  show it ! This is when you put on your happy face . <p> Do n't  worry about your childs manners at this age or if he or she is using a spoon . At this stage in development , its all about creating an enjoyable atmosphere around- eating . Turn the TV off and do n't  allow toys at the table . This is a time to be social . Otherwise , you may raise- a 16-year-old who ca n't carry on a dinner conversation . <p> Even more importantly , if your child is distracted while eating he may not learn to listen to his- queue for fullness and learn to overeat . This is a very important time for your child to learn to recognize these hunger/ fullness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry before a meal . <h> What Foods Should You Be Feeding Your Child ? <p> Try to avoid kid-favorite foods as much as you can at this age , like hotdogs , mac and cheese , etc . Your child is going to have plenty of opportunities to eat these foods and love them . If your child is n't being exposed to these types of foods then your child ca n't get hooked on eating them . Ask anyone who 's child only eats pizza about how stressful it is to get him to try a new food ? <p> Watch out for how many empty calorie foods your child is eating . I did n't  know cheese is considered an empty calorie until I researched it . <p> Think of snacking as a mini-meal and not as treat time . Eating Goldfish crackers is a treat and not a nutritious snack . I grew up on Goldfish so naturally- I started giving them to my twins , until I read the ingredient label and learned what to look for when reading ingredient labels . These snacks are filling and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snack foods . Check out the dos and donts for snacking as this is one of the biggest reasons kids do n't  eat well . <p> Your child might be too tired to eat . If a child is tired then the meal does n't  normally go well . Sleep is incredibly important as it relates to eating . <h> What 's Normal For This Age ? <p> Your child should be signaling that he wants to eat . If you have n't tried teaching a few signs from sign language , the sign to eat is a great one for kids to learn . <p> Your child should be giving signals that he is- ready for more food . Do n't worry if your little one does n't do this each time . <p> Your child should be weaning off purees if he- has n't  already during this phase . Children who stay on purees too long can struggle with texture issues . <p> Throwing and wearing his food is very normal . He is- experiencing food using his- different senses including touch as he- rubs it all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his- sensory development so let him- roll around in it = Find out why messy at this stage is a good thing . <p> Some kids start off eating everything in front of them , but then become more selective as they near 18 months . Again , this is completely normal . <p> Other kids start off a lot more hesitant when it comes to- trying new foods . If you work hard on constantly introducing new foods , they will- grow to be more receptive to trying new foods . Again , this is normal . <p> If your child does n't  like to get dirty or touch slimy foods , do n't  worry ! This just means you need to work with him or her more on sensory activities . Check out food sensory activities to speed this along . <p> Children should be working on learning to feed themselves . It 's messy , but studies show this can reduce obesity in children as they can better regulate the amount of food to they eat .

Reflect on how much snacking your child is doing throughout the day . All of this snacking- might cause your child from experiencing hunger . Kids need to feel hungry to be open to trying new foods and eating a healthy size portion of dinner . Read the article on snacking- to learn how to manage this . <p> Does your child still nurse or get a bottle in the middle of the night ? Your child might not be getting enough food during the day or is using breastfeeding as a way to soothe . The challenge is that your little one is getting calories at night so he is that much less motivated to eat during the day . <p> Is your child still gagging when eating solid foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

It is hard to tell exactly what you are buying in the produce department since all are not labeled if they are modified vegetables . What is your opinion on GMO safety ? <p> ANSWER : Animal and plant foods have been " genetically modified " for centuries . This has been done , in the past , by selective breeding of animals and by selective cultivation and pollination of plants . This process has lead to animals and plants which are more nutritious , more disease resistant and have higher yields . Today , it is also possible to genetically modify plants and animals in the laboratory using very sophisticated biotechnology and newly-discovered genetic engineering techniques . <h> GMO Safety Facts <p> That is not to say that altering the genetic makeup of plants and animals by traditional selective breeding is identical to what is occurring in laboratory genetic engineering . It is not . Using biotechnology and genetic engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can insert segments of genetic material from bacteria and animals into plants and vice versa . This does not usually occur in nature ; there are exceptions . This type of genetic engineering can be what we call " simple " the introduction of one or two genes.or , in the future , it may be " complex " the introduction of multiple genes and large segments of DNA.It is not possible to put all genetic engineering into one category and unilaterally declare that foods that are genetically-engineered are " safe . " Rather , different types and complexities of genetically-engineered foods must be continually evaluated for safety , as they are being produced . Genetically-engineered foods , right now , fall into the category of " single- or double-gene " alterations . These types of foods have been evaluated and can be designated as " safe . " <p> However , tomorrows genetically-engineered plants and animals will be more complex and contain multiple gene alterations . The safety of those foods still needs to be determined . <p> There is no doubt that , in some parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes up the major part of the diet , that altering rice using genetic engineering can make the food more nutritious. - Using rice as an example , natural rice is deficient in Vitamin A. <p> Because of this deficiency and because rice is the staple of diets in many countries , it is estimated that more than 3 million children go blind each year from a Vitamin A deficiency . <p> However , Golden Rice , produced by genetic engineering , is yellow in color because the gene for beta-carotene has been introduced into the rice plant ( beta-carotene is a precursor of Vitamin A and is identical to the yellowish-orange compound responsible for the color of carrots ) . The ability of rice plants to produce this high Vitamin-A rice has been accomplished using genetic engineering.the introduction of two genes which allows the rice plant to make beta-carotenea gene from daffodils and a gene from a bacterium . <p> Using rice as an example , natural rice is deficient in Vitamin A.

It is unfortunate , that there is so much irrationality and emotionalism attached to genetic engineering because it does have the potential for having major positive impacts on the worlds nutrition . It is not useful to run around like chicken little , but rather to proceed and evaluate this technology in a rational , scientific manner , as it develops . <p> My evaluation is that , to date , the GMOs on the market TODAY are safe and I would not hesitate to use these foods .

@@118546167 @7546167/ <h> Is It Safe to Eat Genetically Modified Foods ? <h> The Truth About GMO Safety <p> QUESTION : - Is it safe to eat GMO foods ? It is hard to tell exactly what you are buying in the produce department since all are not labeled if they are modified vegetables . What is your opinion on GMO safety ? <p> ANSWER : Animal and plant foods have been " genetically modified " for centuries . This has been done , in the past , by selective breeding of animals and by selective cultivation and pollination of plants . This process has lead to animals and plants which are more nutritious , more disease resistant and have higher yields . Today , it is also possible to genetically modify plants and animals in the laboratory using very sophisticated biotechnology and newly-discovered genetic engineering techniques . <h> GMO Safety Facts <p> That is not to say that altering the genetic makeup of plants and animals by traditional selective breeding is identical to what is occurring in laboratory genetic engineering . It is not . Using biotechnology and genetic engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can insert segments of genetic material from bacteria and animals into plants and vice versa . This does not usually occur in nature ; there are exceptions . This type of genetic engineering can be what we call " simple " the introduction of one or two genes.or , in the future , it may be " complex " the introduction of multiple genes and large segments of DNA.It is not possible to put all genetic engineering into one category and unilaterally declare that foods that are genetically-engineered are " safe . " Rather , different types and complexities of genetically-engineered foods must be continually evaluated for safety , as they are being produced . Genetically-engineered foods , right now , fall into the category of " single- or double-gene " alterations . These types of foods have been evaluated and can be designated as " safe . " <p> However , tomorrows genetically-engineered plants and animals will be more complex and contain multiple gene alterations . The safety of those foods still needs to be determined . <p> There is no doubt that , in some parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes up the major part of the diet , that altering rice using genetic engineering can make the food more nutritious. - Using rice as an example , natural rice is deficient in Vitamin A. <p> Because of this deficiency and because rice is the staple of diets in many countries , it is estimated that more than 3 million children go blind each year from a Vitamin A deficiency . <p> However , Golden Rice , produced by genetic engineering , is yellow in color because the gene for beta-carotene has been introduced into the rice plant ( beta-carotene is a precursor of Vitamin A and is identical to the yellowish-orange compound responsible for the color of carrots ) . The ability of rice plants to produce this high Vitamin-A rice has been accomplished using genetic engineering.the introduction of two genes which allows the rice plant to make beta-carotenea gene from daffodils and a gene from a bacterium . <p> Using rice as an example , natural rice is deficient in Vitamin A.

It is unfortunate , that there is so much irrationality and emotionalism attached to genetic engineering because it does have the potential for having major positive impacts on the worlds nutrition . It is not useful to run around like chicken little , but rather to proceed and evaluate this technology in a rational , scientific manner , as it develops . <p> My evaluation is that , to date , the GMOs on the market TODAY are safe and I would not hesitate to use these foods .

There are some- great organic and natural baby food options available . - Each family situation is different and your reasons for doing it or not doing it are your own and are right for your family ! <h> Why We Recommend Making Your Own Food : <h> 1 . The food you make is more nutritious for your baby . <p> The food you make at home is more nutritious than pre-made baby food . Food manufacturers have to heat up the food to high temperatures and then cool the food to sterilize it .

I do n't  even think two bananas are in one pouch . - If you use one butternut squash , roast- it , and then puree it , you probably can make 10 pouches and tons more if you mix it with other foods . <h> 6 . You can do both ! <p> If you do n't  have anything thawed or you are out of the house , bring a jar or pouch to make life easier for everyone. - You can keep a few pouches or jars in your diaper bag for those feeding emergencies . - Occupational Therapists and Feeding Specialists will recommend that you do not let your child suck from a pouch .

Since your baby 's diet has been 100% fluids , thinning out the solids helps your child accept the new food .

Start to dilute the juice by watering it down . Over time , continue diluting the juice until you can transition them back to water . Do the same thing with chocolate milk and any other sweet fluids they are drinking . <p> Young children who drink juice often transition to soda drinks , as they get older . Also , do your best to keep kids away from juices , sodas , and sports drinks . <p> Apple juice , unsweetened has 24 g of sugar per cup or 6 teaspoons of sugar . <p> Juice is n't as good as eating the actual fruit .

This process strips out the fiber from the fruit and leaves it very high in sugar . If a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will delay the absorption of sugar .. think of it as a steady stream of sugar getting absorbed .

It will be hard transition , but it 's worth it in the long-term . Childhood obesity- is a huge problem and a growing problem . It often starts with the small choices we make daily with our kids , like on-demand snacking , offering poor nutritional food options- like mac and cheese and chicken nuggets and giving kids juice . <h> Reduce or Eliminate Juice Consumption <p> This is important : Researchers found that when you pair a juice with a vegetable , kids from ages 2 " 5 would eat a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water . <p> When kids start to crave sugar , fat and salt this is called pervasive palate preferences . They get accustomed to these flavors and really start to crave them . <p> Think about what happens when a child drinks a sweet juice , it will bring out the bitter flavors of the vegetable even more , and generally is enough to turn a kid off from eating it . <p> You have to get kids out of this sweet cycle . If a child is drinking sweetened beverages often , then his sense of taste starts to change and in order to eat food , the child would need the food to have a certain level of sweetness in order to want to eat it . That 's why it 's so important to make changes now .

With different foods , comes different textures , which can sometimes lead to picky eating . When it comes to our son , our obstacle was just that : textures . The reason for this is because Lukas was born 11 weeks premature . A lot of children who are born premature end up being tube fed during their stay in the hospital . For our little man , that stay was a long 6 weeks . This extended stay on intubation caused his throat to scar and caused a disorder called dysphagia . What is Dysphagia and how can I overcome it ? <h> What is Dysphagia ? <p> The definition of Dysphagia is difficulty or discomfort in swallowing . While this may be different for every child who has the disorder , for our Lukas , it meant eating baby food until he was 3 -+ years old . Not only baby food but stage 2 baby food because the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would gag . <h> Check Out Our Other Resources- On Sensory Disorders And Solutions : <h> When Are Children Diagnosed ? <p> Children can be diagnosed with dysphagia- at any age . For us , because Lukas was premature , we were not cleared to start baby food until he turned 1 . After 3 months , we were still on stage 2 baby food . However , he would refuse any new foods and those that he did want to eat- or try to eat , he would spit it back up . He choked a couple times as well . Finally , at his 18-month check-up , we expressed our worries to his pediatrician . After just a few tests , it was obvious to the- doctor that we were dealing with Dysphagia . <h> What Kind of Therapist Did We See ? <p> Our son 's therapist was a speech therapist . She helped him with finding the movements to move his tongue around and understand the chewing process . She was there for him every step of the way . We attended therapy twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most disorders , therapy was n't just done in a clinic , it was done at home , 24 hours a day . This was the hardest part of it all . <p> As parents , it is frustrating for us . Having to clean up the mess from the food coming back up 3 to 4 times a day . Working with him and spending 2 hours sometimes on each meal . But we kept going because imagining how difficult it was for us , just meant how hard it was for our little guy . If we felt frustrated , we knew that he would be twice as frustrated as we were . Our job was not just to show our frustration and to stick with our job as parents but to encourage our little guy . <h> Our Milestones and Our Fallbacks <p> Unfortunately , at that time , it seemed like we were having more fall backs than mile stones . At first , if we tried anything new in our routine , like- even potty-training , our little Lukas would regress on therapy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally switch to stage 3 baby food only to go back to stage 2 . <p> Finally , after a year of therapy , we had Lukas on small snacks like puffs and cookies wheels , which he would lick . During therapy , his therapist would use popsicles and tongue depressors . At one point , we also used a brush specially made for sensory problems . We would use it twice a day on his legs and on his arms . This seems to be very affective with him . <p> After Lukas turned 3 , we really started seeing results . He finally was starting to look for other foods and look at what we were eating . This is when we started to mash bananas and whatever we could find to give him . For us , this was the biggest miles stone because the baby food that he was on did not give him enough calories during the day . For that reason , we gave him PediaSure once or twice a day to sustain him .

Our biggest mile stone came out of nowhere . Lukas had been regressing on therapy and we went to Subway . We had bought him a cookie and figured he would just lick it for a while . After my husband and I ate our food , we looked at Lukas and I asked my husband where the cookie was . Then Lukas looked at us and took a huge bite out of the cookie . And the best part was that for the first time , he was chewing ! ! He had finally figured it out all on his own ! After 2 -+ years of therapy ! Even his therapist was amazed how strong and smart our young little man was . He was discharged from therapy that week . <h> Where We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The road to recovery is still here but so small that it is barely noticeable . He still has a hard time with dry meats such as steak or chicken breast but monitors himself . If it is something he has a hard time with , he takes smaller bites and takes his time . But other than a few textures , over the years he has improved significantly . <p> So if you have a child that has dysphagia , just remember how strong they are and hang in there . One step at a time and one day at a time is the only way you can really take- this on . Make sure to stick with your routine and show them support . Celebrate those milestones because it is n't just theirs , they are also yours . You are a team ! - Work with them every day and remember that there are others that are going through the same thing .

@@118546282 @7546282/ <p> So if you- feed your newborn formula just before bedtime , will it ensure a- restful sleep for you and baby ? - Let 's just say there 's some advice we carry down from generation to generation But this should- not- be one of them . Feeding a newborn a heavy bottle of formula to keep them full and happy at night might seem like a good idea , but it could actually- make your child wake up more . <h> 1 . Formula Can Upset A Babys- Belly <p> Sometimes the heavy consistency of formula can upset an infants stomach and cause them to stay awake . Infant formula is more difficult to digest than breast milk , that 's why a formula-fed baby can last longer between feedings . But that does not mean your child will restfully sleep for longer . It can actually disrupt a babys ability to stay asleep because her body is busy processing the formula , and the lack of comfortability ( i.e. tummy aches , digestion cramps , etc. ) might keep her from sleeping soundly . This is especially true when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula . A baby on 100% formula can adapt to the formula and the stomach issues may subside . However , a baby who- is primarily fed breastmilk and given occasional formula may have a lot more digestive issues with the formula . <h> 2 . Your Breast Milk Supply Can Decrease <p> For some breastfeeding moms , when they cut down on the number of breastfeeding sessions , their milk production , and supply may decrease .

Do n't model picky eating , if you do n't want a picky eater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's important not to pass them on to our kids . Let them figure out what they like and do n't like without your influence . Do n't  openly share your dislikes in front of your children . And , prepare foods you do n't  like so your child has a chance to be exposed to it . <p> Make mealtimes fun and enjoyable . Leave your frustrations and fights away from the table . Meals should bring a family together . It 's amazing how important it is for families to eat together . Studies show that kids will eat more in social settings . <p> Do n't label yourself or your little one as a bad eater , picky eater , fussy eater , etc . People live up or down to their labels . <p> Give kids healthy mealtime options that the whole family is eating . Do NOT allow yourself to become a short order cook . I 've caught myself doing this . All of your kids must eat what you made them . I 've found it is a good idea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a choice between a few different healthy options . This ensures you have at least one safe item on the table . They can have their genuine dislikes of food and that 's ok because I provided them with a few options . For example , I will make cauliflower casserole and green beans with bacon . They have two great options to choose from , plus , the main course . My kids are obsessed with peas and they only take a few minutes to make . If I know they are not in love with the rest of the meal , I 'll serve it with some peas as their safe food. - <p> Kids have small stomachs so make the calories count.Do n't let them fill up on filler foods like crackers , pretzels , and pasta , which do n't add a lot of nutritional value , but are filling . On the other hand , do n't get so hung up on every calorie or if they are eating from all the food groups at every meal . It can make you crazy and studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents are too focused on hitting the food groups at each meal . Researchers show that it all evens out throughout a 30-day cycle and that is completely healthy . <p> Do n't pressure your little ones to eat .

There is study after study about this . Be completely neutral about food . Check out this article about not passing along emotional eating to your kids . <p> It 's your job to provide nutritious and yummy food and it 's your childs job to eat as much as their bodies need to grow. - This is so important . Once you put the healthy food on the table , your job is done . Relax . Enjoy a pleasant conversation with your kids and do n't  focus on what he or she is eating . Your job is done . This teaches children to self-regulate , which is a life-long skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with kids . <p> Studies also show that the more attractive the meal is , the more your kids will eat it .

It just reinforces they do not need to eat their meal because they will get a snack later . - Find out why its important for a child to get hungry before a meal .

It 's actually evolutionary . Most toddlers will go through a phase where they are leery of new foods and different textures . <p> Is your child 's sensitivity to textures not allowing him to eat a large variety of foods ? <p> Even if your child is gaining weight normally , he might still have nutritional deficiencies , depending- on how many food aversions and/or sensitivities your child has. - Pediatricians recommend looking- at what a toddler eats over the course of a week to gauge if the child has had a- good variety of foods in his diet . <p> In this article , we will walk you through ways to get your child to be comfortable with a larger variety of food textures . <h> Ways to Start Working on Reducing Food Sensitivity <h> Gateway Foods <p> Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can build on these foods by offering slight variations of the food . Let 's say your child loves chicken nuggets . Start offering different brands of chicken nuggets that have similar shapes and then get a brand that has them in completely different shapes . Then start offering homemade chicken that 's breaded similar to the chicken nuggets . And , then try breaded fish . Keep going and do this with all of their favorite foods . <p> Over time you 'll be expanding their diets using their favorite foods to do it . Make sure you take a few days off before offering similar foods . You do n't want them to get in the habit of eating the same food every day , even if you are using these foods as a gateway . The rule is at least one day apart , if you can . <p> Do n't forget to track your wins and opportunities , as suggested by the Picky Eaters Club series . You might be surprised by your accomplishments if you start tracking them . Each time my little man eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then write down the win ! Slowly , but surely , we are making progress . <h> Work with the Same Textures <p> Some kids love crunchy foods , while others have aversions to them . It 's important to start small , so work within your limitations . For example , if your child does n't like crunchy foods , then do n't shy away from putting all sorts of different kinds of foods and flavors through the food processor . This way your child still gets the flavor profile of foods , even if it 's not the same texture . <p> Get creative and work with your child 's texture aversion . If your child does n't like mashed potato , try potato wedges . Keep introducing some of the same foods in all kinds of different ways using different preparations . Think of all the different shapes and sizes French fries come in . Try them all with your little one . <h> Build on What they Love <p> Then also try sweet potato fries , parsnip fries and turnip and carrot fries . Personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am building on how my kids love the French fry shape . This is how you expand their palates using gateway foods mentioned above . <p> If your kids do n't eat meat , puree it and then mix it with a strong flavor that your child does like . Slowly take down the complimentary flavor as low as low as he will let you . This way he can become accustomed to the flavor of the meat . It 's important to get him used to the flavors as you are working with him to overcome his texture aversions . <p> Over time , try pureeing the food less , and less leaving more texture each time . Or cut up the food in small bites . Go slowly . This is hard ! To me it feels like a part-time job , but I know it will be worth it in the end . I want to set up my twins to be good healthy eaters later in life . I want them to travel the world tasting everything ; ultimately , I want them to be adventurous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Read <p> Teaching your kid to read can be hard . If he does n't get reading right away , you would n't say oh , well , he does n't like to read so I 'm going to stop reading with him . ' Unfortunately , that is what happens with so many parents when it comes to getting their child to eat healthy . If their child does n't eat his vegetables , why give up on serving vegetables ? Practice , practice , practice . <p> I know it can be a viewed as a waste of money and effort . You can make a bunch of vegetables and freeze them . Then every day take another vegetable out of the freezer and unfreeze it and serve . This way you can reduce your effort and food waste by only serving a small amount . Your child is never going to learn to like to eat vegetables if you do not constantly work with him on it . You are teaching taste and it is challenging , but so is potty training and learning to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This process is extremely challenging for both the parents and their child . It 's important for you to know this is hard and stressful for your little ones too . Do your best to be neutral through all their food aversions and texture issues . Your children need your love and support at this time , no matter how frustrating this is . <p> Kids can be very sensitive to texture changes , so it 's important to go slowly . Kids are just figuring out what foods taste like and are naturally cautious about new foods . <p> If you go too fast or are impatient with your child , then he can actually develop a fear of certain foods , textures , whole food groups and/or certain colors of food . <h> Working Through the Steps Slowly <p> Encourage your child to play with his food . This can get messy , but that 's good ! There are so many steps that can happen before a child even eats the food . As adults , we are able to look at a food and can relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives or related it to another food that looks like it . We can quickly anticipate what the food will taste like . Young kids ca n't do that . <p> Some kids need countless exposures before even considering to touching a food . Great , now the child touched it ! <p> The next step is putting it to their lips , and that should take another few exposure opportunities . Some kids might start eating it from this point , but others might need to put it to their lips , taste it and spit it out a few more times . <p> And then finally he eats it ! It can still take some more exposures before the child starts to really like it . It 's an exhausting journey , but do n't give up ! You are helping your child to develop his taste buds and flavor preferences that he will have for the rest of his life . I can cite countless studies that show how children 's taste buds are constantly developing , so do n't get worried if he makes faces or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep exposing it to him , his preferences can change and he can grow to like it over time . <p> The good thing is that if you can get him to like the food before high school , then he will probably like the food as an adult . So , yay ! <p> Tip : Always offer at least one safe food that he is used to eating with each meal when offering a new food . This takes the pressure and stress of having to try the new food . <h> Sensory Play <p> Sensory play can help your child overcome their texture aversion . This is a great opportunity for your child to look at food and to touch it without the stress of having to eat it . Kids learn through play and these sensory activities allow him to get more comfortable with the textures without the stress of having to eat the food . <p> Some kids are sensitive to crunchy foods and others to soft or slimy foods .

@@118546430 @7546430/ <h> Overcoming Food Texture in Kids <p> Food texture describes a food 's consistency , whether a food is lumpy , smooth , thin , thick or a combination of all these things . <p> It 's normal for kids to be cautious about trying new foods . It 's actually evolutionary . Most toddlers will go through a phase where they are leery of new foods and different textures . <p> Is your child 's sensitivity to textures not allowing him to eat a large variety of foods ? <p> Even if your child is gaining weight normally , he might still have nutritional deficiencies , depending- on how many food aversions and/or sensitivities your child has. - Pediatricians recommend looking- at what a toddler eats over the course of a week to gauge if the child has had a- good variety of foods in his diet . <p> In this article , we will walk you through ways to get your child to be comfortable with a larger variety of food textures . <h> Ways to Start Working on Reducing Food Sensitivity <h> Gateway Foods <p> Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can build on these foods by offering slight variations of the food . Let 's say your child loves chicken nuggets . Start offering different brands of chicken nuggets that have similar shapes and then get a brand that has them in completely different shapes . Then start offering homemade chicken that 's breaded similar to the chicken nuggets . And , then try breaded fish . Keep going and do this with all of their favorite foods . <p> Over time you 'll be expanding their diets using their favorite foods to do it . Make sure you take a few days off before offering similar foods . You do n't want them to get in the habit of eating the same food every day , even if you are using these foods as a gateway . The rule is at least one day apart , if you can . <p> Do n't forget to track your wins and opportunities , as suggested by the Picky Eaters Club series . You might be surprised by your accomplishments if you start tracking them . Each time my little man eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then write down the win ! Slowly , but surely , we are making progress . <h> Work with the Same Textures <p> Some kids love crunchy foods , while others have aversions to them . It 's important to start small , so work within your limitations . For example , if your child does n't like crunchy foods , then do n't shy away from putting all sorts of different kinds of foods and flavors through the food processor . This way your child still gets the flavor profile of foods , even if it 's not the same texture . <p> Get creative and work with your child 's texture aversion . If your child does n't like mashed potato , try potato wedges . Keep introducing some of the same foods in all kinds of different ways using different preparations . Think of all the different shapes and sizes French fries come in . Try them all with your little one . <h> Build on What they Love <p> Then also try sweet potato fries , parsnip fries and turnip and carrot fries . Personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am building on how my kids love the French fry shape . This is how you expand their palates using gateway foods mentioned above . <p> If your kids do n't eat meat , puree it and then mix it with a strong flavor that your child does like . Slowly take down the complimentary flavor as low as low as he will let you . This way he can become accustomed to the flavor of the meat . It 's important to get him used to the flavors as you are working with him to overcome his texture aversions . <p> Over time , try pureeing the food less , and less leaving more texture each time . Or cut up the food in small bites . Go slowly . This is hard ! To me it feels like a part-time job , but I know it will be worth it in the end . I want to set up my twins to be good healthy eaters later in life . I want them to travel the world tasting everything ; ultimately , I want them to be adventurous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Read <p> Teaching your kid to read can be hard . If he does n't get reading right away , you would n't say oh , well , he does n't like to read so I 'm going to stop reading with him . ' Unfortunately , that is what happens with so many parents when it comes to getting their child to eat healthy . If their child does n't eat his vegetables , why give up on serving vegetables ? Practice , practice , practice . <p> I know it can be a viewed as a waste of money and effort . You can make a bunch of vegetables and freeze them . Then every day take another vegetable out of the freezer and unfreeze it and serve . This way you can reduce your effort and food waste by only serving a small amount . Your child is never going to learn to like to eat vegetables if you do not constantly work with him on it . You are teaching taste and it is challenging , but so is potty training and learning to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This process is extremely challenging for both the parents and their child . It 's important for you to know this is hard and stressful for your little ones too . Do your best to be neutral through all their food aversions and texture issues . Your children need your love and support at this time , no matter how frustrating this is . <p> Kids can be very sensitive to texture changes , so it 's important to go slowly . Kids are just figuring out what foods taste like and are naturally cautious about new foods . <p> If you go too fast or are impatient with your child , then he can actually develop a fear of certain foods , textures , whole food groups and/or certain colors of food . <h> Working Through the Steps Slowly <p> Encourage your child to play with his food . This can get messy , but that 's good ! There are so many steps that can happen before a child even eats the food . As adults , we are able to look at a food and can relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives or related it to another food that looks like it . We can quickly anticipate what the food will taste like . Young kids ca n't do that . <p> Some kids need countless exposures before even considering to touching a food . Great , now the child touched it ! <p> The next step is putting it to their lips , and that should take another few exposure opportunities . Some kids might start eating it from this point , but others might need to put it to their lips , taste it and spit it out a few more times . <p> And then finally he eats it ! It can still take some more exposures before the child starts to really like it . It 's an exhausting journey , but do n't give up ! You are helping your child to develop his taste buds and flavor preferences that he will have for the rest of his life . I can cite countless studies that show how children 's taste buds are constantly developing , so do n't get worried if he makes faces or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep exposing it to him , his preferences can change and he can grow to like it over time . <p> The good thing is that if you can get him to like the food before high school , then he will probably like the food as an adult . So , yay ! <p> Tip : Always offer at least one safe food that he is used to eating with each meal when offering a new food . This takes the pressure and stress of having to try the new food . <h> Sensory Play <p> Sensory play can help your child overcome their texture aversion . This is a great opportunity for your child to look at food and to touch it without the stress of having to eat it . Kids learn through play and these sensory activities allow him to get more comfortable with the textures without the stress of having to eat the food . <p> Some kids are sensitive to crunchy foods and others to soft or slimy foods .

Its nutritional benefits are multifold . But what has n't  risen to fame is the sugar produced from the sap of the coconut palm tree . Coconut palm sugar is a delectable sugar alternative and with its natural foundation , it is boosting with benefits . Iron , zinc , potassium , and calcium are just a few fantastic finds within coconut sugar . Without an impact on blood sugar levels and being a very low glycemic food , coconut sugar makes an ideal substitute for diabetics and others concerned about insulin intake . And , its sustainable , which means its better on the environment ! ! ! <p> Coconut palm sugar has less fructose than regular sugar , and is a lower glycemic index food , which means your blood sugar spike is n't as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - When your blood sugar spikes from high glycemic index foods it can cause your insulin levels to spike in a short amount of time which increases your chances of getting Type-2 Diabetics . And , do n't  forget the sugar crash you may experience shortly after eating a higher glycemic index food . <p> Coconut palm sugar has a few minerals and vitamins , but nothing noteworthy . This sugar contains trace amounts of magnesium , zinc , calcium , zinc , phosphorous , iron and copper , vitamin C , and potassium . <h> Wholesome Organic Coconut Palm Sugar <h> Date Sugar &amp; Date Paste <p> Date sugar is a natural sugar substitute boosting with flavor . Since it is sweeter than its competitor , recipe artists recommend using 2/3 of the amount of what is called for in refined sugar .

My go to substitution is to buy the whole dates and make date paste and use that in my recipes . <p> If I have time , I soak the dates , but let 's be honest , that never happens . <h> Organic Date Sugar <h> Pure Maple Syrup <p> Maple syrup is a hidden gem probably tucked away in your pantry or fridge . Its not only for pancakes , people ! Its a sticky substance that aids in immunity and heart health with over 54 antioxidants and towering levels of zinc and manganese . <p> However , we must note : there is a great difference between the maple-flavored syrup and the real raw stuff .

Fructose , as noted above , is a type of sugar that is quickly converted to fat . The Harvard Health Publications cautions us that we should not consume large amounts of fructose outside of what is already found in fresh fruits . To demonstrate the comparison of agave to other sugar substitutes , agave is made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45% . What is more astonishing is that high fructose corn syrup actually has less fructose than agave with only 55% content . Although agave has a low glycemic index which is great for diabetics , the mineral and vitamin content is virtually the same as those found in honey . <h> Bananas <p> Were going bananas over this sweet and healthy alternative ! Did you know bananas make a great sugar substitute in pancakes , oatmeal , breads , and other baked goods ? For optimal sweetness , go for the ripe bunch with speckled brown spots and a darker yellow hue . Why are they sweeter the more they age ? That 's because as the banana ripens , the enzymes in its tissues are breaking down the starch into sugars , which saves your body the hassle . That way the body can absorb the sugars more quickly into the bloodstream . <h> Spices &amp; Extracts <p> Cinnamon , nutmeg , allspice , mace , cardamom and ground ginger are all translated as sweet to your taste buds . Almond extract , vanilla extract , cinnamon extract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , too ! Why not take advantage of their herbal health benefits while optimizing their value as a sweetening agent ?

@@118546521 @7546521/ <h> How to Get Your Picky Eater to Eat Healthier <p> Getting kids to eat their veggies can by trying , tiring and stressful . This stress can have a negative impact not only on you or at your dinner table , but also on your child . It 's important to be patient with your picky eater when they do n't want anything to do with their vegetables . Patience is a virtue and nothing proves that more than dealing with children who just wo n't eat their greens . <p> The problem is is that veggies have a lot to contend with . They are likely to lose against any of a number of foods , especially against sugary foods , such as yogurts , pop tarts or ice cream . <p> A child 's taste buds are still developing , but unfortunately they are being overly stimulated by processed foods that are at the perfect bliss point . This bliss point is the perfect combination of sugars , fats and salts that make a food tasty , but not completely satisfying , so you keep wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . <p> So how do we , as parents , contend with this ? Luckily , there are a few ways to get your picky eater to start eating new , healthy foods without having to scientifically engineer foods- to taste good , like those food manufactures do to reach the bliss point . Here are just a few of the ways <h> Healthy Habits for Kids : - Be Consistent , Not Persistent <p> When it comes to serving new foods to your kids be consistent , not persistent . To develop healthy habits for kids by getting them to eat healthier foods , it takes up to 30 exposures of a new food for a child to actually taste it . So if your little one is n't having broccoli during mealtime , do n't fret ! He just needs time . That 's why it 's good to try and expose your child to these foods more than just at one meal . There are plenty of fun interactive ways- you can get them more exposed to new foods . <p> When it comes to persistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child or pressuring him to eat . The dinner table should n't be a place of stress . Being overly persistent will make your child shut down and protest . <h> Cooking and Gardening with- kids <p> Cooking with your kids is a great place to start when it comes to getting your child more exposed to new foods . Kids will have fun cooking with you , which will create a good bond between you and your little one . Not only will you two get closer , but your child will be more willing to try new foods because they will be sharing in the cooking process . <p> Exposing kids to the whole process of food production will get them more time with the food they normally would n't want to spend any time with . The fact that your kid will be growing foods will create a sense of pride that will translate in him wanting to cook the food , serve the food and eat the food . <h> Snack Time and Preparation <p> Start offering a vegetable at every snack and mealtime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Think about how fast your child would be getting accustomed to seeing these foods . If your child eats veggies or fruits during snack time , that means you do n't have to worry so much if your kid does n't eat his greens during dinner time . He already got those foods during another meal . <p> You can present fruits and veggies in so many different ways . With potatoes you can turn them into fries , hash browns , bake them , etc . Even though fries are n't healthy , your child is still consuming a healthy food . You can change them up , slowly work your kid into having healthier versions , but sometimes you have to start unhealthy . But do n't just think that you can make only potatoes into fries . There are plenty of veggies that can be cut into fry shapes ( such as carrots , sweet potatoes and jicama ) and your kid will still love them ! My kids love almost anything cut in fry shapes . <h> Switch Up Grocery Shopping <p> When you shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and together pick out healthier foods . Try not to pick out processed foods . These foods are filled with empty calories . Try your best at staying out of the snack aisles . Go to the produce section instead . It 's okay that your kid sometimes wants and eats unhealthy snacks , just try to make the healthier ones a priority . <p> So you see , when it comes to picky eating there are a number of ways to combat it . These methods require a lifestyle change . So get started today by planting a garden , cooking with your kids or creating healthy pre-made snacks !

Do n't model picky eating , if you do n't want a picky eater . We all have likes and dislikes by now , but it 's important not to pass them on to our kids . Let them figure out what they like and do n't like without your influence . Do n't  openly share your dislikes in front of your children . And , prepare foods you do n't  like so your child has a chance to be exposed to it . <p> Make mealtimes fun and enjoyable . Leave your frustrations and fights away from the table . Meals should bring a family together . It 's amazing how important it is for families to eat together . Studies show that kids will eat more in social settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bad eater , picky eater , fussy eater , etc . People live up and down to their labels . <p> Give kids healthy mealtime options that the whole family is eating . Do NOT allow yourself to become a short order cook . I 've caught myself doing this . All of your kids must eat what you made them . I 've found it is a good idea to offer a few different sides to ensure that the kids have a choice between a few different healthy options . This ensures you have at least one safe item on the table . They can have their genuine dislikes of food and that 's ok because I provided them with a few options . For example , I will make cauliflower casserole and green beans with bacon . They have two great options to choose from , plus , the main course . My kids are obsessed with peas and they only take a few minutes to make . <p> Kids have small stomachs so make the calories count . Do n't let them fill up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't add a lot of nutritional value , but are filling . On the other hand , do n't get so hung up on every calorie or if they are eating from all the food groups at every meal . It can make you crazy and studies show that overall kids do n't eat as well when the parents are too focused on hitting the food groups at each meal . Researchers show that it all evens out throughout a 30-day cycle and that is completely healthy . <p> Do n't pressure your little ones to eat . Studies show that this actually makes them eat less and they will actually avoid the foods you are emphasizing . Have you noticed they do the opposite of what you are coaxing them to do ? There is study after study about this . Be completely neutral about food . Check out this article about not passing along emotional eating to your kids . <p> Studies also show that the more attractive the meal is , the more your kids will eat it . Make the food yummy and attractive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even kids ? <p> If they do n't eat , DO NOT let them snack afterward . It just reinforces they do not need to eat their meal because they will get a snack later . - Find out why its important for a child to get hungry before a meal . You 'll need to gauge this one based on the age of your children and their communication abilities . Generally , around three years old , children can better understand natural consequences . And , yes , it 's ok if your kids are a little hungry . We are not talking about neglect , just the natural consequence of not eating the meal you prepared for them . Typically , if children have a small breakfast or lunch they 'll probably make up for it at dinner time . 203279 @qwx1063279 203287 @qwx1063287

@@118546817 @7546817/ <h> Gestational Diabetes : What It Means for You and Your Baby <h> What Is Gestational Diabetes ? - Advice From an OB/GYN <p> Diabetes is a disease in which the body has trouble controlling blood sugar and the blood sugar goes too high after eating. - Gestational diabetes ( GDM ) is when the condition comes on as a result of the stress of pregnancy and it goes away after the pregnancy . <p> If a woman is known to be diabetic before pregnancy this is a much more high-risk situation and such women should not become pregnant until they are under the care of a high-risk pregnancy specialist . <p> This article applies only to women who do not have diabetes before getting pregnant . <h> Risk Factors For Gestational Diabetes : <p> Family history of diabetes <p> Age over 25 <p> Obesity <p> Previous delivery of abnormally large babies ( greater than nine pounds ) <p> Diagnosis of gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancY <p> Women of Latino , African American , Asian and Native American descent have a higher incidence of gestational diabetes . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gestational diabetes . - <h> How Could Gestational Diabetes Harm Me And My Baby ? <p> When a pregnant woman has diabetes her high blood sugar crosses the placenta and gets into the baby 's circulation . The high blood sugar in the baby 's bloodstream stimulates the baby 's pancreas to put out extra insulin to try and keep the blood sugar in check . Insulin acts like growth hormone and causes the baby to grow to large . <h> Larger Babies Equal Higher Risks <p> Babies with excessive size are more subject to injury during birth . On occasion , this can result in difficulty delivering the shoulders ( shoulder dystocia ) during a vaginal delivery . This risks injuring the nerves that traverse through the baby 's armpits . Rarely this can lead to permanent damage to the nerves that innervate the baby 's arms ( Erb 's palsy ) . <p> Because of this risk , doctors will often resort to Cesarean section if they think the baby is too big to safely deliver vaginally . Thus women who have uncontrolled gestational diabetes have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the baby 's pancreas continuously puts out excessive amounts of insulin in response to the mother 's hyperglycemia . When the baby is born and separated from the placenta the baby 's pancreas is in the habit of secreting high amounts of insulin but the baby no longer needs this extra insulin because it no longer has the excessive sugar coming from the mother . Therefore the baby will have abnormally low blood sugars ( hypoglycemia ) as well as other metabolic problems for the first days of life . <p> Thus babies born to women with untreated gestational diabetes are more likely to need to receive care in the neonatal intensive care unit and experience a longer hospital stay than other newborns . <h> How Is It Diagnosed ? <p> Most obstetric providers screen every pregnant patient for gestational diabetes . This is done between 24 and 28 weeks gestation . That is the time in pregnancy when the maternal pancreas is most stressed by the pregnancy . Most providers use a two stage testing protocol . <p> First , the patient is given a sweet solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the drink . If it is above a certain value a three-hour glucose tolerance test is ordered . In this test , after an overnight fast , the patient drinks a stronger glucose solution and then has her blood sugar drawn once an hour for three hours . <p> If two or more values are greater than the cut-offs the patient is diagnosed with gestational diabetes . Women at particularly high risk for GDM ( obese , previous history of GDM in a previous pregnancy ) are given the one-hour screening test early in the pregnancy and then , if normal , have it repeated at 24-28 weeks . <h> What Is The Initial Treatment For Gestational Diabetes ? <p> A carbohydrate controlled diet is the cornerstone of the treatment of gestational diabetes . This diet limits the patient to no more than 40% of calories from carbohydrates , 20 % from protein and 40% from fat . It is important to note that a GDM diet is not for weight loss . All pregnant women should gain some weight during pregnancy even if they are overweight , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dietitian or diabetes nurse and is prescribed a meal plan with breakfast , lunch , and dinner plus two or three snacks . Watching carbs in a diabetic diet is not like watching calories when you are trying to lose weight . There you can restrict your calories during the day to compensate for the big dinner you are planning to have. - <p> With diabetes , the number of carbs must be the same at every meal every day . Complex ( starchy ) and high fiber carbs are better than sugary drinks and foods because they are metabolized slower and do n't cause high spikes in blood sugar . Moderate exercise also helps control blood sugar . Check with your doctor to see what kind of exercise is appropriate for you . <h> How Are Medications Used To Treat Gestational Diabetes ? <p> Women- with GDM are taught to check their blood sugars after meals using the finger stick glucose- machine . This may sound scary but actually , after a short time , it will become simple- and second nature . <p> Furthermore , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar after every meal . If you and your doctor find that your sugars are not controlled with diet alone you will need to be started on medication . <p> There are two types of medications used to treat gestational diabetes : oral and injectable . For oral treatment , a medication called glyburide is typically used . - This is taken once or twice a day and has few side effects . It does not cross the placenta in big amounts so does not affect the baby . <p> Some physicians prefer to use insulin injections or will switch to insulin if the oral medications are not working well enough . Insulin is self-injected two to four times per day . Again , though a little daunting at first , soon it will seem simple and routine . <p> Large randomized studies have shown that diligent treatment of GDM leads to fewer abnormally large babies , fewer shoulder dystocias , less neonatal hypoglycemia , fewer Cesarean sections and less high blood pressure in pregnancy . There is some data to suggest that treating GDM leads to less fat cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's childhood and adult life . <p> Pregnancy and birth for women with gestational diabetes , with the exception of the things mentioned above , is not much different than pregnancies without diabetes . Most women deliver at term and can deliver vaginally . Extra testing for the fetus is usually not necessary unless medications are needed to control blood sugars or high blood pressure develops. - <p> If the doctor estimates that the fetus weighs 4,500 grams or more ( about 10 pounds ) he or she may recommend a Cesarean delivery in order to avoid the risk of shoulder dystocia . It is important to realize that the estimation of fetal weight is not always accurate , even by ultrasound. - <p> Therefore some C-sections will be done for babies that are not as large as was thought , but women and their doctors like to error on the side of caution . Also , doctors tend not allow women with gestational diabetes to go much beyond their due date . <h> Should I Do Anything Special After A Pregnancy Complicated By Gestational Diabetes ? <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the occurrence of true Type 2 diabetes in middle age . <h> What Does This Mean For You Long Term ? <p> Up to 50% of women who have gestational diabetes , even if it goes away after delivery , will develop Type-2 diabetes sometime in the years after delivery . <p> Doctors recommend that all women who have had GDM be tested for diabetes six weeks after delivery and at least every five years thereafter . <p> The good news is that these women can markedly decrease their risk of later development of Type-2 diabetes by maintaining a normal weight , eating healthy and exercising . <p> In that sense , GDM is nature 's way of alerting you to how you can avoid future trouble by practicing a healthy lifestyle . <h> - 203279 @qwx1063279 <p> James Seltzer , DO , MS is a board certified **25;0;TOOLONG and a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .

If you do n't want a fight about food later on , do n't offer it now . <p> One way to help expand a child 's palate is to add as much variation to their diets as possible , which includes adding herbs and spices to your dishes ! <p> Over time , our senses dull , especially our sense of taste . Some children are picky eaters because they can be overwhelmed by flavors . Keep this in mind , as you introduce foods to your child . Studies show that a child 's taste keeps changing , so do n't give up even after 10-20 introductions . Children 's tastes are still developing ! Let him develop and help your children enjoy a variety of flavorful foods . <h> When Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to wait until about 8 months of age , but that 's not necessarily for allergy reasons . It 's mostly to make sure children 's stomachs are strong enough to handle a possible upset from the spice or herb . <p> Think about kids from other countries . Many do n't have processed baby foods like we do in the US , so international families will often introduce whatever the family is eating . This can include curry , chili 's , cilantro and turmeric . <h> If You Are Pregnant Or Breastfeeding , Keep Eating Spices And Herbs ! <p> I did n't have food cravings , but I had a ton of food aversions when I was pregnant with my twins . I could n't eat much of anything , except for pasta and meat . I actually was so sick of my boring pregnancy palate that I could n't wait to start eating vegetables again to mix the flavors up . I thought if I never saw pasta and meat again , it would be too soon . <p> Knowing what I know now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many more flavors and varieties of food while pregnant . <p> It 's amazing , but these flavors go through the umbilical cord and through breastmilk to start developing a child 's taste buds . Children are more likely to like savory foods if you ate them during pregnancy and/or while nursing . If you did n't breastfeed , do n't worry ; you can still help to establish children 's early taste preferences by offering all these foods early on when introducing new foods . <h> Need More Ideas <p> It 's unrealistic to keep our refrigerator stocked up like a 5-star restaurant . Countless recipes require exotic ingredients to no avail . Here is a great resource for serving the same 5 fruits and 5 vegetables 100 different ways . This way you can keep offering zucchinis and you and your little one wo n't get bored . 203279 @qwx1063279 203287 @qwx1063287

Good Mood Foods ! <p> Even though those Goldfish crackers or fruit roll-ups seem like a good snack for your kid , they may- be doing more harm than good . In fact , these snacks- may be negatively contributing to your childs mood . But , did you know there are good mood foods you can give your kids ? <p> Sugar is often the culprit in increasing tantrums , outbursts and impulse control issues with kids . Even though sugar is in almost everything processed from ketchup and yogurts to tomato sauces and breads , our bodies are not well equipped to process sugar ; so we tend to react in negative ways or over-react , for that matter . <p> Centuries ago , our source of food came from hunting and gathering with little to NO sugar entering our bodies . But in the late 1800s , England lifted its tariff on imported sugar and an influx of fructose- flooded the streets . <p> Today , sugar is found in almost everything we eat and in extreme quantities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have loads of sugar in it . If its labeled to be low-fat or non-fat , it has excess sugar to make up for the loss of flavor . In fact , sugar alone makes up 16% of our diet ( 1 ) . <p> According to pediatrics specialist David Ludwig , " As far as our hormones and metabolism are concerned , there 's no difference between a bowl of unsweetened corn flakes and a bowl of table sugar " ( 2 ) . <h> Get Your Kids Happy with Good Mood Foods ! <p> The foods that are labeled healthy can sometimes be the worst for us , such as yogurt or juice , which both have- more than 2-3 times the recommended daily sugar intake . This high amount of sugar could be making our childrens- moods much worse . Many foods targeted to children can actually be exacerbating your childs temper , causing anxiety and- depression . <p> Although there is a lack of evidence pertaining to the relationship between sugar and hyperactivity in children , there are significant studies that state sugar influences behavior and adrenaline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar ( found in sodas , candies , table sugar and packaged treats ) can increase insulin and depresses the immune system ; not to mention it holds no nutritional value . <h> Sugar- is Addictive ! <p> Recent research states that the neurological substrates in the brain responsible for emotions- " appear to be more robust than those of cocaine " ( 4 ) . In laymans terms , - sugar is more addicting than drugs ! <p> In an- attempt to calm down your childs temper , do n't  cave into unhealthy foods ! Your little one could benefit more from healthier foods than you think . Unhealthy , processed foods are full of empty calories that can actually make your cranky child even crankier . <p> Sure , the sugar boost might put a temporary pep in your childs- step , but what happens when that sugar rush has ended ? The influence of unnatural foods causes mood swings ; from an extreme high to a terrible low. - They do n't  call it a sugar- crash for nothing ! <p> Scientific evidence has concluded that sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking after our loved ones , we need to be smart about how we choose to coax emotions . That 's why we 've put together a list of good mood foods that have proven results and that are supported by- pediatricians , dieticians and " mom " -icians . <p> Here are the very best foods to fight temper tantrums and get your happy child back ! <h> What Prescriptions Can Do , Some Foods Can Do Better . <p> Did you ever hear the old wives tale about " food as- medicine ? " Well they werent far off . A recent study reveals a surprising mimicry found in food and antidepressant medications . Research chemist , - Karina Martinez-Mayorga , PhD. , spoke before the American Chemical Society declaring that an antidepressant called valporic acid has similar chemical structures as those- found in certain foods ( 5 ) . Be sure to check out these articles on- how to improve academic performance with superfoods- and how to improve sports performance with foods . <h> High Fiber Fruits <p> High fiber fruits are a good mood food ! These fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful brain-boosting element . <p> Although these fruits can have loads of good , complex sugar , they are low on the- glycemic index ; this means they wont spike insulin levels ! <p> The natural sugars found in these fruits will not only be tasty- but offer a- healthy-sugar-rush of energy . <p> If you have to pick between fruits , go for berries . They are nutritional powerhouses . <h> Greek Yogurt <p> Serve a bowl of greek yogurt and see the positive effects of calcium produce better nerve function , combat antibodies and send your child off with a full belly and a big smile . Not to mention that the immense- amount of protein found in- greek yogurt will help restore energy and brain function ! <h> Cacao <p> Say it with me : cah-cow . Not cocoa ! Cacao is the rawest form of chocolate . Cocao is before the- additives , sugar , and dairy that makes up the chocolate we all know so well . In fact , - when heated and processed , dairy depletes many of the nutritional benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Raw cacao is high in resveratrol ( like wine ! ) which has been known to regulate blood flow and shield nerve cells from damage . It also contains the chemical anandamide , known as the " bliss molecule . " So if your child craves a candy bar when they 're upset , do n't  go for the chocolate . Go for cacao ! <p> Its not as sweet , but you grow to appreciate it . I like to add cacao nibs to pancakes , waffles , muffins and energy balls . <h> Oat <p> Oh , oats ! Packed with B vitamins , magnesium , dietary fiber and zinc , oats have become a must-have in our kitchen . They have been found to reduce anxiety , suppress symptoms of depression and boost energy . Oats do n't  have to be eaten just as oatmeal ! Try adding them to baked goods like muffins and bread , blend them in smoothies , ground them into flour , or soak them overnight . And if you or your child are sensitive to gluten , opt for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned rolled oats in my food processor and make flour out of them . I then use it in my meatballs , meatloaves and other recipes that- call- for flour . <h> Cashews <p> Cashews are extremely high in copper and iron , which- helps to uplift fatigue- ( hello , energy boost ! ) and are loaded with healthy fats to maintain a strong heart and overall bodily function .

Since they were not spill proof cups , it was a lot easier for my twins to get the water up the straw , since they did n't have to work so hard . I wanted to quickly transition out of these cups because my twins loved to take the straw out and turn the cups upside down and shake them . Let 's just say I wanted to toss these toss-aways fast . <p> We tried all kinds of sippy cups and settled with ones that leaked every time , were hard to clean , and were hard for our twins to use . Not intentionally , but that 's how it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had already bought five or so different types of cups at this point . So , what is an overtired mother to do ? Well do n't ask a friend for a recommendation and then order 16 of the same cups without really trying them . Rookie mistake ! <h> Straw Cups Are Hard at First <p> For young babies , the straw might be why your child is n't taking to it . Some kids really struggle at first with a straw . It requires strong muscles to suck the liquid up the straw , especially if they are the spill proof ones . I 've tried myself , and it 's actually hard to get liquid out of them . My twins would get frustrated and quit before the milk or water actually made it up the straw . <p> There were times I would suck up the milk for them and then hand it over quickly and they would just keep drinking from that point .

Its important your child develops these muscles in their tongue , cheeks , and lips , which will help them when they start speaking. - <h> Dangers to Look Out For : <p> Does n't every parent article try to scare you ? Why should this one be any different ? <p> Do n't  let kids run with sippy cups . Many kids go to the ER every month because they were moving around while using their sippy cup .

If you are in an accident , the cup can become a projectile that can cause serious injury to someone in the car . <p> Do n't let your children sleep with their sippy cups . It can lead to tooth decay . Tooth decay and gum disease is a growing and often not discussed issue facing young children <p> Wash every part of the cup . Cups grow mold in the weirdest places . Try to find cups with fewer parts and take all the parts apart to wash them . I know this can be incredibly annoying ! I had to do it times two . <p> Find cups that can go in the dishwasher .
