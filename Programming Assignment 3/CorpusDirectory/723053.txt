@@120934572 @9934572/ <p> We have a mix of choppy waters and smooth sailing this week . The rough waters are due to the Cancer planets under pressure . Then Mercury and Venus change signs within a day of each other , adding more fire and air to the sky . We also have a serious minded Full Moon in Capricorn to look forward to this weekend . <p> Let 's start with those pesky aspects to Mercury , the Sun and Mars in Cancer . Shortly before Mercury leaves Cancer 's waters for fiery Leo on Wednesday , it will square Uranus in Aries on Tuesday . Verbal battles could explode out of nowhere with painful results . We need to be extra careful about what we say and who we say it to or risk harming an important relationship . <p> Wednesday the Cancer Sun will be trine Neptune in Pisces and square Jupiter in Libra . The first aspect is very empathetic and forgiving while the second one is anything but . We could end up with a serious case of cognitive dissonance which is bound to give all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the final inconjunct between Jupiter in Libra and Neptune in Pisces which occurs Tuesday night . The lack of clarity brought into play by this inconjunct will gradually clear up by the end of the week . <p> The final pair of harsh aspects happens on Sunday when Mars in Cancer is inconjunct Saturn in Sagittarius and the Cancer Sun opposes Pluto in Capricorn . Of the two , the Mars-Saturn inconjunct will probably be the most crazy-making since Cancer and Sagittarius find each other 's motives incomprehensible . When Cancer feels threatened it retreats into its shell but Sagittarius runs out the door for the freedom of wide open spaces . Cancer 's focus is on home and family while Sagittarius loves to explore foreign lands . The Cancer Sun may very easily choose to cooperate with Pluto in Capricorn if it feels Pluto can protect it from forces that threaten ideals of home and family so dear to Cancer . Another option might be to work on finding a healthy balance between our home life and our professional lives . Both of these aspects are key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Venus both make harmonious aspects to Chiron in Pisces shortly before both change signs . On Monday Venus in Taurus is sextile Chiron and on Wednesday Mercury is trine Chiron . Both promote making loving gestures and healing words a top priority . <p> On Tuesday Venus dances into spritely Gemini and turns on the charm . When Mercury arrives in lordly Leo on Wednesday it too will turn to the bright side and take on a much more optimistic outlook . Mercury in Leo and Venus in Gemini will make an exact sextile on Friday , perfect for enjoying social activities of all types . <p> The lunar week starts off on a watery note with a happy Scorpio Moon enjoying being part of a Grand Trine in water with the Cancer Sun and Neptune in Pisces . This ought to give a nice flow to the day since there will be five planets in water ( Cancer Sun , Scorpio Moon , Mercury in Cancer , Mars in Cancer and Neptune in Pisces ) . ( F.Y.I. to water signs , Monday and Tuesday are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth in abundance . ) <p> We 're lucky to have another Grand Trine in water on Tuesday to help offset the effects of an unpredictable Mercury-Uranus square . The Scorpio Moon , Mercury in Cancer and Chiron in Pisces harmonize beautifully and add much needed empathy to the atmosphere . The Scorpio Moon will go void-of-course Tuesday evening and dash into fiery Sagittarius during the night . Take extra care to play nice today whether you have to work or are enjoying the Fourth of July Holiday here in the US . <p> We wake up to a very different tone on Wednesday because not only is the Moon in fiery Sagittarius but Venus shifted into playful Gemini yesterday and Mercury enters outgoing Leo Wednesday evening . The Sagittarius Moon herself makes no aspects until before dawn on Thursday , giving us a day to embrace the freewheeling Sagittarius goodness . With fire and air back in ascendance , the atmosphere is less reactive and people will be more open to socializing again . <p> On Thursday , the Sagittarius Moon will enjoy her monthly sextile to Jupiter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another aspect until she conjoins Saturn Thursday evening . Thursday and Friday appear to be the most productive days this week with Thursday being the better day for meetings . Having a preponderance of fire and air also lifts our spirits and gives our energy a boost . <p> Friday we start off with the Sagittarius Moon going void-of-course for around three hours before she enters industrious Capricorn midday . Once she is in Capricorn she 'll make no major aspects for over twenty four hours . For those who need to focus on finishing up their work week in style , the Capricorn Moon should prove very helpful because she knows how to work efficiently . <p> The Moon will remain in Capricorn for the weekend , and this Moon is n't exactly a party animal . . . well , she can be but only under the right circumstances . This weekend does n't look like it will bring those . On Saturday the Moon squares Jupiter in Libra late afternoon/early evening not too long before the Full Moon in Capricorn happening during the night . Practical tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into the office to work , while others will focus on working around the home . <p> An irritating event hits us on Sunday when the Capricorn Moon opposes Mars in Cancer in the morning and goes on to square Uranus in Aries during the evening . We 'll also be absorbing the impact of the Full Moon in Capricorn at the same time , so my recommendation is to channel any excess energy into simple , productive projects . In other words , we need to do something to keep our bodies moving but allow our minds to run free . <p> We have a very active sky this week with plenty of major aspects and two planets changing signs plus a Full Moon in Capricorn . Please do your best to go with the flow and be patient with those who are n't . Something else we 'll need to adjust to is the week starting off on the damp side and ending up hot and dry . There is no better time to practice kindness , tolerance and forgiveness !

@@120934639 @9934639/ <p> Although I am a " synastry-holic " person , the idea of studying Donald Trumps and Melanias synastry was never particularly appealing to me . As most people , I was seeing these two as an unscrupulous businessman and an avid " gold-digger " by his side , So , to me there was n't interesting stuff there . Not to mention the fact that nobody seemed to know Melanias time of birth , meaning that an eventual synastric study of theirs would be rather incomplete . But things have changed and Donald Trump is now the elected president of the United States while his wife Melania the First Lady ! A synastric study of theirs seems more appealing than ever . <p> Let 's take a quick look at their natal charts . Donald has a versatile Gemini Sun , while his Moon resides in the fiery and expansive sign of Sagittarius . His Ascendant is in the regal sign of Leo ( although in the very last degree of it ) ! - Donald was born during a Lunar Eclipse ( and probably this has to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ) . <p> Let 's move on to Melania now . We are still lacking her verified time of birth so we do n't  actually know her Ascendant nor the " domification " of her planets ( thus there are no Houses in her chart the one you see bellow while the reported time of birth is a conventional one ) . In such a case we are obliged to focus mainly on the signs of the " Luminaries " ( Sun and Moon ) . But even there the lack of Melanias time of birth produces a controversy , because if she were born before 1:27 am ( Slovenia time ) she would then have a Sagittarius Moon ( the same as Donalds ) . But if she were born after 1:27 am she would have a Capricorn Moon and that would make all the difference . <p> If both Donald and Melania have a Sagittarius Moon then you can see the power of their synastry right in front of your eyes ! When two people share the same Moon in the same sign and in conjunction they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rich emotional flux is developed among them and a profound " comprehension " of each other . And although the time frame for this to occur is relatively small ( 00:00 to 01:27 am ) there is a strong probability that Melania was indeed born within that specific time frame . Mathematically though the odds are against it and she might very well have been born after 1:27 am having thus a Capricorn Moon . In that eventuality things would change drastically both for Melania and for their relationship . You see , Melania would then have a Taurus Sun and a Capricorn Moon , an extremely earthy and realistic combination , prone to materialism and social climbing ( especially if the individual is attuned to the " lower frequencies " of the Taurus Capricorn combo ) ! <p> Well , to many of you that might sound a lot like Melania but to a Synastry connoisseur the striking fact ( with this Capricorn Moon scenario ) is that Melanias chart bears no astrological affinity to Donalds chart ! Her- " Lights " are too earthy and " feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his " Lights " are " airy-fiery " and both " masculine " ( Sun in Gemini and Moon in Sagittarius ) . There is no common astrological ground among them . Actually , their two charts not only do not bear any resemblance whatsoever but in addition they are not even remotely compatible ! Here is the " bi-wheel of their Synastry ( the inner chart is Donalds and the outer one is Melanias ) . <p> So , what 's going on with the Donald Melania Trump relationship ? Is theirs an arranged match , a mere marriage of convenience ? Because under an astrological point of view the two do not seem to be compatible at all . Well , that 's not entirely true , as there are at play here some astrological elements that are rather invisible at first sight but crucial in the long run . I have personally developed a relative theory , where I call these " difficult to spot " elements " Latent Synastric Elements " ( LA.S.E. in abbreviation , you may read the gist of this theory in my article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , at the " Sasstrology " website ) . <p> As you know , the Sun in a womans horoscope is telling us a lot about the type of the masculine figure she is mostly attracted to . In Melanias case her Sun forms a conjunction to her Saturn , thus her ideal masculine archetype should be an authoritative , socially recognized and probably older than her figure . Trump actually represents all these traits . Furthermore , Melanias Sun Saturn conjunction bears a strong affinity to Donalds Sun in the Tenth House ( which is traditionally representing Saturnian values ) ! <p> In addition , Melanias Sun forms an opposition to her Jupiter , thus her ideal man should have some Jupiterian traits too ( he should be exuberant , optimistic , larger than life and " rich " ( figuratively or literally speaking ) . And Donald is Jupiterian alright , since one of his " Lights " ( his Moon ) is in Sagittarius ( the sign ruled by Jupiter ) , while his Sun is forming a trine aspect to his Jupiter ! <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Venus ( a pivotal planet in love affairs , indicating the attributes of our ideal partner ) is replicating almost identically the planetary aspects of- Melanias Sun ( his Venus is conjuncting his Saturn and is forming a challenging aspect to his Jupiter ) ! These should be accounted as latent synastric elements ! <p> Another important LA.S.E. in this relationship stems out from the fact that Melanias Sun in Taurus is synastrically " falling " in Donalds Ninth House . As we saw before , Donald is very Jupiterian ( his Sun is trining his Jupiter and his Moon resides in Sagittarius ) . But with this 9th House domification Melania ( although a rigid Taurus ) somehow acquires Sagittarian traits , when interacting with Donald ! And this he definitely loves , because Melania is ever aggrandizing him , she is ever lifting him up , making him see the brighter side of life ! She might be even learning him things while she definitely makes him laugh <p> Actually , as we delve deeper in their Synastry we realize that Melania is the " stabilizer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship ! And Donald needs a lot of " grounding " for sure , having both his " Lights " in mutable signs . And Melania is complementing him in other ways too . Surprisingly , Donalds Moon resides in a very emotional , tender , family orientated sector of his chart ( in his Fourth House ) . In that sector the Moon is much dignified . But there is another side to it , as the Fourth House Moon might often be ultra sensitive and touchy . If Melania has a Capricorn she is then complementing and strengthening that sensitive side of Donald Trump . And she does that even more so if take in consideration the fact that her Venus and Mars are synastrically falling in his Tenth House ( meaning that she becomes even more Capricornian when interacting with him ) ! <p> We already mentioned that planet Venus is of paramount importance in love affairs . Melanias Venus is conjuncting her Mercury , meaning that her ideal partner should have some " mercurian " traits , he should be witty , versatile , communicative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald definitely is one ( as he belongs to the sign of Gemini , ruled by Mercury ) . <p> Another part of Melania craves for a Martian partner ( as her Venus is forming a conjunction to her Mars too ) . And Donald has been since his early childhood the martian type of guy ( his Mars in conjuncting his Leonian Ascendant and he was feared by many of his school mates ) . Even more so , Melania craves specifically for a Martian Gemini type of man ( as her Mars resides in the sign of Gemini ) . Well , Donald absolutely fulfills that side of hers ! <p> Melania has a Moon Uranus square aspect and Donald has a Sun Uranus conjunction . So they both have a Uranian colored " Light " and that should be accounted as a " latent " synastric element as well . <p> This is n't by no means a complete study of Donalds and Melanias synastry . They do have many interesting " explicit " synastric inter-aspects ( like the ones of Pluto , Neptune etc . ) That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and an exhaustive synastric analysis should normally take something- like 15 20 pages ) . In this article I tried to give you a different synastric point of view on the Donalds Melanias relationship , focusing mainly on their " latent " synastric elements , which although not very obvious are utterly conditioning the quality of a relationship !

Meanwhile the secondary progressed horoscope of the country indicates the country 's evolution and its developing needs . If we take the Obama campaign in 2008 as an example . On election day ( Nov 4th ) Saturn and Uranus were exactly opposite each other , in Virgo , Pisces . Barack Obama largely funded his campaign through collecting small internet donations from a broad base of supporters . Obama 's campaign motto Change we can believe in ' , his Afro-American roots , his Moon in Aquarius ( the same sign as the US Moon ) , the fact that he would be the first black President , all these things combined suggested that Obama was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US was rounding off transit Uranus trine radix Sun and was clearly resonating with Uranus .

On election day , the country went with the mantra change ' . The last time a presidential election was held in the year of a Saturn/Neptune square , was in November 1980 , and it was a landslide win for Ronald Reagan . As things stand , Hillary is definitely ahead in the polls and short of an act of God , I ca n't see how anything will stop her at this stage .

The last year or more , Jupiter in Virgo opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sagittarius . This shape shifting , unsettling transiting t-square left an empty space in Gemini , - i.e. the space exactly opposite the focal planet , Saturn . The energy peaked in June just before the UK Referendum on Europe . It was interesting to see the Gemini 's lining up to seize their moment in the limelight . Boris Johnson , Jeremy Corbyn , and in the US , Donald Trump are three Gemini 's definitely worth a mention . With the recent Jupiter/ Libra ingress , the relentless mental and spiritual poundings of Jupiter in Virgo have subsided . The final Saturn/Neptune square has also passed . This particular t-square is no longer in its prime . Donald Trump " whose secondary progressed Sun had been lording it in Leo " looks less sparkly since it crossed the boundary of Virgo in mid August . In terms of essential dignity " Donald Trump 's sun has now passed its peak of influence . Trump has a radix Saturn/Venus conjunction in Cancer which falls exactly on the US Mercury " ruler of the US seventh house of partners but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about having someone like Donald Trump as a spokesperson for the country .

Mercury rules okay ! <h> Astrology insight : Clinton vs Trump and BeyondHillary Clinton however , is a totally different kettle of fish . If ever a Presidential nominee embodied Pluto , I believe Clinton to be this person . Pluto in Capricorn is closely bound up with the establishment , the networks and corridors of power , the scheming behind closed doors , the relentless pursuit of ambition , the acquisition of wealth , the dreaded invisible hand ' . - Whitewater , Filegate , Travelgate , Podesta , her deleted emails , the Clinton Foundation troubles , Hillary Clinton has been round the block so many times she should be dizzy . Yet , the muck does n't stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just goes high ' . <h> At this point , I want to touch on the bigger picture and events that are not just related to the US but are visible in Europe as well . Pluto 's current placement in Capricorn is part of an of axis , which has Cancer at its opposite pole . Massage one end of this axis " and the other side is automatically invoked . Cancer is Moon ruled and in astrology the Moon is related to the people . Pluto in Capricorn has made us deeply aware of the profound cultural changes that have taken place which have transformed the work force and society as a whole . We have entered a post-industrial age and there is growing divide between the rich and poor . The collapse of manufacturing , the global markets , cheap labour , outsourcing , the influx of newcomers , the rules of austerity which have shrunk the welfare state , have led to resentment and to the emergence of new forms of populism . The core message of people like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump is anti-establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called wisdom of the ordinary people . Or in the words of Nigel Farage the little people have had enough ' . There can be no doubt that this is Moon talk .

Viewed from this perspective the emergence of Donald Trump is totally within the current planetary remit . Donald Trump 's Sun is trine the US Moon . A vote for Trump , Farage , Brexit is a vote against the above mentioned rapid cultural change that Pluto in Capricorn has made us acutely aware of . <h> Astrology insight : Clinton vs Trump and BeyondThe horoscope for what certainly looks to be the Clinton inauguration is interesting as it blows new life into the cardinal cross that dominated the astrological atmosphere in 2014 ( see chart below ) .

Meanwhile the secondary progressed horoscope of the country indicates the country 's evolution and its developing needs . If we take the Obama campaign in 2008 as an example . On election day ( Nov 4th ) Saturn and Uranus were exactly opposite each other , in Virgo , Pisces . Barack Obama largely funded his campaign through collecting small internet donations from a broad base of supporters . Obama 's campaign motto Change we can believe in ' , his Afro-American roots , his Moon in Aquarius ( the same sign as the US Moon ) , the fact that he would be the first black President , all these things combined suggested that Obama was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US was rounding off transit Uranus trine radix Sun and was clearly resonating with Uranus .

On election day , the country went with the mantra change ' . The last time a presidential election was held in the year of a Saturn/Neptune square , was in November 1980 , and it was a landslide win for Ronald Reagan . As things stand , Hillary is definitely ahead in the polls and short of an act of God , I ca n't see how anything will stop her at this stage .

Boris Johnson , Jeremy Corbyn , and in the US , Donald Trump are three Gemini 's definitely worth a mention . With the recent Jupiter/ Libra ingress , the relentless mental and spiritual poundings of Jupiter in Virgo have subsided . The final Saturn/Neptune square has also passed . This particular t-square is no longer in its prime . Donald Trump " whose secondary progressed Sun had been lording it in Leo " looks less sparkly since it crossed the boundary of Virgo in mid August .

Mercury rules okay ! <h> Astrology insight : Clinton vs Trump and BeyondHillary Clinton however , is a totally different kettle of fish . If ever a Presidential nominee embodied Pluto , I believe Clinton to be this person .

Pluto 's current placement in Capricorn is part of an of axis , which has Cancer at its opposite pole . Massage one end of this axis " and the other side is automatically invoked . Cancer is Moon ruled and in astrology the Moon is related to the people . Pluto in Capricorn has made us deeply aware of the profound cultural changes that have taken place which have transformed the work force and society as a whole . We have entered a post-industrial age and there is growing divide between the rich and poor . The collapse of manufacturing , the global markets , cheap labour , outsourcing , the influx of newcomers , the rules of austerity which have shrunk the welfare state , have led to resentment and to the emergence of new forms of populism . The core message of people like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump is anti-establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so called wisdom of the ordinary people . Or in the words of Nigel Farage the little people have had enough ' . There can be no doubt that this is Moon talk .

Viewed from this perspective the emergence of Donald Trump is totally within the current planetary remit . Donald Trump 's Sun is trine the US Moon . A vote for Trump , Farage , Brexit is a vote against the above mentioned rapid cultural change that Pluto in Capricorn has made us acutely aware of . <h> Astrology insight : Clinton vs Trump and BeyondThe horoscope for what certainly looks to be the Clinton inauguration is interesting as it blows new life into the cardinal cross that dominated the astrological atmosphere in 2014 ( see chart below ) .

If you are a good observer you will notice that there are six more progressed/transiting planets located at the 20th degree of their respective signs ! <p> Progressed Mercury at the 20th degree of Virgo <p> Transiting Jupiter at the 20th degree of Libra <p> Transiting Saturn at the 20th degree of Sagittarius <p> Transiting Venus at the 20th degree of Aquarius <p> Transiting Uranus at the 20th degree of Aries - <p> Progressed Venus at the 20th degree of Leo perfectly conjuncting his Moon ! <p> Now , that 's quite a rarity ! Six ( progressed or transiting ) planets located at the very same 20th degree ( and we are not counting here the progressed planets Jupiter and Saturn , falling short of the 20th degree by just mere minutes of arc ) definitely constitute a planetary " over-tuning " !

So , on the Christmas day of 2016 too much planetary energies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , to say the least <p> But there is more to it . On that fatal day Michaels progressed Venus was perfectly conjuncting his Moon ( in a partile aspect ) ! This seems to be a very sweet , docile conjunction ( maybe he died in some quiet and serene manner ) . But in reality Venus is not that " docile " in the superstars chart . You see , Venus is the ruler of the zodiacal sign of Taurus . But in Georges chart the sign of Taurus is what we call " intercepted " ( it is entirely comprised in the 11th House , with no House cusp crossing it ) . This denotes a deep rooted blockage and possibly an inherent inability of some kind ! Scorpio is also intercepted , representing some sexual intimacy blockage . According to Joanne Wickenberg ( who developed the theory ) the outlet for such blockages is provided by the so called " duplicated " signs ( Leo and Aquarius in Michaels case , meaning that his outlets were creativity in general , the extravaganzas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is that in Michaels chart both Venus and Pluto are rulers of " intercepted signs " and as such might have some unusual attributes . This means that the partile conjunction of his progressed Venus to his natal Moon should not be interpreted just in the usual way but under some new , insightful perspective as well . <p> Of course , if one over-scrutinizes Michaels " death tri-wheel " s/he will eventually find ( there are many " all finding " astrologers ) several " death configurations " in it ( i.e. transiting Mars and North Node aspecting his deadly Uranus Pluto duet with Uranus being the ruler of his Eighth House . Progressed Saturn in the Eighth , transiting Uranus over his natal Jupiter or transiting Neptune opposing his natal Pluto or any near eclipse over his vital points ) . Well , these configurations might have their own merit but they are not giving us the full picture . Because ultimately the astrological study of George Michaels death grows to a study of the " over-tuning " of the planetary energies ( regardless of the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the rather neglected theory of the so called " intercepted " and " duplicated " signs . The " all finding " astrologers might learn something out of it !

After that the Moon will be void-of-course until late Wednesday afternoon . <p> Whenever the Moon is void-of-course , we 're better off staying with routine matters than attempting to start working on something new and that applies to Wednesday during business hours . When the Moon bursts into fiery Sagittarius late afternoon/early evening , she could inspire us to call some friends to get together over dinner . An opposition to quick witted Mercury in Gemini ought to keep conversations lively and spiced with witty remarks to keep us laughing . <p> Thursday the Sagittarius Moon makes no aspects until she enjoys a sextile to Jupiter in Libra during the evening . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a brisk walk over your lunch hour . A late evening square to Neptune in Pisces sends us off into dreamland for better or worse . <p> The Full Moon in Sagittarius takes place early Friday morning and Jupiter in Libra stations direct about an hour later . It will be evening before the Moon catches up to Saturn in Sagittarius which may bring a welcome dose of reality . During the night the Sagittarius Moon will be trine Uranus in Aries before going void-of-course until dawn . <p> The weekend features the Moon in Capricorn , who would rather be working than doing something frivolous . Midday Saturday the Capricorn Moon will oppose Mars in Cancer and later in the afternoon she will be trine Venus in Taurus . This suggests we may be happier working around the house with our families doing some sort of home improvement project than attending social occasions under duress . <p> Sunday looks equally quiet with a pleasant Capricorn Moon-Neptune in Pisces sextile midday and an evening conjunction with Pluto in Capricorn . Both of these aspects favor spending time alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . <p> Since we 'll need a few days to adjust to Venus and Mercury changing signs , it is fortunate the sky is relatively quiet this week . The Full Moon in Sagittarius is going to be enough of a pot stirrer to prevent boredom from setting in for those who thrive on action . Thursday and Friday are the best days for social activities , something we can take or leave the rest of the week .

Aims and ambition , plans and projects , status and reputation are all in the spotlight and moving forward again , sometimes suddenly or in unconventional ways . Do n't be put off by limits or delays at end of May , however unsurmountable they temporarily appear ; and do look forward to new communication and connections with the new moon from 25th . <p> Leo <p> 23rd July " 23rd August <p> Recently , you reached to the past for faith and perspective .

From 3rd , Mercury moves forward , which might mean you 're re-encountering issues that were a sticking point then , but you 're now ready for a different approach . This is most noticeable during first week of May , and during the finance and resources ' focused full moon ( 10th ) , when situations might move surprisingly fast , also 13th .

Creative projects also get the green light , perhaps in surprising , sudden or unique ways ; so no matter how many times something has n't worked , May can be the month it does ( perhaps around 10th , 12thand 19th ) . It 's also a time to work on relationships , contracts and agreements : the Sun moves into this area of your chart from the 20th , and there are new beginnings in store with the new moon there on the 25th ; so do n't let limits define you , or close your mind , by end of the month . <p> Capricorn <p> 22nd December " 20th January <p> Your ruling planet , sensible Saturn , is in positive relationship to unconventional and experimental planet Uranus for much of May , most powerfully around 19th .

Sounds like a clash of opposites , but this is a positive meeting , so it blends into a time to plan and shape your wildest dreams and watch them flow into easy fruition ( but do n't be put off by challenges during final week ) . Friends , groups and gatherings might play an important part in events , along with communication , messaging , and even local neighbourhood ( 10th , 12th , 19th , 25th ) .

The motion forward might be fast , unpredictable or erratic at times but it 's there , especially around a full moon ( 10th ) that focuses on learning , communication , travel , and faith in your road ahead . The Sun warms and energises your home and family chart from the 20th , and there 's a new moon of new beginnings there on the 25th . The challenges of the final week can trigger defensive or protective behaviour but do n't let this shut down a burning desire for new adventures .

Most of the major players are present and aspecting each other : Jupiter in Libra , Saturn in Sagittarius , Uranus in Aries and Pluto in Capricorn . <p> The Cancer Moon and Capricorn Sun are part of a Cardinal Grand Cross with Jupiter in Libra opposing Uranus in Aries harking back to the Cardinal Grand Cross during the first part of 2014 . The biggest difference between the two Grand Crosses is Uranus in Aries is the only planet to take part in both , and the only true outer planet in the current one . A Grand Cross is a very stable pattern and can lead to long term stalemate situations . It is entirely possible we will end up once again dealing with issues that emerged in 2014 concerning family , security , risky behaviors and failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big factor and unless we are willing to take a step or two outside of our comfort zones , the existing stalemate will probably continue . <p> Another difference on this Full Moon is the positive presence of Saturn in Sagittarius . Saturn is trine Uranus in Aries and sextile Jupiter in Libra . This suggests we can draw on Saturn 's wisdom and Jupiter 's upbeat attitude to come up with workarounds that will allow everyone to move on with their lives . Saturn helps tone down some of Uranus in Aries 's more extreme solutions and at the same time extracts fresh , new approaches to help resolve old issues . How badly we want to break free of our current stasis and get on with our lives may determine how willing we are to make the necessary compromises to achieve that . <p> Pluto in Capricorn is far enough out of orb now for his influence to be weakened but I suspect we 'll still feel his sullen involvement . Those who have personal planets and Ascendant from 16- to 18- in the cardinal signs ( Aries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel obsessive behaviors creeping in . Pluto in Capricorn can and will bring about change but his ideas usually involve a scorched earth policy that leaves nothing in its wake . He is still widely conjunct the Capricorn Sun ( partile on January 6 ) and that means he also opposes the Cancer Moon . Family relationships in particular could be permanently severed at this time . <p> A more benign aspect with Pluto is the sextile to Mars in Pisces . I see this one as stiffening Mars in Pisces 's spine and bringing out a latent Mars in Scorpio effect . This may bring more passion and conviction to our love lives . <p> Do n't forget Venus is now in Pisces and conjoins Neptune on this lunation . It is definitely time to spice things up with a little glamour and fantasy ! Falling in love under these influences could be a fascinating experience though a little risky .

People may shoot off their mouths and almost immediately regret doing so under this influence . Mercury in Capricorn can be very closemouthed , unlike outspoken Mercury in Sagittarius . Please take a few moments to carefully consider whether or not it would be worth it to blurt out whatever is on your mind . Once Mercury reenters Capricorn it will be there until February 8 . <p> There is bound to be some emotional upheaval under the Full Moon in sensitive Cancer and that may obscure important messages surfacing now but if we pay attention , we have an opportunity to pick up on themes that will be in play for much of the year . The combination of cool , pragmatism and intuition available on this lunation are perfect for figuring out what to retain and what to discard . Keeping our hearts and minds open is critical to finding our way to a better future . As always , practice kindness , patience and tolerance .

@@120934901 @9934901/ <h> Astrology Think Tank : One of the aims of an astrology think tank is to use astrological knowledge of horoscopes and cycles to influence the course of action . I opened this three part series on the EU referendum by questioning David Cameron 's wisdom in calling it under a mutable cross . I suggested that Cameron should have waited for Jupiter to enter his own sign Libra and for the positive planetary reception between Jupiter and Saturn to establish itself . This is sound astrological advice . In the second part I looked at important degree areas and considered a possible knee jerk reaction ' as UK ascendant ruler Venus moves out of bounds on referendum day prompting the UK to plough its own course . I gave my take on the result " suggesting that the UK would remain in the EU . Now , in this last part of the series , I will look at the horoscopes of the EU ( horoscope 1 ) , Boris Johnson , David Cameron and Nigel Farage . <h> Astrology Think Tank : It is clear when looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its main aims . The Moon is in Taurus conjunct the South Node : literally a reconstruction project , from the ground up . The fixed signs are related to values and Neptune conjunct the North Node in Scorpio " one arm of a fixed cross " points us towards collective shared values that will not be easily won . While the close Moon/Uranus square has the potential for break-ups and break downs , the EU horoscope has a very earthy , pragmatic Sun/Moon trine : there is a very definite core commitment to its main aims , economic and political security . The EU is about to enter its second Saturn return . This is a great time for a re-think , a re-focus and a re-view . What are the core values ( Sagittarius ) of Europe ? What is its main vision ?

Saturn will transit EU ascendant and MC ruler Mercury in 2017 " before moving across the IC ( and the galactic center ) and entering its home sign Capricorn . Given the fact that the EU and the UK have the Sun in the same degree " this transit could either consolidate and close the deal " or indicate major obstacles in the negotiations . <h> Astrology Think Tank : Nigel Farage ( horoscope 2 ) is very much the man of the moment . The angles of his chart resonate with the current overdose of mutable energy . You could call him a planetary spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this message has been pretty- shocking . Farage is currently bolstered by Uranus transiting his sun sign . Farage 's exalted me first ' Aries Sun " squares UK Capricorn sun " which in a mundane sense translates as a projected struggle for UK first . However , I am concerned that the UK political arena has simply become a battle ground for Farage 's own self aggrandizement . Farage image is that of a rebellious , drinking , smoking lad ' , however , we should not forget that he described his party UKIP as the fox inside the Westminster hen house . The UK/Farage composite chart ( horoscope 3 below ) does not present a pretty picture . Sun square Saturn conjunct the North Node reeks of authoritarianism . Fear of the other is a powerful drug and the- campaign poster Farage released only yesterday , suggest he is currently administering large doses of it to the UK public . Given the UK 's resonance with the Saturn/Neptune cycle , the current transiting Saturn/Neptune square " picks up Nigel Farage 's horoscope quite magnificently . It is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is transiting Farage 's 4th house and is squaring his- asc/desc axis .

Cameron 's vision is Conservative but clearly much less far right ' . He is an establishment figure . Farage is not . With his chart ruler Venus conjunct the UK ascendant , the image Cameron projects resonates with the image the UK has of itself . This single aspect goes a long way to explaining his majority second term in office . Cameron 's powerful Mars in Leo is conjunct UK Saturn : he is the youngest PM in over 200 years. - Both Mars &amp; Saturn are currently suffering from a a stinging , long transit of Mars in Scorpio . Much more worrying for Cameron is transit Pluto in the fourth house which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , Cameron needs to take the gloves off , he needs to be prepared to come out from behind his Libran facade and get into the fray . He needs to toughen up his act if he is to channel this energy successfully. - If he does n't , I am afraid he will be seen to be weak . I would recommend " and I really hate myself for saying this " that he watch some Maggie Thatcher videos ! Cameron has power at his finger tips now " though unlike his nemesis , Farage , he is unsure how to use it . I get the feeling that the status quo , his self image , or both are too important " though on reflection in the light of the horrific killing of Jo Cox " restraint could also be viewed as a virtue . Unlike Farage , Cameron 's Uranus/Pluto conjunction is under wraps in the 12th house . Both Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson are currently experiencing the transit of Saturn in square to radix Pluto . This fires up ambition , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both have been hammering their message out or should I better say , forcing it down our throats ? - Cameron 's polite voice became lost in the din . The composite UK/Cameron ( horoscope 5 below ) is also somewhat unsettling . Mars in Cancer is unaspected on the midheaven and therefore lacking clout . Venus is conjunct Pluto and opposite Saturn which is precisely the energy the country is wrestling with at the moment . On the plus side , the chart has a protective Sun/Moon trine and a composite Jupiter which emphasizes radix Jupiter in the 10th . More advice for Cameron : push home the benefits EU membership has for small business ( radix UK Jupiter rules the 3/6 houses ) , get more EU success stories out there , go for good headlines . Ultimately Jupiter in Leo is far more interested in hearing about success than about failure . In other words , keep it positive . <h> Astrology Think Tank : Last but not least , the horoscope of Boris Johnson ( below ) , a Gemini , who has natal Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK 's secondary progressed ascendant is currently in the ninth house and it is conjunct with Johnson 's Mercury . His vision of the future of the UK clearly resonates with a lot of people . Again , with 7 out of 10 radix planets in mutable signs and born under a mutable t-square with Mars as focal planet , Boris Johnson is yet another man of the moment . Mentally agile , a complete opportunist , Johnson is perfectly positioned to pick the chestnuts out of the fire . Under a mundane Jupiter/Pluto trine , any fool will tell you , chaos spawns opportunities for some . Like Cameron , Johnson also shares a Libran ascendant with the UK . Though Johnson 's Venus is very closely conjunct the Sun , the conjunction is unaspected . It seems to me like its not really going anywhere . Boris Johnson lacks weight , he might be amusing , but he lacks gravitas . Of the Gemini planets , only Mars is really aspected and it is square to both Saturn and Uranus . When challenged massive fissures open up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex Salmond . Boris had been consistently mis-quoting a report- and was forced to admit , he had n't actually read it . So my honest opinion on both Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage , is that their vision for the UK is populist , simplistic and self-serving . The road to hell is paved with good intentions " but with Farage and Johnson calling the shots , the UK 's stature , power and potential can only be diminished . <h> On a final note , I would like to mention the UK Pluto transit opposite the Moon ( 3x between Jan. &amp; Nov. 2018 ) : The current cycle began under a 5x drawn out conjunction between September 1929 and June 1931 . In particular 1929 is etched into collective memory . On October 28th " following the Wall Street Crash " there was a sharp fall in the London UK Stock exchange . Huge unemployment followed . On March 1st 1931 , fascist , Oswald Mosley formed the New Part - which would later became the British Union of Fascists . There was enormous financial hardship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle is round I started this series noting the rarity of the current mutable cross .. and related it to the dark ages that took hold as the authority of Rome ( also Europe wide in its reach ) crumbled . However , there are huge differences between then and now . The rulers of Imperial Rome were autocratic and despotism was rife . The Emperor was as a god " who ruled through the virtue of an army , with an iron fist . The EU is not ruled by Brussels " though there are those who would have us believe that this is the case . The EU has many voices in the forum and the UK has been welcomed as one of them . Of course when the UK choses to Remain " - this Pluto transit will still come about , but the arena within which it will be operating will have different parameters . <h> I have thoroughly enjoyed working on all three articles .

Finding a way to stay focused and clear in the midst of increasing acceleration is going to be our key task in 2017 . <p> Uranus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 . Even though theyve just had their third and last exact conjunction and wont be together again for another 90 years , they are still conjoined at the moment , and their- influence is going to be felt for years to come . The last time this combination occurred was about 90 years ago , in 1927-28 , when Eris first arrived in Aries . Radio came in at that time and radically changed the way information was disseminated , marking a new era of media influence that continues today via a plethora of electronic media . <p> Uranus is an awakener and Eris a warrior priestess together they are tweaking our awareness- and keeping things unsettled. - The powerful tension created marks a struggle to maintain a unique- self in the midst of so much distraction and unreality . At the same time , through electronic media , - we have become connected to the whole world in a way that can precipitate profound global change . The question becomes : Are those changes for the better ? Is the medium really the message ? ( Marshal McLuhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Many people now get their sense of self and of reality on social media , which makes us very susceptible , not only to fake news , but to becoming- very un-grounded and- lost in a- reflection that merely imitates reality . <p> Current events are showing us just how crazy that can get . Jupiter is currently amplifying all of this unsettledness , increasing and- accelerating the disorientation and plunging us into a vortex of uncertainty . With Pluto continuing its shake down of the system ' , it can seem like nothing is solid or real . <p> All of this instability can create- deep feelings of vulnerability and unease ( Saturn square Chiron ) , triggering anxiety and a sort - of disconnect which slowly becomes- a deep spiritual crisis ( Chiron in Pisces ) . This can be a good thing if it triggers a cathartic change for the better . Anything that gets us- to wake up and smell the coffee ! - But it can also spiral us down deeper into feelings of separation and distrust , and when people feel threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is ours . We know what we have to do . Get connected ! First to our self - and then to each other . <p> Venus -planet of Love " is once again bringing us- her message of love , blessing and healing and a chance to begin anew . Currently- Venus is retrograde in the sign of Aries , and heading back toward Chiron in Pisces . On April 15thshe will give Chiron a powerful , healing kiss , - before she turns back forward and rejoins us as the Morning star . <p> Venus in Aries is about our need for self love . Not narcissism or self aggrandizement ( naming no names ahem cough , cough ) but a true sense of personal value that allows us to give and receive love .. <p> The planet of love traces a perfect pentacle every 8 years. called a pentagram , or a pentangle , one of the oldest symbols on earth , dating from 4,000 years BC . It represents the sacred feminine and is also linked to what is called divine proportion as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one beloved of artists since Renaissance times and also to be found in post-Hellenic art and in the geomantic planning of Templar sites , being those proportions of a rectangle considered most pleasing to the eye .

We do n't  have to be perfect to be lovable . We can be perfectly imperfect . If we do not feel worthy of love , - we will always find a way to sabotage our life and our relationships in an effort to fulfill those negative expectations ( believe me , I know this one ) . - As Venus represents energy exchanges , it also includes our money issues .

@@120934960 @9934960/ <p> After the pair of eclipses , a nice ordinary lunation is quite welcome even if it is on the uncomfortable side . The two eclipses were dominated by cardinal fire but the Full Moon at 22- 13 Virgo on 12 March 2017 , 07:54 AM PDT offers the water and earth signs an opportunity to present their side of the story from a fluid , mutable point of view . <p> The luminaries are caught up with the Jupiter in Libra-Uranus in Aries opposition via semi-sextiles and inconjuncts . An awkward rectangle is created between the four planets and finding a way to resolve the dissonance created by this pattern probably wo n't happen . Additionally Pluto in Capricorn harmoniously aspects the Pisces Sun and Virgo Moon while widely squaring the Jupiter-Uranus opposition . If we want to sell our ideas , base those on good , well documented information rather than flashy , bold theories , and if those ideas benefit those who clearly need help so much the better . Prudent , down to earth strategies are far more likely to be well received . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight square between Virgo 's ruler , Mercury , and Saturn in Sagittarius suggests serious fact checking is going to happen . Be very wary of anyone who is pushing their agenda aggressively and wants an answer NOW because it might be full of inaccurate information that will come back to bite us later . <p> Pisces 's ruler , Neptune , is semi-sextile retrograde Venus in Aries and that does n't bode well for accurately assessing value . Investing a serious amount of money now is not recommended because knowing exactly how much something is worth is the key to smart investing . This aspect may make it challenging to determine whether or not your new love interest is as wonderful as they 'd like you to think they are too . Be cautious , do your homework and hold off on agreeing if your intuition is nagging at you all is not as it should be . <p> We no longer are dealing with impatient Mars in Aries now either . Mars moved into fixed , practical Taurus three days before this lunation , and Mars in Taurus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes no aspects on this lunation but his solid presence adds support to the earth and water contingent . <p> This Full Moon in Virgo is the perfect opportunity to honor all the quiet , sensible people who are there to help us make necessary appointments , find the right information and who work tirelessly on behalf of others . Patience and persistence in the pursuit of good information is what we need now , not more fireworks and drama . Above all , listen closely to the quiet voice within for guidance when it comes to what is the best fit for us.

There are two significant events this week : Mercury leaving subtle Pisces for forthright Aries on Monday and the Pisces Sun squaring Saturn in Sagittarius on Friday . <p> Mercury in the fire signs tends to be very direct and not especially tactful . The only aspect Mercury in Aries makes this week is on Saturday when it will conjoin Venus in Aries . That ought to make for some interesting moments for those out partying this weekend . At least no one is going to be in doubt about whether or not someone is interested in them ! The good thing about Aries directness is if you are n't interested , it is OK to be direct in return . Most of the time , they 'll take it in stride and move on . <p> The Pisces Sun is on the sensitive side this week . It conjoins Chiron on Tuesday and squares Saturn in Sagittarius on Friday . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then being confronted with more reality may lead some to feel like they are being picked on unfairly . This underscores the need to continually work on being as honest and realistic with ourselves and others as possible in order to avoid unpleasant surprises . What these two aspects could reveal this week is how deeply in denial some are , always an uncomfortable situation . <p> The Moon only travels through three signs this week rather than four : Libra , Scorpio and Sagittarius . <p> Late Sunday night/early Monday morning the Moon shifted into Libra where she is feeling more indecisive than usual . Her ruling planet , Venus , is currently retrograde in Aries which leaves her with less oomph . The only aspect the Libra Moon makes Monday is an opposition to Venus during the evening . Usually a Libra Moon is very good for interacting with others and she may still have enough influence to get our week off to a pleasant start . <p> Midday Tuesday the Libra Moon has her monthly square to Pluto in Capricorn followed shortly by an energizing conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposes her , bringing out her argumentative side . The morning should be OK for working with others , but it might be better to work alone as much as possible for the rest of the day . There is a testy confrontive feel to the day . <p> Very early Wednesday morning a sextile to Saturn in Sagittarius can help restore the Libra Moon 's sense of balance before she goes void-of-course for about five hours . After she sinks into Scorpio 's still waters , the Moon will spend most of the day quietly absorbing information while minding her own business . A late afternoon/early evening opposition to Mars in Taurus could make some feel rather cranky . Much of the day favors working on tasks requiring concentration , and most of us focus better with few distractions . <p> Thursday and Friday the Scorpio Moon is trine the Pisces planets , excellent for re-attuning our intuitive antennas . Working on research projects with one or two other people will be more comfortable than being around large groups . Both days should be good for staying on task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Scorpio Moon goes void-of-course during the afternoon on Friday and arrives in dashing Sagittarius during the evening . <p> Adding the fiery Sagittarius Moon will trip the celestial balance for weekend even more strongly to fire and air . If you stayed at home last weekend because no one was in the mood to socialize , you 'll probably make up for that this weekend . There is a very restless , outgoing feel both Saturday and Sunday . <p> Saturday the Sagittarius Moon is trine both Venus and Mercury in Aries during the afternoon before squaring Neptune in Pisces in the evening . As long as we remember to arrange for a designated driver before hand , we can have a grand time with our friends and family . Enjoy the lighthearted , enthusiasm pervading the atmosphere . <p> Sunday has an even more adventurous tone with the Sagittarius Moon sextile Jupiter in Libra in the afternoon and trine Uranus in Aries during the evening . For fire and air folks , the urge to go out and DO SOMETHING will be very strong . Hopefully the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around outside or go for a drive in the country . <p> This is the week leading up to the equinox ( March 20 ) and it is not surprising to see a gradual increase in planets in fire signs . Mercury joins Venus and Uranus in Aries along with Saturn in Sagittarius . Nonetheless , the Sun is still Pisces this week so we have an opportunity to adjust to the sense of impatience more planets in fire bring to the table . We have a brief window of time to collect our thoughts and prepare for the rush of Aries season .

@@120935085 @9935085/ <p> On June 8th , a snap ' general election will take place in the UK . Snap " because the election should have taken place in 2020 , but was called early . Theresa May 's slogan for the election campaign is strong and stable leadership ' " so in this introductory article on the UK election , I will answer the followings questions does the horoscope of Theresa May suggest she is a strong and stable leader ' ? Why did May refuse to take part in last night 's leaders ' debate ? and last but not least , would her election bode well for UK Brexit talks with Europe ? I will begin by saying , that there is no birth time for May " so the horoscope used below is a sun rising chart . <p> Born under the sign of the scales , you would expect the soul to be required to learn the art of balance . Weighing up ideas , sizing up situations , sitting on the bloody fence for hours agonizing over which course of action to take : Libra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that " forget at your peril that Libra is a cardinal sign ! ! Once a decision is taken , Libra can be incredibly resolute . The ruler of May 's Libra Sun is Venus in Leo and in her horoscope , Venus is approaching a conjunction with Pluto and both Venus and Pluto are square Saturn in Scorpio . There is a stubborn , fixed edge to this aspect , which acts like a sharp point . Saturn square Pluto is an aspect of authority " and the burning question is " how is that authority put to use ? Typically , a person with hard Saturn/Pluto aspects will appear very strong , dominant even when in their comfort zone -but very weak when outside it . My first astrology teacher , always referred to the hard Saturn/Pluto aspects as the master or slave ' aspect . Of course , consciousness plays a role- as do other planets favourably aspecting either planet " however in May 's chart , the Saturn/Pluto square is incredibly close . This astrological aspect explains to me , why May refused to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in last night 's debate would have meant engaging with the public and colleagues on a feeling level on live television . This would have put May way out of her comfort zone . With Venus conjunct Saturn " square Pluto I think she was concerned she would come over as stiff , or strict , that she might lose the the argument and hence her power . If feeling weak " she would likely have clammed up ' . The carefully cultured strong and stable ' image of May the Conservatives are marketing , is quite simply too important risk with a tv debate . However , this refusal to take part , to engage is worrying , particularly with a view to the Brexit talks . <p> When May sent her letter to Europe , the threatening tone many European leaders picked up on resonates with Leo square Scorpio " Saturn square Pluto energy . I am a Brit , living in Europe " honestly " European leaders got the message . It seems to me that May has set the tone . Hard on hard " Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM " the discussions with Europe will be rougher and tougher than they need be " and this is partly because of the stance taken . If Europe plays ball " and May can be the boss " can remain detached and powerful within her comfort zone " great . But will Europe really be prepared to bend over backwards ? ? If May is unable to face up to a televised debate , how will she face discussions and talks with European leaders ? The whole hard Brexit ' thing , the idea of walking away from the talks , well to my mind it reeks of an un-evolved , unloved , untended Saturn / Pluto square . <p> Meanwhile back at the birth chart . Jupiter in Virgo is in detriment " Mercury in Virgo is at home , comfortable even when retrograde . Mercury and Jupiter are two aspects of mind . Mercury puts things into words , Jupiter places them in a wider context . Jupiter is opposite Mars in Pisces " which again has a fluid feel to it . We are dealing with mutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overreach followed by back tracking . This aspect is another that clearly undermines the strong and stable ' meme . <p> So will May win the big prize ? She is clearly hungry for power ( Sa/Pl ) and determined to put her ideas into practice ( Me/Ju in Virgo ) . With Jupiter currently transiting her sun sign Libra " and stationing direct on the day of the election " we see here a good planetary signature for success and indeed , for moving forward . This favourable energy is complemented by Saturn , which is currently in trine to May 's Venus . This summer 's solar eclipse on Aug 21 , which falls on May 's Pluto " has done so before in 1998 " however it failed to take the wind out of her sails . So we need some very strong signatures elsewhere , strong enough to counter balance Jupiter " to see another leader at Number 10 .

If it does n't  , it will be in keeping with the sense of unreality that comes with an eclipse with Neptune in Pisces hehe. - - The Sun , representing our conscious awareness , will be , well eclipsed ! - allowing usually hidden , more subconscious elements to come to the fore .

Yet , despite the potential volatility , and insanity , - todays eclipse- contains- blessing and magic . Whatever is revealed today , another layer can be removed , of that thing we need rid of , - of those old programs , - moving us into a quantum shift . <p> This will be a year of surprises , and of acceleration .

This is now the last eclipse of that series , an end to whatever began last year , or to be more accurate , an end to one stage of a larger cycle of radical change. - The effects of this eclipse will still ripple out for months - then in- August the next eclipse will be in Leo/Aquarius . <p> The Nodes of the Moon are about to shift into Leo and Aquarius , and the focus will be around self/other , ideals/social justice/self sovereignty , things I wrote about two weeks ago at he lunar eclipse . <p> And so it goes round and round we go on the carousel of time .

Advice : Do n't  believe everything you read . You should n't anyway and by now you probably do n't  - but this energy could turn out to be particularly sketchy/dodgy. - I would extend that warning to signing documents etc . Wait a week , and/or go over everything several times . <p> Neptune can make us delusional , - our judgement/discernment- is likely to be impaired , and that on top of all that volatility , so do be careful .

This is especially true on this lunation with Pluto , Scorpio 's ruler , sextile the Scorpio Moon and trine the Taurus Sun , adding richness and depth to the Full Moon experience . <p> The agitation in this chart comes from Neptune in Pisces . He squares Mars in Gemini and is inconjunct Jupiter in Libra . These three planets actually form an odd shaped triangle between 13- and 14- in both cardinal signs and mutable signs . The effect is certainly odd in part because Mars is trine Jupiter in Libra . This can create a situation where Mars is dashing around at full speed one minute and collapsed on the couch barely able to move a finger the next .

The Mercury-Uranus conjunction will be exact the day before the Full Moon , and the Mercury-Saturn trine will be exact the day after . Both aspects occurred while Mercury was retrograde and now we may see whether or not our best ideas are bearing fruit . Dramatic breakthroughs are possible now . <p> Venus , Taurus 's ruler , is moving forward in Aries and is unaspected on this lunation .

Thankfully she will arrive in genial Leo about an hour later and start to lighten the atmosphere . Once she is in Leo , the Moon makes no aspects until early tomorrow morning when she will be trine Venus in Aries . If we tread carefully the first part of the morning and do n't step on anyone 's feelings , this should be a easy going day . A warm , friendly Leo Moon creates a good environment for interacting with others . She enjoys spreading goodwill and encourages us to put a big smile on our faces when we are meeting and greeting . This is probably the best day this week to schedule face to face meetings- starting around noon and later .

@@120935121 @9935121/ <p> All the celestial activity this week is centered on the dynamic Full Moon in Cancer on Thursday . Within a few hours after the Full Moon , Mercury returns to Capricorn and the need to press forward with our plans intensifies . Edgy exchanges are very likely during midweek when emotions are running high . <p> The Capricorn Sun squares Uranus in Aries on Tuesday and Jupiter in Libra on Wednesday leading up to Thursday 's Full Moon . The Jupiter-Uranus opposition challenges Capricorn 's need for a controlled , orderly approach . This may be one of those instances when the planets in opposition , no matter how much they squabble amongst themselves , will join forces to push their agenda . Jupiter and Uranus both favor a more radical , forward thinking approach than the Capricorn Sun . We could be challenged to reconsider what makes us feel secure , especially when it comes to our home and family . Demanding family members behave according our rules regardless of their feelings probably wo n't end well . <p> One thing I noticed about the Cancer Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very up front and personal experience . The Sun and Moon are about as personal as it gets and Jupiter in Libra is on the edge of the outer planets ( Saturn , Uranus , Neptune and Pluto ) . Anyone with their Sun , Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars or Ascendant between 20- to 22- in the cardinal signs are going to be faced with the need to take action of some kind . As the inner planets move into Aries and hit 20- to 22- , this Grand Cross will be triggered again and again . One way or another something is bound to give . <p> We do have some sweet along with the bitter this week including Mars in Pisces sextile Pluto in Capricorn on Tuesday night , the Capricorn Sun sextile Chiron in Pisces Wednesday and a wonderful Venus-Neptune conjunction in Pisces on Thursday . <p> Pluto gives Mars in Pisces some backbone and he could come across like Mars in Scorpio . . . more intense , forceful and passionate . Some Pisces folk out there may surprise the heck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down firmly . <p> The Sun-Chiron sextile may bring awareness of the need to be sensitive to other people 's vulnerabilities rather than stomping all over them . It could also help us take sensible steps to healing our own wounds . <p> What can I say ? Venus conjunct Neptune in Pisces is the ultimate romantic aspect , floating around in a fog of idealized Love . Some may meet a person they believe is their soul mate or fall madly in love with someone who only exists in their imagination . For more prosaic souls , this lovely aspect can help us renew the romance in our relationships with a candlelit dinner for two . <p> Monday is not really the Gemini Moon 's day nor is it ours if we 're looking for factual information .

The Moon will be void-of-course mid-afternoon following the opposition to Mercury . She will be much happier after she enters Cancer an hour later . Staying at home this evening is a good bet . <p> Wednesday has a much better flow to it with the Cancer Moon trine Venus and Neptune in Pisces early in the day , sextile Pluto in Capricorn early evening and trine Mars in Pisces shortly after that .

Mercury returns to Capricorn at dawn adding another planet to water and earth signs with an abundance of cardinal signs .

Since Venus conjoins Neptune today our evening plans may take a very interesting turn . <p> Friday the Leo Moon makes no major aspects though she is inconjunct both Venus and Neptune in Pisces . Be very careful about buying anything using excess glamour as a sales pitch . What may look amazing on the surface could turn into a pumpkin later on . Even though it will probably be hard to concentrate on work today still it would be best to tidy up loose ends at work . <p> Despite having big plans for this weekend , we may end up lazing about more than anything . The Leo Moon is void-of-course all day Saturday after an early morning trine Saturn in Sagittarius . The Moon-Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the desire to go play increases later on . The Moon enters Virgo in the evening and we may decide going out is too much effort . <p> We 're reminded Virgo is a mutable sign on Sunday when the Virgo Moon opposes Venus and Neptune in Pisces the latter half of the day . We may start off feeling industrious in the morning but that may not last long with other more enticing options on the horizon . <p> The pacing this week is erratic at best . We have Mercury starting the week off at a crawl and gradually picking up speed towards the end plus it leaves fiery Sagittarius for cautious Capricorn . The crackling cardinal energy surrounding the Cancer Full Moon demands action but we probably will have difficulty gaining traction right away .

@@120935125 @9935125/ <h> The UK 's first ( failed ) attempt to join the EU was on August 1st 1961 under the transit of Uranus conjunct radix Saturn in Leo . Saturn is the ruler of the UK Sun " and- I think the transit of Uranus over UK Saturn made those in power wake up to the possibility of a new world role . The Suez Crisis in 1956 was a humiliating defeat for the UK , it served to speed up the independence of its colonies and damaged- Anglo-French relations . Having refused an invitation to take a leading role in the Schuman plan ( in 1950 ) , the precursor to the EU , the UK did a 180 degree turn and set its sights on- European membership . How very Uranus ! <h> The UK 's second failed attempt at entry was on November 27th 1967 , under the transit of Neptune in Scorpio square UK Saturn in Leo . Because the UK is born under a Saturn/Neptune square , it is extremely sensitive to the Saturn/Neptune cycle . ( For example , Queen Elizabeth II was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. etc. ) - I suggest that it is no co-incidence that the EU referendum is taking place under a mundane transiting Saturn/Neptune square . The first horoscope below , is for the UK ( inner wheel ) , and for the first and second failed attempt at joining . Note the position of UK radix Mercury ( 17 Sag . 22 ) . <h> Horoscope 2 below , shows the UK 's entry to Europe on Jan. 1 1973 ( inner wheel ) and for the 1975 and 2016- referendums . Striking " are the planets clustering around the 12-17 degrees Gemini mark ( Saturn center wheel , Sun middle wheel ( Mercury is just wide ) - &amp; Mercury in the outer wheel ) and the 11-17 Sagittarius mark ( Venus center wheel , Neptune middle wheel , Saturn outer wheel ) . The Gemini/Sagittarius axis which is particularly related to trade and to the international legal agreements that govern it , is emphasised . The Gemini planets fall under the astrological rulership of Mercury , the god of traders , shop keepers ( robbers and thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter ruled " a planet with affinity with foreign travel , broader horizons , the bigger picture . As you can see , the upcoming referendum resonates strongly both with the join &amp; previous yes ' vote horoscopes . This must surely be seen as a big plus for the REMAIN camp as it seems to suggest a renewal of vows . Interesting note : Boris Johnson , leader of the LEAVE campaign , has Mercury at 19 degs 19 Gemini ! <h> Horoscope 2 <h> Horoscope 3 below , is for the UK ( innermost wheel ) and the EU membership . The ascendant for EU membership is conjunct the UK radix ascendant , an almost seamless fit . The join horoscope highlights the third house , local trade vs the ninth house , foreign countries and international agreements . Europe is good for UK business so its said , because it offers the UK access to a large foreign market . At time of joining Saturn ( ruler UK Sun ) was transiting UK ninth house . This almost feels like handing over a portion of autonomy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think its so surprising that just two years later " when Saturn was transiting the natal tenth house " the first referendum on whether to remain in Europe was held . At that time , Pluto was in transit over UK ascendant which is suggestive of a big make over " which incidentally is reflected in the UK secondary progressed horoscope . At time of joining , UK progressed Sun in the ninth house had literally just entered Cancer ! <p> Horoscope 3 <h> Horoscope 4 " the last horoscope in this article " simply shows the UK and the 2016 referendum . Transiting Mercury " is at 16 degrees 36 Gemini " Saturn is at 11 degs 41 Sagittarius " and transiting Jupiter is in the picture as well at 16 deg 05 Virgo . Once again the Gemini/Sagittarius axis is very clearly emphasised . I find this significant . <h> Horoscope 4 <h> In a reversal of position to the join horoscope- " when Saturn was transiting the ninth " - transiting Saturn is about to conjunct UK " Mercury . This could easily translate as the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking back responsibility for its own trading relationship with the rest of the world . Transiting Uranus is currently in UK 7th house " the house of open enemies but also of partnerships . Uranus is always a game changer and can lead to sudden breaks in relationships . However it must be noted that Uranus is currently trine to UK radix Saturn and join the EU Mercury . At the time of entry , Jupiter was in Aries doing pretty much the same thing . Again , this could be a boost for the REMAIN camp . <h> Given the astrological conditions " we are all at sea . A mutable t-square of this extreme rarity will create big waves . A term that resonates most strongly with Jupiter opposite Neptune is that of a tsunami of immigrants . Saturn square Neptune breaks down order " and leaves people running scared . Free floating anxiety is a lovely watery trope and so Neptune in Pisces . We seem to be in the midst of a collective mal-function . Hopefully this will ultimately lead us to a re-connect ' with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scared , it 's normal sometimes " only we seem to have forgotten that . However , as things stand irrational fears " resulting from the breakdown of the old order and authority " are recreating conditions that were also evident at the time of the breakdown of the Roman Empire ( see my previous post ) . Corruption , greed , lack of political accountability , lack of vision , etc. etc. have led to a crisis of faith between the people and those who govern them . Irrationality , insecurity and fear have a lot to say in this referendum . <h> A worrying astrological factor for the REMAIN Campaign " is that Venus ruler of the UK ascendant " is Out of Bounds on the day of the vote . A planet OOB " wants to pull away from authority ( the Sun ) and go its own way . Venus is on the midheaven " in Cancer " the sign of the UK Moon . This speaks to me of personal identity and of protecting what belongs to me . When threatened , Cancer draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate to playing safe better the devil you know ' . However , the OOB aspect could also suggest that Britain is about to pull away from Europe . Other astrological factors that need to be taken into account : <h> 1 : Nothing huge is happening in the UK horoscope on the day following the referendum . However , Mars is in Scorpio and almost at station and it squares UK Saturn ; the transiting Moon in Aquarius opposes UK Saturn ( Parliament ; - transiting Moon in Aquarius squares Mars . This creates a fixed t-square involving radix UK Saturn : - alea iacta est ' ? The Moon on the day of voting , is in the fourth house " our home , our roots , the ground beneath our feet " but it is in group orientated Aquarius . <h> 2 : The UK is approaching the transit of Pluto opposite the Moon . Given the UK Moon is in the 10th house " this suggests a change in the public persona of the country , a change in status of the country , and quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . However , it must be said whether we vote to go " or stay , this energy will surface . Broken promises by the government , wo n't be taken lightly .

David Cameron is in the midst of the transit Pluto square the Sun and whether we stay or go , he will struggle to keep his party together methinks . Imagine if the vote is very finely balanced " and it could very well be ! <h> 3 : - In May 2019 " the UK has its lunar return " followed in August 2021 " by a dazzling triple sec.progressed conjunction of Sun , Moon and Jupiter in 17 degrees Leo . UK Saturn " you will remember is in Leo " in the 11th . In one word : sovereignty , sovereignty is important for the UK . Though 2019 or 2021 seem like a long way off , fact is , leaving Europe will not happen over night . There will be new agreements necessary , new trade deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find this triple conjunction very bold , very daring , and very confident " and let 's face it " a vote for BREXIT will take a lot of self confidence . <h> In the introduction , I said I would give my astrological opinion , so here it is. - The most determining factor in my eyes , is that the current mutable t-square locks into UK radix , - EU entry and and EU referendum horoscopes .

Yes , Venus still has one more exact square to Saturn in Sagittarius happening on April 21 and she will be well within orb of that square when she stations direct . However the sextile to Mars will ease tensions in part because she will feel loved and appreciated .

Remember Venus is slowing to station direct on Saturday and even after she turns the corner it will take her awhile to get back up to speed .

@@120935502 @9935502/ <p> Guess what time it is ! That 's right , its time for everyones favorite transit- Mercury Retrograde ! This makes the fifth planet we have going retrograde right now , and man , could it be any less fortuitous ? Well , yes actually- but it definitely is n't great timing , that 's for sure . This year its all about the earth signs , first and foremost being stubborn-as-all-hell Taurus . So what is shifty Mercury up to in this sign ? <p> Supposedly , Mercury in Taurus on its own is viewed as kind of a terrible placement . Now , I see where they get that idea , because he gets the best billing in the air and fire signs where his synapses are firing on all cylinders , and a few cylinders that he rents on the weekend . Hell , even Capricorn and Virgo get good press when it comes to Mercury , and Scorpio is no slouch either ( think every self-narrated film noir detective protagonist , ever ) but never Taurus . In Pisces he gets to be the tortured soul/brilliant artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taciturn , which is a nice way of saying as dumb as a bag of hammers . Well since this is my own placement , I- guess it falls to me to defend him ! I can attest that there may be some truth to the criticism- but Mercury in Taurus has a lot of great benefits that could very well be the key to navigating this tricky season ! <p> The truly great thing about Merc in Taurus is that he gives this great focus , exclusive to this sign , that you will see referred to a lot as either blinders or tunnel vision . The simile is extremely accurate , as this sign has an almost preternatural ability to shut out any and all distractions in pursuit of a goal . While the rest of the retro planets are off causing chaos and hacking away at what is no longer important in your life , Mercury is going to ensure that you do not allow it to knock you off track in pursuit of your greater aims . Now , the challenge here is if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placement is not one that can course-correct with ease . No , it is more like the Juggernaut from X-Men : An unstoppable force once set in motion , but without any initial movement toward an aim , it is easy to give into the inertia , never getting started and wasting your time on pointless distractions that seemed important at the time . <p> Another boon to this transit is its concept of impact when it comes to your words . Right now , you will be challenged on the things you say and think , and of course since that is Mercs wheelhouse , that takes on added importance . You will find yourself zone-ing out a lot , being able to still your mind without even trying to ( especially when you consciously have something to distract one of your other senses and can then shut out entirely , is a trick I have found works WONDERS ) . You must also be very cautious in the things you say- Take your time in expressing what is going on in your head , chew over your words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say more with fewer words , cut out anything extraneous . No fluff with this one . Say something that really matters . Also no matter what , be honest at this time- Brutally if needed . Now is not the time to skirt around anything in order to spare anyones feelings . <p> One thing you do really want to watch out for is that time passes much more quickly under this transit than you realize , even though while its happening it can feel like you are trapped in a quagmire . I guarantee that you will wake up one day , when we are mid-Gemini , and suddenly realize that your to-do list is woefully uncompleted , and that you have n't shown up to work in three weeks . Its just the way it goes down . So use your time wisely , while you have it ! <p> And obviously the standard Mercury Retro disclaimer- No signing any contracts ( especially when it comes to things like phone bills or your cable/internet ) , no major life changes or big purchases , basically put nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in terms of your finances , and the day-to-day running and banality of your life , the better . <p> I was born during Mercury Retrograde , so an over active mind has been a staple of my- existence . - Add my- Aquarian sun/moon/ascendant/Venus to that and I 'm essentially a strange intergalactic being . - So how do I fight through the alienation and over thinking ? - Fortunately , we have the answer to that question in the sign that Mercury is retrograding in ( and the sun has just changed to ) TAURUS . - In order to bypass the shit coming from Mercury Retrograde , use Taurean direct , honest , and plain speak . - Or , you know , get ready for shades of this alienation to consume you . - It is descending up on us again - the most frequent and relentless of the planetary retrogrades ; that of Mercury , the- Messenger.So what the hell happens during Mercury Retrograde ? - In short , all things related to communication begin to break down . - Your ideas become cloudy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ( flavored by your murky thinking ) , mechanical things break essentially connections go haywire . - Its not a very pleasant energy , to say the least.Some people are obviously more adapted to it than others.Some people thrive during Mercury Retrograde because they have learned methods that help them communicate through their own alienation. - Because of this , I personally find Mercury Retrograde to be an easier time for demented writers ( you know we all are demented , right ? ) . - It is a good time to WORK . - Not to finalize things . - Hell no. - But WORK because with this Jupiter Retrograde in VIRGO ( the detail whore ) and Mercury retrograde in TAURUS ( the obsessive freak ) , you will be able to see all the faulty pieces of your plan . - And remember , Mars is also in Retrograde going from Sagittarius to Scorpio . - In this state , he projects the plotting serial killer energy . - Scorpio is the psychic detective of the zodiac deeply inspecting human psychology . - Do n't  forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lifetime , so expect challenges to dominance to increase during Mars Retrograde into Scorpio.These are tools , guys , not enemies . - Use the Suns energy right now ( in patient Taurus ) , and stay calm through the chaos that is ensuing . - Get still . - Get obsessive . - Get detailed about your WORK . - The 8 of Pentacles card I pulled is a work order . - You can turn this energy to your favor just like anything else . - Bend it to your will . - With Saturn also being in retrograde , you can expect this Mercury retrograde period to be flavored with torture . - Things you may have said months ago could suddenly come back to haunt you out of literally fucking nowhere . - I pulled the Justice card to go with the " go to werk " message from 8 of Pentacles. - This means you should expect unfinished business to walk up to you as you 're in line for coffee , or trying to peacefully cross the street , or when you are attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fucking wilderness it will find you . - Its time to tie up all the loose ends and verbal contracts . - Mercury is going to be testing our ability to remain- consistent- with what we have learned by- throwing us shit back at us that we did n't  deal with appropriately in the past . - I feel that Justice is also trying to tell me that we must constantly watch our speech for injustice / breaks . - This is your mantra for the next few weeks : - Taurean direct , honest , plain speak . - Use it like Justices sword.Mercury IS in Taurus , and Taurus has a heavy hand in finance . - With the full moon in Scorpio descending upon us , and a beautiful grand earth trine coming during the Mercury Retrograde period , you can expect financial opportunities to emerge.Pluto joined the Retrograde party this past weekend , bringing our inner demons to the surface . - With Mercury getting anxious in his retrograde state , expect peoples demons to come out in communication . - Pair Mars in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The Sun moving from Aries to Taurus ( April 19 ) couldnt have come at a better time . - Keep your eyes on the big fiery orb , folks meaning keep yourself GROUNDED and focused on the things that are real in your life , say what 's on your mind , and try and channel all of this " bad " energy into Venus-like- pursuits . - Taurus is ruled- by Venus . - Its time to transform your pain , and its time to structure your way to your fortune . <p> Lots of love , everyone . - Be good to each other . - I know all you want to do is shoot people until they bleed out slowly right now , but really , its all just a big- misunderstanding ! - Isnt it usually ?

This is auspicious . We have reached the other side , reflecting the last new moon in Pisces like a mirror . We have crossed some sort of strange , dimensional rift , with illumination resting firmly betwixt . Like Libra , the hangman is the centerpiece . He sits smack dab in the middle of the major arcana of the Tarot , suspended between two worlds . This book end situation is a new sort of experience for Libra . All endings breed beginnings , and Libra is consistently stuck in the middle of the story . Both the ideas of starting and ending seem foreign and dizzying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been like sitting on a fence ; something Libras are very good at .

Unfortunately , while Libra has been sitting around contemplating , her Aries neighbor has erected hedge statues and planted gardens and a built one of those stupid fountains . Spring is here , and the scales have finally tipped . Sowillo , the sun , has arrived . The funny thing about the sun , like illumination , is that you can never look directly at it but you see its presence all around you . - The hangman has lost his ego . He is in a position where you could throw a rotten tomato on him , kick his head , or give him a hug . Who knows . He has taken the leap of faith . Its time to give everyone the big fuck you and bloom how you choose . You get to be whatever kind of fucking flower you want to be . You inherit yourself . <p> THE SUN : For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 of Swords represents self interest , which makes perfect sense for a sun in Aries . You 're going to have to defend what you believe in . People are going to disagree with you . They are going to fight you and kick you when you are down . Do n't  fucking let them . Seriously , punch them where it hurts most and move the fuck on . We have to let things go and become light and fly now . The rune Kenaz , also known as the " torch , " tells us that you will " surpass the master . " This is where we make a choice , punks ( sorry , Libra ) . What is the story you are going to choose to tell ? Are you going to keep telling the same old fucking story , or are you going to take what you want ? Are you the master of your own fate , or will you allow the illusion to suck you back in ? There is also a warning here . This card tells us it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libra is scolding Aries . She tells him to do what is right and to do it with the fullness of his unique intensity . I 'm sure Helios- and I can both agree that there is nothing more glorious to behold than an Aries with a righteous goal at his back . Kenaz represents controlled transformation . It governs apprenticeship , study , and the search for enlightenment . What drives you ? What is your end goal ? Look beyond everything . What is the sun of your life ? <p> MERCURY : For Mercury , I pulled The Devil and Algiz . This is a fascinating combination . They call Algiz the rune of connections . What kind of connections ? In particular , the kind between us and the gods . Algiz represents the higher self and courage . It is used as a protection rune and is charged with giving us courage in the face of fear . People are going to say what they need to say . Thatll be nice , wont it ? There is this idea of " personal gravity " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key , so find your rhythm . Mercury is the planet of communication , so Algiz in this position tells me that the full moon will be a glorious time for getting in your creative zone and just letting work come out . We also have the Devil archetype to deal with here . This card warns us that people ( including you ) may have an easy time influencing us with their words right now . Listen carefully to the way people speak to you , from the friends in your micro , to the politicians in your macro . What does everyone really want ? Its an easy time to figure this out due to Mercurys connection to Algiz , the god whisperer , and The Devil , the impulsive egoist . Helios : <p> Venus and Neptune Okay , so these two annoy me . These are my least successful/integrated energies . Luckily , they work together exceedingly well , and with Neptune still in Pisces ( do n't  remind me ) it lends itself to a lot of customization and experimentation . Let me tell yall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick-up Artist days- its called Mind-shifting . What you do is you visualize your success ( whatever form that might take ) and marry that to an intense memory of achievement . Connect yourself as much to that memory you can , using your senses . Overwrite your insecurity and doubts with the emotion in your memory and use it to convince yourself that you already have succeeded , and really BELIEVE it . Once you swing that , all that 's left is the execution , just actually doing it ! <p> Artemis : <p> VENUS : - For Venus , I pulled The Star and Hagalaz. - Again , a fascinating combination . - The Star ( card #17 ) is hope , the light , healing and escape after the collapse of the motherfucking tower ( card #16 ) . - The Star is Aquarius , who is ruled by the circulatory system . - It is the idea of connection at a mass level the spider who weaves the threads between the stars . - This is a great combination . - It tells us that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock away all that is n't fastened securely to the truth . - Really , guys , this is good . - Venus represents what we truly value . - Its time for that to be clear for us. - Venus is giving us our speck of hope , and really there is nothing more perceptible in the sky than the wandering star Venus . <p> NEPTUNE : - For Neptune , I pulled The Lovers and the blank rune ( fate rune ) . - Neptune rules over our temptations ( thus the planet of alcoholism , YAY ) . - She is all the things we can not see that are creeping around in the other world , influencing us in some wyrd way . - The blank rune sure shows that here , standing in for the idea of " fate " itself . - There are going to be a lot of magical moments , strange things coming into fruition that we may be blindsided by . - You see , Neptune represents that which is barely on our peripheral . - She also represents the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me that higher connections are coming into manifestation in our lives . <p> Helios : <p> Jupiter , Saturn , Chiron , Uranus , Pluto Okay , so this is becoming less and less Super Saiyan energy and more the 12 labors of Heracles . In which case , were at the 3rd labor ( yay us ! ) , seeing as how we already overcame the Nemean Lion ( brute strength ) and the Hydra ( overcoming multiple issues at the same time , balance ) . This labor would be that of perseverance , and humility . In the third labor , Heracles is tasked with catching the Ceryneian Hind , a stag that could run as fast as lightning . Heracles came across it by chance , then chased it over a year without catching it . After he kept running and chasing it , he ran into Artemis , who told him to leave it be , as the stag was hers , and go back to the asshole king who tasked him with the labors to say that he had caught it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the steps to the palace , Artemis brings the stag to him , making him promise to return the stag to her .

When he does , Heracles released the Hind , and it escaped , and Heracles told him coyly that he had just been too slow . <p> Artemis : <p> JUPITER : For Jupiter , I pulled Justice and Inguz . So we have the rune of growth in the planet of growth . Hmmm . So what the hell are we growing ? If Jupiter is the planet of joy and abundance , it looks like we are growing what we want through righteous action ; aka Justice . Inguz rules subtle action , and Jupiter is being ruled by the Queen of Detail Virgo .

This is a good time for workings involving money . Unfortunately , if you have been sowing bad karma along your path , get ready to eat shit . <p> SATURN : For Saturn , I pulled the The Hermit and Jera . So the Hermit is associated by the zodiac sign Virgo , and Jera represents the harvest , and Saturn has a big scythe he uses to reap . - This is a dire warning for us . Saturn goes into retrograde on March 26 , 3 days after the Full Moon Eclipse in Libra on the 23rd . When Saturn decides to cycle back through the field , he brings double karma along with him . I 'm sorry to terrify you . Remember the pendulum has begun to swing . <p> URANUS : For Uranus , I pulled the King of Cups and Gebo . The King of Cups is a highly creative individual with great emotional depth . He sits in the storm of Uranus , calm and composed , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashes of insight coming from Uranus the powerful jolts in our day that rattle our very foundation . The important thing is that the King of Cups sees them and becomes aware of them . He then responds in a composed manner .

There is great ability for you to make inspired partnerships with the people around you . This is encouraged . Follow the flashes of lightening , and do so generously . Share your fire . There is a lot of reciprocation in this combination . The King of Cups is very giving and generous , and Gebo literally translates to the gift . - Get ready for lots of gifts of insight as well . <p> PLUTO : - For Pluto , I pulled the 7 of Pentacles and Berkano. - What is with this card ? - It keeps fuckin showing up , left and right , and its beginning to make me very curious . - The 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change . - Something has finally been completed , and now it is time to choose our direction . - Pluto is the planet of regeneration , and our lives are very much being pumped with new life blood as we speak . - Thanks for the juice , Pluto , because we are really going to need it for all these fucking retrogrades about to beat us down . - Berkano shows up for us , under the planet of legacy coupled with the 7 of Pents. - This probably means it is an excellent time for money manifestation . - You can truly have what you want , you just need to have the guts to change yourself in order to get it . - Do n't  just sit there . - Either harvest what you have in front of you and make something of that , or take what you need and begin your new life . - Decisions , decisions . - Youre going to be forced to change , so its time to choose a route or smash face first into the median ( sorry again , Libra ) .

The idea of participation , of sharing a goal without having a clearly defined personality outside of the group , - resonates with Aquarius . Now however , with the Moon eclipsed in Aquarius , the focus is very much on the winner , the almost super human achiever . Think Usain Bolt ( Sun in Leo ) or Michael Phelps ( Sun conjunct Mars in watery Cancer ) . <h> Astro-Insights : Some thoughts on Thursday 's Lunar Eclipse <h> The Moon relates to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our fundamental concerns for family and self . The Moon eclipsed could relate to patterns of behaviour that have been with us for so long they have become part of the furniture . Look to the house where the eclipse falls and do some brainstorming . The focus now is on the Sun i.e. consciousness . You might begin by questioning yourself . Why do I do that ? What 's in this for me ? The Sun has the limelight " do you ? What might need to change in your perception of yourself that would help to better define who you are ? - What specific ideas are holding you back ? With the Moon eclipsed " this answer might be related to your tribe " and to the habits of many lifetimes . This lunar eclipse is very useful " because Mars and Saturn " two planets that have featured in all the eclipse horoscopes this year , lunar and solar , are now both heading in the right direction . Sure , these are the two malefics and Mars is now in hot pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paramilitaries , right wing regimes , and general fruit cases with or without guns . So we should keep it simple , personal i.e. Moon based instead . Sagittarians need a goal situated on a future horizon . Find yours . In contrast to the mutable cross , fixed energy allows you an opportunity to get things established and get some real lasting results . Move . Get on and do what needs doing . <h> Astro-Insights : Some thoughts on Thursday 's Lunar Eclipse <h> On a mundane note , the Moon relates to the collective , to the people en mass , to the ebb and flow within the collective . When the Moon is eclipsed the lunar and solar energy field is disturbed . This has subtle influence on the planet earth.For example the infrared electromagnetic waves normally emitted by the Moon are absent . The temperature on the lunar surface drops . In other words , change is very literally in the air around us . The Moon will be eclipsed in 25 degs 52 Aquarius and its worth picking out a few horoscopes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus on . The USA has the Moon in 27 degs 10 Aquarius , Sibly horoscope . The Sun is a masculine planet , however in a mundane sense it strongly relates to powerful persons , leaders , and nowadays the Sun can just as easily relate to women with balls . On a political level and speaking symbolically you could say the opposition is pretty much wiped out here . Well .. at least more campaign set backs " possibly from the grass roots . Though not on the same scale , surely the response by President Obama ( a Leo ) to the flooding ( very lunar ) in Louisiana will be compared to the response of G.W. Bush ( lunar ruled Cancer ) to hurricane Katrina . The needs of the people and the lot of the people , will be stirred up by this lunar eclipse . The UK has ( Capricorn sun ruler ) Saturn in 23 degs Leo 22 , and with the Sun transiting around this point , the UK has done exceptionally well at the Olympics this year , being currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is a small country . This has n't detracted though from the Labour leader fracas . The struggle for the soul of the Labour Party continues . <h> Astro-Insights : Just before I sign off . The Sun trines Uranus on Tuesday . This is very quirky energy and with Uranus in trail blazing Aries , clearly favours he/she who dares . Venus in Virgo trines Pluto on Thursday which is pretty hands on practical as well . Venus trine Pluto is great energy to harvest your own personal harvest , to reap the rewards of some past labour you have put in . Furthermore , with Mercury in pragmatic Virgo opposite Chiron and inconjunct Uranus on Friday , a leap of faith and a break with convention , might be on the cards . <h> All good things ..

Its eccentric orbit crosses that of Mars and Earth , and approaches Venus as well . From 1900 to 2100 it passes closer than 30- Gm to Venus 11 , Earth 33 , and Mars 14 times . It passed by Earth at a distance of about 40 lunar distances on December 7 , 2013. 3361 Orpheus is a potentially hazardous asteroid ( PHA ) because its minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID ) is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters . The Earth-MOID is 0.0139- AU ( 2,080,000- km ; 1,290,000- mi ) .

The major stories about him are centered on his ability to charm all living things and even stones with his music , his attempt to retrieve his wife , Eurydike , from the underworld , and his death at the hands of those who could not hear his divine music . As an archetype of the inspired singer , Orpheus is one of the most significant figures in the reception of classical mythology in Western culture , portrayed or alluded to in countless forms of art and popular culture including poetry , film , opera , music , and painting . For the Greeks , Orpheus was a founder and prophet of the so-called " Orphic " mysteries . He was credited with the composition of the Orphic Hymns , a collection of which only two have survived . The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of his wife Eurydice ( sometimes referred to as Euridice and also known as Argiope ) .

In her efforts to escape the satyr , Eurydice fell into a nest of vipers and suffered a fatal bite on her heel . Her body was discovered by Orpheus who , overcome with grief , played such sad and mournful songs that all the nymphs and gods wept . On their advice , Orpheus traveled to the underworld . By his music he softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone ( he was the only person ever to do so ) , who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition : he should walk in front of her and not look back until they both had reached the upper world . He set off with Eurydice following , and , in his anxiety , as soon as he reached the upper world , he turned to look at her , forgetting that both needed to be in the upper world , and she vanished for the second time , but now forever .

Since his love was not " true " " he did not want to die for love " he was actually punished by the gods , first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld , and then by being killed by women . After returning from the underworld , Orpheus never took another wife , instead only taking the company of young boys from that point on .

Now in terms of the astrology itself , some astrologers link this asteroid as the long sought-after indicator of homosexuality ( possibly sharing this with Ganymed ) , but I would go straight for the kill and call it more likely to be an indicator of pedophilliac tendencies , at its most extreme .

@@120935816 @9935816/ <p> Beginning in 1952 and lasting through 1953 , Saturn and Neptune formed a conjunction . In 1952 , Chiron and Uranus formed an opposition to each other , and joined in a t-square to the Saturn/Neptune conjunction . Think about that . If you take it apart and look at each planet individually , are they friends with each other ? I think Saturn and Chiron might be able to get along in the best of circumstances , if Chiron is able to heal through the earthiness and reality imposed by Saturn . But Neptune , Uranus and Saturn they have diametrically different ways of expressing themselves . While a case can be made for Uranus and Saturn getting along sometimes , because Saturn is the ancient ruler of Uranus , meaning ( to me ) that if you 're going to be an iconoclast , those in a position of power stand the best chance of destroying old form . Otherwise , they rub up each other irritatingly , with Uranus wanting to smash Saturn 's old forms , and Saturn protesting that tradition holds value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Those Born In 1952-53 ( 809 words )
