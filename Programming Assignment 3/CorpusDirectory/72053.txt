On average a Nanny is paid 8.40 per hour , and normally works 37.5hrs a week , has two days off a week , is entitled to paid-holidays and only works evenings after prior arrangement . Unfortunately our Mom has no such luxury as for the first 4 - 5 years of the child 's life , she has to work 7 days a week , has no holiday time ( unpaid or otherwise ) . This equates to 5840 hours a year or 112 hours a week dedicated to Childcare . <p> Once the little one makes his or her way into the World of education then the job of Mum becomes a little easier as Children spend 38 weeks of the year in school , which is a minimum of 836 hrs , which means that the quota required for childcare is a mere 5000 hours annually ( 96 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform . <p> *The average number of children per family in the UK is 1.8 , with 2 children being the most common family size .

@@14620660 @3220660/ <h> Tradition Of Stocking Fillers <h> Stacking stockings for years ... <p> Posted on 3 October 2014 <p> Nowadays , children ( and many adults too ) look forward to receiving their Christmas gifts , and for most children this will entail receiving a Christmas Stocking Filler . The joy of waking up in the dark and fumbling at the foot of the bed until your hand finds that knobbly , rustling , full-of-surprises stocking is a memory that remains with you forever . Not many of us will stop to wonder where this tradition began but like most traditions it has its roots far away in history . <p> The tradition of giving small gifts began with St Nicholas , a senior bishop born in Turkey in 270A.D . After his death , a group of sailors who worshipped Nicholas moved his bones to Bari in Italy where he took the place of a female deity known as The Grandmother , or Pasqua Epiphania , who used to fill the children 's stockings with her gifts . Her shrine at Bari then became the centre of the Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageant they conducted annually on the anniversary of Nicholas ' death , on December 6 . <p> These groups worshipped a pantheon led by Woden -their chief god and the father of Thor , Balder , and Tiw . Woden had a long , white beard and rodea horse through the heavens one evening each autumn . The persona of Nicholas merged with Woden and he shed his Mediterranean appearance , grew a beard , mounted a flying horse , rescheduled his flight for December , and donned heavy winter clothing . Sound familiar ? <p> In 1809 , the novelist Washington Irving ( most famous for writing The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and Rip Van Winkle ) wrote a satirical piece on Dutch culture entitled Knickerbocker History . In this he refers several times to the white bearded , flying-horse riding Saint Nicholas using his Dutch name , Santa Claus . <p> Between 1862 and 1886 , illustrator Thomas Nast drew more than 2,200 cartoon images of Santa for Harpers Weekly based on Moores poem .

And thus Santa as we now know him was born . <p> Now , what about the giving of gifts and Christmas stockings at the time ? The hanging of stockings had become popular in the Victorian period but for the poorer children only a few nuts and some fruit would be available . For the lucky children from richer families a whole host of gifts were possible : for a girl , things such as a doll and clothes to dress her in , hair ribbons , a sewing kit , drawing pencils , a book , a canary ( ! ) , or perhaps mittens or a muff to keep out the cold .

If we look back to the Victorian Age as the main shaper of our current Christmas traditions this paints a very different picture.There was much planning to be done for a Victorian Christmas and this helped pass the long winter nights . Many gifts were home- made and often daughters would help their mothers with sewing and needlework . Personal gifts were popular and patterns were printed and advice was to be found in books and periodicals . One that was particularly useful was Cassell 's Household Guide <p> Gifts ranged from practical ones to ornamental objects . Food gifts such as jams , jellies , and preserves were made and stored earlier in the summer , alongside home-made sweets such as peanut brittle or fudge . <p> Poor families made their own gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would save their pocket money to buy marbles , a spinning top , skipping ropes , kites or cheap wooden toys . <p> Victorian stockings were very beautiful as they used to be the children 's main present . Santa Claus would fill them with fruit and nuts and a piece of candy or two . There would also be some bright new pennies and a lump of coal for luck . A wooden toy might stick out of the top ; a soldier for the boys and a doll for the girls . <p> Gifts for Mother might include such things as an apron , a fan , a strawberry or tomato shaped pincushion , lacy needle cases , a silver thimble and sewing scissors , cologne , handkerchiefs or scarves , combs , or a watch-case . For Grand-mama perhaps a pomander ball , doilies , a scented sachet , or book-markers . <p> For Papa , perhaps a muffler or scarf , a monogrammed tobacco pouch , a chamois eyeglass cleaner , a gift of homemade cookies in a handmade container or a cigar case . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencils , a muff , a wardrobe of crochet and lace edged blankets and dresses for dolly , a tiny wax doll in a nutshell cradle , a painting set , a fan , a music book , a sewing kit , a book , mittens or a doll . <p> For a boy a stamp album , some carved and painted toy animals , a toy pistol , wind-up soldier , marbles , building blocks , a savings bank or a shoeshine kit . <h> Stocking fillers during the second World War Years <p> The factories which appeared during the Industrial Revolution meant that mass production of toys made them more accessible to middle and lower class families as they became much cheaper . However , all this changed during the war years as rationing and the unavailability of goods made life much more difficult . <p> Many children were evacuated to the countryside from the cities to avoid the danger of air raids and bombs so Christmas became a very different affair for many families . <p> 1939 The government debated whether extra spending at Christmas should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the then Chancellor insisted that money should not be wasted . Many people ignored this and , with rationing on its way , were determined to enjoy the festive season . <p> For most people this was a happy time , and people spent what they could on presents . Many gifts were heavily influenced by the times , such as for children , a scaled down Red Cross , RAF or naval uniform , which proved very popular . Card games - which that year included the very topical titled ' Blackout ' , and ' Vacuation ' were also available , as were many childrens Annuals . <p> For adults , gifts with a wartime ( and practical ) theme included steel or Bakelite helmets , and gas masks in leather cases . People were encouraged to buy French food and drink , and as a result many troops in France received parcels from home that included French produce . <p> 1940-41 The war continued and practical gifts came into vogue . Items such as gardening tools , books , bottling jars and seeds were very popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some gardening magazines even recommended a bag of fertilizer as a gift , and the most popular present for Christmas 1940 was the much in demand and very scarce bar of soap . <p> 1941-42 The war dragged on and toys , if they could be found at all in the shops , were often poorly made and of shoddy quality or very expensive <p> People made their own presents or reinvented objects into other things , and magazines in the lead-up to December were full of ideas for home-made gifts . One choice of patriotic gift was a National Savings Certificate , or a savings book with a few stamps attached . <p> 1943-44 Once again presents were ' make do and mend ' . Many magazines printed instructions for embroidered bookmarks or calendars , knitted slippers and gloves , and brooches made from scraps of wool , felt , plastic , or even old silver cutlery . Nothing was wasted and everything was appreciated . <p> 1944-45 The Ministry of Food pleased everyone , particularly children , when it announced a Christmas treat - an extra 1 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , and half a pound of sweets . Once again there were a host of do-it-yourself gift articles in magazines and books . Woman magazine for 9 December advised : ' One of the nicest presents to give ( or to receive ) is a half-pound of home-made sweets ' , and the book Rag-Bag Toys had instructions for making gifts such as a ' Chubby pink pig from an old vest ' , or a doll made from ' old stockings ' . <h> Up to the present day <p> During the 1950s children were likely to get a stocking and a few main presents such as an Annual , perhaps some clothes and gifts such as a train set for a boy or a piece of jewellery or toiletries for a girl . The stocking would usually contain a new penny or a higher denomination coin if you were lucky ; something sweet like a sugar mouse , or a smokers kit made from chocolate ( totally un-PC by todays standards ) ! , liquorice sweets ; an orange and some nuts and probably not much else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the horror of another world war attitudes towards Christmas changed radically and it gradually changed into the often over indulgent extravaganza we know and love today . <p> Looking back from the 1960s it is interesting to see what some of the best sellers at Christmas were . Many main gifts were far too big for a stocking and some children moved on to a pillow case whilst for others the stocking became a secondary gift filled with smaller , less expensive gifts . Most would have been shop bought and the popularity for hand-made gifts declined . <p> The list is endless and serves to show how much our choice of gifts has changed over the years . For todays child , a Christmas stocking is most likely to be accompanied by a separate selection box of chocolates and contain many small personal or fun presents . These are often cheap and cheerful but are still as gratefully received as by all those other children throughout history .

@@14620743 @3220743/ <h> Things To Avoid When Buying Stocking Fillers <h> Do n't make a mistake this Christmas ! <p> Posted on 4 October 2014 <p> When shopping for Christmas Stocking Fillers we often tend to go a bit mad and buy lots of cheap and cheerful gifts without giving the choice of gift a great deal of thought . Filling the stocking with lots of goodies might be fun but there are rules to consider before choosing what you buy and for whom . What might seem like brilliant stocking filler for one person might be a total mistake for another . <h> Things to think about : <p> 1 . The persons individual likes and dislikes : We all have our own favourite prezzie ideas but this does not mean we have to inflict them on others . The idea is to buy a gift that you think the person will like and not one that you secretly hope you will eventually end up with when the original recipient a ) chucks it at you in disgust b ) throws it in the bin where you can surreptitiously retrieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following Christmas who then passes it on to you the Christmas after that one . Listen carefully children ; this is not the reason we buy gifts ! <p> 2 . Their interests : Choosing the perfect gift is like choosing a piece of clothing ; it needs to suit your shape , size and colouring . Well , actually not YOUR attributes but those of the recipient . Buying someone something in the hope that you might get them to join you in your hobbies/pursuits or in the hope that you might get to borrow a gadget or suchlike is not in the true spirit of gift giving ! <p> 3 . Their physical appearance : Open your eyes and take a good long look at the person you are buying for . You do not want to embarrass them or embarrass yourself by being the perpetrator of any of the following misdemeanours ; a ) buying a hair drier for a bald person b ) buying an electric shaver for a ZZ Top look alike c ) buying a sparkly , stretchy boob tube for a cuddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slimming class d ) buying joke boggle eye glasses for someone who actually wears jam jar bottom thick glasses all the time anyway e ) buying a joke character mask for a person whose face is actually worse than the mask and who will be greeted by horrified gasps when they take the mask OFF f ) NEVER EVER EVER buy anything sporting a fake moustache for a facially hirsute female ! ! ! You get my drift shoppers ? <p> 4 . Where they live : Pay attention to where the person actually lives . Garden tools or gardening paraphernalia will not be appreciated by a person living in a high rise block of flats . Neither would they be impressed by a garden hammock or a paddling pool . Likewise , a person with a massive garden and vegetable plot/herb garden would be completely mystified as to the reason why he/she has received an Indoor Allotment or a miniature box of seeds etc . <p> 5 . Their job/occupation : People come home to escape work so be very careful that their stocking filler is not a reminder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bath Shower gel type anything unless you want to find yourself possibly wired up to the darned thing ! Accountants will not appreciate anything even remotely resembling a calculator ( even one made of chocolate ) . Well maybe if they are female they might overcome their revulsion and just eat with their eyes closed ! Publicans do not want bottles of any type of alcoholic beverage or drinking glasses and caf owners do not want novelty mugs . Cooks do not want any type of cooking gadget/implement and scientists do not want any type of miniature microscope however fantastic its magnification is . So be careful ! <p> 6 . Their age : Children will accept anything but again , beware as there is nothing more disappointing for a child that receiving a stocking filler that they are too young to use . Yes , we all know that Daddy or Mummy will have loads of fun putting things together but that is no good for the offspring is it ? Teenagers always think they are much older than they actually are and will be happy to have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go anywhere near gifts bearing the words Karma Sutra , Erotic , Wicked or Sexy . Although should you forget this rule and find yourself already having bought such items then you will just have to keep them for yourself ! On the other end of the scale are the Silver Surfers who may be mightily offended to receive any type of gift normally associated with elderly people . <p> 7 . Their level of fitness and general health : We all like to think that we are reasonably fit and able to manage all sorts of physical exertions but you do n't  want your choice of gift to be responsible for permanent injury/damage to anyone . A skipping rope might seem like fun , especially after a few Christmas Sherries but the last time the writer tried to do a doubler she ended up with a seriously ricked back for a week ! Do not buy a musical gift for anyone very hard of hearing . No booze for anyone with alcoholic tendencies ( if you have friends like me , this might significantly reduce your gift list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone trying to give up the dreaded weed . <p> 8 . Their financial situation : Gift vouchers or lottery tickets can be a wonderful idea but if the recipient is really struggling then cash might be a better bet . If a voucher is a must try to choose one from a shop or website selling a wide range of goods as this means they may be able to buy something they really need but can not afford themselves . Cash might seem tacky ( and of course , they will know how much you have spent ) but it might be a great gift for someone who needs it . <p> 9 . Your financial situation : The idea behind stocking fillers is to buy something small and usually fairly cheap and cheerful . A few sweets , an orange , a few nuts and a new penny . ( Oh sorry that 's from my dim and distant past ) ! If money is not a problem diamond earrings or a ring ( are you listening boyfriends and husbands everywhere ) ? But if money is tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , market stalls or resort to Blue Peter style hand-made creations . <p> 10 . Whether they love Christmas or are Bah Humbug types : <p> If the person you are buying for loves all things Christmas then go to town and have a ball choosing and wrapping their lovely stocking fillers as you know they will love everything about this . <p> If they are miserable , undeserving Scrooge types who just look on Christmas as an unnecessary indulgence do n't  bother to waste your hard earned cash or precious time on them and instead spend that money making your own Christmas a little nicer for yourself . <p> Consider these quotes from Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol ; <p> Ebenezer : You 'll want the whole day off tomorrow , I suppose . Bob Cratchit : If quite convenient , sir . Ebenezer : It 's not convenient . And it 's not fair ! If I stopped you half a crown for it , you 'd think yourself ill-used , would n't you ? But you do n't think me ill-used if I pay a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' T is only once a year , sir . Ebenezer : That 's a poor excuse for picking a man 's pocket every 25th of December . Bob Cratchit : Yes , sir . I 'm sure I 'm very sorry , sir , to cause you such an inconvenience . It 's the family more than me , sir . They put their hearts into Christmas as it were , sir . Ebenezer : Yes , and put their hands into my pockets as it were , sir . I suppose you 'd better have the whole day . But be back all the earlier the next morning . Bob Cratchit : I will indeed , sir . Thank you , sir ! It 's more than generous of you , sir . Ebenezer : Yes , I know it is , you do n't have to tell me . <p> I hope all the Bob Cratchit 's will enjoy Christmas 2012 and that all the Ebenezer 's will change their opinion of Christmas .

@@14620763 @3220763/ <h> Christmas Gift Wrapping Guide <h> Prepare with our presentation skills ! <p> Posted on 2 October 2014 <p> Okay , we 've all seen the iconic Christmas images of a tree surrounded by perfectly wrapped Christmas Presents in films and on Christmas cards , but is it really true to life ? Well now it can be by following our simple guide to wrapping your goodies . No more dog eared looking presents that are coming unwrapped by Christmas Eve . <p> Step 1 ; <p> Be organised , do n't leave it until last thing on Christmas Eve , there is nothing worse than the unnecessary stress of time constraints . Put on some Christmas music , pour a glass of mulled wine and have the mince pies to hand . <p> Step 2 ; <p> Gather all the materials you need , wrapping paper , scissors , sellotape , ribbon and obviously the gifts to be wrapped . <p> Step 3 ; <p> Remove price tag ( unless you 've gone really overboard and you want the recipient to know ) , and place gift along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping paper to wrap over gift leaving about a 2 inch overlap . Check there is enough paper at each end to cover the gift completely when folded over them . <p> Step 4 ; <p> Now cut the paper in the relevant place , use a pencil to mark where to cut the paper ( as determined in Step 3 ) . Then cut the paper , to help keep your cutting straight either fold the paper or use a long ruler . <p> Step 5 ; <p> Check the paper at each end , if there is an excess trim away . You should be left with enough paper to cover the ends , but not too much it makes folding into flaps difficult , if this is not the case , then go back to step 2 and maybe ease of the mulled wine . <p> Step 6 ; <p> Open out the cut piece of paper and place the gift in the centre upside down on the unprinted side of the paper ( Obvious I know , but there 's always one ! ) <p> Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper to the centre of the gift and secure to gift with tape . Fold under 1 inch of the opposite lengthwise edge and bring to the centre , then tape down the full length of the edge . <p> Step 8 ; <p> Turn the half wrapped gift so that one short end is facing you . Hold the left and right edge of the wrapping paper and push the sides in to form flaps top and bottom , ensuring sharp creases . Tape the edges to the gift . <p> Step 9 ; <p> Fold down the top flap and tape to gift , repeat with the bottom flap . <p> Step 10 ; <p> Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the other end of the gift . <p> Step 11 ; <p> With the gift seam side up , place a ribbon lengthwise under the gift and bring it up over the gift . At the point where the ribbon meets cross the ribbon over and wrap widthwise over the gift . <p> Step 12 ; <p> Turn the gift over , unless you can tie a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow in the centre of the gift . <p> Step 13 ; <p> Affix gift tag , either tie onto the end of the ribbon or stick directly on to the gift . <p> Step 14 ; <p> Repeat all of the above steps for the necessary number of gifts . <p> This method works best for square or rectangular shaped gifts , if you need to wrap an unusual shaped gift then place in a appropriately sized box prior to wrapping . If even after following this guide your wrapped gifts still look like a bad art student project then there are always gift bags . 
@@14620764 @3220764/ <h> Traditional Smoking Is Bad For You <h> The Question of Smoking <p> Whilst Electronic Cigarettes are a much better alternative , we have never been more aware of the health risks associated with smoking . <p> Traditional cigarettes contain all sorts of harmful toxins and chemicals which can cause cancer , choric bronchitis and heart attacks . <p> Here are some horrific facts about smoking traditional cigarettes : <p> Worldwide there are an estimated 1.3 billion smokers . Every year though , 5.4 million people die from smoking related problems - that 's one person every 6.5 seconds . <p> 50,000 people die every year in America from passive smoking alone . It 's about time something changed . Electronic smoking alternatives are the perfect change , with no risk of passive smoking and unbelievably reduced health risk . <p> In the UK 100,000 people die from smoking each year , even if a third of these were to switch to electronic cigarettes , this number could be reduced by up to 30,000 . <p> Electronic cigarettes are n't just used as a replacement , they are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the NHS predict that 2 out of 3 smokers want to quit , that 's a lot of potentially healthy people . <p> Around 300,000 people die of lung disease every year and 8 out of 10 of which are directly related to smoking . <p> Cancers of the mouth , nose , throat , larynx , gullet , lungs , pancreas , blood ( leukaemia ) and bladder are common in smokers . <p> Smokers are more likely to suffer from fertility problems and can find it difficult to maintain an erection in middle-age . <p> Heart disease is the biggest killer in the UK. 1 in 7 of these deaths are smokers . <p> The quality of smoker 's skin is poorer , with more lines appearing at a younger age . <p> On average women who smoke experience the menopause two years earlier than those who do n't . <p> So , having read the above what is the attraction with these little white sticks of tobacco wrapped in paper ? <p> For us at Prezzybox.com , the most amazing thing about electronic cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic smokeless cigarettes are sold with the assurance that they contain no tar , carcinogens or tobacco , but what does this really mean for your health ? <p> Tar : this substance found in conventional cigarettes coats the lungs , reducing their capacity and making you more prone to disease . Also , this substance can cause cancer as it damages the cells which prevent tumours from forming and can also cause gum disease . Tar is also known for staining fingers and teeth , giving that yellowy look so often associated with smoking . E-cigarettes do n't contain any tar , so you will never have to worry about the health risks associated with this substance or the staining which it can cause . <p> Carcinogens : These chemicals are known for damaging our DNA , causing cells to divide faster and form cancerous tumours . There are 19 known carcinogens in cigarette smoke according to experts . Again , there are none in an electronic cigarette . <p> Tobacco : The World Health Organisation estimates that tobacco caused 100 million deaths in the 20th century ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockages and making you more vulnerable to heart attacks . E-cigs contain no tobacco , making them a far healthier alternative to conventional cigarettes . <p> Electronic cigarettes are not just a far healthier alternative to smoking though , they are also a great way to cut down on how much you smoke , or even give up . Nicotine patches and gum are often not enough to kick the habit and the best thing about electronic cigarettes is you still feel like your smoking : You still have something in your hand and you are still giving yourself that break from everyday life which you would get from a normal cigarette . <p> With e-cigs you can regulate exactly how much nicotine you need , you can have as many or a few puffs as you like without feeling like you 're wasting money ! <p> Not giving up completely ? <p> Electronic cigarettes are a fantastic alternative for the regular smoker , providing a cheaper , healthier way to get that nicotine hit ' . <p> Do n't take our word for it though .

It appears that it did ! <p> Although there was no official truce at the time , roughly 100,000 British and German troops ceased fighting along the length of the Western Front . The first truce started on Christmas Eve , 24 December 1914 , when German troops began decorating the area around their trenches in Ypres , Belgium and more so in Saint-Yvon ( called Saint-Yves ) , in Plugstreet/Ploegsteert - Comines-Warneton ) . <p> Capt . Bruce Bairnsfather , who was there , has described how the German soldiers began by placing candles on the trenches and on trees and then sang Christmas carols . The British followed suit and sang carols back to them . The two sides then shouted Christmas greetings to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man 's Land in the middle of the trenches , to exchange small gifts , such as food , tobacco and alcohol , and small souvenirs such as hats and buttons . Artillery fell silent and the truce allowed a chance for the retrieval of the bodies of recently killed soldiers to allow for burial . Joint Christmas services were also held in places . <p> The truth about the football match remained uncertain until a letter describing it was found by Rodney Barker whist sorting through papers of his uncle , Staff Sgt Clement Barker . Sgt Barker joined the army in 1902 aged 18 and served with the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards . <p> He wrote the note to his brother Montague four days after the game in 1914 , saying the short-lived ceasefire began after a German messenger crossed No Man 's Land on Christmas Eve to arrange it . In his own words : <p> " A messenger came over from German lines and said that if ( our side ) did not fire , they ( the Germans ) would n't in the morning ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the trench - no shots - our men did the same , and then a few of our men went out and brought the dead in and buried them and the next thing a football kicked out of our Trenches and Germans and English played football . " <p> The football match did indeed happen but sadly , the war went on for four more years , with the loss of ten million lives . <p> The legendary tale of the Football Match in the Trenches was emotionally depicted in Sainsbury 's 2014 Christmas Advert . Where troops momentarily paused the war to venture into no-man 's land to share precious gifts and play and innocent game of football .

While beautiful to look at , it demonstrates the delicate balance of a closed system like the Earth and contains some of the same essential elements that are found on our planet . The Earth is represented by the gravel at the bottom , with water filling approximately two-thirds of the system and air filling the balance of the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the system , life - the shrimp , the algae and the bacteria . <h> Who developed EcoSpheres ? <p> Originally discovered by two scientists , the late Dr Joe Hanson and the late Dr Clair Folsome , the EcoSphere is the result of technology developed at NASA 's research laboratories . NASA scientists were researching self-contained communities for space explorers to live in during long-term space flights . And out of this work came the EcoSphere - an ecosystem of animal and plant life in perfect balance with nature . The EcoSphere is a NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory Technology Transfer Program . <h> What 's inside an EcoSphere ? <p> Each system comprises a clear soup ' of filtered seawater containing gravel and gorgonia ( the non-living branch like material ) together with some shrimp , algae and bacteria . Each is a key component of the ecosystem . The gravel , gorgonia and glass all provide surface areas to which the micro-organisms can attach themselves . <h> How does it work ? <p> The EcoSphere works by gathering energy from the light and converting it biochemically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enables the algae to produce oxygen by photosynthesis . The shrimp breathe the oxygen in the water and graze on the algae and the bacteria . The waste from the shrimp is broken down by the bacteria into nutrients , which in turn feed the algae . The shrimp and the bacteria also give off carbon dioxide and the cycle is renewed when the algae use this once again to produce oxygen . <h> How Long Will The System Live ? <p> If you think the EcoSphere is cruel then fear not . The average life of the EcoSpheres is two to three years , which is longer than if they were in the real ecosystem as they have no predators to worry about . The larger systems tend to last longer because they contain more shrimp . It is not possible to be precise about this because much depends on the differing light and temperature conditions each system experiences . The actual age of the shrimp is also unknown . Some EcoSpheres have lasted ten years or more . EcoSpheres need warmth as well as light to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viability of the system . <p> Do you have an un-answered question about this product ?

The average life of the small EcoSpheres is two to three years , which is longer than if they were in the real ecosystem as they have no predators to worry about . It is not possible to be precise about the exact lifespan because much depends on the differing light and temperature conditions each system experiences .

While beautiful to look at , it demonstrates the delicate balance of a closed system like the Earth and contains some of the same essential elements that are found on our planet . The Earth is represented by the gravel at the bottom , with water filling approximately two-thirds of the system and air filling the balance of the space . Fire is represented by the light .

And out of this work came the EcoSphere - an ecosystem of animal and plant life in perfect balance with nature . The EcoSphere is a NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory Technology Transfer Program . <h> What 's inside an EcoSphere ? <p> The EcoSphere works by gathering energy from the light and converting it biochemically . Light , together with the carbon dioxide in the water , enables the algae to produce oxygen by photosynthesis . The shrimp breathe the oxygen in the water and graze on the algae and the bacteria . The waste from the shrimp is broken down by the bacteria into nutrients , which in turn feed the algae . The shrimp and the bacteria also give off carbon dioxide and the cycle is renewed when the algae use this once again to produce oxygen . <h> How Long Will The System Live ? <p> If you think the EcoSphere is cruel then fear not . The average life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is longer than if they were in the real ecosystem as they have no predators to worry about . It is not possible to be precise about the exact lifespan because much depends on the differing light and temperature conditions each system experiences . The actual age of the shrimp is also unknown . Some EcoSpheres have lasted ten years or more . The EcoSpheres need warmth as well as light to function correctly . Keeping the temperature fairly constant assists the long-term viability of the system . <p> Do you have an un-answered question about this product ?

While beautiful to look at , it shows the delicate balance of an ecosystem just like our own . It contains some of the same essential elements that are found on our planet .

Each is a key component of the ecosystem . The gravel , gorgonia and glass all provide surface areas to which the micro-organisms can attach themselves . <h> How does it work ? <p> The EcoSphere works by gathering energy from the light and converting it biochemically .

The waste from the shrimp is broken down by the bacteria into nutrients , which in turn feed the algae .

The average life of the small EcoSpheres is two to three years , which is longer than if they were in the real ecosystem as they have no predators to worry about . It is not possible to be precise about this because much depends on the differing light and temperature conditions each system experiences . The actual age of the shrimp is also unknown .
