Distributed Architectures for DOCSIS networks are emerging that provide significant scale advantages and flexible deployment options supporting for both DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1 networks . Distributed DOCSIS deployments are beginning today in some markets based on the earlier C-DOCSIS specifications . <h> New Specification Release <p> CableLabs is documenting several different Distributed CCAP Architectures ( including Remote PHY and Remote MAC-PHY ) and will release the set of technical reports and specifications throughout this summer . <p> Last month , CableLabs publicly issued the Remote PHY family of specifications . Theses specifications are also known as MHAv2 as these are an evolution from the original Modular Headend Architecture specifications . <p> The Remote PHY technology allows for an integrated CCAP to be separated into two components : the CCAP Core and the Remote PHY Device ( RPD ) and describes the interfaces between them . One of the common locations for an RPD is the optical node device that is located at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CCAP Core stays at the headend . A CCAP core can control and setup data paths with multiple RPDs situated in multiple fiber nodes . <h> What is Remote PHY ? <p> The Remote PHY technology uses pseudowires between a CCAP Core and a set of RPDs . The CCAP Core contains both a CMTS Core for supporting DOCSIS data transport and an Edge QAM Core for supporting video transport . The CMTS Core contains the DOCSIS MAC ( signaling functions , downstream and upstream bandwidth scheduling , and DOCSIS framing ) and the upper layer protocols . Remote PHY supports both DOCSIS 3.0 &amp; 3.1 Specifications . The EQAM Core contains all the video processing functions that an EQAM provides today . <p> The RPD contains mainly PHY related circuitry , such as downstream QAM and OFDM modulators , upstream QAM and OFDM demodulators , together with pseudowire logic needed to connect to the CCAP Core . The RPD platform is a physical layer converter device whose functions are to convert downstream DOCSIS data , MPEG video and out-of-band ( OOB ) signals received from a CCAP Core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optical network ( PON ) to analog RF for transmission over the coaxial cable ; and to convert upstream RF DOCSIS , and OOB signals received over the coaxial cable to digital for transmission over Ethernet or PON to a CCAP Core . <p> The CableLabs Remote PHY technology is detailed by six specifications and one technical report ( describing the overall architecture ) including : <p> The System Specification that describes System level requirements such as initialization sequences and security . <p> The R-DEPI and R-UEPI specifications that describe the downstream and upstream pseudowires and the L2TPv3 control plane . <p> The GCP specification that defines a protocol used for configuration of Remote PHY Devices ( RPD ) . <p> The R-DTI specification that defines the timing interface between the CCAP-Core and RPD . <p> The R-OOB specification that defines support for the SCTE55-1 and 55-2 out of band data for video applications . <h> What 's Next ? <p> These specifications define the technology to provide guidance to vendors building solutions for the Remote PHY architecture . Vendors have begun architecting ASIC designs , device platforms and software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements for managing these devices are also being specified at CableLabs and will be released as an additional specification later this summer . These distributed architectures of course support standard DOCSIS 3.0 and 3.1 modems and gateways no differently than integrated architectures . <p> The main options under the umbrella of Distributed CCAP Architectures are the Remote PHY and the Remote MAC-PHY technologies . CableLabs ' work is in progress to document the Remote MAC-PHY architecture . This work will culminate in a technical report which will also be released this summer . <h> Investigating Distributed CCAP Architectures <p> The work around Distributed CCAP architectures ( DCA ) is of interest to many CableLabs members in North America , Europe and Asia . Cable operators are investigating DCA for the various gains they bring including : <p> Consistency with FTTx deployments which will include remote architectures for reach and wavelength management <p> Fits with the SDN/NFV initiatives operators are considering across access networks <p> These integrated &amp; distributed HFC technologies have parallels , and similar features and benefits , to wireless infrastructure architectures such as Macro-cells , small-cells , Distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Distributed CCAP Architectures fit well in different deployment scenarios and all work cohesively together to support the varying capacity and demand in the areas where their deployments provide the best solution . <p> As operators look to optimize their network deployments in each of their cable plants in each of their markets it will be very interesting to see how and where these distributed CCAP technologies will be deployed in each operator 's HFC networks . It is indeed an exciting time to be working on the access network technologies and being part of the evolution it is going through . <p> Karthik Sundaresan is a Principal Architect at CableLabs , responsible for the development and architecture of cable access network technologies .

This open event brought together business leaders , key technologists , and security experts from multiple industry sectors , academia , and government . They shared in-depth views of IoT 's evolution and the increasing security , privacy and policy challenges arising from the ongoing and rapidly accelerating deployment of connected devices . <h> Billions of new devices lead to an increased threatspace <p> Shawn Henry of Crowdstrike , a retired executive assistant director of the FBI , set the stage for our experts for the rest of the day . His focus and ideas were repeated and supported throughout the event by speakers and panelists . Security threats pose significant challenges to IoT , with real risk to individuals , businesses , and national security . The threats come from terrorist and organized crime groups along with other nation states . New extremist groups such as the Cyber Califate extend activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on theft of personal identifying information they can monetize , targeting capabilities critical to businesses as they evolve extortion . <p> Criminals target IoT , losing essential data or the ability to use critical devices unless asset owners pay financial compensation to retrieve . A major example is the rash of ransomware targeting hospitals . And , of course , there have been attacks by nation states , notably attributed to North Korea and Iran . All three types of adversaries steal data , change data , and destroy data to achieve their own ends . However , the IoT benefits are worth investment in effort and resources to protect , and IoT security needs to assess the risks posted by bad actors , mitigating vulnerabilities appropriately . <h> Collaborating on standards and public policy <p> IoT risk management- is also a concern among policymakers , who take notice when insecure devices impact networks and services . Matt Tooley of NCTA- discussed with- Allan Friedman of the NTIA- the agencies ' efforts to galvanize all relevant parties toward solutions through a multi-stakeholder process . Gerald Faulhaber of the Wharton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingood of Comcast- agreed on the need for broadly shared responsibility for IoT security , and Professor Faulhaber noted some form of government- oversight may be forthcoming , though the model is unclear. - While certification of devices may provide some key elements we need , it 's important we understand policy- will likely be slow to evolve . This means businesses , including service providers , - device manufacturers and others- must- evolve their security strategies as- adversaries evolve their methods of attacking IoT. - Industry-driven solutions will continue to provide the most agile responses to new threats . <h> Threat mitigation <p> The team of security experts that came together at CableLabs ' Informed event are working hard to manage risks and mitigate threats . We heard great insights from Dylan Davis of RiskSense , Terry Dunlap of Tactical Network Solutions , James Plouffe of MobileIron and technical consultant to the popular Mr. Robot series , Dan Massey of the DHS Security &amp; Technology directorate , Tobin Richardson from the Zigbee Alliance , and Matt Perry from Microsoft also the OCF Board of Directors President .

There are n't that many surprises here as Brian Scriber of CableLabs provocatively summed up in the final key . <p> Encouraging manufacturers to implement well designed and securable code , and enabling the security capabilities and features we know to use in other technology areas . <p> It is critical to protect people and devices during onboarding , the process of joining networks and configuring devices and services properly as they are first installed . We need strong device and personal identity methods , enabled through public key infrastructure solutions . <p> Our communications and device operations need to ensure confidentiality and integrity while also ensuring appropriate levels of availability . <p> Finally , devices must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must include upgradable security and dynamic patching of vulnerabilities . <p> Our industry knows how to do these things we 've got over 30 years of experience securing our networks and IT systems . The lessons learned are still relevant and should be applied to the broader IoT ecosystem . But , we still see common errors like use of known insecure protocols and use of devices that do n't require strong authentication , or even include default credentials so anybody knowledgeable of the device can log on . And people can find those devices through services such as Shodan a very common theme through the day . There are opportunities for improvement such as better measurement and monitoring capabilities . Applying the benefits of data science and big data practices will help detect vulnerabilities and anomalies faster. - - - Further , highly automated strategies to patch and reconfigure devices and networks will enable us to address threats quickly .

@@88722439 @4222439/ <h> Share <p> In the world of cable modems a lot has been said about the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth , the rock-solid historical trend where broadband speeds go up by a factor of about 1.5 each year. - But alongside the seemingly unassailable truth described by that trend is the nagging question : " Who needs a gigabit per second home broadband connection , and what would they use it for ? " - Are we approaching a saturation point , where more bits-per-second is n't what customers focus on ? - Just like no one pays much attention to CPU clock rates when they buy a new laptop anymore , and megapixel count is n't the selling point it once was for digital cameras . <p> It 's clear that aggregate bandwidth demand is increasing , with more and more video content ( at higher resolutions and greater color depths ) being delivered , on-demand , over home broadband connections. - DOCSIS 3.1 will deliver this bandwidth in spades. - But , in terms of what directly impacts the user experience , what is increasingly getting attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latency is a measure of the time it takes for individual data packets to traverse a network , from a tablet to a web server , for example. - In some cases it is referred to as " round trip time , " both because that 's easier to measure , and because for a lot of applications , it 's what is most important . <p> For network engineers , latency has long been considered important for specific applications. - For example , it has been known since the earliest days of intercontinental telephone service that long round-trip times cause severe degradation to the conversational feeling of the connection. - It 's similar for interactive games on the Internet , particularly ones that require quick reaction times , like first-person-shooters . Latency ( gamers call it " lag " or " ping time " ) has a direct effect on a player 's chance of winning . <p> But for general Internet usage , web browsing , e-commerce , social media , etc. the view has been that these things are n't sensitive to latency , at least at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a user really care that much if their Web browsing traffic is delayed by a few hundred milliseconds ? - That 's just the blink of an eye " literally. - Surely this would n't be noticed , let alone be considered a problem. - It turns out that it is a problem , since a typical webpage can take 10 to 20 round-trip-times to load. - So , an eye-blink delay of 400ms in the network turns into an excruciating 8-second wait. - That is a killer for an e-commerce site , and for a user 's perception of the speed of their broadband connection . <p> And , it turns out that more bandwidth does n't help. - Upgrading to a " faster " connection ( if by faster we mean more Mbps ) will have almost zero impact on that sluggish experience. - For a typical webpage , increasing the connection speed beyond about 6 Mbps will have almost no effect on page load time . <h> If Latency is Indeed Important , What Can We Do About It ? - <p> There is a component of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network link miles ) between a client and a server. - Information currently travels at near the speed of light on network links , and , while some network researchers have bemoaned that " Everybody talks about the speed of light , but nobody ever does anything about it " ( Joe Touch , USC-ISI ) , it seems that once we harness quantum entanglement we can call that one solved. - Until that day comes , we have to rely on moving the server closer to the client by way of Web caches , content-delivery networks , and globally distributed data centers. - This can reduce the round-trip-time by tens or hundreds of milliseconds . <p> Another component of latency comes from the time that packets spend sitting in intermediate devices along the path from the client to the server and back . - - Every intermediate device ( such as a router , switch , cable modem , CMTS , mobile base station , DSLAM , etc. ) serves an important function in getting the packet to its destination , and each one of them performs that function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then making a decision as to which direction to forward it. - This process takes some time , at each network hop , while the packet waits for its turn to be processed. - - - Reducing the number of network hops , and using efficient networking equipment can reduce the round-trip-time by tens of milliseconds . <p> But , there is a hidden , transient source of significant latency that has been largely ignored " packet buffering. - Network equipment suppliers have realized that they can provide better throughput and packet-loss performance in their equipment if they include the capability of absorbing bursts of incoming packets , and then playing them out on an outgoing link. - This capability can significantly improve the performance of large file transfers and other bulk transport applications , a figure of merit by which networking equipment is judged. - - - In fact , the view has generally been that more buffering capability is better , since it further reduces the chance of having to discard an incoming packet due to having no place to put it . <p> The problem with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TCP ) to control the flow of packets from the server to the client. - TCP is designed to try to maximize its usage of the available network capacity. - It does so by increasing its data rate up to the point that the network starts dropping packets. - If network equipment implements larger and larger buffers to avoid dropping packets , and TCP by its very design wo n't stop increasing its data rate until it sees packet loss , the result is that the network has large buffers that are being kept full whenever a TCP flow is moving files , and packets have to sit and wait in a queue to be processed . <p> Buffering in the network devices at the head of the bottleneck link between the server and the client ( in many cases this is the broadband access network link ) have the most impact on latency. - And , in fact , we see huge buffers supported by some of this equipment , with buffering delays of hundreds or thousands of milliseconds being reported in many cases , dwarfing the latency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem. - It only shows up when TCP bulk traffic is present. - If you test the round-trip time of the network connection in the absence of such traffic , you would never see it. - For example , if someone in the home is playing an online game or trying to make a Skype call , whenever another user in the home sends an email with an attachment , the game or Skype call will experience a glitch . <h> Is There a Solution to This Problem ? - <p> Can we have good throughput , low packet loss and low latency ? - At CableLabs , we have been researching a technology called Active Queue Management where the cable modem and CMTS will keep a close eye on how full their buffers are getting , and as soon as they detect that TCP is keeping the buffer full , they will drop just enough packets to send TCP the signal that it needs to slow down , so that more appropriate buffer levels can be maintained . <p> This technology shows such promise for radically improving the broadband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in DOCSIS 3.1 equipment ( both cable modem and CMTS ) . - We 've also amended the DOCSIS 3.0 specification to strongly recommend that vendors add it to existing equipment ( via firmware upgrade ) if possible . <p> On the cable modem , we took it a step further and require that devices implement an Active Queue Management algorithm that we 've specially designed to optimize performance over DOCSIS links. - This algorithm is based on an approach developed by Cisco Systems , called " Proportional Integral Enhanced Active Queue Management " ( or , more commonly known by its less tongue-tying acronym : PIE ) , and incorporates original ideas from CableLabs and several of our technology partners to improve its use in cable broadband networks . <p> By implementing Active Queue Management , cable networks will be able to reduce these transient buffering latencies by hundreds or thousands of milliseconds , which translates into massive reductions in page load times , and significant reductions in delays and glitches in interactive applications like video conferencing and online gaming , all while maintaining great throughput and low packet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can make a huge impact . <p> Greg White is a Principal Architect at CableLabs who researches ways to make the Internet faster for the end user . - He hates waiting 8 seconds for pages to load. -

Our world would be simpler if wireless RF signals would dutifully follow separation rules . However , they are freewheeling spirits that enjoy visiting their friends in the cables . <p> This means that using your cellphone near your TV can result in interference . <p> Over the ages we engineers have done our best to keep the interference to a minimum . A simple way to do this is to have the signals in the cable use a different frequency range than the signals in the air . It turns out that signals at different frequencies do n't like to mingle ( a natural separation solution ) . However , the wireless spectrum has gotten crowded , and relatively recently cellphones have begun using frequencies that cable TV systems use . With our natural separation solution out the door we have to fall back to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using multiple layers of shielding on our cables , tight connectors and well-designed cable modems and set-top boxes . <h> How much risk is there ? <p> We have performed measurements to check the quality of the RF shielding approach . Here are a few charts showing what we 've found : <p> This chart shows the electromagnetic field strength required to cause a failure ( a lost data packet or video picture breakup ) on the device we tested . The blue dashed upper horizontal line represents the amount of field strength an LTE based cellphone will produce at a distance of 5 feet when it is transmitting at its maximum allowable power . The red dashed lower horizontal line represents the field strength it would produce at a distance of 5 feet when it is operating at a more typical power level . <p> We measured a variety of cable modems to produce this chart . The cable modem represented by the blue vertical bar on the left of each grouping is an older unit that has been largely replaced in the field . The cable modems represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouping represent the majority of devices currently deployed . The vertical bar on the right of each grouping represents a cable modem model that is just now being deployed . <p> This shows that cable modems are in good shape and are able to keep the freewheeling RF signals in the air from getting in . The results for set-top boxes are similar . <p> The place where things start to get risky is with the cables that feed the cable modems and set-top boxes , as seen below : <p> Cable companies have to live with interference issues when wireless and wired signals mix together , so they are quite diligent in ensuring that the cables they use are well shielded . The vertical bar on the right of each group above represents the performance of trade-grade cables ( what you typically get from your local provider ) . The vertical bars on the left of each group represent cables with the most risk . These cables came from retail outlets and from cables that builders may have used during home construction . <p> The story is similar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise a system with great components : <p> This graph shows the shielding performance of a connector when it is tight ( green vertical bar on the right ) , backed off by a half turn ( blue vertical bar on the left ) and backed off by 1 turn ( red vertical bar in the center ) . <h> What should I do ? <p> If you find that interference has befallen you and the video on your TV is breaking up when you use your portable device , the first thing to do is check that the connector on the cable leading to your set-top box is tight . Tightening the connector with your fingers is sufficient " but keep in mind that if you move the set-top box the connector may get loose again . <p> Next , check the cable feeding the set-top box . Retail outlets do carry good quality cables . They 're not the least expensive in the store , but they also are n't much more expensive than poor-quality cables . You will want to look for the cables with quad layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be prone to interference ; the cable on the right is well shielded : <p> Finally , check for any RF splitters in the line .

@@88722454 @4222454/ 210661 @qwx830661 <h> Wired <h> Share <p> The demand for data network capacity has been growing exponentially year after year with no sign of stopping . If the past is a guide to the future , the cable industry must come up with radically more efficient use of- the existing cable infrastructure- in order to meet- demand . <p> Today , the most constrained part of the network , and the most costly to upgrade , is the fiber infrastructure between the headend and the fiber node , to the wireless cell radio or to large business customers. - Avoiding costly fiber re-trenching requires a fundamentally new approach to this part of the network . This is where coherent technology provides an opportunity . <p> If you are familiar with coherent optics , then you are aware that the technology has been used in long-haul fiber optic networks for decades . CableLabs has adapted that technology for use in short-haul access networks , and simplified it to reduce the cost . And it has much higher capacity for future growth than the analog optics that are used in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times more capacity ! We have already demonstrated 50 times more capacity than analog optics can achieve today by using coherent optics on 80 kilometers of fiber , and more improvements are on the way . <p> Using traditional analog optics , to achieve that high transport medium quality requires increasing the optical transmit power level , which unfortunately reduces the number of optical analog carriers the fiber can support due to fiber non-linearity effects. - Figure 1 shows a representation of fiber 's wavelength spectrum with 4 analog optical carriers . <p> Figure 1 " Fiber spectrum with 4 analog carriers <p> This limitation on analog optical transport has prompted the cable industry to look into other architectural evolution approaches . One approach that solves the analog limitation problem , while also tackling space limitations that may exist in certain hubs , is the distributed architecture approach . In a distributed architecture no radio frequency ( RF ) is transported through the- optical link . The- optical link does not contribute to distortion of the DOCSIS- RF signal , only the coaxial portion of the network is- responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this digital optical link uses intensity modulated direct detection systems such as the ones found in 10 Gigabit Ethernet links and in passive optical networks ( PON ) . In these non-coherent systems , - the signal modulation used is On-Off Keying ( OOK ) . OOK is achieved by simply switching the laser source off and on . Non-coherent systems operate at lower power than analog optics and can therefore make better use of the wavelength spectrum in fiber . Figure 2 depicts the wavelength spectrum of fiber with several non-coherent OOK optical carriers. - <p> A high-capacity non-coherent ( but digital ) optical link can carry 100 Gbps using 10 wavelengths ( optical carriers ) carrying 10 Gbps each . Non-coherent systems are a suitable near term approach , but there are additional fiber resource challenges that have to be considered- when evaluating a long-term strategy . <p> HFC Networks have been typically designed with 6 to 8 fibers connecting the hub to the fiber node . Two of these fibers are used for primary downstream and upstream connection and in some cases two additional fibers are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for future use . Unfortunately , a large amount- of these- future use ' - fibers , because of an ever-increasing demand for bandwidth , - have since been repurposed for business services , cell backhaul , node splits and fiber deep architectures . In some cases , only the two primary fibers that are feeding the fiber node- remain available for access transport. - <p> In fact , the architecture migration toward Full Duplex DOCSIS , which strives towards a more symmetric- transport , relies on a node plus zero amplifiers ( N+0 ) architecture . A typical node in today 's HFC networks will supply services to 500 households . When converted into an N+0 architecture , the result is the creation of 12 to 18 deeper N+0 nodes . The challenge for the optical portion of the access network becomes supplying enough bit rate capacity to 12-18 N+0 nodes , each capable of supplying 10 Gbps to residential subscribers . <p> This fiber shortage problem will only intensify as fiber demand for business services and wireless backhaul increases . Assuming that costly fiber re-trenching from hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different solution must be found to provide the required capacity . This is where coherent technology provides an opportunity ! <p> Coherent technology has been used to achieve higher speeds than any other optical technology . In coherent optics , both amplitude and phase modulation are used to put information onto an optical carrier . This enables the generation of Quadrature Phase Shift Keying ( QPSK ) and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation ( QAM ) constellations carrying information . The nature of the coherent signal also allows the separation of the optical signal in two orthogonal polarizations . Each polarization can independently carry the two-dimensional constellations mentioned above . The signal processing used in coherent systems facilitates shaping of the spectrum of the signal to avoid interference with adjacent optical carriers . Along with the much lower power requirements , coherent technology allows for efficient multiplexing of the optical carriers within the wavelength spectrum of fiber . Figure 3 shows the wavelength spectrum of fiber with coherent optical carriers over 2 polarizations. - <p> Coherent optics has been used in the long-haul environment for over 30 years . The long-haul environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes up to 3000 km . In a long-haul environment , - significant channel compensation is employed to correct the long distance related impairments , making long haul solutions expensive . <p> The access network environment is very different from long haul networks in one key respect , optical links in access networks are typically no longer than 30 km . That is two orders of magnitude shorter than long haul . The complex and expensive system implementation that long haul is known for no longer applies to access implementation . The shorter fiber lengths result in minimal dispersion of the optical signal . Furthermore , since no in-line amplification is needed , non-linear distortion and noise are significantly reduced . This increases the link margin and enables much lower implementation costs . It is NOT your father 's coherent implementation ! <p> Here at CableLabs- we have re-engineered the coherent link to meet the special conditions of the access network . We have developed technology that is higher performance and much lower cost when compared to long-haul or metro environments . <p> In the laboratory , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with minimal dispersion compensation . That is 26 times the capacity of what can be achieved over an analog optical carrier fully loaded with 1.2 GHz worth of DOCSIS 3.1 signals . We have achieved that using a symbol rate of 32 GBaud ( 32 GHz ) , using 16QAM modulation ( 4 bits per symbol ) over 2 polarizations ( 32*4*2=256 Gbps ) . In addition , we have multiplexed eight of these wavelengths to achieve 2048 Gbps . That is 50 times more than what can be achieved over 4 analog optical carriers each with 10 Gbps of DOCSIS 3.1 payload ! <p> The optical access environment could lend itself to further improvement in capacity per wavelength by further increasing symbol rate and/or modulation order . A future achievement of 64 QAM modulation could represent the pinnacle in efficiency and capacity per wavelength of our optical access environment . One can only dream of such transport efficiencies in the long-haul environment . <p> Coherent optics is extremely flexible . Capacities per wavelength greater than 256 Gbps may not be needed at each target end-point in the near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that modulation order , polarization and symbol rate can be varied enables significant flexibility in the type of supported services . Lower symbol rates allow for multiplexing 100 or 200 Gbps wavelengths to end points . In the access network , it makes sense to dedicate a single wavelength to a target end point ( subscriber ) . In the access , since wavelength spectrum is a precious commodity , higher speed should not be wasted on multiple wavelengths but used to reach a greater diversity of target end-points . This avoids retrenching from the hub to original fiber node in order to lay additional fiber strands . Ideally , operators would only have to deploy more fiber from the original fiber node to deeper end-points in their networks . <p> As the industry evolves toward Node+0 architectures , the volume of optical connections to intelligent nodes will increase substantially compared to traditional architectures . Interoperability and a robust vendor ecosystem are therefore key to providing a low-cost solution using coherent optics . <p> With key goals being interoperability and vendor diversity , CableLabs intends to develop specifications which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network . Similar to previous specification development efforts , the coherent optics specifications will focus on interface requirements , signal integrity requirements , configuration , and management . As usual , CableLabs welcomes involvement from the vendor community to develop these specifications . In the near future , look for announcements related to the establishment of a coherent optics working group to develop the specifications . <p> At CableLabs , we are developing and specifying technology that allows the cable industry to support the growing requirements of broadband access . Come and join us in developing tomorrow 's high capacity network solutions ! <p> Dr. Curtis Knittle , VP of Wired Technologies , also contributed to this article .

@@88722458 @4222458/ 210661 @qwx830661 <h> DOCSIS <h> The Evolution of DOCSIS Proactive Network Maintenance ( PNM ) <h> Share <p> All cable operators would like to find and fix problems quickly , hopefully before a customer experiences a problem . <p> Long ago , before the advent of DOCSIS , the cable plant was one-way downstream and operators waited for the customer to inform them that something was not working as intended , usually with a phone call . With DOCSIS and the advent of two-way communication , the reporting process became potentially easier , but without an operational support system , the fallback was still the telephone . The Cable Modem Termination System ( CMTS ) could , for example , know that a particular Cable Modem ( CM ) had dropped off-line , but without any software to discover the problem and report the event to an attentive OSS , the subscriber still had to pick up the phone and talk to a human . This situation became much less acceptable when the cable system also became the phone system , as well as an interactive video entertainment system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for problems in a cable network . These include details such as excessive transmit power at the CM or low receive CM signal levels . There were also indicators for high packet or codeword errors , both at the CM and CMTS , and low receiver MER ( modulation error rate , a measure of noise and interference in the signal ) . While these indicators are useful , they are deficient at telling an operator exactly what a problem is . For example , should a line technician or an installer be sent ? Where should they go and what should they be told to check ? In any case , high packet errors generally indicate a poor customer experience , if anyone is using the affected frequencies while the packet errors are occurring . <p> Hooks for cable operational support systems ( OSS ) , which have traditionally used IPDR ( Internet Protocol Detail Records ) or SNMP ( Simple Network Management Protocol ) to relay DOCSIS MIBs ( management information base ) data , have been steadily improving , and are on a threshold of quantum improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not sufficiently well specified or implemented to produce valuable data . That is rapidly changing . <p> The first MIB objects to be exploited for detailed intelligence about plant issues were upstream equalization coefficients . DOCSIS uses upstream linear pre-distortion at the CM so that a burst transmission , after it passes through network distortion , arrives at the CMTS clean . An analogy would be eyeglasses that pre-distort an image so that it arrives on your retina in-focus . <p> As an example , wiggles in the frequency response indicate standing waves generated by an echo tunnel . One or both ends of a severe echo tunnel locate a signal reflection caused by a damaged cable plant . The frequency of the standing waves can be measured to reveal the length of the echo tunnel , which indicates a line distance . <p> Further enhancements to the pre-distortion analysis technique allowed accurate grouping of common impairments affecting multiple CMs . If the network 's topology is known , a POI ( point of interest ) can be located on a map where the common impairment is likely located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the small percentage of impairments that were intermittent . Figure 1 illustrates , with the top two plots , the upstream channel 's time and frequency graphs for a single CM from data taken over 3 days every 10 minutes respectively . The two colors of traces indicate that the connections were intermittent . The third trace indicates power variation with time and the fourth trace illustrates the variation in the upstream 's linear distortion . Generally while the connection was intermittent , more transmit power was required . <p> Figure 1 An intermittent CM observed over 3 days <p> A second valuable MIB object came from newer CM chips that could do full-band capture as part of their demodulation process . These chips allowed a full-band spectrum analyzer functionality to be provided by the CM . Figure 2 is a spectral plot from a CM . <p> Figure 2 A full-band spectrum analyzer plot captured by a CM in the field . <p> Now , with some concerted and coordinated effort there is a potential for our diagnostic capabilities to take a big step forward with DOCSIS 3.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful set of management objects that should allow more efficient plant maintenance . However , these benefits will not fall out of the sky . Careful coordination and collaboration will be required with the equipment vendors and cable operators to get the correct data sets into correct formats . <p> Other opportunities for big operational improvement also exist . For example , terminal devices can have an ability to generate their own complaints , even when the subscriber is not home . But terminal devices are only a component of a network . <p> Recognizing that the device closest to the subscriber likely knows the most about the subscriber 's experience , it is also possible to use the collective past experiences of several subscribers ' terminals to identify common problems affecting multiple subscribers , as well as problems affecting only one subscriber . This functionality could be stored in a common format log similar to a syslog . <p> In short , the future of cable OSS can be as bright as we are willing to make it " given lots of hard work , thanks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Principle Architect with the Network Technologies group at CableLabs. - Tom 's main interest is in the physical layer of cable networks , and he enjoys digital signal processing ( DSP ) , RF network design , and testing. - He has been a cable engineer for 34 years .

@@88722511 @4222511/ 210661 @qwx830661 <h> Networks <h> Share <p> Almost exactly two years after a group of 13 network operators launched Network Functions Virtualization ( NFV ) onto the world stage , there is now another seismic industry shift taking place towards using open source software for networks . Open Platform for NFV ( OPNFV ) , which launched today , is a new open source initiative that brings together the network and software industries to accelerate adoption and interoperability for NFV solutions based on open source . OPNFV will create a reference platform where performance and interoperability of open source NFV solutions will be validated . As one of those involved in the early discussions that led to the creation of OPNFV , I am extremely pleased that we have been able to help bring into existence this new forum . CableLabs hosted the inception meeting for OPNFV at our location in Sunnyvale in June and we are proud to be a founding member of OPNFV . CableLabs ' Director of Advanced Networks and Applications , Chris Donley , will serve on the OPNFV Board . <h> What is NFV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in my 40+ years in the industry . NFV is a new way to implement network functions as software instances running on industry standard servers . Proprietary hardware appliances will become obsolete except for the most specialized applications . Some examples are illustrated below : <p> - NFV Vision <p> For the first time network designers will not be limited by the constraints of fixed hardware to design their networks . We have more flexibility to select best-of-breed features ; we can deploy them at Internet speed ; and we can avoid the nightmare of an accelerating hardware obsolescence cycle driven by consumer devices . At last we can design networks able to adapt in real-time to services demand using industry standard servers that can be loaded with new software on the fly to deliver a different mix of services depending on demand , optimizing equipment utilization while minimizing energy consumption . The ability to implement new types of resilience schemes with almost any fault management capability that can be imagined is particularly exciting . CableLabs is actively involved in the ETSI NFV Industry Specification Group ( NFV ISG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts . The NFV ISG work will be an important reference for OPNFV . NFV enables an unprecedented degree of innovation in the networks space which the industry is only just starting to grasp . I expect a blizzard of startups to appear offering new approaches for every aspect of networking . I 'm also participating in an international dialogue with academia to encourage NFV research , and new courses to train the next generation of engineers to be multi-skilled in networks and software . <h> Why is Open Source Important ? <p> As a long time stakeholder in the traditional telecommunications standards process , it has often been frustrating to have to wait for standards to be agreed before we could get on with trials and start deployment to gain the business benefits from new network technologies . It is even more frustrating when progress is blocked - sometimes for years , by intractable technical arguments or commercial positioning . In today 's fast paced technology-driven competitive world where commercial oblivion could be just one click away , the waterfall approach to bringing in new technology does not work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards development in our industry . In stark contrast , the IT industry has embraced the model of open source , where a community of developers works collaboratively and individually to create pieces of software that can be rapidly and continuously integrated to produce working prototypes and rapidly expose bugs . With the open source approach , specification and implementation occur simultaneously resulting in very fast progress and an open innovation dynamic where everyone contributes to build common features , avoiding duplication of effort and enabling everyone to focus on product differentiation . The openness of this ecosystem guarantees out of the box thinking and a global innovation dynamic decoupled from geography or the companies for whom the developers work . While CableLabs considers open source and formal standards processes to be complementary and we will continue to be actively involved in both , we are increasing our focus on accelerating innovation by using open source to rapidly develop prototypes validating our approaches . <h> What is CableLabs doing in this space ? <p> CableLabs has been working in the open networking and virtualization space for over two years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in progress on behalf of our MSO stakeholders . In particular , we are working on virtualizing the Converged Cable Access Platform ( CCAP ) and customer premises equipment ( CPE ) . As part of those projects , we have a number of our own developers actively developing prototypes which we are contributing to open source projects such as OpenDaylight . For example , CableLabs developed a CMTS plug-in for OpenDaylight that was used by several vendors to demonstrate their SDN and NFV solutions at last week 's SCTE CableTec Expo conference in Denver and that has been incorporated into the OpenDaylight Helium ' release . The vendor-agnostic , non-profit environment at CableLabs is unique and ideally suited to open source development in collaboration with vendors . We have implemented open source reference platforms at our Sunnyvale and Louisville locations and we intend to be an active contributor to OPNFV through both code contributions and vendor-neutral testing . <p> Don Clarke is a Principal Architect at CableLabs working in the Advanced Network and Applications Group progressing virtualization technologies .

Ideally , the deployed technology meets consumer demand for many years , allowing service providers to avoid costly upgrades before fully recovering their investments . In addition to technology longevity , service providers also like to see technology evolution , a next generation , to borrow an overused technology term , to ensure future consumer demands can be met by staying within the same technology family . Nowhere is the next generation moniker more prevalent than in the development of passive optical networking ( PON ) standards . <p> Both the ITU-T and IEEE are creating next generation PON standards . The ITU has approved two documents from their G.989 series defining Next Generation PON 2 ( NG-PON2 ) , and a third document is currently undergoing final comments . The NG-PON2 architecture settled on a time and wavelength division multiplexing ( TWDM ) method which stacks four wavelengths in a coordinated manner onto a single fiber , with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore 40 Gb/s . Since the ONU only receives one wavelength , the bit rate received by a single ONU is capped at 10 Gb/s . In such a solution , the dynamic bandwidth allocation ( DBA ) would likely be independent for each wavelength . Multiple vendors have reported demonstrating the TWDM-PON solution . A four-wavelength TWDM-PON is illustrated in the figure below . <p> 40 Gb/s Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexing ( TWDM ) PON . <h> Is a 100 Gb/s Solution on the Horizon ? <p> The IEEE 802.3 Working Group has recently formed a Study Group to develop objectives for the next generation of Ethernet Passive Optical Networking ( NG-EPON ) . Several key technology decisions await the NG-EPON Study Group : ( 1 ) number of wavelengths , ( 2 ) bit rate per wavelength , ( 3 ) transceiver tunability , and ( 4 ) channel bonding . Faced with the same consumer demands and industry competition as other access network technologies , the NG-EPON Study Group could relatively easily define a four-wavelength , 10 Gb/s-per-wavelength PON to put it on par with NG-PON2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated by NG-EPON participants that would take PON technology multiple steps beyond , and presumably allow consumer demand to be met for many years into the future . For example , using advanced modulation techniques to provide 25 Gb/s per wavelength , combined with four multiplexed wavelengths on a single fiber , could yield the first 100 Gb/s PON solution . By incorporating channel bonding , a concept popularized by CableLabs and the cable industry in the DOCSIS- 3.0 specifications , an NG-EPON ONU would be capable of receiving one or more wavelengths , potentially receiving 50 Gb/s or more . In a channel-bonded solution the DBA will closely coordinate upstream transmissions on one or more wavelengths simultaneously . Are the optical transceivers tunable ? That is another of the many important technology decisions yet to be made . A channel-bonded , time-wavelength division multiplexed PON is shown in the diagram below . <p> With a keen eye on vendor implementation schedules and interoperability , the increased capacity of NG-EPON ONUs and OLTs could be staged according to a timeline that aligns with consumer demand and service provider requirements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( next-next generation ? ) . <p> These technology decisions will begin to take shape within the NG-EPON Study Group ( and subsequent Task Force ) starting at the September 2015 802.3 Interim meeting . Anyone with the desire to contribute is welcome to attend . Perhaps the ITU-T will also investigate these same approaches for NG-PON2 , ultimately resulting in another step toward a converged optical access solution ( See the OnePON blog regarding a converged optical access initiative ) . <p> In his role as Vice President Wired Technologies at CableLabs , Curtis Knittle leads the activities which focus on cable operator integration of optical technologies in access networks .

So often , people view the radical transitions as dehumanizing " that technology moving us further from each other , making our relationships more distant and our interactions impersonal . However , this really does n't hold up to close scrutiny when we consider the context of our whole lives . We 've never been so connected to people and information " and we are becoming more engaged every day . We are able to stay in touch with family and friends more easily ; share experiences even though distant ; share intimate ideas over phones even when sitting next to each other . Like so many important areas of our lives , the realization of the connected world is also transforming healthcare . CableLabs hosted an InformED symposium to investigate how connected healthcare is evolving and what technical challenges it must overcome . Attended by a fantastic mix of technical professionals , visionaries , and subject matter experts , the overwhelming consensus was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result will be an even more humane and caring system , accessible to more and more people at even lower cost . <p> The connected healthcare event was opened by Simon Kos , Chief Medical Officer of Microsoft . He set the tone for the day , demonstrating how technology is fundamentally changing society as it becomes more accessible , affordable and capable . His view was on our total health " not just during episodic care with clinicians , but our overall quality of life as we cope with the challenges of living . To organize his storytelling , he used the Quadruple Aim framework and presented examples to examine technology innovation along the dimensions of engaging patients , empowering care teams , optimizing clinical and operational effectiveness and transforming the care continuum . His examples resonated with the views and ideas of other presenters and panelists throughout the day . <h> Transforming Healthcare Through Interoperability- and Data Liquidity <p> Security concerns are very real , as discussed by a panel of Corporate Information Security Officers ( CISOs ) moderated by Ram Ramadoss of Catholic Health Initiatives . Panelists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health , and Timothy Torres of Sutter Health. - The rash of ransomware incidents against thousands of hospitals globally demonstrates the severity of the threat environment . Yet , as Mr. Ramadoss discussed with his panel , they ca n't control threats . Rather they work to control weaknesses . Some weaknesses are obvious and yet have been very hard to fully mitigate " phishing , being too open with system administrator privileges , exposing sensitive systems to risks by using them for personal activities such as email . Others are not so obvious . Kathy Hughes pointed out that the focus on care tends to decentralize IT " with the result that a large percentage of devices connected to the care network may not even be known to security teams . Timothy Torres said one way his organization found that works to deal with this challenge was to incentivize purchasing devices through correct channels . The panelists all felt that device security certification could be a major improvement in ensuring securable devices were used to provide care . And they cited potential savings in cyber security insurance as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day was data liquidity . The concept of data liquidity is not synonymous with interoperability , though related . Rather , data liquidity is about ensuring actionable access to health information by whomever needs it .

Blockchains are designed to address trust in a way directly applicable to healthcare , providing a basis for security , privacy , control , transparency , and compliance . <h> Innovation in Connected Healthcare <p> The final speakers painted a bright future , discussing in depth how digital transformation will refocus healthcare on the patient , humanizing care . Summer Knight of Firecracker was particularly eloquent , sharing her passion and drive to show how the cable industry can be pivotal in providing medical grade connectivity . She feels that the evolving connectivity will engage and empower individuals and their family as part of the healthcare team as we hardwire humanity at every point of care . Medical grade connectivity can provide the platform for customer engagement and activation , putting the patient in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significant . Remote monitoring can reduce costs by as much as $8400/year per patient . Coupled with other critical functions , the near term opportunity for cable operators is over $200 billion annually , supporting a total addressable market of over 170 million people . <p> This was a very informative event . It brought stakeholders together to chart how we can achieve a bright future in providing secure , connected health . Working together , the cable industry and health care industry can lower the per capital cost of care and we can improve the wellness of populations by making access easier . Medical grade connectivity will improve the patent experience and change how we assess success in providing care as we transition the business focus from fee-for-service to a focus on positive results . We can empower care teams in new ways , ensuring quicker care that allows us to treat patients better and increase the likelihood of excellent outcomes .

As a result , Wi-Fi may be subject to radio disturbances that may be immitigable . <h> Considerations for In-home Wi-Fi Deployment <p> Interference can be a significant issue and AP location and channelization should be set to avoid it . Not only co-channel , but adjacent channel and alternate channel interference can also be significant issues . Intelligent tools such as Automatic Channel Selection , Radio Resource Management ( RRM ) , and Self Organizing Networks ( SON ) should be considered to help with interference mitigation . <p> The 5 GHz band offers more channels and is less crowded than the 2.4 GHz band and should be considered for in-home Wi-Fi deployments . Dual Band Dual Concurrent ( DBDC ) APs , which allow use of both bands simultaneously , are also available and should also be considered for in-home Wi-Fi deployments . <p> Support for Wireless Multimedia ( WMM ) and airtime fairness is recommended for in-home Wi-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevent slower clients ( e.g. legacy ) from dominating the airtime . Currently , Airtime Fairness is not part of Wi-Fi standards . <p> Although the 2.4 GHz band offers better distance coverage , Wi-Fi signals in the 5 GHz band provide excellent coverage as well in homes with drywall panel walls . Analysis shows that three HD video streams can be successfully transmitted to three Wi-Fi clients up to 80 feet from the AP in a home with drywall construction . Wi-Fi signals in the 5 GHz band offer more limited coverage in houses with brick walls ( or concrete floors ) . In these houses , HD video streaming is possible if there is only one wall between the AP and clients . Wi-Fi signal attenuation is too high for two or more brick walls to reliably support HD video streaming . In cases where a single Wi-Fi AP is not sufficient to provide whole house coverage and required performance , there are multiple options for the consumer and operators to improve Wi-Fi coverage and performance . A few examples of these include : <p> Multimedia over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communications ( PLC ) to Wi-Fi extenders <p> Wi-Fi mesh ( e.g. 802.11s ) <p> Wi-Fi repeater <p> Or a combination of the options above <p> Transmit Beamforming ( TxBF ) and spatial division multiplexing improve wireless system performance . Increasing the number of spatial streams increases the Wi-Fi system throughput ; however , the relative gain in throughput is diminished as the number of spatial streams increases . TxBF is not standardized in 802.11n , resulting in a lack of interoperability . On the other hand TxBF is standardized in 802.11ac . <p> Additionally , Optimum placement of the AP in the customer house can make a significant difference in Wi-Fi signal coverage and performance . Recommendations and guidelines for in-home Wi-Fi installation will be covered in detail in a future blog post . <h> Summary <p> Demands on in-home Wi-Fi networks are only growing . There are many factors influencing the performance of in-home Wi-Fi networks . Proper deployment and management of In-home Wi-Fi networks can help improve customer experience . <h> Future Work <p> As of this writing , home networks and in-home Wi-Fi topics are active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier and want to get involved , please see the information here on how to engage .

Ideally , the deployed technology meets consumer demand for many years , allowing service providers to avoid costly upgrades before fully recovering their investments . In addition to technology longevity , service providers also like to see technology evolution , a next generation , to borrow an overused technology term , to ensure future consumer demands can be met by staying within the same technology family . Nowhere is the next generation moniker more prevalent than in the development of passive optical networking ( PON ) standards . <p> Both the ITU-T and IEEE are creating next generation PON standards . The ITU has approved two documents from their G.989 series defining Next Generation PON 2 ( NG-PON2 ) , and a third document is currently undergoing final comments . The NG-PON2 architecture settled on a time and wavelength division multiplexing ( TWDM ) method which stacks four wavelengths in a coordinated manner onto a single fiber , with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore 40 Gb/s . Since the ONU only receives one wavelength , the bit rate received by a single ONU is capped at 10 Gb/s . In such a solution , the dynamic bandwidth allocation ( DBA ) would likely be independent for each wavelength . Multiple vendors have reported demonstrating the TWDM-PON solution . A four-wavelength TWDM-PON is illustrated in the figure below . <p> 40 Gb/s Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexing ( TWDM ) PON . <h> Is a 100 Gb/s Solution on the Horizon ? <p> The IEEE 802.3 Working Group has recently formed a Study Group to develop objectives for the next generation of Ethernet Passive Optical Networking ( NG-EPON ) . Several key technology decisions await the NG-EPON Study Group : ( 1 ) number of wavelengths , ( 2 ) bit rate per wavelength , ( 3 ) transceiver tunability , and ( 4 ) channel bonding . Faced with the same consumer demands and industry competition as other access network technologies , the NG-EPON Study Group could relatively easily define a four-wavelength , 10 Gb/s-per-wavelength PON to put it on par with NG-PON2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated by NG-EPON participants that would take PON technology multiple steps beyond , and presumably allow consumer demand to be met for many years into the future . For example , using advanced modulation techniques to provide 25 Gb/s per wavelength , combined with four multiplexed wavelengths on a single fiber , could yield the first 100 Gb/s PON solution . By incorporating channel bonding , a concept popularized by CableLabs and the cable industry in the DOCSIS- 3.0 specifications , an NG-EPON ONU would be capable of receiving one or more wavelengths , potentially receiving 50 Gb/s or more . In a channel-bonded solution the DBA will closely coordinate upstream transmissions on one or more wavelengths simultaneously . Are the optical transceivers tunable ? That is another of the many important technology decisions yet to be made . A channel-bonded , time-wavelength division multiplexed PON is shown in the diagram below . <p> With a keen eye on vendor implementation schedules and interoperability , the increased capacity of NG-EPON ONUs and OLTs could be staged according to a timeline that aligns with consumer demand and service provider requirements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( next-next generation ? ) . <p> These technology decisions will begin to take shape within the NG-EPON Study Group ( and subsequent Task Force ) starting at the September 2015 802.3 Interim meeting .

Perhaps the ITU-T will also investigate these same approaches for NG-PON2 , ultimately resulting in another step toward a converged optical access solution ( See the OnePON blog regarding a converged optical access initiative ) . <p> In his role as Vice President Wired Technologies at CableLabs , Curtis Knittle leads the activities which focus on cable operator integration of optical technologies in access networks .

Although subscribers pay for a certain high-speed broadband connection , bandwidth caps are not reached most of the time . An opportunity exists to optimize bandwidth resources for the benefit of the greater community , especially since cellular data networks are overloaded due to an ever-increasing number of users and resource intensive applications such as Google Maps , Facebook , etc . <p> Now imagine walking through the same residential neighborhood and having ubiquitous Wi-Fi connectivity from your neighbors ' access points . Instead of all access points being locked to visitors and passers by , everybody is able to connect . Phones ( or any other Wi-Fi client ) connect seamlessly from the coverage area of one house to another while neighbors still maintain the security and privacy of their locked access points . This scenario depicts a Community Wi-Fi network , and actually , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Community Wi-Fi ? <p> Community Wi-Fi networks allow service providers to leverage unused capacity on existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to offer Wi-Fi network access to visitors and passers by . An operator can also use this excess capacity to offer services to retail and roaming " partner operators ' subscribers . The residential subscribers accessing the network from inside their homes have prioritized access to the Wi-Fi resources . The residential Wi-Fi infrastructure is configured in a manner that allows for a secure and independent access channel to retain service quality , safety , and privacy for both residential and visitor customers . Roaming users are only allowed to use the Wi-Fi network capacity that is not currently used by the subscriber at home . <p> Basically , the wireless Access Point ( AP ) in the home will provide two networks : a private one for the home owner/subscriber , and a community network for on-the-go subscribers passing through the neighborhood . While the user is at home , all of their Wi-Fi devices ( smartphone , tablet , etc. ) should automatically connect to the private network . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coverage area , and passes in range of another AP operated by the same service provider , their client devices will be able to connect to the public network . <h> - How does this benefit me ? <p> A subscriber 's access point is made available to other on-the-go subscribers , adding to the number of access points within a Community Wi-Fi network . In return , the subscriber is able to tap into other shared access points within the Community Wi-Fi network . This gives access to the high bandwidth and speeds offered by cable Wi-Fi networks when on-the-go instead of having to use more costly cellular data networks . The subscriber is part of a community of shared Wi-Fi networks . <h> What about privacy and security concerns ? <p> Traffic on the Public ( Community Wi-Fi ) network routes differently from that on the Private ( subscriber home ) network . At no point does a user on the Public network have access to any other device on the Public or Private network . The user of the Private network similarly does not have access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All traffic on the Public network is sent through a secure tunnel to the core network before it is routed to the Internet , ensuring that traffic is separated between the two networks . <h> How far in the future is Community Wi-Fi ? <p> It is actually already happening .

Here we will review recent technical work we did with a major proponent of LTE-U , Qualcomm Technologies , and explain why that effort only reinforces our concerns . <p> In brief , we observed that current LTE-U prototype equipment is quite primitive " it is really just in mock-up state at this point " and incapable of demonstrating important coexistence features . The vendor-promised features , most of which are not required or even identified by the LTE-U Forum in its latest specifications , are not yet working to enable fair and reliable coexistence and confidence in testing . In addition , we found that claims of its ability to share fairly rest on a seemingly faulty understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for a collaborative and open standards development process . <p> The Wi-Fi community has long sought the same collaborative standards development process for LTE-U that LAA has enjoyed ( License Assisted Access LTE is the flavor of unlicensed LTE being developed in the mobile standards body , 3GPP ) . But in the absence of LTE-U standards development , CableLabs has engaged directly with the promoters of LTE-U in an attempt to do the fundamental research required to find coexistence solutions . Far from converging on solutions , however , our work to date on LTE-U has raised more questions than answers . <h> Lessons Learned with Qualcomm 's LTE-U <p> CableLabs recently concluded a brief technical engagement at Qualcomm 's campus in San Diego , which was preceded by a lengthy negotiation of what we would be allowed to test on site . Ultimately , the scope of the plan was much narrower than our guidance and focused on a limited set of basic coexistence tests . It certainly was not the fulsome research that we recommended and is required to address the concerns of Wi-Fi technologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alliance last week . <p> Unfortunately , our main conclusion from the three weeks we spent on site at Qualcomm is that there is no basis for definitive technical statements about LTE-U coexistence . The reason for this is surprisingly simple : LTE-U is in a prototype phase of development , and does not possess the features that its proponents have noted are important to coexistence . <p> For instance , Qualcomm has noted that their LTE-U solution will sense the spectrum for Wi-Fi activity and adjust its duty cycle on ' time for rapidly changing congestion conditions . But that is not what we were shown . What we saw was an LTE-U prototype that must have its duty cycle manually programmed ; it has no adaptation capabilities at all . There were other issues as well : For example , the equipment did not natively use the 5 GHz band that is targeted for LTE-U , and it only supported a single user device . We will refrain from going on at length here , but as is apparent in the photo below , LTE-U requires substantial further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the state of the art plainly wo n't work in the real world , despite assurances to the contrary and claims of comprehensive testing . <p> Figure 1 : Prototype LTE-U base station ( left ) and user device ( right ) <h> Importance of a Common Research Framework <p> Since LTE-U equipment is not mature , it should come as no surprise that coexistence research leaves much to be desired as well . Statements that LTE-U is more friendly to Wi-Fi than Wi-Fi is to itself ' necessarily rely on a baseline understanding of how Wi-Fi shares the spectrum with other Wi-Fi networks . But , in our three weeks at Qualcomm , engineers spent the majority of the time grappling with that crucial baseline information . The test setup at Qualcomm was uncontrolled and provided strangely imbalanced measurements . Afterwards , a CableLabs engineer replicated the setup at our Colorado facilities with the same make of Wi-Fi equipment , and within a half hour obtained balanced results , suggesting that problematic baseline measurements were somehow endemic to Qualcomm 's research environment . CableLabs and its members regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior we observed on-site in San Diego seems quite out of the ordinary . Selected baseline measurements are shown in Figure 2 below , including the expected balanced baseline we observed in our Colorado lab . <p> Figure 2 : Imbalanced Wi-Fi baseline behavior in Qualcomm research not observed in follow-on CableLabs work <p> This highlights the fundamental problem with the LTE-U coexistence research done to date : There is no common technical framework in which stakeholders are working , which makes it very difficult , if not impossible , to interpret research results across studies . This is apparent in our limited work with Qualcomm , and in Qualcomm 's prior studies , which also reflect baseline imbalances and call into question the research conclusions of LTE-U proponents . <p> Since we spent most of our time at Qualcomm working to diagnose apparent problems with the research environment , we did not come close to executing against the already modest test plan developed at the outset . We did however take some limited measurements of Wi-Fi behavior in the presence of LTE-U ( which was tuned to 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow representation of possible real-world LTE-U configurations ) . <p> As seen in Figure 3 below , the impact of LTE-U depends on what your comparison point is : To conclude that LTE-U coexists better than Wi-Fi , one would need to lower the bar as much as possible " using an imbalanced baseline and referencing only the lower end in the analysis . This would clearly be a skewed approach , and even when doing so , it still does n't tell a conclusive story " reference the first case in the figure below , where the presence of LTE-U degrades Wi-Fi more than either baseline case . We would submit that the better approach is to diagnose the problems with the baseline measurements , rather than using unexplained results to justify definitive conclusions . <p> Figure 3 : LTE-U coexistence not reliably determined <p> Furthermore , the in-home research detailed in a recent blog post by our principal architect , Jennifer Andreoli-Fang , made it clear that LTE-U is likely to have a disproportionately negative impact to Wi-Fi when the baseline is properly calibrated . An open standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater consistency and confidence in results . <p> We certainly hope that Qualcomm 's LTE-U solution will move from prototype to product in the near future , so that the Wi-Fi community can attempt to validate its coexistence efficacy in an open and comprehensive fashion . But that would only be one necessary step on the path toward equitable spectrum sharing . As we have detailed before , the LTE-U Forum coexistence specification leaves substantial room for different vendor and carrier approaches , which are likely to do disproportionate harm to Wi-Fi . <p> While this quite limited testing at Qualcomm 's facilities raised more questions than answers for us , CableLabs remains fully committed to rectifying the shortcomings in unlicensed LTE coexistence. - Indeed , we have seen more hopeful progress in the development of the global standard form of the technology , LAA-LTE , which we are cautiously optimistic is on a path to coexist well. - The more aggressive approach taken by LTE-U clearly poses significant challenges , but we see promise in the open standards process and the particular technical choices of LAA as the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coexistence in unlicensed spectrum requires a broadly supported agreement on specific solutions . That is why a collaborative , open standards development process is so important " that is how Wi-Fi is developed . Its success is self-evident in the marketplace .

Now , I 've been doing these predictions for many many years and actually have a pretty good track record . I 've made most , I 've missed a few . - But also , I like to go out on a limb and give some predictions that kind of , maybe , push the envelope a little bit . <p> What 's the number one prediction for 2017 ? It 's around augmented reality , virtual reality , but more importantly , mixed reality . Mixed reality is really this combination of AR and VR where you actually see data and information that you can act upon . This kind of an experience is going to be really mind-blowing for people . It 's really a great opportunity for content creators to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storytelling , the way of telling stories , and the way of making information interesting and actionable . So stay tuned , this is going to be a very exciting area . The first part of the year we 're going to see more work in the hardware technologies . As we get into the latter half of the year , it 's really going to be exciting to see some of this new content that is going to become available . <p> What 's the second prediction ? Second prediction is IoT : the Internet of Things is going to continue to be the hot area for 2017 . Now , we 've seen this introduction of IoT devices really explode in 2016 . But one of the concerns that 's really come out is security . The ability for hackers or people who are not friendly to be able to access IoT devices in consumers ' homes has really become front-page news . So the question I have is , the technology is there , it 's going to continue to expand , it 's continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area has to be addressed before I predict broad consumer adoption of IoT devices . We 're going to see IoT in everything from home security , home monitoring , heating , air conditioning , home appliances . We 're also going to see some IoT devices and interesting areas like home health : healthcare devices that allow your doctors to monitor your healthcare , maybe after procedures or whatever , in your home and that just reinforces this one critical area which is around security to make this technology broadly available . <p> The third area is around display devices . Now , if you go back and you look at my predictions in previous years , I 've talked about 3D the year it became a hot issue at some of the trade shows . We 've talked about 4K. 4K high dynamic range ( HDR ) which is broadly going to be just a boon area for this year . In fact in 2016 , in going into the holiday season , it became really very prevalent for people to buy these new kinds of TVs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's left to be done is around flexible displays . Flexible displays being built on new kinds of materials such as this mylar , which is the backing material that 's being used in some of the flexible displays that you 'll see come available in the first part of 2017 . This allows for displays to be manufactured that are one millimeter thick that literally you can attach to your wall as if it were wallpaper . What does this mean for the broad marketplace ?

@@88722622 @4222622/ <h> Share 210661 @qwx830661 <h> Security <h> Device Security in the Internet of Things <h> Share <p> As of the writing , some of the largest distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attacks ever are actively disrupting major service and content providers . Many of the attacks are being reported as leveraging Internet of Things devices such as IP cameras . It 's interesting that these dramatic attacks are happening during Cybersecurity Awareness month . <h> How to Affect Change In Security <p> For many , IoT literally opens doors ; for those of us in need of electronic assistance for key tasks , this is critical for daily living ; with an estimated 20 billion devices online four years from now , it is a critical security requirement. - CableLabs is focused on specific goals in securing Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices for three specific reasons : 1 ) our desire to protect the privacy and security of our subscribers ; 2 ) enabling trust in the technology automating the environment we live in ; and 3 ) the need to protect the network infrastructure supporting subscriber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for handling both the heterogeneous security models of existing devices through advanced networking techniques and in future devices through guiding standards bodies and industry coalitions in security considerations . <h> Who is Looking out for Your Privacy ? <p> Subscriber privacy goes beyond personal anonymity ; it includes protecting information that can be used to identify people , or their devices. - Consider a mobile device , such as a Bluetooth fitness band , that broadcasts its unique identifier whenever requested ( such as during any handshake to authenticate the device on various networks ) . That broadcast identifier could be used without the device owner 's knowledge to identify and track shoppers in a mall , protesters , or visitors at medical clinics among other concerns . Interestingly , network protection starts with device identity , and while many put this in opposition to the subscriber privacy , it does not need to be . Prior to onboarding devices into the network , which involves authentication and authorization as well as exchanging credentials and network configuration details , devices can provide temporary random identifier for new onboarding requests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attestable , and unique identifier so that network operators can trace malicious behavior . Insecure devices that can evade identification , spoof their network address or misrepresent themselves , all while participating in botnets are a threat to everyone. - Being able to rapidly trace attacks back to offending devices allows operators to more effectively coordinate with device owners in surgically tracking down and quarantining these threats . <h> Security " Where , When and How <p> Subscriber security is different from privacy and looks to ensure availability , confidentiality , and integrity. - Availability is the key reason for the need for immutable identifiers within networks . When networked devices are subverted to participate in DDoS attacks , the ability to trace traffic to the corrupted devices is key . Encryption of data ( in use , at rest , and in transit ) is the primary means of assuring confidentiality . Since many IoT devices are constrained in processing power , it has become easy for manufacturers to overlook the need for confidentiality ( data protection ) , arguing that the processing , storage and power costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposable IoT devices are capable of using PKI thanks to Elliptical Curve Cryptography ( ECC ) . ECC requires smaller keys and enables faster encryption than traditional methods have allowed " all while maintaining the same level of security assurances as traditional ( RSA ) cryptography . This allows not only for confidentiality , but can also be used to deliver integrity through non-repudiation ( a device can not deny it received a command/message ) and message origin assurance ( through signing or credential exchange ) . - However , good ECC curve selection is very important . A final element of security is the ability for these devices to securely update their operating system , firmware , drivers , and protocol stacks . No system is perfect , and when a potential vulnerability is discovered , updating those devices already deployed will be a key part of the success of the IoT and how we interact with these tools . <h> Forming Trust <p> These elements described above , availability , privacy , confidentiality , and integrity , all work together to develop trust . This trust comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers have with devices , the more trust is earned . Negative experiences deteriorate this trust , and this can happen disproportionally to events which built trust , and it often happens vicariously as opposed to personal experience. - For example , a subscriber who reads about a personal security camera that has been visible to others on the internet , - may forego the purchase of that , or similar , devices . The overall goal is to improve experiences for consumers both in future devices and to limit not only how many devices are compromised , but also limit the scope and impact of any individual vulnerability through leveraging multiple layers of defense . <h> Working Together Toward Network Protection <p> When IoT devices can be used en masse to leverage attacks targeting DNS servers , and when consumer market incentives do n't enforce security as a primary concern , industry standards bodies and consortia are typically called on to develop solutions . The Open Connectivity Foundation ( OCF ) is the leading IoT influence group , with over 200 leading global manufacturers and software developers ( Intel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) joining forces to ensure secure and interoperable IoT solutions . Other ecosystems are converging on OCF as well , and groups like UPnP , the AllSeen Alliance , and OneM2M have merged into the OCF organization . CableLabs and network operators including Comcast and Shaw are part of this movement , contributing code , technical security expertise , leadership , specifications , and time to make the Internet of Things safer for everyone . The Linux Foundation project , IoTivity , is being built as a platform to enable device manufacturers to more economically include security and interoperability in their products . OCF is driving toward support within IoT devices for subscriber privacy , security , and trust . <p> Standards organizations tend to focus on future devices , but helping manage existing devices is another area of research and exploration . The IoT security community is actively engaged not only on the future , but on the present , and how to improve consumer , manufacturer and operator experiences . A key tool to support existing IoT systems will be intermediating device/internet connections and providing bridges between ecosystems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help manage devices . <h> Convergence <p> These different needs , privacy , security , trust and network protection , all combine to create a positive perspective on the IoT environment. - Imagine devices which are highly available , trusted to do what they need to do , when they need to , for only whom they are intended to , and that communicate across networks securely , all while maintaining privacy . This is the focus of component and device manufacturers , network operators , integrators , academics , and practitioners alike. - The convergence we are seeing around standards and open source projects is great news for all of us . <p> Interested in learning more ? - Join Brian and several others at the InformEDG Conference in New York , April 12 , 2017.

This traffic explosion is putting pressure on service providers to rein in costs while increasing capacity. - Enter Software Defined Networking ( SDN ) and Network Function Virtualization ( NFV ) . - In much the same way that virtualization and Cloud have changed computing , the combination of these two technologies have the potential to lower costs , decrease customer provisioning time , and accelerate new service introduction . SDN and NFV will also allow increased automation and customer self-service , thereby reducing trouble tickets and operating costs . <p> Generally speaking , SDN describes an open architecture comprising a set of APIs , and control protocols such as OpenFlow , Forwarding and Control Element Separation ( ForCES ) , and SNMP that allow for dynamic , distributed provisioning and automation . To this list , CableLabs is adding a PacketCable MultiMedia ( PCMM ) plugin " check out our interview on SDN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOCSIS links . Using SDN , service providers can use DevOps tools such as Puppet and Chef to provision network devices , replacing error-prone manual processes . <p> NFV decouples network functions such as firewalls , deep packet inspection , caching , etc. , from proprietary hardware so that they can be run in software on generic ( e.g. , x86 ) servers. - - This allows service providers to use standard IT virtualization software to dynamically instantiate , move , or scale network functions . While not reducing the overall computational load , service providers have flexibility to decide where to put the load , e.g. , moving it from a crowded hub site to a headend or regional data center . <p> While either SDN or NFV can be used by itself , there is synergy in combining the two technologies. - Taken in combination , NFV provides the what ' ( virtualization architecture ) and SDN provides the how ' ( APIs and control protocols ) to enable service providers to embrace network virtualization. - These technologies also accelerate new service deployment , as they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be tested , and deployed at scale using MSOs ' internal cloud infrastructures . As part of CableLabs ' Open Networking assessment , we determined that by 2018 the combined technologies have the potential to significantly reduce OpEx and CapEx , while increasing revenue in the form of new dynamic services provided to consumers . <p> - <p> The revolution in networking , heralded by SDN and NFV , has profound implications for MSOs . As networks become part of the cloud ' , MSOs can sell Network-as-a-Service to enterprise customers and other MSOs . In addition , these technologies will allow MSOs to sell dynamic , mass-customized services. - As we have seen with smartphones , customers will be able to condition their service by selecting from a curated selection of apps ' ( e.g. , optimized over-the-top video , optimized gaming , de-optimized peer-to-peer file transfers , etc. ) . - I 'm personally looking forward to network-based parental controls and firewall services to simplify my home network , so I do n't have to maintain policies on all my devices. - Also analogous to cell phones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and device-independent access to services , whether accessing them from home , CableWiFi , or a hotel across the country . <p> At CableLabs , we are bringing SDN and NFV to the cable industry through two projects. - Our Open Networking project is exploring how to virtualize cable access network hardware elements , particularly focusing on head-end devices such as the CMTS. - This project is focused on rapid prototyping using emerging SDN toolkits . This will enable us to develop a scalable architecture , roadmap , and requirements for broad application of virtualization in the network. - - Our second project involves developing a Virtual CPE prototype to demonstrate the applicability of these technologies on very low-end devices . - We are also engaged with the ETSI NFV Industry Specification Group , where we sit on the Network Operators Council ( NOC ) .

@@88722703 @4222703/ <h> Share 210661 @qwx830661 <h> Technology <h> Voice Service Over Wireless Networks <h> Share <p> Voice traffic has consumed the airwaves of cellular and Wi-Fi networks for years now , being popular with subscribers and a revenue source for operators . Wi-Fi calling is rapidly expanding as a valued service for subscribers . Operators who offer Wi-Fi calling on their own Wi-Fi networks have a unique advantage to provide a superior Wi-Fi calling user experience . Operators have significantly expanded their networks while greatly improving performance and ease of access for subscribers . As a result , operators can successfully offer Wi-Fi only voice services , or Wi-Fi preferred services in cooperation with a macro cellular operator . Furthermore , the deployment of LTE networks has made handovers between Wi-Fi and cellular operators much more achievable compared to legacy 3G networks . What are the recent developments to be aware of ? How can these developments be leveraged ? <h> Voice over Wi-Fi <p> Manufacturers , operators and the WFA are taking several initiatives to make voice calling on Wi-Fi substantially more available , reliable and easier to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks , and adding 5Ghz radios , to help ensure the sufficient network capacity . Device manufacturers are improving the voice calling friendly Wi-Fi capabilities of their smart phones . Through CableLabs testing services , we have recognized that device manufacturers are also delivering on improved Wi-Fi RF performance that enhances voice calling quality and connectivity . Read more on RF performance tests from a past blog post , " Are all Wi-Fi Channels Created Equal ? " The WFA has a number of device certifications in place , and in development , that help make Wi-Fi calling much more seamless with reliable performance . Recent industry trends indicate accelerating growth of voice calls over Wi-Fi networks . <h> All IP Wi-Fi and Cellular Handovers Thanks to LTE <p> LTE is a 4G cellular air interface well suited for VoIP calling . Unlike circuit switched 3G networks , LTE provides low latency all IP mobile access . VoIP services , including VoLTE , can be deployed as an application over the LTE data service . Therefore , a single VoIP application can be used over both LTE and Wi-Fi access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IP address ( or network address ) presented to the VoIP client on the smartphone . Operators can manage this either in their core networks , or at the VoIP application itself . Today 's options with LTE are much simpler than attempting handovers between IP based Wi-Fi networks and circuit switched based 3G voice networks . <p> It is not strictly necessary for the Wi-Fi operator to arrange a relationship with an LTE operator in order to provide continuous voice service to subscribers across Wi-Fi and LTE networks . A relationship can , however , provide additional levels of network integration using standardized interfaces that may improve the handover experience depending upon the capabilities of the LTE network . <h> Device Configuration Impacts User Experience <p> Device configuration has a direct impact on the user experience . Operators have deployed Over The Top VoIP applications on mobile devices to offer a compelling voice service while on either Wi-Fi or LTE networks . These applications may also provide service across Wi-Fi and LTE networks with varying degrees of user involvement . OTT applications often include their own custom dialers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may implement further optimizations to enhance the user experience . The mobile device can be optimized to support faster handovers using air interface parameters not normally available to applications . The device can be customized to exploit mobility and network selection optimizations that may include additional interfaces with network servers . Furthermore , the device can make use of the native dialer for voice services , regardless of Wi-Fi or LTE access .. <h> Network Selection <p> The best user experience starts with network selection . When should a Wi-Fi or LTE network be automatically selected by the device ? Network selection per operator policy can provide subscribers more seamless and reliable voice calls . The operator 's network can either direct the smart phone to the proper network , or the operator can provision a policy so that the device can execute network selection . Many vendors offer proprietary solutions for network selection . Wireless forums such as the Wi-Fi Alliance and 3GPP are specifying standard device interfaces to support operator provisioned network selection policy . <h> Summary <p> Wi-Fi calling is growing rapidly . More operators offer voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their Wi-Fi networks while improving performance , which can provide superior service to their Wi-Fi calling subscribers . LTE networks provide an opportunity to offer simplified and more seamless all-IP handovers between Wi-Fi and cellular networks . Industry trends among operators , manufacturers and wireless forums point to greater use of voice over Wi-Fi by subscribers , which means increased opportunities for operators .

However , cloud solutions do provide many of the building blocks as a great starting point . <h> Current Environment <p> Service providers are evolving their networks and services to better meet customer needs and expectations . Hosted applications are continuously updated with new features and consumers are starting to demand a similar frequency of change with services innovation . This rate of change and innovation in service provider networks will not be achieved by rolling more and more specialized hardware boxes to tens of millions of customers . Delivering software-based network solutions that reduce dependency on specialized hardware boxes is the only way to meet these customer expectations . <p> End users ' expectation for service quality continues to increase , and they are typically not willing to accept a tradeoff between performance and capabilities . They want both increased performance and increased capabilities . Service Level Agreements ( SLAs ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources to meet these needs is neither economic , nor sustainable . High performance and network proximity are key to delivering interactive voice and video solutions with high bandwidth and low latency . No one wants to be misunderstood when delivering nuanced details during a videoconference with their stakeholders ! <p> Currently , network services are delivered on several specialty devices located at customer sites or hosted by operators . Today , these specialty devices only provide a subset of needed capabilities and physical upgrades are both expensive and time consuming . <h> Critical Success Factors <h> Performance <p> In addition to being consistent and predictable , the network must be fast . There are no milliseconds to spare while moving across the network . For time sensitive applications such as cellular networks , there is no tolerance for physically routing packets inappropriately . They need to traverse the quickest route to their ultimate destination . To use a reference from " Smokey and the Bandit , " one of my favorite movies , Bandit ( Burt Reynolds ' character ) did n't drive through New York City to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortest and fastest route possible . Network traffic needs to do the same thing . Stick to the fastest and most direct route and only deviate when absolutely necessary , <p> This is not the natural mode for software running in an interrupt-driven multi-tasking environment . Much like humans trying to multi-task , tasks tend to take much longer if we are very busy . Software needs to be configured to prevent or bound interference when multiple workloads are running on the same computer . <h> Location <p> " Location , location , location " is as important to network virtualization as it is to real-estate . Virtual Network Functions ( VNFs ) are the software components that replace the current Physical Network Functions ( PNFs ) . VNFs need to be strategically placed , including positioning at the customer site or even other service provider nodes . Managing Wi-Fi networks requires access to devices at customer sites . Even when offloading the majority of the work to a hosted cloud , there are still physical accesses , routing and local security workloads that are best hosted on the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delivery Networks need caching instances to be located relatively close to the customer site to reduce latency and core network bandwidth . Storage of data should not be on the other side of a busy or slow network connection . The path the data takes over the network needs to provide a consistent user experience . The network also needs to be flexible , as it must adapt to varying network loads and outages . Typically , enterprise cloud applications are designed for high availability and low cost . Speedier customer use is not always a consideration . The ability to easily manage service delivery locations by automatically placing and moving workloads within a data center , or geographically is a must for virtualizing network services . <h> Interoperability <p> VNFs must work with the deployed Network Function Virtualization ( NFV ) infrastructure and hardware . Should each VNF require a different infrastructure , it would be nearly impossible to manage and would cost much more to deploy . Interoperability can enable more competition and a broader set of vendors to deliver network services . Competition drives innovation . Standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading the way in developing the foundational standards for NFV based on a set of use cases and requirements coming from industry . Other standards bodies are referencing the ETSI-NFV work to address application-specific needs . These standards are becoming the basis for defining interoperability . But as with any standards effort , there will be many interpretations and implementations that follow these guidelines . <p> All of the independent components will need to be validated at key touch points to ensure interoperability and there is still no single test suite available today that will guarantee interoperability between VNFs or between VNFs and the infrastructure that hosts them . To help address this issue , ETSI-NFV is developing test specifications that are being referenced by OPNFV which itself was initiated by the ETSI NFV co-founders to accelerate implementation and feedback on the NFV specifications . <h> Looking Ahead <p> Over the next two to three years , we should see NFV being incorporated in mainstream cloud platforms .

Currently , the SNAPS project leverages a specific configuration of OPNFV which is being tested and hardened . Many of our enhancements have been included in the OPNFV " Colorado " release of the Apex installer . <h> Sharing our Expertise <p> While trying out different OpenStack installers , we soon ran into the dilemma of how to quickly use and validate our cloud in a repeatable manner .

Upon clarification , the claim turned out to be a bit misleading ; nevertheless , the claim caught the attention of the regulators . <p> The U.S. Energy Department started down the path to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations would not go into effect until 5 years after the regulation became final , and would only apply to new STBs . <p> The problem with this is that we do n't even know what STBs will look like in five years. - The pay TV industry is making continuous improvements in their devices , as well as looking to combine services going forward. - Today the cable industry is deploying integrated devices that provide both high-speed data and phone service via cable. - - Additional features such as home security monitoring , home energy management , and even health management can be added. - Regulationsconstraining the energy consumption of STBs also constrain innovation in this space . <h> Coming Together <p> Seeking an alternative , the major players in satellite , cable , and telecom came together in 2012 to form an unprecedented voluntary agreement wherein they would take it upon themselves to build , purchase and deploy more energy efficient STBs. - Working together , this solution addresses over 90 million pay TV households , which represents over 90% of the subscribers in the U.S. <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the energy advocates , and therefore was not enough to get the Energy Department to terminate their regulatory process. - So the members of the VA and the energy advocates reconvened in 2013 and came up with a more aggressive set of energy targets that the advocates would endorse , and the advocates signed on to the voluntary agreement . <p> Shortly thereafter , the U.S. Energy Department endorsed the amended VA and publicly terminated their regulatory proceedings . - - This is a win-win for everyone : service providers , advocates , regulators , and consumers ! <p> This approach is significantly better than going down the regulatory path for many reasons. - It results in much faster adoption and deployment of energy efficient STBs - rather than waiting the 5 years for regulation to take effect , it goes into effect in 2014. - In addition , the cable operators are updating software on some of their existing STBs to reduce the energy consumption of devices already fielded , whereas regulation only applies to new devices. - The VA allows for new features and concepts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated VA can be found here . <h> The Role of CableLabs <p> With expertise in the technical capabilities of cable STBs , and their corresponding power consumption , CableLabs played a significant role in the negotiations with the energy advocates and crafting the updated VA. - We have established the CableLabs Energy Lab , and are already supporting the cable signatories ' testing of their STBs in preparation for the first reporting period . <p> CableLabs is also factoring energy management into its specifications. - Most notable is the introduction of 1x1 mode into the DOCSIS 3.0 specification. - In this mode , the cable modem can convert from using multiple bonded channels to just one channel upstream and one channel downstream if the data rate is low , which can save energy . <p> CableLabs is committed to helping cable operators and manufacturers design and deploy more energy-efficient consumer premises equipment. - We have working groups that meet regularly with our members and vendors to address many energy management initiatives , including efforts on the international front. - CableLabs is also hosting a website that contains energy consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1 , 2014 . <p> Debbie Fitzgerald is a Principal Architect in the Application Technologies R&amp;D group at CableLabs. - She leads the Energy Management Program at CableLabs , working with cable operators and manufacturers to improve the energy efficiency of cable consumer premises equipment ( CPE ) .

A surge of angst began to well up inside of me . We needed to handle a load of eighty 250MB Yocto build images being siphoned from the cloud simultaneously with full IP provisioning without a hiccup . Countermeasures were taken to mitigate the risk by installing an additional circuit at our lab and configuring a dedicated network for the event . We executed dry runs . We had back-up plans . - I was still edgy . <p> So " what 's the RDK buzz all about ?

It is refreshing to quickly build a prototype for a real customer use case without all of the smoke and mirrors . Through an open and collaborative effort , CableLabs and BSS/OSS solutions provider Intraway developed a proof-of-concept and demonstration using open source software . - This demonstration manages virtualized customer premise equipment ( vCPE ) and is compliant with Metro Ethernet Forum ( MEF ) defined Carrier Ethernet services . Details on the demonstration and how you run and build upon this work will be shared later in this post . <p> Software-Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization , commonly known as SDN and NFV , are terms that are present in every telecommunications engineer 's mind today . It is hard to look at a technical newsletter or site without seeing at least one article with those acronyms . <p> Most Communications Service Provider ( CSP ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they represent a shift in the networking paradigm . The real question is not how trendy this technological approach is , but rather if it is still just hype or if there are genuine business opportunities for service providers . In this article , we intend to answer that question . And , here 's a spoiler : this technology is closer than you think . <p> For instance , what happens in a non-virtualized environment when a customer requests a bandwidth upgrade for all its branches ? Normally , it would take weeks to manually gather the network configuration . Then there are the planning , designing and delivery stages , which can take months . - And what if that upgrade request was made to handle a high-demand period ? - Too often , by the time the service operator is ready to deliver , the high demand is over . But SDN/NFV , along with an orchestration layer , delivers new services and change requests in a matter of days or even hours . With SDN and NFV adoption , rapid innovation is the new network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenue that we are just starting to imagine the possibilities . This technology represents such a shift that while not yet fully realized , its promise is already changing the business playbook for MSOs . <h> The Enabling Technology <p> SDN is commonly characterized as the separation of the networking equipment 's control capability from the data manipulation and forwarding processes . By separating the control of networked equipment from the hardware , SDN provides an opportunity to programmatically configure the network . By exposing control of networked elements through a software programming interface , configuration and control of the network can be automated through software scripts or applications . <p> Software controlling operation of networking equipment can be modified and tested easily , and deployed much faster than the design-build-test cycle of the hardware . Thus , SDN provides the opportunity to greatly streamline not only the initial deployment of services on the network , but also later modification and maintenance . <p> NFV is the modularization of functionality in networking equipment so that it can be separated from the network hardware and potentially executed outside the equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates the opportunity to both simplify network hardware and introduce flexibility in the network architecture . Examples include network functions such as routing , load balancing , packet inspection , and firewall . When implemented in software as independent virtual network functions ( VNF ) , data handling processes such as these can be invoked and chained together as needed . <p> CableLabs established early leadership in virtualization technology for deploying business services by exploring the use of open source SDN controller platforms to configure networking equipment for delivering business/commercial services . Open source refers to the software development by a community of talented developers that are not necessarily all working for the same company . Open source development allows for progress to be made at a pace that is not necessarily tied to a particular organization 's product schedule or hardware specifics . <h> The Demonstration <p> But if SDN and NFV are to be more than a collection of proprietary , semi-closed ecologies , there needs to be a working reference model that the greater communications community can look to for ideas , guidance , and benchmarks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPE demonstration . - The goal of the project is to demonstrate a properly implemented , open-source based SDN solution to support existing services . Intraway volunteered to join CableLabs ( with consultant Inocybe Technologies ) in this open-source effort . <p> Service activation and live modification of business services typically have the longest lead time and often require the most manual intervention . - These use cases were selected for the initial demonstration . - - A point-to-point Ethernet circuit between two User Network Interfaces ( UNIs ) was chosen as the service . - To demonstrate that SDN functions need not be proprietary , we used OpenDaylight as the control plane , OVSDB - for the communications interface , and Open vSwitch to do the actual switching in the CPE devices . <p> For the hardware , we chose to use two Raspberry Pi devices to host the UNIs , an eight port Ethernet switch ( to act as the network ) and a laptop running Ubuntu Linux acting as the controller . - Connected to each of the Raspberry Pi UNIs were laptops acting as the clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client ' laptops is not important . ) <p> Finally , a web interface on the controller laptop is used to configure and initiate the creation of the services . <p> This demonstration shows the creation of an Ethernet Private Line ( EPL ) between the two Raspberry Pi devices at a set bandwidth rate . - After connectivity and traffic are established , we instruct the network to modify the existing rate through the controller software , which then issues instructions to the Raspberry Pi devices . - The bandwidth of the EPL is immediately changed without having to tear down and rebuild the circuit ! <h> Conclusion / Next Steps <p> With the success of the proof-of-concept , the source code is now publicly available in the open source project 's code repositories .

If you send a device to us for testing , not only can you rely on receiving accurate test results , but we will also provide guidance and expertise found nowhere else . Ultimately , we aim to help you get your product to market faster . <h> Lab Services transition <p> My colleague Wylie Nelson , VP of Wireless and Testing Services , gave an update on the CableLabs Lab Services team transition into Kyrio . You can read more about the transition on the Kyrio blog , but now consider Kyrio the storefront for all testing . The Kyrio team will perform the work for certification , but the CableLabs Certification Board will decide what does and does not get certified . <p> This transition allows us to focus on your company goals in new ways across a broader range of services . Wylie will be working closely with the testing team to continuously improve testing processes in order to increase the speed of delivery for our customers . <p> Wondering what we can do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd love to help solve your problems .

Let me recap what has happened over the past 8+ months : <p> All service providers signators are required to post the energy information about their STBs purchased beginning January 1 , 2014 . CableLabs is hosting this information for the 6 cable signatories at http : //energy.cablelabs.com . <p> The procurement commitment is to purchase at least 90% of STBs that meet ENERGY STAR version 3.0 standards , beginning January 1 , 2014 . However , the VA still included a procurement report of purchases made in 2013 . Even in 2013 , the 11 service providers ( across cable , satellite , and telco ) had 85% of their purchases meet the ENERGY STAR 3.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over 14 million existing STBs to enable auto power down capability . <p> CableLabs supported the cable operators with STB energy measurement collection and reporting to the Independent Administrator . All reports were submitted on time and fully complete . <p> The VA also calls for a field verification by an independent third party auditor who will test STB energy consumption in over 80 homes across the US . CableLabs hosted a training event for the independent auditor and service technicians from all the service providers. - - The field verification will begin at the end of September . <p> The VA has already resulted in substantial energy savings for our country . In 2013 , the VA resulted in reduced annual STB energy consumption by 1.4 TWh , representing a savings of approximately $168 million and CO2 savings of 842,000 metric tons . And all these savings are occurring while deployed stock is increasing , and exciting new features are being rolled out by the service providers . <p> Debbie Fitzgerald is Director of Client Application Technologies at CableLabs .

@@88722837 @4222837/ 210661 @qwx830661 <h> Wireless <h> InformEDG Wireless Tackles Spectrum Policy with FCC Commissioners <h> Share <p> Last month in New York , CableLabs hosted its inaugural InformED Wireless conference , where we gathered leaders and luminaries to chart the evolution of wireless networks . Consumers ' appetite for wireless continues to grow , and fixed networks - like cable and its Wi-Fi assets - become ever more important to satisfying their needs . <p> The program was holistic , touching on business strategy , technology , and of course policy , which is fundamental to the future of wireless . Spectrum is the key enabler of our wireless future , and we were fortunate to hear what the FCC has in store from Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Michael O'Reilly , in a conversation facilitated by NCTA Executive Vice President James Assey . <h> Unlicensed Spectrum , Past and Future <p> Commissioner Rosenworcel began by grounding the group in some history , noting that Wi-Fi as we know and love it today is , essentially , a happy policy accident . In liberalizing the 2.4 GHz frequency band for wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine the industry-driven innovation that would take place in what were then considered junk bands ' . <p> Now that Wi-Fi has become consumers ' on-ramp to digital opportunity , the FCC is much more intentionally building on that success . Commissioner O'Reilly noted the substantial opportunity to usher in next-generation gigabit Wi-Fi by opening new bandwidth in the critical 5 GHz frequency band . A portion of 5 GHz is used by Wi-Fi today ; by expanding the spectrum available there , consumers would win big through improved broadband speed and capacity . <p> To make that happen , the FCC is considering how Wi-Fi should share spectrum with another service , known as Dedicated Short Range Communications ( DSRC ) . DSRC received a 5 GHz spectrum allocation in 1999 , and is envisioned by the auto industry to provide vehicle-to-vehicle communications . Since it has not yet been deployed , it is the perfect time to determine spectrum sharing regime . <p> CableLabs has written on this topic , providing the technical foundation for the progress that is possible here , just as we have driven forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders like the Commissioners Rosenworcel and O'Reilly , we should be able to turn that possibility of progress on 5 GHz into reality . <h> Growing the Pie Through Sharing <p> There are no easy wins in spectrum policy . As demand for wireless grows across sectors and services , sharing the spectrum more efficiently becomes increasingly important . By enabling more dynamic use of the spectrum " particularly in frequencies used by the Federal government , according to Commissioner O'Reilly " we can grow the pie for new uses , instead of trying to carve up smaller , unsatisfying slices . <p> Commissioner Rosenworcel noted that the FCC is moving forward with an approach that would do just that . In the 3.5 GHz frequency band , new commercial uses will be enabled later this year , which will share the spectrum with U.S. Naval radar systems through a database-driven access architecture . When the Navy is n't sailing nearby , consumers will be able use the spectrum . <p> CableLabs is doing research in this area under an experimental license from the FCC . We are also helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body that is leading the effort , known as the WinnForum . <h> To the Next Frontier <p> There is much buzz in the industry about 5G ' " the next generation of mobile technology " which is likely to use spectrum in higher frequencies than have been typical to date . These are the spectrum frontiers ' , where no mobile system has yet ventured , but will be integral to network densification and capacity augmentation , and will drive fixed/mobile convergence . <p> Commissioners O'Reilly and Rosenworcel both expressed a desire for the US to take a leadership role in 5G development , which the FCC will assist by making new spectrum frontiers ' available " including the 28 GHz , 37 GHz , 39 GHz , and 60 GHz bands " as early as this summer . <p> Research in this area is progressing apace , and 3GPP , the mobile standards body in which CableLabs participates , is beginning to specify the details of what 5G will look like . But ultimately , progress toward 5G will depend on spectrum availability , in the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address this in 2019 . By the sound of it , the FCC will be well down the path toward these new frontiers by then .

@@88722840 @4222840/ <p> However , the success of 5G will not just be about new wireless technologies ! The deployment of 5G technologies will be dependent on the ability of the wireline transport network connected to the radio access networks ( RANs ) . This is because all the air bits will be transported from the wireline systems , most likely high-speed fiber optic networks . The network architecture and topology are evolving too ( see Figure ) and we expect to see a proliferation of small cells deeper in the network closer to the end-user . Small cells have a range of 10 to 200-meter cell radius within urban and in-building locations , to 1 or 2 km in rural areas . Centralized or Coordinated-RAN solutions , where the baseband units are placed together and share information at a centralized location , require the extremely high speed and low latency only available using fiber networks . The reality is in mobile networks the bits are only air bits for a very short part of their life ! <p> Historically , the transition to new mobile technologies has resulted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the advancement from 3G to 4G , RANs reached a capacity of 1 Gb/s to 10 Gb/s per cell . If you consider the effective throughput for each user and the deployment of multi-antenna technologies , future 5G RANs will require ten times the backhaul capacity of today 's networks . If 5G network technology is deployed at scale , wireless networks will have to xhaul ( backhaul , midhaul , and fronthaul ) massive amounts of data between cell sites and core networks . <p> Compared to alternatives like mm-wave self-backhauling , deploying optical fiber provides a superior technical solution due to bandwidth scaling , low and deterministic latency and jitter , and high system reliability . Optical techniques can also provide the leverage to enhance inter-cell coordination , achieve wide network coherence , and also decrease timing jitter in high order vector modulation and simplify remote radio head architecture . In this sense , fiber is not only the transmission pipe , it can integrate with wireless systems for end-to-end seamless networking purpose to affect network control and power efficiency , minimize latency , provide network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead . <p> Fiber and optical transport technologies are expected to play more and more important roles in the RANs to meet the aggressive performance goals of 5G . CableLabs is heavily involved in both the wireless and wireline portions of RANs . On the wireless portion , CableLabs is contributing to the ongoing formation of 5G technologies and network architectures including multi-gigabit wireless transmission over millimeter-waves and dense mobile and fixed wireless access . On the wireline portion , CableLabs is exploring new fiber optic technologies that increase capacity and lower latency , while also leveraging the unique characteristics of Hybrid Fiber Coax networks . Leveraging our expanded efforts toward university research , we are exploring the melding of wireless and wireline through collaboration with the National Science Foundation 's Fiber-Wireless Integration and Networking ( FiWIN ) center led by Georgia Tech .

@@88722866 @4222866/ <h> Overview <p> The CableLabs Reference Implementation ( RI ) makes use of GStreamer infrastructure for handling MPEG transport data . This includes all stages of set-top box data pipeline : input , demultiplexing , section filtering , audio and video decoding , audio and video mixing/filtering and presenting the final output to the user . GStreamer is part of the Gnome project and aims to provide a complete and open multimedia framework solution for processing audio and video content . The main GStreamer web page can be found here . A high-level list of features is here . And here is how the GStreamer authors themselves describe GStreamer . <h> Official Documentation <p> GStreamer comes with many useful documentation resources . The following reading is recommended : <h> Terminology <p> It is recommended to gain some comfortable level of familiary with the GStreamer terms before attempting to read or write any code . A summary of the most important GST terms from the two previous documentation resources is provided here : <p> Element- a basic GStreamer object that does something with a multimedia content . Elements can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content into the element as well as zero or more source pads that are exit points of data out of the element . <p> Source Element - an element with no sink pads that generates content for the next element . Examples of source elements are : file source ( reads from file and presents the data on its source pad ) or UDP source ( reads from a UDP sockets and presents the data on its source pad for the next element ) . <p> Filter Element- an element with one or more sink pads and one or more source pads . The filter elements process the data . Examples : <p> Demultiplexer is a 1-to-N filter element with one sink pad that accepts a source of multiplexed data ( for example an MPEG-2 transport stream ) and then presents demultiplexed data on its source pads ( elementary audio and video streams , private section data ) . <p> Multiplexer is a a N-to-1 filter element with many sink pads and one source pad . It combines the output from different sink pads into a single multiplexed content on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no source pads that takes the GStreamer content outside of the GStreamer graph . It is a " data terminator " . Examples of sink elements include file sink ( saves received content into the file ) and video sink ( DirectX display , XVideo display ) . <p> Plugin - a collection of one or more GStreamer elements . A GStreamer plugin is a DLL on Windows or DSO on Linux . A plugin DLL has to be loaded first by the core GStreamer engine before any of its elements can be instantiated inside a GStreamer application graph . <p> Bin - a collection of GStreamer elements . This allows grouping of multiple elements into a single logical entity that can be used in multiple places inside a larger bin or pipeline . <p> Pipeline - a special , top-level bin that allows scheduling and running of all of the elements . Pipelines make GStreamer elements and bins run . <h> PC Platform <p> Most of the GStreamer source has already been incorporated into the RI Platform repository here . We are currently using the following packages : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of core elements and a collection of core indexers . <p> **32;1360;TOOLONG - A collection of base plugins . Currently , we are not using any of the plugins from this collection but this source code base is required by the Good and FFMPEG plugins . <p> **32;1394;TOOLONG - A collection of " good " plugins . At this time we are using the udpsrc element from gstudp plugin and rtpmp2tdepay element from the gstrtp plugin . <p> **29;1428;TOOLONG - A collection of wrapper elements that allow to use various components from the FFMPEG library as GStreamer pipeline elements . Currently , none are used but primarily demultiplexer and decoder components will be utilized . <p> For more information about different types of plugin collections ( The Good , the Bad and the Ugly ) , read this . <p> At this time , the GStreamer source base correcly builds and links in Windows . For more information on how to build the RI Platform repository , follow this link . <h> Library Update ( in-progress ) <p> The GStreamer library is a few years old now and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10/1/2011 ) . We are switching to the following packages : <p> **25;1459;TOOLONG - GStreamer engine plus two plugins : a collection of core elements and a collection of core indexers . <p> **32;1486;TOOLONG - A collection of base plugins . We are not using any of the plugins from this collection but this source code base is required by the Good and FFMPEG plugins . <p> **32;1520;TOOLONG - A collection of " good " plugins . At this time we are using the- udpsrc and udpsink- elements from- gstudp- plugin <h> Runtime <p> Once the RI Platform repository is successfully built , the following GStreamer tools and the actual RI GStreamer main application can be used to verify the correctness of the build and runtime environment . <h> runGST.sh <p> runGST.sh is a convenience script that will run the RI pipeline in many configurations as well as run gst-inspect on any element named on the command line . It uses the gst-inspect and gst-launch commands ( described in the sections following ) along with setting the appropriate environment variables to do so . There are several options , invoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once the RI Platform is successfully built , the tool can be used to validate some of the GStreamer elements used in the pipeline . <p> If you want to run both the input and output pipelines , two terminal windows will be required . - In the first window , type : <p> . /runGST.sh -capall -in -ch 1 <p> This will start the input pipeline , capture stdin and stderr to a file called gst-input.log and use the file- **38;1554;TOOLONG as the source of MPEG data . <p> In the second window , type : <p> . /runGST.sh -capall -out -ch 1 <p> This will start the output pipeline , capture stdin and stderr to a file called gst-output.log and use the program with PID 0x7D0 in the stream- of MPEG data to decode . <p> Once these commands are invoked ( not order dependent ) , you should see looping video playing in a native window . <p> Either of these commands can be altered with the -gdb option to run that respective pipeline in gdb for debugging purposes . This is helpful if you are receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakpoint and single step the code in your element . Sometimes it is- desirable to run either the input or output pipeline with VLC instead of our elements . This allows for a comparison against an " off-the-shelf " sink or source . To do so , use the -vlc option ; if this option is used for both pipelines you will not be running any of the RI pipeline code . Finally , the -standalone option ( mutually exclusive with -in and -vlc ) uses a file source for the input of the output pipeline ; i.e. the input pipeline and UDP portion of the output pipeline are skipped and MPEG data is fed directly to the pre-processor . <p> The GStreamer pipelines can now be run across a network ( i.e.- separate- machines ) by making use of the -host and -port options . <p> If you want to look at the capabilities or properties of a given element , type : <p> . /runGST.sh -inspect &lt;element&gt; <p> This will run gst-inspect on the element provided on the command line ; e.g. udpsrc or mpegdecoder. - The -capall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a file called gst-inspect.log <h> Gst Inspect <p> gst-inspect is a command-line tool that allows querying element properties and displaying them in human-readable form . Once the RI Platform is successfully built , the tool can be found at the following location : <p> There are two cases when the tool is used : <p> to list all of the elements installed on the system : <p> to filter out a list of elements or to search for a particular element : <p> to check properties of a particular element : <p> For those familiar with the Linux-based GStreamer environment , there are a couple of differences that need to be remembered when using the tool in the Windows-based RI environment : <p> Unless explicitly added to the $PATH system variable , the gst-inspect invocation is not able to locate and choose an installed version of the tool . It is required that a full version of the tool is explicity specified . In our case , it is : <p> The plugins are not installed in a system directory . The tool must be explicity told what plugins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the previous example has only 1 plugin ( containing static 2 elements ) loaded . For example to list elements inside the UDP plugin , it is necessary to type : <h> Gst Launch <p> gst-launch is another command-line tool provided by the GStreamer package . It allows instantiating elements and running pipelines without writing any code . It is a great prototyping tool and can be found at the following location : <p> As with gst-inspect , an explicit version number invocation as well as explicit DLL/DSO load option need to be used when invoking the tool in the Windows RI environment . Here are some examples of how the tool can be used to construct GStreamer pipelines from elements : : <p> To create a very very simple pipeline that uses the file source element to read a file mp2ts.mpg and pass its content to a file sink element that writes that file to a disk ( i.e. a GStreamer-based file copy ) , type <p> What should happen is a file copy.mpg should be created in a current directory with exactly the same contents as mp2ts.mpg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to verify that both files are identical . <p> Another example : a save-network-stream application . It listens on a UDP socket and saves received content to a file : <p> The invocation now blocks because the pipeline is listening on a UDP socket , port 1234 until explicitly interrupted ( via Ctrl+C in the terminal window ) . To test the pipeline , it is necessary to spool something to that socket . Any MPEG-2 content encapsulated in UDP/RTP will work . There is a Wiki page that describes how to do this with VLC . Once something is spooled to the socket , it will be saved to a file save.mpg . VLC can be used again to playback the saved content to verify that the pipeline operation worked successfully . <h> RI <p> The RI actually used to use a pipeline identical to what was described in the last paragraph . In order to start it , run ri.exe and spool content to the RI GStreamer application as described on this page . If you successfully get through this last step , your GStreamer RI application is working correctly ! -

Wherever a school day begins , imagine having the opportunity for it to end in a different state , in a foreign country , or maybe even on a distant continent . <p> As a part of the Education Initiative Team at CableLabs and as a parent of children in public schools , I have spent time re-imagining how technology could transform our classrooms . What if we used technology to create a borderless , or even boundless educational experience ? What impact could we have ? What challenges would we face ? What solutions might be possible ? <h> Technology Enables Alternative Learning Experiences <p> By maximizing the use of technology in the classroom and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology can enable traditionally schooled , homeschooled , and remote learners to join in on classroom lessons . Video communication , and potentially newer experiences offered by augmented and virtual reality solutions , can offer the ultimate virtual field trip for classrooms and schools of any size. - Instead of the required reading assignments that we are all used to , e.g. read this book , write this essay , imagine high school classrooms where an alternative learning experience is assigned to supplement the required reading. - For example , a teacher could coordinate a live video conference session with an author as an engaged interactive experience for students . <p> Newer technology and broadband connectivity , including next generation solutions such as DOCSIS- 3.1 and Full Duplex DOCSIS- 3.1 , can leverage multi-location learning and collaboration . Students in the United States can participate in the global community with students from other countries , thus creating opportunities to gain knowledge of other cultures , economic strata , and quality of life . By expanding the scope and perspective of knowledge students gain from alternative learning experiences , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology allow us to provide a broader frame of reference for education and gear outward focus for the next generation to be successful on a global level ? - Could a greater international perspective in the classroom administer opportunities to solve real world issues and ultimately empower our children through project based learning and problem solving ? <p> Utilization of video conferencing in schools is not a new concept. - In fact , many schools have embraced the technology to create alternative learning situations . - For example , through Skype Collaborations , teachers in Kansas learned about a water crisis in Nairobi that prevents students from coming to school . Within their science , math , and social studies classes , students in Kansas learn about the Nairobi community , the living conditions , and the resources needed to fix the water crisis faced by the school . Shortly after hearing about their circumstances , the students and teachers of the Kansas school set a goal to help the children of Nairobi get back to their classroom. - By Skyping with representatives from Life Straw , the students learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common household items . Then the students created awareness of the crisis by fundraising to obtain Life Straw Filtration systems for the Nairobi school . After watching students describe their project , it 's clear to see the passion they have gained while working towards providing a sustainable solution for those in need . Through this example , there is no question that technology , often enabled through broadband connectivity , is capable of being used for a variety of purposes . <h> The Role of the Cable Industry <p> Introducing alternative learning experiences is an opportunity for the cable industry . As an already strong partner for education , the cable industry is in a position to promote meaningful change. - One idea would be to design and develop trusted solutions and enable educators to structure lesson plans outside of the normal classroom activities , take advantage of highly-trusted networks , and introduce new media types . - This will enable the teachers to focus on the content of the lesson , and the tech to be more easily accessed to support learning objectives . <p> Appropriate use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy and altruistic perspectives that would not have been possible even ten years ago. - We have the opportunity to develop a generation of individuals who are more empathetic and outwardly focused . - By promoting learning without limiting the experiences in our own backyards , we can create dialogue to teach compassion , appreciation , and authenticity . 
@@88722912 @4222912/ <h> Share 210661 @qwx830661 <h> Technical Blog <h> Web Media Playback : Solved with dash.js <h> Share <p> ( Disclaimer : the author is a regular contributor to the dash.js project ) A crucial piece of any standards development process is the creation of a reference implementation to validate the feasibility of the many requirements set forth within the standard . After all , it makes no sense to create a standard if it is impossible to create fully compliant products . The DASH Industry Forum recognized this and created the dash.js project . <p> dash.js is an open-source , JavaScript media player library coupled with a few example applications . It relies on the W3C Media Source Extensions ( MSE ) for adaptive bitrate playback and Encrypted Media Extensions ( EME ) for protected content support . While dash.js started out as a reference implementation , it is has been adopted by many organizations for use in commercial products . The DASH-IF Interoperability Points specification has achieved relative stability with respect to the base functionality , so the development team is focused on adding features and improving performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players . <p> One of the benefits of dash.js is in its richness of features . It supports both live and on-demand content , multi-period manifests , and subtitles , to name a few . The player is highly extensible with an adaptive-bitrate rules engine , configurable buffer scheduling , and a metrics reporting system . The example application provided with the library source displays the current buffer levels and current representation index for both audio and video , and it allows the user to manually initiate bitrate changes or let the player rules handle it automatically . Finally , the app contains a buffer level graph , manifest display and debug logging window . <p> CableLabs has been an active contributor to the dash.js project . Much of the EME support in dash.js was designed and implemented by CableLabs to ensure that the application will support the wide variety of API implementations found in production desktop web browsers today . Additionally , CableLabs has created and hosted test content in the dash.js demo application to ensure that others can observe the dash.js EME implementation in action and evaluate support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection <p> The media library contains extensive support for playback of protected content . The EME specification has seen many modifications and updates over the years and browser vendors have selected various points during its development to release their products . In order to support as many of these browsers as possible , dash.js has developed a set of APIs ( **34;2736;TOOLONG ) as an abstraction layer to interface with the underlying implementation , whatever that may be . The APIs are designed to mimic the functionality of the most recent EME spec . Several implementations of this API have been developed to translate back to the EME versions that were found in production browsers . The media player will detect browser support and instantiate the proper JavaScript class automatically . The **34;2772;TOOLONG and **44;2808;TOOLONG classes provide the application with access to the EME system both inside and outside the player . ProtectionModel provides management of MediaKeySessions and protection system event notification for a single piece of content . Most actions performed on the model are made using ProtectionController. - - Applications can use the media player library to instantiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once licenses have been pre-fetched , the app can attach the protection objects to the player to associate the licenses with the HTMLMediaElement that will handle playback . <p> An EME demo app is provided with dash.js ( **41;2854;TOOLONG ) that provides some visibility and control into the EME operations taking place in the browser . The app allows the user to pre-fetch licenses , manage key session persistence , and playback associated content . It also shows the selected key system , and the status of all licenses associated with key sessions . <p> Greg Rutz is a Lead Architect at CableLabs working on several projects related to digital video encoding/transcoding and digital rights management for online video .
