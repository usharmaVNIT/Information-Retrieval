A lot of it is a confidence thing I think , and also her school maths teacher has been quite negative about her work ; so hopefully the tutoring will rebuild some of Sophia 's general confidence over time , which would be great . Sophia will never be a star at maths , but if she can just get passes instead of always negative marks and comments from school , we will be quite happy with that .

@@60418836 @418836/ <h> By Post <h> Algebra Tutor <p> Algebra Math <p> Algebra math is the language through which we describe patterns . As opposed to having to do something over and over again algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process . Algebra is one of the main branches of mathematics and relates to the study of structure , relation and quantity . Algebra studies the effects of adding and multiplying numbers , variables , and polynomials . In addition to working directly with numbers , algebra also covers symbols and variables . <p> Algebra Concepts <p> To fully understand Algebra students need to practice each concept regularly . Below are most of the concepts that an algebra tutor can cover for this area of study . Cubic equation- an equation involving a cubic polynomial Fundamental theorem of algebra- this theorem states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root . Linear equation- an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable . Quadratic equation- any equation having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0 . Quartic equation- a function of the form where a is a nonzero , which is defined by a polynomial of degree four , called quartic polynomial . Quintic equation- a function of the form where a , b , c , d , e and f are members of a field . Polynomial- an expression consisting of variables and coefficients , that involves only the operations of addition , subtraction , multiplication and non-negative integer exponents . <p> Why use statistics- tutors ? <p> The Algebra tutors from Ezy Math Tutoring offer various benefits , not only for the student , but also for parents . Algebra tutors will give your child the tools , help and attention to catch up to where the other students in their class are so they are on the same track .

@@60418968 @418968/ <h> How To Tutor Primary School Students <p> Tutoring is always going to be a fun and rewarding experience as we get to help students to overcome their difficulties with our own teaching skills . Naturally , the problems experienced by a student in primary school and high school are going to be very different , and therefore we need to be conscious about different teaching techniques we can use . The best methods to consider are : planning , organisation , dynamic and fun lessons , proactive and unique lesson structure . <p> A student in primary school is going to need a more structured , interesting , dynamic lesson for them to remain attentive for the lesson duration . Tutors can not just expect to help with the student 's homework as this wo n't create a longer term benefit . Tutors need to arrive to each lesson with a lesson-plan in mind of what they are going to do that day . Creating a timetable or bringing some worksheets can go a long way to ensuring a productive lesson . <p> Create a special tuition folder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This helps the student to become more organised with their study habits and also is a great resource when revising material . This is also a good way to keep track of the progress the student is making . <p> Making a lesson fun is always going to be a big challenge especially if it 's an area which you consider to be really quite dry . However , if you are n't excited about what you 're teaching " the student will be equally unwilling to learn about it . Tutors should always try and build rapport with the student and try and make the math concepts seem more interesting and exciting . This can be done by teaching with a lot of energy or being very positive when a student gets a question correct . We want the student to be rewarded for learning , and to enjoy the lesson . A common way to keep the student interested is a dynamic lesson style , where you change the material being taught throughout the lesson , so it 's not to repetitious and dull . Alternatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you could use to deliver the message to the student . The best ways to keep your student interested will depend upon your student . <p> Make the lesson unique to the student which you 're tutoring . Try and work out some academic goals with the student about what they would like to achieve from the tuition , and then reassess the goals once they 've been achieved. - This really helps to bolster the confidence of students , and they will become more motivated to independently do the work . <p> Remain in touch with the guardians more when you 're dealing with primary school students as they can be very helpful to ensure the homework is done , and that the student is practicing what they learned in the lesson . Keeping the guardian in the loop helps them to make sure the student is focusing upon relevant areas and is thinking about tuition outside lessons .

@@60418974 @418974/ <h> Find a Tutor Sydney <p> Our Find a Tutor Sydney Department can provide you with the maths tutor you have been looking for . Our find a tutor Sydney system is not only one of the easiest systems for parents , it also guarantees the perfect tutor who can cater to the individual needs of your child . <h> The Ezy Math Philosophy <p> Children have a lot to deal with nowadays . Academic expectations are on an all-time high and many students are struggling to keep up . This is especially the case for maths . Students have to learn the material pretty quickly , but they are not shown how to study or how to look at a mathematical problem . This often leads to children losing faith in themselves and they start to underperform due to a lack of guidance . <p> Ezy Math believes that every child needs to be motivated and encouraged in order to succeed . We also believe that every student learns in a unique way and that true teachers should cater to that way of working . However , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not always possible in school . <h> Who Is Ezy Math ? <p> Ironically , the Ezy Math Tutoring Company was started by a mathematician . He had a true love for maths and decided he wanted to share that gift with others . He quickly learned that having a love for maths makes all the difference . <p> Since the start of Ezy Math , the company has grown out to be one of the biggest tutoring providers in Australia . Our company currently offers tutoring in Sydney , Melbourne , Perth , Brisbane , Adelaide and the Gold Coast . Also , we have built an excellent reputation with both parents and students , so Ezy Math is a quality service you can trust . <h> The Find a Tutor Sydney System <p> Getting in contact with a maths tutor is very easy .

Once they have established the level of maths your child needs , we will pick out the perfect maths tutor for your child . <p> Once a tutor has been appointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The first lesson is completely free and is used by us to evaluate the problems the child is dealing with . This makes our Find a Tutor Sydney System almost infallible . <h> What Can My Child Gain ? <p> Parents and children can gain many benefits from getting a tutor from our maths tutor Sydney department . The most beneficial improvement for most parents is better grades and that is definitely something that our maths tutor Sydney department can deliver . <p> However , we need to mention that there are more benefits to be had by using a tutor from our maths tutor Sydney department . First of all , children get all the time they need to explain some of the difficulties they have been experiencing in school . A listening ear on its own is a great benefit , but a tutor will also show the student how to tackle those problems and get more confident in general . <p> A maths tutor will also work at the pace of the student . This means that there is more time to discuss maths subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some basics that are needed to take maths to the next level . <p> Children generally feel more at ease with a one-on-one tutor as well . Some students are having quite a bit of trouble asking questions in the classroom or are afraid to make a mistake because they think they will be laughed at . Our tutors are all professionals and will encourage your child to ask questions . <p> A good maths tutor can also provide the child with that link between maths and real life . Many children and students believe that they will not need maths later on in life , because they have a certain profession in mind . However , once a tutor explains some real life links , the flame of interest in maths gets rekindled . <h> What about Learning Disabilities ? <p> Our maths tutor Sydney department can also provide your child with a specialised tutor for learning disabilities . A learning disability does not mean that your child can not succeed in math . Everyone 's brain works in a very specific way . Sometimes small adjustments need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some children struggle in school because of dyscalculia . This particular learning disability causes children to have difficulty in understanding or manipulating numbers . A common misunderstanding about this condition is that many people believe that children with dyscalculia have a lower IQ , but this is definitely not the case . Studies have shown that even people with a high IQ can suffer from this condition . <p> Dyscalculia is not something that can not be overcome , just like other learning disabilities . Our maths tutor Sydney department has quite a bit of experience with learning disabilities and can assign a specialised tutor to tackle this particular issue . <h> Read What Others Say <p> Are you wondering what other people say about Ezy Math Tutoring ?

@@60418980 @418980/ <h> By Post <h> Our Philosophy <p> At school students are bombarded with mathematics content but never taught how to learn this elusive subject or how to study in general . Eventually students fall behind and often they do try to catch up . Commonly , they do n't  know- how to approach such an overwhelming task and their efforts yield little results- the cycle of poor grades continues . <p> Our philosophy to teaching is based upon a firm belief that every child can succeed at maths or any other subject , given the proper encouragement , motivation and tools . We- believe that a tutors most important job is to listen and observe how students work and learn , and then provide them with strategies to work and learn more effectively . A tutors aim should be to reach underachieving students as early as possible and teach them effective and lifelong learning strategies and problem solving skills . This will begin a cycle of confidence , motivation , and academic success that will stay with them for the rest of their lives . 181969 @qwx591969 <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first preference " Commerce and Mechatronics Engg. at Monash University . He obtained- a study score of 43 in Physics and 37 in Maths Methods . We are- grateful to your company for willing to send a suitable Maths and Physics tutor even after term 1 , after we realised that that Ezra was having difficulty in Maths Methods . Your tutor was extremely patient , always on time and Ezra was able to discuss difficult concepts with him . We would definitely recommend your company to others . <p> Our tutor is Anthony . We have found his interaction with our son Benn has proven very rewarding . Benn has taken to Anthony and sees him as a mentor as well as a tutor . He has only praise and admiration for Anthony . At our discussions with Benn - after each tutorial Benn has a renewed interest and passion for Math . Anthony and Benn seem to have similar interests in physics and sciences which I think helps . He is also providing and encouraging Benn with his confidence not just in math but in all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Anthony 's professionalism and he is a testimonial to your business <p> All good so far , both Will and I are very happy with Ben . He is good value . Highly recommend him . <p> I just wanted to express my thanks to you and my son 's tutor Sam . With his assistance Grady improved his maths results from virtually failing the subject to achieving a very respectable B + for his end of year - 11 final grade . Sam was personable and patient , encouraging and motivating . Even though my son has decided not to continue studying maths in year - 12 , I am delighted with the results he was able to achieve , and the confidence and self- belief he attained . Please pass these comments on to Sam . Again , thank you so much . <p> We have been really happy with tutor and your service and have already recommended you to other parents .

Ezy Maths is fortunate to have such a patient and understanding tutor as Justin , we wish him every success for the future . <p> Our experience with Ezy Maths has been excellent . Most importantly the maths tutor you supplied was exceptional . She kept my daughter motivated and facilitated improved results to the point where we now only call for help on occasion rather than every week .

The different presentation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small novelty and this may slightly increase interest , especially if you make a big deal about it . <p> If this is a topic which arises explicitly within other topics , try teaching them this concept from within- a different topic .

@@60419013 @419013/ <h> By Post <h> Maths Teacher <p> A maths teacher can have a huge impact in a student 's grades . Each teacher has a different way of teaching that works for them and each student also has their own way of learning that works for them . These two factors do n't always mesh the best and that is where a student will have problems . Some maths teachers do n't full explain things , they just quickly go over it and do a few problem then give the students a worksheet to work on . This is where our maths tutors come in and fill in the blanks for the students . <p> Difficult Teachers <p> Sometimes the problem that the student is having with their maths teacher themselves . If the teacher dislikes your child or they feel that way at least this could be harmful to their learning experience and have an impact on their grades and academic performance all year long . Our maths tutors are more than happy to help the student with their math no matter what . It is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least make it better so your grades are not being impacted . One ways to try and fix this are to : Respect the classroom rules ; by following rules the student is showing that they are taking the class seriously and that they respect him/her . Have your child evaluate the whole situation and make sure that their behavior is positive and they do n't have an attitude towards the teacher . <p> How to help your child using the methods that their teacher uses <p> Some parents when trying to help their child practice worry about using a different method than their teacher is using to teach them . This is a valid concern as giving the student too many methods and techniques while they are trying to understand concepts can create added confusion to what they already do n't understand . Whether it is a parent or a maths tutor they should try and keep the method of learning consistent with how they are learning in class . The student will probably not be able to tell you exactly how they are bring taught but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looking at the students class notes . If the student does not have class notes the maths tutor or parent should encourage them to take notes and teach them the proper way to do so . Handouts are another way to try to figure out what methods to use . <p> How to select your math tutor <p> All maths tutors that are looking to work for us Ezy Math Tutoring go through a very strict selection process . All possible tutors take numerous tests to assess their skills and qualities and also to see if the possible tutor is a good candidate to work with children . Other than the above tests we also check to make sure that the potential tutor has the proper education and skills to motivate and educate children .

@@60419032 @419032/ <h> Building A Strong Math Foundation <p> Mathematics is a subject which builds upon previously learnt knowledge . Each year of schooling advances upon the concepts learned from previous years . A solid foundation is vital for students to succeed in mathematics . Without solid math skills , students are likely to have a lot of trouble throughout school . <p> Students with weak basic math skills find the subject to be increasingly difficult and confusing . Students who do n't have a good set of math skills tend to develop math anxiety and tend to try and avoid doing mathematics , which only worsens the problem . When a student develops a solid foundation in math , they can then take on any concept in math with fewer struggles and more enjoyment . They may even begin to enjoy math and think it 's fun ! <p> In order to build a solid foundation , we need a particular approach which focuses from the bottom all the way to the top . A lot of students do n't get a proper introduction to mathematics , which builds confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the student being taught a very narrow focus toward math . ( For example , an overemphasis on shapes , and overlooking arithmetic or a focus on rules instead of comprehension ) <p> The best way to ensure concepts are well understood is to revise them consistently . Students should place an equal focus on the concepts they really enjoy and understand to the ones they consider to be boring . Math anxiety is a product of poor understanding in a math concept , which can usually be traced back to the introduction of the subject area . Students can not properly understand the more complex concepts in math , without thoroughly understanding the easier ones . <p> Studies have shown students learn best when they are active rather than passive learners . Everyone is capable of learning , but may learn in different ways . Therefore , lessons must be presented in a variety of ways . For example , different ways to teach a new concept can be through play acting , cooperative groups , visual aids , hands on activities and technology . Learners are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why something is done this way or that way and why not this way . Gone are the days where students could just rote learn concepts and not question them . Students can not regurgitate operations in a math exam and expect to get more than a mere passing grade ( if not a failure ) . Students really need to understand the introduction from each topic area in math to ensure they have a good foundation . <p> Students should be encouraged to ask questions and try and understand the fundamentals of each concept . Having a strong math foundation will always make the questions in examinations seem easier . Building strong math foundations will lead to increased learning skills . Understanding that math is a subject that can be viewed from several perspectives is often reserved for those that have exposure to it . Students that have a good understanding of the basics have more time to try and understand the same concept from multiple viewpoints . This ensures appreciation of the subject and leads to very high results .

@@60419037 @419037/ <h> How Parents Contribute to the Development of Gender-Related Math Attitudes <p> Ask any teacher about the makeup and dynamic of their class , and one of the first observations will be the differences between their male students and their female students . Boys and girls vary greatly in their behavior patterns in the classroom , their study habits and their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to different academic areas , especially when it comes to math . Girls tend to have a negative attitude towards math and show a higher sense of anxiety when it comes to the logistics of solving math equations . This negative attitude plays a large part in why girls stray away from math related career paths and higher-level math courses . Research shows that these negative attitudes towards math start at home , and that parents and teachers play a critical role in the way female students approach math concepts .

If children hear their parents get excited about finding different ways to solve a problem , or see that their parents stick with a math problem without giving up , they too will adopt these behaviors . If parents get easily flustered , give up easily or invalidate the importance of a specific math concept , the children will also pick up on these negative behaviors . Parents should be very aware to instill a positive attitude towards math , and encourage their children to approach each problem with confidence and determination . <p> Sometimes , without even knowing it , parents can put a gender-based expectation on their children when it comes to math . Studies show that parents of high school and middle school boys assume their children will preform better in math than girls. - Studies also show that by sixth grade , parents believe their boys are natural mathematicians and believe it is more important for them to be sufficient in math than their female classmates . Fathers tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do for their daughters . All of these gender-based expectations can be detrimental to the success in girls , as lower expectations can foster the idea that it is not important for girls to succeed in math , and in turn negativity shift their attitudes towards the subject . <p> Parents can encourage their girls to peruse careers that require a higher knowledge of math , such as science and engineering based career paths . Parents who are aware of the unintentional gender stereotypes can be proactive by setting high expectations for their daughters when it comes to math and science , by seeking help for their daughters who struggle in math at an early age , and by emphasizing the importance of math in their lives and their future . <p> Parents and teachers can work together to foster positive educational attitudes towards math in both boys and girls .

Math problems often require established procedures or methods and knowing which method to apply . Problem solving requires practice ! The best way to ensure you can always achieve good results in problem solving exercises is to understand the math work involved . Make sure you 're always paying attention in class .

@@60419041 @419041/ <h> Planning Lessons for Maximum Impact <p> How do I cover the majority of what is necessary within a one hour span ? <p> Being able to cover the material each lesson is quite a feat ! Being able to cover most of the material each lesson is very important and can be done when lesson planning is used . Effectively to be a great tutor will involve answering as much questions as possible each lesson and making sure you maximise the time spent with the student . Below are a few ideas which can greatly help to increase the amount of material covered in each hour of tuition . <p> Plan lessons and set goals <p> Planning lessons is a terrific way to ensure the hour spent with the student is highly efficient . When you begin with the student , set some goals of what you and the student wish to achieve over the following fortnight , month , 3-month period . Once you have some short and medium term goals set- you can periodically monitor your progress to keep track on what is an is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what areas your student is having difficulty with and mentally prepare yourself to focus your time on what is necessary . <p> With a lesson plan which is based upon achieving pre-set goals , the hour lessons will be far more productive as you and your student can more easily prepare for lessons . You both already know an outline of what is going to be taught in each lesson , and then you can maximise the time you 're with the student . <p> A lesson plan is a great way for the student to begin setting academic goals which is a key element to success in academia . It allows progress to be monitored with ease , which will increase the confidence of the student as they see all of the ground they 've covered in their tuition . <p> If you 're not sure if time will allow you to get everything covered within the tuition time " decide which necessary areas you wish to cover : and then tutor them ! If time allows- you could go and teach the less important elements of the lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to ensure you 're continuing with your structured tuition plan , and that the student is happy as well ! <p> Remember though that it will take some time for this planning to become habitual and for you and the student to develop a momentum around it . You may still fail to cover everything needed in each tutorial but over the longer term you will definitely cover much more material than you would with unplanned lessons . <p> Consider extra time with the student <p> There will usually be factors you can not account for , like the extra time it might take to explain a concept , a distraction or a pop-quiz etc . The main thing to do if you feel you 're not going to have sufficient time is explain this to the student and perhaps their parents also . Mention the option of an extra 30mins of tuition , or another lesson later on in the week to go over the material you did n't have a chance to cover . You can also ask the student to see their teacher at school for extra help .

Rebecca obviously has patience and takes the time to explain things so Sophia can follow them and work through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem with the school is they move along so fast that there is not enough practice time , and we ( the parents ) are not familiar with what they teach so we ca n't just help out quickly ; we have to re-learn it ourselves first , and then we 're probably not good at explaining clearly . That 's why it is great having Rebecca who can obviously explain things in a way Sophia understands . The main thing is that Sophia sees herself as no good at maths ' , but when something is explained so she understands it , she is very pleased when she can get the right answers . A lot of it is a confidence thing I think , and also her school maths teacher has been quite negative about her work ; so hopefully the tutoring will rebuild some of Sophia 's general confidence over time , which would be great .

@@60419044 @419044/ <h> Multiple Intelligences and Math <p> Based on ground-breaking cognitive research , Howard Gardner of Harvard has identified eight distinct intelligences which he classified as Multiple Intelligences ( MI ) . His ideas when applied to the school scenario have wide implications in effective teaching-learning . He says that we all have these intelligences in varying degrees , with one or more that gain prominence over others . Each individual child with his or her unique intelligence profile can learn better , faster and more effectively when teaching-learning is oriented towards nurturing and fostering the development of multiple intelligences and uses these as the basis for learning . <p> When teachers adopt strategies for math competency development based on each of the MIs , they allow children with all kinds of MI profiles to participate and benefit from these .

The student always felt that she could n't do well and that she will always hate maths . I decided to challenge myself that no matter what I will surely make this student reach the top level . Slowly the effort rose- and I was proud of myself that I was capable of teaching my students to love maths and always never lose hope .

His ideas when applied to the school scenario have wide implications in effective teaching-learning . He says that we all have these intelligences in varying degrees , with one or more that gain prominence over others .

@@60419058 @419058/ <h> How Parents Contribute to the Development of Gender-Related Math Attitudes <p> Ask any teacher about the makeup and dynamic of their class , and one of the first observations will be the differences between their male students and their female students . Boys and girls vary greatly in their behavior patterns in the classroom , their study habits and their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to different academic areas , especially when it comes to math . Girls tend to have a negative attitude towards math and show a higher sense of anxiety when it comes to the logistics of solving math equations . This negative attitude plays a large part in why girls stray away from math related career paths and higher-level math courses . Research shows that these negative attitudes towards math start at home , and that parents and teachers play a critical role in the way female students approach math concepts . If parents and teachers can be aware of their influences and work together , both girls and boys can have a higher self-confidence when it comes to mathematics and both can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards math is a tremendous influence on a child 's perception and attitude towards the subject . If children hear their parents get excited about finding different ways to solve a problem , or see that their parents stick with a math problem without giving up , they too will adopt these behaviors . If parents get easily flustered , give up easily or invalidate the importance of a specific math concept , the children will also pick up on these negative behaviors . Parents should be very aware to instill a positive attitude towards math , and encourage their children to approach each problem with confidence and determination . <p> Sometimes , without even knowing it , parents can put a gender-based expectation on their children when it comes to math . Studies show that parents of high school and middle school boys assume their children will preform better in math than girls. - Studies also show that by sixth grade , parents believe their boys are natural mathematicians and believe it is more important for them to be sufficient in math than their female classmates . Fathers tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do for their daughters . All of these gender-based expectations can be detrimental to the success in girls , as lower expectations can foster the idea that it is not important for girls to succeed in math , and in turn negativity shift their attitudes towards the subject . <p> Parents can encourage their girls to peruse careers that require a higher knowledge of math , such as science and engineering based career paths . Parents who are aware of the unintentional gender stereotypes can be proactive by setting high expectations for their daughters when it comes to math and science , by seeking help for their daughters who struggle in math at an early age , and by emphasizing the importance of math in their lives and their future . <p> Parents and teachers can work together to foster positive educational attitudes towards math in both boys and girls . Children who are encouraged to excel in math will have a greater self-confidence in the classroom , which will also lead to higher self-confidence in other aspects of their lives .

@@60419078 @419078/ <h> Maths Tutoring Sydney <p> Ezy Math tutoring provides tutoring services in various areas of Australia , including Melbourne , Perth , Brisbane , Adelaide , Gold Coast and Sydney . Parents who are currently looking for maths tutoring in Sydney can therefore immediately take advantage of the maths tutor Sydney services we offer . <h> Common Problems <p> Problems with maths is more common than you might think . The reason for that is actually quite straightforward . Maths is a subject that is taught over a number of years , just like learning a new language . When some of the building blocks during those years are missed , students can experience serious difficulties . However , it is something that can be overcome by going back to the basics . <p> Other common problems that often occur with maths are learning disabilities . The most intruding problem is often dyscalculia . This is a learning disability characterised by difficulties learning basic arithmetic facts , processing numbers and performing fluent calculations . <p> Confidence can also be a problem with mathematics and can be a cause as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that failing in maths can lead to a lower confidence which has an impact on other grades as well . A lack of confidence can also be a cause , for example by not taking initiative in class , feeling embarrassed or feeling less good than the other students . However , having problems with maths does not necessarily mean that the student has a learning disability or emotional problem . Education expects a lot from children these days , so sometimes they just get overwhelmed and need a little extra help to get through <h> Our Tutors <p> The tutors who work at our maths tutoring Sydney department are selected according to high standards . Every tutor must meet certain requirements and must be fit to work with children . <p> In order to guarantee the suitability of the tutors in our maths tutor Sydney department , we submit possible candidates to a screening process . Our screening process consists of interviews , simulations , background checks , resume screenings and more .

Our maths tutor Sydney department will also make sure that your child changes study habits and makes them more effective at maths , regardless of their skill level . <p> Next to maths , Ezy Math Tutoring also provides tutoring for additional subjects . This includes physics , chemistry and English . <h> Finding the Right Fit <p> Before we assign a tutor , we usually ask the parents for more information about the student .

A tutor from our maths tutor Sydney department will work one-on-one with the student , ensuring that all the study material is absorbed and understood . <p> A direct result of maths tutoring Sydney is a clear increase in maths grades . However , for a large amount of students this effect also spreads to other courses . By learning how to study more effectively and by gaining more confidence in own abilities , maths tutoring Sydney can have a profound effect on all academic achievements . <p> It is also easier for students to accept one-on-one help . Asking questions in class or the help of a teacher can sometimes be embarrassing for students , especially in a class where striving to become better is considered to be nerdy .

@@60419097 @419097/ <h> Year 4 , Some General Advice <p> I am starting with a new student who is in year 4 , is there anything I should prepare in particular regarding math problems , or should I concentrate on their text book they use at school ? <p> In year 4 they may not have a text book . If so this is something you will need to bring up with the student and client , perhaps organise for a question book . Having a resource which has an intrinsic structure to it will necessarily provide an easier structure to follow in tutorials themselves . This means you can spend less time preparing work and planning what to do and spend more time on tutoring fundamental concepts and teaching useful learning strategies etc . <p> If you have n't worked with such a young student in a while an important thing to remind you is that younger students are much less self aware . You need to double check that they really understand a lot more you cant take their agreement and responses on face value as much . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 maths it will give you some ideas of how concepts are explained . You will need to draw lots of demonstrations and where possible physical demonstrations as younger students are used to learning this way . <p> The most important thing is to make the student feel comfortable and build good rapport . Once they like you they will learn from you a lot easier ! Use more positive reinforcement to get them on your side . <p> Younger students also find it harder to concentrate . Keep them engaged by being interactive such as getting them to explain things back to you and be more involved , as involved as possible or they zone out . Also , sitting still may be a challenge if so just take a 2-3 minute break in the middle of the class , make sure the student get up and moves around to change their physical orientation .

Rebecca obviously has patience and takes the time to explain things so Sophia can follow them and work through the maths , which is exactly what we wanted . The problem with the school is they move along so fast that there is not enough practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with what they teach so we ca n't just help out quickly ; we have to re-learn it ourselves first , and then we 're probably not good at explaining clearly .

The main thing is that Sophia sees herself as no good at maths ' , but when something is explained so she understands it , she is very pleased when she can get the right answers . A lot of it is a confidence thing I think , and also her school maths teacher has been quite negative about her work ; so hopefully the tutoring will rebuild some of Sophia 's general confidence over time , which would be great . Sophia will never be a star at maths , but if she can just get passes instead of always negative marks and comments from school , we will be quite happy with that .

@@60419101 @419101/ <h> Long Tutoring Break Due to Illness Now Behind <p> One of my students has been sick for the last few weeks and has thus missed a substantial amount of maths any tips for catching them up ? This is a fairly common scenario in tutoring . Here are some suggestions . <p> First get the student on side by discussing the need to catch up on the content and getting some commitment from them . You can make the catch up a " mini-project " <p> Make sure you are fully aware of the content the student has actually missed . They need to ask their teacher or peers so that you know what needs to be covered . <p> Plan the " catch-up-project " together with the student , do n't  just do it in an ad-hoc manner . Map out the content which you need to teach them and tentatively what you will teach them in each tutorial for the- next X weeks . <p> As you cover material in the coming weeks make sure that you acknowledge the students progress and give them positive reinforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that the student can effectively learn at school and not feel lost when they are in the classroom . If they feel lost in class they will continue to fall behind for a little while and this will spiral into a bigger problem for you as they bring more and more " problems " home from school . <p> The approach to catching them up should be strategic and deliberate , not random or unstructured . First you should teach them the content being covered currently at school and knowledge gaps that relate directly to that material so that their time is not wasted and they can follow the teacher reasonably . <p> Encourage them to use all the resources available to them in order to catch up , not just you . They should see their teacher at school for extra help during lunch or recess , or before/after school . The teacher can help answer their " problem " questions so you can focus more on teaching the concepts and not have to deal with their " silly mistakes " or other details that may not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends for a bit of informal help . <p> Another option is to suggest extra tutorials for a few weeks or longer tutorials . For example two lessons per week instead of one or tutorials for 1.5 hours instead of 1hour at a time . Just make sure the parents are ok with this , not just the student . <p> If you and the parents agree to do this then it can be a good way to gain commitment from the student to do extra homework until they catch up . i.e. extra tutoring is only warranted if they agree to do their part and work hard .

I have referred a few of my friends onto your website as their kids were having difficulty too ! ! ! <p> So far so good with Tim . Tim is now tutoring both my kids and both are really happy with him . Results will show in the months to come . It is early days but we are very happy so far . <p> Yes , we are very pleased that Sophia likes Rebecca and the tutoring seems to be going well . Rebecca obviously has patience and takes the time to explain things so Sophia can follow them and work through the maths , which is exactly what we wanted . The problem with the school is they move along so fast that there is not enough practice time , and we ( the parents ) are not familiar with what they teach so we ca n't just help out quickly ; we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not good at explaining clearly . That 's why it is great having Rebecca who can obviously explain things in a way Sophia understands . The main thing is that Sophia sees herself as no good at maths ' , but when something is explained so she understands it , she is very pleased when she can get the right answers . A lot of it is a confidence thing I think , and also her school maths teacher has been quite negative about her work ; so hopefully the tutoring will rebuild some of Sophia 's general confidence over time , which would be great . Sophia will never be a star at maths , but if she can just get passes instead of always negative marks and comments from school , we will be quite happy with that . Sophia is very good at English/Hums and art ; maths is her weak area , and we are very pleased ( and actually surprised ) that she is sitting through an hour of maths tutoring each week without complaint . We did not know how it would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a retired male maths teacher - and she hated it .

Casey did much better in her test than she would have done and we are already over the moon .

@@60419111 @419111/ <h> Tutoring First Lesson + Good Impression <p> When a new student is assigned to you for tutoring , it can be a very exciting experience going for the first lesson . However , it must be recognised , that they 're expecting a professional tutor who will be able to help the student . It is a good idea to keep in mind the importance of : <p> 1 . Being on time Someone you are meeting for the first time is not interested in your " good excuse " for running late . Plan to arrive a few minutes early . And allow flexibility for possible delays in traffic or taking a wrong turn . Arriving early is much better that arriving late , hands down , and is the first step in creating a great first impression . <p> 2 . Physical appearance The way you present yourself does matter . The client and student you 're meeting for the first time do not know you and your appearance is the first clue about who you are . It does n't mean you need to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a good idea to arrive in a singlet , boardies and thongs for the first lesson . While you are free to wear what you like to tutoring , your dress on the first lesson can create an impression of your ability to be skilled tutor . <p> 4 . Introductions with client and student After you have arrived , it is important to speak to the client about the student and remember that small talk does go a long way . It will help the client to understand that you 're interested in making a difference to the student 's studies . Try to be positive and courteous and attentive when you hear about the student 's situation . Mention how you can make a difference and help the student . Confirm that the lines of communication are open should the client have any questions or issues , they 're also welcome to contact the head office directly as well . <p> 5 . Build rapport with the student When you sit down with the student , it 's a good idea to introduce yourself and mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend the first 5-10 minutes just finding out more about the student , eg their academic goals , school etc . This will help the student to feel more at ease and enjoy the lesson more by knowing that you are there to really help them ! Ask about the student 's problem and how they are going in other areas of school . It 's always good to know about what the student likes to do outside school so you can relate to interesting things they like in lessons . <p> 6 . Concluding the lesson with professionalism If the client is still there at the conclusion of the first lesson , let them know how everything went . Explain to them you have developed some goals and a structure in order to complete these . Confirm a day and time for the next lesson and then say goodbye to both the client and the student . Leaving with a smile and showing you care can go a long way to leaving a strong and positive first impression .

@@60419126 @419126/ <h> Main content of Year 12 Maths <p> The core content of year 12 maths revolves around calculus . Apart from this , there is the application of the principles of plane geometry to theoretical problems as well as the use of tree diagrams to expound on the laws of probability . Very important too are arithmetic and geometric series as well as their applications in consumer mathematics ( compound interest , hire purchase and repayment plans ) . <p> From then , the bulk of year 12 maths lies with calculus . Starting with applications of differentiation learnt the previous year and introduction to the second derivative . This will include primitive functions , concepts such as maxima , minima , tangents and normals to curves . Thereafter , integration is introduced . This year , students will learn about the Simpson 's rule , the Trapezoidal rule and the application of integration to areas and volumes of solids . Real world application of calculus is also important to this year especially in phenomena involving growth and decay , velocity and acceleration where calculus as a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculus will be studies in trigonometric , logarithmic and exponential functions and their applications . <h> Common challenges for students in Year 12 Maths <p> Calculus . Calculus . Calculus . Year 12 is the year of calculus in maths . Therefore , it can be difficult for students who have n't grasped the fundamentals to move on to the applications . This , in the final year of High School when preparation for final assessment is in full gear , can be daunting to students . <p> To be more particular , students often find it hard to unify their knowledge , especially around calculus . There are so many rules and concepts which are inter-related . It can be challenging to understand how exactly the rules and concepts are connected and how to apply them in a specific context . The only way to really deal with this is to focus on true understanding of the material , without which knowledge can not be cross contextualised . <h> Main outcomes for Year 12 Maths <p> At the end of this year , students must show a complete understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to integrate and differentiate functions as well as apply these to higher concepts and real world problems . Apart from this , students are expected to have mastered every area in algebra , probability and high school geometry . They must also be able to solve trigonometric , logarithmic and exponential functions and show the sound reasoning capability of borrowing from different areas of year 12 maths to solving problems where applications of principles are required . <h> If hiring a tutor , what study habits and content to focus on in Year 12 Maths ? <p> Studying for final assessments in year 12 will prove daunting . When getting a tutor , be ready to allow your child extra hours for study . This is absolutely necessary . It is even advisable to get a tutor early so your child can learn ahead of the class . This will not only afford him/her more time for other preparations but also give the child an all-important confidence to approach the maths in year 12 without fear and undue anxiety . <h> Main challenges involved in tutoring a Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover may overwhelm a year 12 maths student and make him/her difficult to tutor . Making sure that your child covers all the necessary content with spare time for revision can be challenging . It requires effective planning and time management which is impossible without the full co-operation of a student and commitment to completing all set homework . <h> Some good ideas on how to help your child in Year 12 Maths <p> You and/or the tutor should quickly pinpoint your child 's areas of weakness in year 12 maths and even the previous years ' maths . This will make it easy to fill those gaps and build on a better foundation . Furthermore , give your child more time for study and lots of encouragement to see them through the last year of High School . 181969 @qwx591969 <p> Zara has been a real help so far to Naomi who looks forward to seeing her each week after school .

@@60419131 @419131/ <h> Parents Disappointed with Tutoring <p> A parent is unhappy with the progress of her child . This reaction came about after her child got a series of questions wrong with completing problem outside of the tutoring sessions . These problems covered material and concepts that have not been covered in the tutoring sessions that the student is unfamiliar with . The material and concepts have now been covered and the student understands how to approach the problems . And the only reason the student could not answer the questions correctly was that the material was new yet it still received a quite negative response from the parent . How should I proceed ? To ensure the parent that the tutoring sessions are working and the issue of the parents response to her child getting math problems wrong , on unfamiliar material , that has not been covered ? <p> The main ways to combat this problem is to : <p> Speak to the parent as soon as possible about : <p> The expected time before good results for the student are likely <p> The expectations they have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever prompted , that kind of general knowledge requires specific preparation . <p> Setting objectives and goals for the student to show the positive impact of the tuition <p> How you plan to maintain an open line of communication about how each lesson is going and the progress being made <p> When a parent is n't happy with the progress made with the child it could be due to many different factors . Parents might form expectations that results will be achieved in a much shorter time frame than what is likely , and therefore become upset when the results are n't achieved . It is highly necessary to speak to the parent about the student 's situation and how long it may take until they can see some large improvements in certain areas . Communication with the parent will go a long way with maintaining a good relationship and ensuring they 're not disappointed . <p> Achieving good results will take time . Depending on how the student is currently going in school , it could take a month or several months . Ensure that the parent understands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Effective teaching involves prioritising which areas to focus on , and usually it is a good idea to teach the mathematics from the ground-up . This is done by dealing with the basics in the topic area before teaching the more advanced material . This method helps the student to recognise all the elements necessary to solve some of the harder problems in this area , and gives them a chance to understand the concepts again . You need to explain to a parent that this is the method you 're going to take as it will see a permanent improvement to attitudes and grades , however it will take time . <p> Planning some objectives and goals you wish to achieve with your student throughout the tuition is a great way for both the student and parent to see the effect of the tuition . This is a good way to organise the lessons to ensure time is n't wasted and it also helps to shape the parent 's perspective on the time required for high quality tuition . <p> Finally , you will want to keep an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be from speaking to the parent quickly before or after a class in person , or through a text or quick phone call . This shows that you really care about the work involved and also helps the parent to understand how the tuition progress works .

@@60419170 @419170/ <h> Where To Start if Student is Lost <p> I 've just started with a grade 3 student . We are doing 1 hour twice per week in order to cover gaps as well as school work . It is quite hard at the beginning to decide where to start as he is very intelligent but is lacking so much knowledge . He ca n't do anything besides addition . His class is not following a textbook so it can be a little hard to know what to work on or what direction to take . <p> Firstly , just because his class is n't following the textbook does n't  mean that you cant . A textbook can really help create structure within tutorials . If you do follow his textbook , then he will be " in the know " when they do cover that material in class . This usually gives students great confidence when that topic is covered since they already know the work " before their peers . When it is done at school it will also serve as a natural revision for him and instil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far behind , such an ego-boost could really jolt him in the right direction . <p> If he is so far behind at such a young age then it is likely that he has n't developed his logical thinking skills in general . Any work you do will help in this regard . <p> This student clearly has bigger problems than worrying about the structure of his syllabus . At the end of the day maths is still maths , in any language , in any syllabus . It is probably better to focus on his basic arithmetic and logical thinking skills . Once these develop tutoring him will be a lot easier and he will be able to learn at a much faster rate . Just be careful not to neglect school work . School work should take priority since it affects him on a daily basis and we want him feeling confident as soon as possible .

Having a tutor who is close in location and able to work at developing a relationship with each individual student can greatly assist students in discovering how to succeed in maths . I would also strongly recommend Ezymath 's professional development activities and CEP modules to other prospective tutors . I have appreciated the important learning lessons within the CEP modules and have applied this to my tutoring and used it to help my students .

This was because they gave me a great teaching framework to work within , with which I could incorporate my own methods . My greatest accomplishments working with Ezy Math were without doubt the moments when my students were able to overcome certain learning difficulties to produce excellent results . This was often achievable through a simple reorganisation of their work habits and thinking processes .

EzyMath Tutoring gave me a wonderful opportunity to coach younger students not only in the subject of Mathematics but also Chemistry , Biology and Physics .

The modules on self-belief , the different types of learning styles were interesting , intriguing and informative .

The weekly material provided by EzyMath was extremely thought-provoking and always had a practical application . My biggest accomplishment was definitely becoming friend and mentor to my student . We were able to discuss issues outside of the normal day to day work , and I was able to understand the interests and learning capabilities of my student . This was invaluable to for developing a good working relationship thereby enabling me to structure my lessons with more intent overtime .

I showed him simple maths tricks that no curriculum teaches ( e.g. how to figure out 11 times tables to any number ) . He understood it well , but the biggest boost he had was the confidence he got from knowing something the other kids did n't . He started to enjoy maths a lot more and his scores and attitude improved . His care givers were very happy about it . I got a big kick from steering him in the right direction and I hope he carries on this confidence in all his endevours . With Ezy Math , what I felt was great were the weekly tutoring tips/themes .

@@60419173 @419173/ <h> Improve Exam Skills <p> Methods to get students more comfortable with tests ? <p> A short answer is practice practice practice . <p> Maths tutoring is not just about drilling content into the heads of students " we need to teach students how to study effectively , find their own learning strategies , how to prepare for exams , and very importantly ( but often overlooked ) how to manage themselves within an exam . It is amazing how many students never consider the importance of exam skills . Many tutors also never spend the time that this area deserves . Many students just expect that if they understand the content and can do most of the questions in their textbook then they will do well in an exam . Usually this is n't true . <p> Important considerations in an exam are : <p> Stress and anxiety which in turn leads to poor thinking . <p> There are ways to manage these fear driven challenges but there is no effective way that works for all students . <p> Breathing techniques Making sure the student really knows their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning and their intelligence <p> Physiology of the student can contribute to anxiety if they are physically tense <p> Handling the situations when you ca n't answer a question <p> Make sure to at least write something <p> Controlling emotions when this happens <p> Self questioning process for problem solving <p> know when to not waste your time and move on <p> Managing time within an exam " <p> which questions to do and which questions to leave . <p> Which part to do first , which part to leave until last . <p> Doing working out in such a way that marks are maximized . <p> relative neatness and readability <p> structure of working out so it is easy to back check <p> completeness <p> avoiding messy crossing out and scribbles <p> These are probably the four main areas of exam technique that we would identify . Obviously there are other ways that this can be broken down but if you discuss this with your student there will definitely be points that they relate more to and other points that they do n't  . For example they may relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know their work but not be advanced enough to be aware of their working out habits or even appreciate the concept . <p> There is no way to improve a students comfort with tests unless you give them practice performing under pressure . Force them to do practice tests under timed conditions and set up a reward/punishment system so that they really feel the pressure maybe get their parents involved . Also , practice will help but strategic practice will help much more . Discuss the points above with your student , make them aware of their exam weaknesses , try to isolate 1-3 points for them to focus on first . After each practice exam discuss their performance in regard to the points of improvement above you chose to work on . Gradually they should develop a comfort . 
@@60419174 @419174/ <h> How Parents Can Help Tutoring ? <p> The parents asked what they can do to help the student 's progress outside of my tuition time . Is there a standard response to this or do I suggest something particular for each student ? <p> The answer lies in both of your proposed suggestions . There is indeed a response which would generally work for each student ; however it would need to be tailored to cater for each individual student . <p> There are several things which you could recommend to the parents to help the student out of tuition time . Here are a few things below which will be able to get some ideas flowing . <p> Firstly , the most important skill students need to acquire is Time Management . Having good time management helps the student to plan their afternoons more effectively to balance between homework and co-curricular activities . Planning the student 's time will help to see a structured and methodical nature to study time , which will help to prevent time wastage , and ensure more time spent studying . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is focussed on the work-at-hand . Make sure distractions like mobiles , televisions , music , friends etc. are kept away from the student as they do their work . This will help to increase the efficiency of the time spent doing the study , as well as ensure the brain is only working on solving one thing at a time . Productivity will greatly increase when distractions are limited . <p> Thirdly , a Homework diary ' can really help the student keep track of what homework is to be done each night , it helps for the student to write down what was learnt in class that day for each subject , and what the homework was . This helps the student to reflect on the more important academic lessons of each day . <p> Fourthly , ensure the students are periodically asking their teacher for help , and are seeing them either before or after school , or during lunch . Ensure they 're asking for extra assistance from the teacher also , in the form of extra worksheets or clarity on some classroom activities . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher when the next exam is going to be-to make sure it does n't sneak up on them and they have time to prepare . <p> Fifthly , a Study folder ' can be a great asset to any student when it comes to exam time . A study folder will be a 2 binder folder ( or equivalent ) , with a lot of notes made during tutoring sessions . This limits wasted paper , and also allows the student to have a great resource when it comes to revising the areas they requested assistance in . Any extra work the student requests from the teacher could be added to this folder also . This helps the students to learn how to study efficiently for subjects , as they have an additional resource to peruse . <p> The list of things you can help parents to do is not exhaustive ; primarily , a lot of the study skills the parents can impart to the students can be of great benefit to all avenues of academia . <h> One comment <p> Otavioluizpereira said08 August 2013 <p> I have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladruny onto my schedule or I 'll forget to do it .

Rapport has a few key pillars and there is plenty of information about it online . Here are some good points . <p> Relatedness : People like it when they feel related to . Over the course of your tuition make an effort to identify with the student . If they are going through something that you are familiar with feel free to mention it to them .

They should feel like you are a team working toward a common goal . <p> Including the student in the planning of homework , include them in planning what content you will be covering . Students usually are not accustomed to being treated with this kind of respect and respond to it favourably . Just make sure that you do not forgo homework in favour of establishing a better relationship . <p> Ask for feedback about how they are enjoying the tuition and what else you can do to help them <p> - Discuss their goals .

When the student does well , or makes improvements be sure to point it out " make the student feel good about themselves . If the student is always feeling kind of positive when you are around they will eventually associate you with that feeling . <p> Your tutoring efforts will have most impact on the student if you have a good rapport . Students will learn much better from tutors whom they like rather than tutors whom they are merely willing to work with . At the same time it is crucially important to have rapport with the parents of the student . The student and parents will periodically discuss the progress of tuition and their opinions and impressions of you will rub off on each other .

If the teacher did give irrelevant homework you may ask the student to ask their teacher once more for homework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the current school topic . <p> Even if the student gets some relevant homework , looking forward you are likely to have a problem . The school topic will keep changing and the student is likely to feel discouraged if they continuously have to ask an unsupportive teacher for extra work . A more suitable long term solution in this situation would be to organise another textbook/workbook for the student . This way whatever work the student is doing at school , you will have your own resource for setting relevant homework . Ezy Math has a range of digital resources available in the tutor admin section but it is best to organise for a hard copy of some textbook/workbook . You may want to explain the situation to the parents and see if they would be willing to purchase a textbook from Dymocks or other book store . It may also be a good opportunity to praise the student for their proactivity and gently inform the parents about the unsupportive school teacher . <h> 2 comments <p> Angela Waddington said02 April 2013 <p> I have had similar experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher for what topics were being covered and some home work ( they do n't  even have their own text books , they use the schools copies ) I explained the importance d varicose materials as sources of information the the parents as suggested getting a text book , even a second hand one from eBay , just search state specific maths quest text books , they have fantastic explanations and many questions . These text books can go for as little as $5 ! ! Well worth the money .. I also had trouble gettin y student to seek the teacher for questions due to " I do n't  have time " responses from the teacher , so I got my student to write up their questions throughout the lessons in a deep rate page/back of book and ask the teacher with it already in front of them , this improved but also helped Nero see where thy were missing information and if it was the same type of misconception they were experiencing .

@@60419225 @419225/ <h> Getting A Student To Talk Aloud <p> How do I get my student to speak in class and also use speaking aloud ' with me during lessons ? <p> This is a great question as it brings in personal characteristics of the student in conjunction with how comfortable they are with the learned material . It considers whether they 're introverted or extroverted , or if they have issues with confidence . In either case , more knowledge about the subject materials and understanding how the topics work will create a desire to communicate and exchange information . Students who do n't know much about the particular subject wo n't have much to say . <p> A great way to help students to open up more with the tutor to talk aloud ' and feel comfortable enough to speak in class , is to relate to them , on their level . Try and explain the concepts in a way which makes sense to them ! You may need to re-word and restructure material until the student properly understands it . It also helps- to explain what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and have no idea what it actually is about . They do n't understand some of the material has real life implications , which can negatively affect how they think about it . If they have the concept related a little more to their life , they might understand and enjoy it more . Also , they need to understand that making mistakes is n't a negative thing ; they need to be alleviated from any fear of failure . You could try and get the student to speak about their goals and what they 're hoping to achieve . How their success in school will help lead their future in a more positive direction . <p> Try to explain to the student how important it is for you to understand what is going through their head. - The student should realise that Talking Aloud is an opportunity for the student to vocalise their understandings of the question they 're doing , regardless of how silly it might sound . We want to create a very positive learning environment where the student feels comfortable with answering in detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process that led to the conclusion . Tutors should be nurturing and supportive as the student may feel uncomfortable or venerable as they divulge what 's going on in their head when they look at a problem . It can really help to model this for the student by doing it yourself when you are figuring out a problem . Speak your thoughts aloud and it will make them more comfortable to do the same . Another little trick is to ask to student to teach the question to you as if they were the teacher this gets them talking without feeling awkward . <p> If students are shy to speak and give their opinions themselves , they often are more comfortable when they are participating in role plays with a mini-guide. - Sometimes it can help to probe by asking yes or no questions , and then to give them an opinion to express , i.e -You disagree because . " " You agree because " . This gives them a basis on which to practice the topic you are focusing on . This takes away any fears they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their thoughts before uttering them to you . This can be a good way to see how the student is formulating their answers and you can try to explain the material to them more thoroughly if required . <p> Students will usually feel more comfortable speaking aloud if they feel supported by the tutor , and that they wo n't be judged upon their response . The more confidence a student has about a subject , the more inclined they will be to speak about it . Confidence can be bolstered from knowledge about solving problems through several different approaches . I.e The teacher may explain one way to solve quadratic equations , while you may show the student another way . Regardless of which way is ultimately preferred , the student will feel more comfortable knowing they have more proverbial tools at their disposal .

@@60419243 @419243/ <h> What 's new in Year 8 Maths ? <p> Prime factors are introduced in year 8 maths . For probability , complementary events and simple probability problems are taught . Equivalence and substitution in solving algebraic equations are new topics this year as well as solving linear equations and algebra word problems . <p> Frequency tables , histograms and polygons are introduced as means of data representation and to analyse data , median , mode and range will be taught alongside mean . For circles , circumferences will be new introductions and prisms will be studied for volume . Measurement of time this year will include using international time zones . In geometry , Euler 's relationship and isometric drawings will be new .

Do they still go to school ? Do they go out to the movies or to their friend 's house for playtime ? Try to qualify whether or not the student is consistently that sick that they really can not have a tutoring lesson . The purpose being to understand if the problem is really that the student is too sick to learn or if their attitude toward tuition is somewhat passive . Obviously , make sure to be respectful and not unintentionally imply that you think the student is n't really that sick . <p> If the student is engaging in other activities then you probably need to have a conversation with the parents about the damage that inconsistency does to progress . Often parents do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is sick , feeling and unwell and the parents may want to appease their child and just make them feel better " they feel sorry for them in a very loving way .

@@60419272 @419272/ <h> Senior Students General Advice <p> I now have a struggling student who will be in yr 11 this year . Things will be far more serious and I want to make sure I do the best possible job I can , that she also is motivated to keep things from going downhill . I have dedicated some time during first tutoring session of year to evaluating last year and mapping out a plan of attack for this year . Any further tips on senior maths would be great . <p> There are a few big things that make year 11 and 12 challenging for students : <p> The challenge is managing these 4 challenges throughout the year and not falling behind . This requires a strategic approach to studying . Time management , study habits , exam preparation technique , organisational skills etc all make a huge difference in year 11 and 12 . Many students do not appreciate this and simply want to focus on learning how to answer the question immediately troubling them . This is only normal but it wo n't solve the ultimate challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require careful and deliberate preparation , managing the content being studied strategically , doing practice exams etc . <p> The first thing you need to do for a year 11/12 student is make them appreciate these facts so that you can develop a co-operative relationship without them always focusing on only their immediate problems with school content . They need to trust that you can prepare them for their exams . <p> Secondly you need to help them develop the habit of being organised about their studies . Which topics will you be studying in the coming weeks ? Which topics will you be revising simultaneously ? How will you be preparing for the next test ? When will those topics be revised ( actually mark the dates ) ? What other topics are relevant to that exam ? What does the student want to achieve and what are they willing to do for this achievement ? All these questions should consistently be considered and the answers should be used to update the students study plans . Hopefully , this habit of organising will develop and serve the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in place and strong organisational skills are developed it will be much easier to work with the student , to plan tutorials , to have the work you set actually completed etc . Another few good pieces of generic advice : <p> Never stop developing their algebra and arithmetic skills " they need to speak this language fluently . <p> Get them doing some form of practice exams/tests ASAP ! Even if you create them yourself . The student needs to get accustomed to the exam experience which is a skill in itself . <p> have them see their school teacher for extra help answering questions so you can use your time more strategically in tutorials <p> Aside from this it depends on the specifics of the student . Their specific trouble topics and weaknesses . They may need to work on problem solving , format skills , positive self-talk etc . However , the points above should more or less apply to all students in year 11 and 12 . <h> One comment <p> Adhinda said08 August 2013 <p> Thank you so much for posting your cmnmeot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I write about things that I think and observe .

@@60419294 @419294/ <h> Tutoring Students Who Are Differently-Abled : ADD <p> All students are entitled to a great education , and deserve every opportunity to excel . Students with disabilities can be helped in a variety of different ways that will help them understand and improve their grades and self-confidence in the classroom . A successful tutor will know the manipulatives , activities , language , concepts and techniques that will help a differently-abled student succeed . <p> A common issue many students is struggling with ADD or ADHD . This affects their focus and ability to concentrate for long periods of time . In order to serve them well , tutors can implement a few of these strategies to ensure students get the most out of their study time . <p> Use both written AND verbal directions . It may be easier for a student to comprehend what is expected from them when they can hear it and see it . Involving more than one of these senses increases their ability to retain the information . <p> When giving an example , do it more than once . Repetition can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract ideas , use charts , maps or graphs . These visual aids help students to see the information provided and helps them really see the numbers they are working with and how the numbers work together to create the solution . <p> If the student seems to be getting antsy or is having a hard time sitting still for the lesson , get up and move around ! Role-playing is a great way to keep the learning momentum going and allows the student to move around . Sometimes students with ADD are trying so hard to focus on sitting still that is nearly impossible to focus on the task at hand . Eliminate the stress of sitting perfectly still and let them get up and act out the concepts you are teaching them . This also helps in their memory of the content . They will remember the role-playing scenarios and it will be beneficial when they have to recall in the information on a test or in the classroom . <p> Put one problem or example on one page . This will help the student focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , words and formulas on the page . <p> Break long assignments into chunks . Remember that it 's not that students with ADD are unable to master the material ; it is that they struggle with focusing on the material for long periods of time . To help them , chunk the lesson up into smaller sections . This will not only help the student stay focused , but it will keep them from getting bored and unfocused . <p> Although the library can be a quiet and peaceful place for some students to learn , for a child with ADD it could still be very distracting . All of the books , the people talking , computers running , library books being checked out , all of these things can be very distracting to a student with ADD . A quiet home office , a dining room table or an empty classroom may be a better fit for a child who is trying to focus . <p> Trade roles with the student . Once you believe the student has a grasp on the content , have him/her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach it , so if they are able to explain the problems to you , you can be sure they have a solid understanding of the concept . If they are still not 100% sure on the information , teaching you will allow the student to hear him/herself say the content out loud , which is another way to use multiple senses to help the information stick . <p> Tutors who are working with students with ADD should remain patient and not have a problem repeating directions a few times . A soft , slow , patient speech pattern is helpful , and it is helpful to check frequently to make sure the student is following and understanding . Children who are taught in a way that is best for them make great gains and find a sense of achievement and confidence that they did n't have before .

@@60419306 @419306/ <h> A Student Who Knows Very Little <p> My year 10 student is struggling overall with her maths , she is in the lowest class at and is finding it difficult to solve almost every type of equation and she barely knows her times tables without looking them up in a chart . Is there anything i can refer to to help with this or any suggestions ? Most of my students so far have been quite the opposite and excel quite well in their maths study . <p> You paint quite a grim picture , like everything is wrong . That is a hard place to start , it is overwhelming . You will need to design a global , long term solution for this student , you ca n't deal with this situation on a week by week basis . In order to start it is probably best to define the problem more precisely , to break it down in its constituent parts and then start work . Do some " consultative tutoring " . I would consider the following points : <p> PSYCHOLOGY and ATTITUDE : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her homework ? Does she understand how far behind she is ? Does she understand what it will take to succeed ? What exactly does she want to achieve ? What is she willing to do to achieve her goals ? <p> The student 's work ethic and attitude are the main variable in this equation . You must determine what level of success is possible given her attitude and ambition . If she wants higher results than you believe possible with her attitude then either lower her expectations or improve her attitude ; otherwise she will not get the results she expects/desires . <p> Without MASSIVE action and MASSIVE changes , her situation will improve only slightly at best . She must have the right mindset to take the necessary actions . <p> SKILLS <p> Mathematics is based on a few pillars , these are some important ones : <p> Arithmetic <p> Algebra ( in all its shapes and forms ) <p> Curve sketching <p> Without some serious strength in these areas your student will NOT succeed in year 11 and 12 and she will have extreme challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still be accomplished but not with very high grades . <p> Start working on the areas above one at a time . Do so continuously and never stop until she is a master of at least arithmetic and algebra . This is the language of mathematics ; this is where you should start . Once she is strong in these areas , tutoring other math content will be much easier . <p> Students typically want to work on current school work . If she is not in tune with the meaning of mathematics then she will not want to focus on algebra if her class at school is doing probability . This is to be expected . You will need to consult with the student and/or parents to explain what needs to happen if they are to turn this situation around . <p> A good idea is to devote a part of every lesson and every homework assignment to arithmetic/algebra . If you do not , she will never speak this language well enough to do well in year 12 . <p> LEARNING LOGISTICS and PLANNING <p> By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be enough to help this student . She needs some momentum to turn things around . I would wager that currently you spend all your time answering the most pressing questions she has from school and there is no time to focus on anything else ? This kind of scenario quenches the craving she has for support without really teaching her to stand on her own two feet in mathematics . <p> Suggest having lessons more than once per week and/or increasing the length of each lesson . <p> Ask the student to start seeing the teacher at school for extra help once or twice per week . Without constant support she will not climb out of this hole , and the school teacher can be a huge asset when used correctly . <p> Increase the workload you give her for homework . <p> Put a program in place to turn things around . Plan 1-2 weeks ahead what you will focus on and what will be expected of her . Make sure she is included in the planning process and is agreeable . Ideally , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to keep her accountable and she will need all the support she can get . Revisit your plan on a weekly basis ; make improvements and changes as required .

How hard does she actually strain her brain before putting it in the " too hard " basket ? <p> While every student is different , really successful problem solvers can spend up to 30min on one question , moving back and forth until they make progress and solve the problem . Obviously this takes confidence so that the student must believe that the problem is solvable and they have the capability of solving it . Hence it is worth sticking with it even if it takes 30min because they know eventually they will get it for some students its a matter of pride to finish it on their own . <p> When she is stuck get her to write stuff down .

Students can sometimes think that poor grades in an exam can be the end of the world . Explain to the student that failure is one of the lessons of life , and the only real failure , is not learning from mistakes . The mistakes made in one exam are going to be the reason for success later one ! The first thing would be to examine how the student prepared for the exam .

Was extra time spent on weaker areas or complex concepts ? The second things to consider is the student 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes they made in it . We can categorise the mistakes into different areas , so we know how to deal with the problems effectively . Some of the main errors made on exams are : misreading question , carelessness , wrong concept used , incorrect application of concept , poor time management , and silly mistakes . There may be other types of errors as well particular to each individual student ; however this is a guide of the most common errors . Once the student realises the type of mistakes made in the exam , it follows for the student to try and explain how or why they made those mistakes . This can give a good indication as to what the student was feeling when making these errors ; it also allows them to explain any pressure they felt about the exam . This also is a great time to reinforce the importance of constant revision to the student , and the significance of beginning an early study-regime . After going through the errors with the student ; ask the student if there 's anything they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The student might have some ideas about what they would appreciate more of during lessons . Explain to the student that you 're going to place greater emphasis on the weaker areas in the student 's knowledge . Create a study plan together about overcoming the current academic hurdles . Organise a revision timetable so the student can show that they have learned from the poor exam results and now wo n't make those mistakes again . The most important thing is that the student recognises the mistakes made , the reason why the mistakes were made , and how to ensure they do n't make them again . In other words , they are developing self awareness in regard to their strengths and weaknesses . Ensure your student remains positive and motivated through a troubling time for them . A poor exam result is n't always a negative thing ; it can be the beginning of a very positive thing , however , the wrong attitude can easily paralyze a student , especially if they were expecting to do much better . <h> One comment <p> Roden said20 January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my student when I set him an exam-style test to consolidate his learning from previous sessions . <p> The questions were intentionally challenging , and served as a great opportunity to address a range of small problems that added up to an overall problem in approaching questions and problem solving in general . <p> It also helped to reinforce the point of how important it is to revise , as well as prepare .

I was wondering if you had any advice regarding this kind of problem should it happen again . Probably the first thing to ask yourself is " Should the student continue tuition with me instead and why ? " Being accustomed to a teaching style is not going to be enough of a reason for most parents since school tutoring is free and private tutoring is expensive . This is a fair enough perspective from the parents point of view and if they are to continue private tutoring the cost:benefit equation must be really promising . How much more benefit will the student get from you over the free tutoring at school ? Maybe the student really would be better off with school tutoring ? A few points to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free tutoring then their global truth about the situation must be some version of " My child can probably get most if not all of the benefit of the tutor from the school tutoring free of charge " .

This is really the goal of tutoring in the first place . However , it may be an uncomfortable shift for the student .

So since you are , chances are math has not always been easy for you . Fortunately , improving your math skills can be done , and with a positive attitude , practice and a little help from people who DO truly love math , you can change the way you think about math , which in turn will change the way you succeed in math . Here are 5 things to stop telling yourself , RIGHT NOW : <p> 1 . I 'm not smart enough for math- Some people believe that people who understand math are smarter than those who do n't , that the ability to understand math and numbers is some sort of superpower . However , being strong in mathematics is just as impressive and important as being strong in music or dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as struggling with photography or theatre or swimming . It is important to remember that understanding math is a skill , not a superpower , and can be strengthened and fine-tuned by anyone who puts in the work . <p> 2 . I have a horrible memory- If you ca n't remember anything else in this article , remember this : math is not all about memorization . Sure , memorizing big- families and formulas can help you solve math problems faster , but actually understanding the concepts and the WHY behind the math will help you become a successful mathematician . Ask questions and have teachers/parent/tutors explain it until it makes sense to you , and you do n't need a memory- like a steel trap to recall the information <p> 3 . I have to use shortcuts , so I 'm not good enough- Some people count on their fingers , some use rhymes and songs they learned in grade school , others tap tap tap away on their calculators . Using tools or tricks to help you find the answer is not cheating , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are any less capable to ace a math test than someone who counts in their head ( and who knows , maybe they are counting on their toes and you just ca n't see ) <p> 4 . I 'm a girl , girls are n't good at math- We all sincerely hope nobody is really saying this to themselves , but just in case : IT 'S NOT TRUE ! Men and women are very different , and their brains work in different ways . This does not mean women ca n't be top of their class in math . In some cultures , there is a subconscious message to women that they should n't be/ are n't interested in math related careers . It is important for women to remember that they can do anything a man can do and not let gender stereotypes prevent them from trying , engaging and asking questions in math class . <p> 5 . I 'm never going to use this- Fact : There will be times in math class when you would bet your last dollar- that you 'll never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . You 're probably right . However , a lot of the learning that is happening when you 're doing complex math problems is not the problem at all . It is fine-tuning your listening , organization and time management skills . It is helping your concentration , problem solving and critical thinking skills . Almost every career path uses some sort of math , so it is important to remember that when you 're about to thaw down your pencil and give up . Your dream career may not require you to know the quadratic formula , but it may require you to have the ability to recognize patterns , or use estimation or measurement . <p> The first step in improving your math skills is improving your attitude and inner dialogue . When you stop believing these five math myths , you give yourself the confidence you need to dive a little deeper into your math class , ask more questions , study a little harder and do whatever it takes to become the mathematician you know you can be .

However , for students who are already showing signs of struggle in one or more academic areas , an after school job may not be the best idea . <p> After school jobs require a lot of a student 's free time .

Teens sleep a lot because they need to sleep a lot , even if their sleeping times seem off compared to the rest of the world ( Staying up until 3 am and waking up at noon ! ) However , the brain is doing a lot of work in those hours when a teen is sleeping , and an afterschool job may interfere with their sleep schedule . Jobs that require late night hours such as waiter/waitress or working at a movie theatre can really throw off a teen 's sleep schedule , and could leave them feeling drowsy , irritable and unmotivated in class the next day . For students who are already struggling with math , exhaustion definitely does not help . <p> If your teen does not absolutely need to have an after school job , it may be beneficial for them to focus their time after school on their grades instead of an extra responsibility .

@@60419359 @419359/ <h> About Tests and Education System <p> I get quite despairing at times when i listen to the political football that is education . It is not all negative however as there are many people who are trying to improve things for everyone . There are many great teachers and tutorials on the internet . <p> To anybody interested i will recommend an essay you can easily find online called " Lockharts Lament " which highlights many of the problems that exist . The first half is full of dubious analogies and - dubious understanding of art and music . The second half however is full of concrete examples of where the problem lies . Lockhart diagnoses the problems in great detail and says things we might be thinking but do not know how to articulate . This man is a real mathematician who has a vast wealth of knowledge to draw upon . <p> One of the developments we have seen in Britain and i am sure there are developments in comparable countries is the calls for basic computer programming to be introduced in high schools . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no evidence given as to why this well help students . There is no better way to kill enthusiasm in a subject than to make it a compulsory part of the school curriculum . People who like these things are drawn to it outside of the school environment in my opinion . <p> The rise in standardized testing which takes the form of NAPLAN in NSW and " No Child Left Behind " in the United States is an interesting development . I am in favour of some form of standardised testing however i can not help but notice that there is some confusion as to what the purpose of the tests are.We are always told NAPLAN gives us information yet the information it gives basically disappears into a vacuum and nothing changes at the school level . In other words very little is done with the information once we gain it . - Parents of poorly performing students will get tutoring for their children partly because they get little support anywhere else . <p> Take recent developments in Britain although i am sure it is much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make maths " interesting " and " relevant " and the ways in which we need to do this are by using word problems . - Word problems such as at the primary school level involving how may donuts can we buy with a certain amount of money or using belly flops to talk about trigonometry or projectile motion . It is suggested sometimes that people who do not take to mathematics at an early age would take to it if only the sort of bells and whistles just mentioned were added . However if the previous mathematics education was not " relevant " - why assume that a sugar coated version of the same curriculum will be ? <p> It is furthermore constantly asserted by some people that the best way to get people interested in maths is to make it relevant to the " real world " . As if the " real world " consists merely of mundane repetitive tasks many adults are forced to do for a living.The answers here are usually along the lines of we should teach students how to manage their personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would imagine people also mean double-entry bookkeeping . There is nothing wrong with teaching these things however these pursuits are not deeply mathematical in nature and certainly do not compose a mathematical education . <p> In my opinion if we think about this seriously for more than a couple of seconds this sort of thinking is deeply floored . Do people really think that poor unfortunate students in a class really want to spend a lot of time doing that sort of thing . It would not take very long to adequately teach people how to do these things anyway . Most adults can do their taxes without needing any formal training and have a fairly good idea of what they can spend within their budget . And when students can do these things it begs the question of do students stop maths altogether when they have gained these shallow competencies ? <p> Understanding mathematics gives you a whole new way of looking at the world . That is not an abstract idea as it has many material consequences . Entire fields of thought are cut off if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solitary pleasure which is the best feature of it . <p> Notice that many people have missed that simple and honest hard work is the only way to learn mathematics . Furthermore knowing that your hard work has paid off - is what makes mathematics and all activities fun . Things like the school curriculum are largely elements on the side as what matters more is what you discover during your own studies of the subject . Like swimming and riding a bicycle mathematics is a skill and can ONLY be learnt by spending a lot of time working at the subject .

@@60419362 @419362/ <h> Tutoring CAN be All Fun and Games <p> It is important for parents , teachers and tutors to remember that before students are students , they are children . And children are built to play . They learn through playing from the time they are very small , and continue to grow mentally , emotionally and physically when they are encouraged to use their imaginations and play . This is especially true when helping students with disabilities . Traditional worksheets and lessons may not be the way that these children learn the best , and a good teacher/tutor strives to find the way that the student feels the most successful and teach them accordingly . Physical play , classic board games and sensory play are great ways to step out of the box and help to stimulate the brains of developing students , regardless of their ability level . <p> Sensory Play <p> Research shows that babies who are exposed to different types of sensory activities develop fine motor and problem solving skills faster than those who do n't have exposure to this type of play .

Something as simple as using rocks or marbles to count out during a math lesson is a great way to include the senses in their learning . <p> Classic Games <p> A excellent incentive for kids to stay focused and do their best during a tutoring session is by promising a fun game session at the end . Students will look forward to what they think is a break in their learning , but really it is a continuation of the lesson , just in a different form .

By incorporating a fun game into learning , students will be more engaged and excited about the material covered . <p> Physical Play <p> If you live in a place where it 's realistic to spend time outside , take advantage of it ! Think of different ways you can cover the same material by being outside instead of at a table . It 's easy and fun to put together a scavenger hunt for the student to find various shapes outside , helping with their understanding of geometry .

I have in place set more at home tasks to be completed between tutorials . Since parents are making little effort to effectively teach , student is making no effort to complete tasks , and tutorial time has been reduced , I perceive that improvements will be difficult . <p> - <p> If you feel that a parent or student is becoming increasingly complacent with organising tuition sessions- it is time for a serious one on one conversation with the parents . The conversation should outline why there has been a reduction in lessons recently . If you have a hunch it 's due to low results recently , then maybe note some of the reasons why the student did n't perform very well . Also do n't  assume too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going through . Explain that reducing the frequency of the tuition sessions will only exacerbate the problem instead of resolving it . Reduced time with the tutor will just make the progress a lot slower , if not halt it altogether . Remember a professional attitude here when speaking to the parents can go a long way , because as much as they value money , they will value their child 's education more . <p> Parents have a tough job of weighting the benefits of quality tuition against the cost of it , and sometimes due to their financial circumstance , tuition will be slowed down or stopped . If a parent is considering slowing down tuition because they 're devaluing the service all they end up doing is making it a self-fulfilled prophecy .

Mention any gaps you have minimised and any areas which you have improved the student upon . Explain how the student 's improved study skills will also help them to achieve their goals . Essentially we want to rationalise the perceived cost/benefit analysis so the parent realises that tuition is still a very worthy investment . <p> If the student is not completing the homework tasks on time , it would be a good opportunity to speak to the parents to outline the importance of completing homework tasks . Mention that without homework tasks being complete ; it reduces the time efficiency of the tuition sessions , thus reducing effectiveness of tuition against the money spent on it . Most parents will like the idea of getting more bang for their buck ' by having their son or daughter complete homework tasks . Lastly , speak to the student as well to mention all the benefits of tuition to the student , to help them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student about the benefits they 're likely to be engaged by the most . It may be a good idea to speak to the student before you speak to the parents so that you can relate the students version of the tutoring experience back to the parents . <p> Make sure that before you speak with the parents you have well thought out ideas about the progress of the tutoring or lack thereof . Also prepare some suggestions to the client to offer supportive approaches if they do in fact chose to decrease tuition . For example , suggest the student sees their school teach 1-2 times per week for a bit of extra help ; or that perhaps the parents put in some effort to teach the student if they are able .

@@60419402 @419402/ <h> Student Resents Tutoring <p> I am not getting a good response from one student ; she openly resents having a tutor and is passively aggressive toward me . She is rude and does not complete the homework I set for her . I have tactfully picked up on her rudeness and explained to her how I can help her academically . I have discussed the attitude with her parents , and they support me 100% . She has convinced herself that she does not require a tutor . <p> That sounds like a challenging but engaging situation . <p> The first thing you probably need to do is work on yourself to make sure that you are comfortable in the situation and not taking things personally . Often when students are forced into tutoring by their parents they will resent having to do the tutoring and sometimes pass that feeling onto the tutor as well . This is especially common during the rebellious teenage years . - Decide if you want to help this student and break through to them , if you do then prepare yourself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrespect personally . <p> From here you should try to understand the student 's reluctance . Why does she not want extra help ? <p> Does she feel stupid for needing extra help ? <p> Does she think she is doing well enough ? <p> Does she resent giving up her leisure time ? <p> At this point you do n't really need to convince the student otherwise , this is really about making the student feel understood and building trust . Depending on your comfort levels you may want to talk about the elephant in the room directly : She does not want you there and hates that her parents are forcing her . Tell her about a situation where your parents forced you and you hated it " build commonality . <p> The truth is that despite what she thinks of tutoring or what she wants , you are coming over anyway . Another truth here is that when you do come over , she does n't get as much out of it as she could because of her attitude . It is also probably true that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutoring if all these attitudinal issues were n't at play . Try to focus on what she does want and ask what she would like out of the tutoring ? What can you do for her ? <p> Students at that age are not accustomed to being treated as an adult or having their opinions and preferences considered . However , when they are given some responsibility and power to make decisions they usually appreciate it . This is the direction you should be aiming for . Try setting homework with her as a team " ask if she is ok with the amount you are setting , involve her . <p> Careful involving the parents . If you do so try to do it behind the scenes for now . The student resents the tutoring but this really comes from the resentment towards her powerlessness in the decision of tutoring which was enforced by her parents . If you want to gain her trust ( which will be necessary for progress ) you ca n't be seen to be siding with her parents too much . <p> You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do n't the parents will eventually cancel the tutoring and the student will not have received the true benefit of tuition . There is only so long that parents will be happy to pay for tuition if their daughter is ( for whatever reason ) not benefiting from it . 
@@60419411 @419411/ <h> Student Needs Holiday Sessions But Not Keen <p> One student 's parents want to stop tutoring after his exam but i think he needs to continue as we 've only really just begun and i feel he will just forget everything and go back to how he was before . <p> This is a really common situation . There are two main things you need to do here : <p> Understand the goals of the client <p> Educate the client about what it takes to achieve their goals <p> Some parents are only concerned about their child passing an exam instead of being focussed on learning and academic success . If this is the case there is little you can do besides voice your concerns for the student 's long term academic success which is being put in jeopardy with such attitudes . However , many parents are so far removed from the experience of study that they have forgotten what it 's like . They may not be aware of the damage caused by extensive breaks , or inconsistent tutoring in general . <p> As a tutor it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . If you feel that tutoring over the holidays will benefit him or that youve " just started " as you said and stopping now would undo all the progress , it 's your responsibility to communicate this to the client . You can also bring this up with the student and see if they are open to suggestions . Maybe the client is open to it and the student is not , maybe it 's the other way around ? <p> The best way to communicate your suggestions is in relation to the student 's goals . They will not want to do tutoring over the holidays just because you think it is worthwhile , but they may be willing to do so if it will help them achieve some perceived benefit/goal . Explain why it will help them and make sure that you understand what they want to achieve from the tutoring first . <p> Make sure you thoroughly explain your reasoning and that your suggestion is in their best interests . Work with them to create a solution that they will be happy with . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the next term ; that way all wont be forgotten , further progress will be made and it wo n't cost them too much . Alternatively , you may want to offer a supplementary structured revision schedule for homework over the holidays . Be creative . There exists a solution which will work for them ; you just need to find it .
