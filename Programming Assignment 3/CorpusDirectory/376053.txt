Obviosly more higher you go in the divisions harder the matches you well get against more experienced and dedicated Fifa players . This is really addictive mode and once you start playing it almost become obsession to win the title of Division 1 . <p> Each season is split into 10 games . You get 3 points for a win , 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss . Depending which division you are in you will get a certain points target for promotion or relegation . The higher the division the more you 'll need for the title and/or promotion . <h> Which teams to use ? <p> This is all down to individual preference really . I do n't  use 5 start teams more often and i like to play with teams who are 4.5 or 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions and use a championship or league 1 club to mix things up a bit . When you are playing with a 5 star team you mostly end up playing against Real Madrid or Bayern Munich they are reall strong teams on counter attacks . <h> How to play in FIFA 13 Seasons <p> possesion is awesome , keeping possession is crucial Mix up your play ( use crosses , long balls and long build ups ) Use your goalkeeper ; rush him forward when needed , makes it difficult to score against Pick a formation and stick to it ( allows you to become familiar with where players will be when you have the ball in certain areas ) <p> I have played over 1500 matches in seasons but never won div 1 title . Why ? because this game lags. sometime i win 10-12 matches in row and than i go winless in 15 matches . this is some sort of momentum thing in this game . <p> James <p> To be honest mate I think you just need to come to terms with the fact that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't  go your way but that 's football/gaming . I 've not played as much as I 'd like but since i bought the game I 've had consecutive promotions/league titles up to division one . Never even staying in the same league . Surely the " scripts " shouldve stopped me from doing that ? ? ? And stopped me from getting to roughly 50 wins 6 draws and 8 losses . Man up and stop blaming everything else <p> Audi009 <p> The " Scripting " is real . Its like in 5/10 matches . But in all serious Meintum is obviously bad at the game because scripting would n't happen 15 games in a row , as stated . <p> Michael <p> Yes the lag absolutely ruins this game . I have won Div 1 twice now but they only thing keeping me from winning ALOT more is simply lag . People with terrible skill can beat you because of lag . This lag is never from my end . <p> I do n't  believe there is scripting but goals at the 45 ' and 90 ' are a joke . Defenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> JC <p> That is exactly what people mean by scripting , surely . The defenders are also massively static after kick off ( so much so that 90% of the people in higher divisions go straight for a long ball over the top 2 passes after kick off ) . You are also extremely likely to concede a cheap goal after going 3 up you can spot it happening " my players cant pass , cant tackle , they screwed up their shot , and the 3 follow up shots , so this corner will definitely be a goal " every game . Equally to my benefit often as well , so I 'm not whining cos I 'm crap . <p> Julio <p> Well I experienced the opposite . I 'm terrible at this game but for a while I could do no wrong . All the loose balls bounced my way all the opportunities presented themselves and my team was running . I shot up 5 divisions in row but it did n't  last .

Blame lag all you want . There 's so much you can do about it but to play through it . I 've won games that were obviously scripted for the opponent to win ( fast players getting outpaced , misplaced passes ( I average about 85-90% pass accuracy ) and defending mishaps- players stopping or falling after tackles ) And I use 4-4.5 star teams- Cagliari , chievo , Palermo , anderlecht If I 'm Feeling kinky <p> Nat ( @natmiller556 ) <p> i 'm not the greatest at fifa but I know if your losing that much lag is not the problem . <p> Marinho <p> Hi Mario Which formation and tactics do you use when play with Cagliari ? <p> Admin <p> @ Mario <p> you are at xbox or PS ? if on xbox add me ruudarch and get your ass whooped = <p> Felipe <p> Add me so I can teach you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : so its not only me who getting his players fuked up when reach div2 .. all passes are wrong and the players are not moving at all .. and they lag about 1 sec while the opponent run and pass like devils and no matter what i try .. i keep losing till i drop to div5 then things get back to normal .. THIS IS EA FIFA13 .. its not me losing and its stupid and shit .. i hated the game for that <p> Esteban <p> I 've experienced exactly the same thing . You get stuck in a rut and it feels like players lag , and all passes go wrong , defense makes all kinds of mistakes , the opposer just feels superior . But I do NOT think that this is characteristic of the game . I think is more of a psychological thing . One has to overcome the rut , that 's it ! <p> thedondadda <p> Momentum is real in this game .

I understand the need to create realism , but some parameters are geting tweaked too hard.not to mention fouls on players that are about to run through.so many times , players gets knocked down , and no callwhatever , its an awesome game when its normal , but when that ish kicks in , i just laugh and turn it offim not an idiot , i know somethings are being altered , and i 'm not the only one who notices ( obviously ) i have also had it confirmed that some people ( especially mexicans and brazilians : ) ) purposely add lag to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . whatever , hopefully fifa14 will circumvent some of these issues or at least apply them more realistically . <p> bali <p> Dude I just had a game where I won 5 in a row then I played this idiot who really sucked ..

Its a mental thing , you start losing because you get frustrated , and then you want to blame something else . I 'm sure some of you are good players too , but if you let it get to your head you will always lose . the secret is to enjoy each game , do n't  be tense , and simply enjoy the fact that your playing an amazingly realistic football game . If your not enjoying it you should probably take a break . I my self have experienced what you talk of ; the lag , bad passing straight to opponents strikers , and slower feeling players . But that 's when you need to take a deep breath and relax , maybe even turn the console off for a while n get some fresh air . and then when you come back to it you will DOMINATE ! the game does n't  cheat you . you are the creator of your own environment , its all in your mind , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beat . Sensemilla helps <p> Felipe <p> Perfect comment . Nothing to add . <p> J <p> Sensemilla is the answer <p> JC <p> The opposite occurs though my players sometimes feel unstoppable , and just ride tackles . If I am 2-1 down and have a corner on 90 minutes , then it is going in , and the reverse if I 'm the one winning . Certainly many aspects are down to the player , but too many in this game are not . <p> Ashley Rod <p> I do not know if there is a lag or a script , but I definitely believe there are many occasions when things do not go your way e.g. players seem super fatigued and take their own sweet time to pass the ball and hence get tackled or intercepted , my shots are way off target or shots being superbly deflected by the opposing goal keeper and also when the opposition successfully tackles you close close to 100% accuracy and yours is 20% . I even try to set my team to all defense and keep possession , but none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum shifts my way and I thrash the opponent . So , I think it is the law of averages and can only hope that the " lag " or " script " do not come into play on critical games . It can be super frustrating when you are close to winning division 1 and you remain at this level . <p> Does any one have a problem facing Bayern Munich , my success rate against that team is poor . If I score 1 , they end up scoring 3 , if I score 4 , they end up scoring 6 . I take Madrid and struggle all the time to keep pace . Their defenders seem to out pace Benzema , Ozil , DMaria and Modric . Lahm seems to compete well with Ronaldos pace . Seems strange <p> Admin <p> Hey man , you are absolutely right . I find Bayern Munich as the hardest team to beat online in seasons and i always play with Manchester United . Bayern Munich always seem to score goal through wings with absolute fast players in Robber and Ribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Danshui <p> Switch to 5-4-1 England and stick both Ashley Cole and Leighton Baines on Robben and you will find that BM are easy to beat . <p> James <p> To be fair you may be right with teams like that . Try using four star teams in your season , using them has got me to a record of 56 wins , 4 draws and 8 losses ( I 'll give you my PS username to check if you need to ) . Pick a team that gives you an advantage in the right areas that play to your strengths . <p> For example I use Aston Villa a lot and no one else ever seems to . They have a slow defence but you can combat that with good positioning . Their man threat though is up front , Gabby Agbonlahor and Darren Bent out pace pretty much any defender in 4 star teams making one on ones easy to come by with quick passing . <p> Also theyve got NZogbia who is very fast and skillful so getting crosses in is easy to do as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who want to be Santos because of Neymar , granted he s quality but he s only one man so Santos are very easy to play against . Give Villa a go , trust me <p> PJ <p> My problem recently has been people cutting the connection when i 'm winning . It says its calculating the result but several times it basically ignores the game and puts you back to where you were . Today I was 7-1 up with less than 10 mins to go connection got lost , and then the stats fail to acknowledge the game ever happened . Very frustrating ! <p> Anyone else experienced this ? <p> Felipe <p> Yes , it does happen sometimes . What I usually do is resert the console and connect back to seasons . It seems like the server is able to recover the lost data that way . But it works like 90% of the time .

Remember : your defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you score in the first 5 ' the game will give your opponent good opportunities to get that goal backbecause he couldve quit . To the guy that expects div. 1 titles after 1500 games : if you never played a video soccer game before and you play 1500 games online without practicing , playing the AI , reading blogs and playing friendlies you will be lucky if you are 400-300-800 . Nobody has won a division 1 title without having played this game or EVO before this year . Those who claim they picked it up and are 290-30-45 in seasons are LIARS . I know over 100 players , and all the div 1 guys have played for years . And finally , even though I suck at this game , I happen to play on both Xbox &amp; PS3 , abnd I can tell you winning 80% of your games on PS3 is good but not great .

The best players are on Xbox <p> James <p> Agreed over your point about scripting . There is no favoritism in the game , therefore if you 're having a hard time one game its just as likely that the other player will be stitched up in your next game . <p> How you can make the point that " winning 80% of your games on PS3 is good but not great " I do n't  know . Especially seeing as by your own admission you 're useless at this game . So odds are you 're only playing around div 4/5 at best . Surely youd have to be playing the better players to have some sort of idea of who 's better ? ? ? I 'm not going to get drawn into the " which console is better debate " because that 's boring and pointless . <p> I 've played in div 1 on both systems and Ive always found ps3 players to be much more difficult to play against . But that 's likely to be luck of the draw anyway because there is absolutely no reason why one set of players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise is either biased , looking for an argument or idiotic . <p> bill roubanis <p> I 've played div 1 both platforms several times , but generally I 'm stuck around div 3 and do n't  improve much . What can I say , I 'm a slow learner , I do n't  practice specific things , and I play endless late night games sometimes while falling asleep on the console , and dropping from one division to the next , then climbing back up a few days later when Im rested . <p> My 80% comment was ridiculous , and I apologize . Anyone , on any platform , winning 400 of their first 500 seasons matches is world class . People play for years and take online courses just to be able to get to the point where they win half their games . <p> About the platforms : I am located in Los Angelesother places may differ .

They claim it is because the standard XBOX controller is better for this game than the standard PS3 controller . I am not sure . I am not an XBOX rep . I hate their greedy attitude .

No Howard Webb jokes please . let 's take a look at the EPL Refrees salaries . <p> So in a single season Premier League refrees can make around -70,000 which is two weeks average salary of an Premier League footballer , That 's how much Footballers are being paid at the moment <p> In england since 1998 English FA decided to form a professional group of refrees who are officiating premier league or lower division games . Back in the days like 10 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now its increased to -38,000 to -40,000 depending on the experience but that 's not all yet .

We will publish the list of referee for next season here . <p> Just watched one of the worst refereeing performance for many years by R Madley who officiated in the Burnley v Derby game .

There should NOT be an upper echelon of referees . Yes reward effort and commitment . Yes reward performance by impartial assessment and yes remunerate appropriately . However , there are a goodly number of match officials in the lower leagues fully capable of doing an equally good or better job as the refereeing elite we are blighted with currently . I 've seen dreadful decisions made by these guys . For example , dreadful tackles unchallenged and clear dismissals ignored .

WADA has maintained a prohibition list forbidding the players and athletes from using banned drugs and a comprehensive dope test system has been initialized but despite the presence of extremely strict rules and awareness campaigns , every year players from different sports get into the headlines on the pretext of using banned drugs . Once found guilty of cheating , players get stripped off their achievements but even this step ca n't keep many players from using such drugs .

With the next Cricket World Cup becoming ever closer we hope that no such event happens this time around .

Here is the comparison with FIFA 14 gamplay screenshot . <p> EA Sports FIFA 14 Expectations this year FIFA in the last couple years has been the best sports selling game , and that due to the fact that EA managed the transition from PS2 to PS3 effectively , they put together a new game engine , graphics were improved but most importantly first time they leaped forward than PES in terms of gameplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be the same FIFA 13 with some new tweaks , a little bit better graphics , but if they can work on online connectivity issues they can again rock this year . <p> Konami PES 2014 Expectations this year Konamis PES on the other hand , was leaps and bound ahead in terms of game play than fifa before 2009 , but after that they just could not take the series to next level and lost the battle , but with the promised to bring the new Fox engine in the game die hard PES fan will be dlighted that they can actualy expect great things from PES , and this is Konamis last chance to get on lever terms before consoles move to next generations . <p> biased report on fifa . no details on pes dri.bling , and its struggle between slow strong players and small agile players and its a photo of messi using his RIGHT foot to shoot from distance lol which really shows the development team know nothing also nothing on completely seperate ball and player physics , shirt and body also seperate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pes to be completely overhauled . but hey your website and your ( biased ) article . Oh and fifa13 hardly rocked its too quick and i know people who still play fifa 12 due to this and other problems <p> sumedh <p> fifa is a nice game but the features and graphics of pes are any time better <p> dinesour <p> they may be somwhat better , but you just cant face the fact that FIFA will always be better . <p> mark <p> @fifa always huge fanboyism right there . PES is not ages behind . I played both pes and fifa 2013 and I enjoyed more PES its a good game . Fox Engine will be a deal breaker it allows lot of tweaks to be made to the gameplay and graphics will be top class . Even now the graphics in PES are better than in fifa . <p> The article also is fifa biased . " Pro Evolution Soccer fans which were disappointed with the last 2 versions of the game " . Yeah right . The last game was n't a disappointment at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you really cant compare them now . <p> James <p> LOL Fifa soccer simulator ? Bull shit the only football simulator on the market is the Fooball Manager series <p> Anywho this generation is a write off , FIFA won , both teams need to concentrate on the transition to the new consoles . Pro evo fucked up because they were kings on the ps2 and did n't  want/ think they had to change much when the ps3/xbox360 came . So it will be interesting to see how fifa will react . <p> very well said man . PES was awesome on PS2 , and after xbox360/ps3 they just could not make it to next level . FIFA improved on next gen but still after playing 1000 games online i can only see same kind of goals i am scoring or conceding same pattern . <p> haz <p> To be honest i liked fifa 12 but no-way is fifa a simulator its a great package game but that 's itpes 13 on the other hand has a realistic gameplay which is the reason of my switch over this year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and fun football package and online modes . <p> Pes13- great gameplay and a game for hardcore football gamers . <p> Terrybull <p> FIFA is a just arcade , play 20-30 matches and you will start to score same goals over and over again . nobody an not deny , you play it online or offline they way you play is so damn same . <p> with PES you get variety , you can score different goals all the time , even after playing for 1000 matches you will get somthing new.only downfall ? official licensing or overall game presentation . <p> its like beautifull vs sexy , you always want to bang sexy why ? because its fun to play with her .. is n't it ? <p> Messi10 <p> Very well said ! <p> Sajal <p> @Terrybulltotally agree with you man <p> these are the right words to xplain pes vs fifa <p> do n't  deny it <p> the amount of pes fan-boys that go online and write stuff about how fifa is crap just to make themselves feel better knowing that fifa is so good successful popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put together times ten.The top three football games out are fifa 13 , fifa 12 and fifa street no arguing about that end of story <p> Aaron <p> I 'm really not liking the moniker " arcade " . I mean I do n't  think Ive ever had to insert coins for credits to play PES . Why is it arcadey anyway ? What is the definition of " arcadey " . It just seems like an arbitrary thing to use to define a gameplay style . <p> joeke12 <p> Since the ignite engine wont be in fifa14 , i am now stepping away from fifa and go to PES 2014 . <p> joeke12 <p> Mean in PC version ofc . <p> Beroe <p> Same to me <p> andrea <p> fifa 14 foreverrrrrrrrrrr fifa 14 &gt; pes 2014 <p> Sascha <p> FIFA is a nice game but the biggest problem is that it is run by EA . So money milking everywhere , the worst support imagineable and an incredible amount of user-unfriendly decisions per se . Remember how they tried to sell FIFA 12 to WII users as FIFA 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact were the player jerseys and the music ? Things like that . To be honest the new features that every FIFA title seems to offer rather make up for a good update then a new game . That would be fair to everyone . But if they would call it update , they could n't demand 66 80 G ( ! ! ! ! ) for it anymore . <p> It COULD be a great game , it really has the potential yet in fact especially Ultimate Team as a main feature is one big unnecessary waste of its consumers lifetime and nerves . Not only is the game full of unnecessary annoyances and in severe need of becoming more beginner friendly , it constantly annoys you with cards like contracts , form , formations and so on that are neither realistic nor improve the game .. they are only meant to prolong your playing time and annoy you so much that you want to buy FIFA points . <p> This year for the first time i will not support EAs impudence anymore and change to PES . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly rather into the game so it offers the most enjoyment possible also to the customers not only their bankers . We all know that the licenses are the only reason why EA can rest assured that people will buy over and over again their FIFA series . Yet do n't  let names blind you . If you are up for a good game and a publisher that sees you as a consumer that has a right for the best game imagineable since after all you payed a lot of money for it .. then avoid EA . <p> El Matador <p> thks man , <p> I 've always played pes and iss , ando for the first time in my life i was strating to think that maybe i should give a chance to FIFA , but after reading your post ive decided to , once again , to buy Pro Evolution Soccer the best game series ever . <p> Thks <p> CRISRON7 <p> I see that many have now understood that PES is way better than FIFA .. I am lucky that i got it 2 years ago .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same childish gameplay for babiesPES is real mans footballand who says FIFA outsold PES in 13 ? . Check yourself .. Now with FOX ENGINE let 's hope PES will reach beyond FIFAs limit .. LOL <p> Syiranami <p> Also , pes should get an official license so that way it will be a ground breaking football game ! : - ) I used to be a Fifa fan boys but when i tried pes it blows me off ! ! The free of customization , graphics patches and fifa is so dumb that u cant edit official players faces like ronaldo , messi etc. and also ive pissed off on fifa 13 where the nike boots is design is too damn tinyhopefully the fox engine will outrun the crappy engine that used in fifa and also pls pls make a pes for the ps2 cuz they should realize that there are many people that cant afford buying those higj end console so make one that is different from the 13 and 12. bring back the 07,08,09 pes ! with new engine lol ! <p> joy <p> pess grapics always better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the heat of real football u will always go for fifa . <p> shawn <p> i think that pes is getting way way better than fifa <p> marwen <p> marwen says pro is always better <p> josephcouri <p> I 'm a fifa fan but let 's admit it.pes 14 will be way better than fifa that is before the ignite engine comes into play.fifa is too one-way.initially it is interesting but after some time u get fed up.To pro fans i was one myself until i tasted fifa next gen.Movement was lyk straight and diagonal ( hardly saw 360 movement ) , bubbling shots , player faces were kinda tough , bad ball control.But i got hope in pes 14. hope they do n't  dissapoint . <p> alonso <p> Pes all the way i play pes since pes 5 Pes 6 give me pure excitement , i enjoy pes 6 and skipped pes 2008 , 2009 , i played 2010 , 2011 , but still i love pes 6 , then when pes 2012 is out , i really enjoy it , pes 2013 as well pes working hard to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifa have so many teams and players that give you really enjoy career mode , but gameplay still i think pes is better , <p> Bruce <p> One of The most important factors the pes needs to edge fifa is more flexibility in the master league In particular to change from one team to another . If pes listens to this I can guarantee a huge leap forward . <p> shamir <p> Bro this time round there is switching option ! ! ! So do join a PES gang <p> Matt <p> The top 2 notes for each game in this article should be flipped . I enjoy both but PES is just eternally screwed due to the licensing situation . Nothing like a " realistically " gripping match between North London and Man Red . Its just ridiculous that EA is allowed to own sole rights to these licenses . <p> Cill+an OBynre <p> as the comparison says they are different games so saying one or the other does n't  matter . its personal preference each game has something the other does n't  and neither of them are perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again they would n't just give us everything otherwise they would n't be able to make another game . i have played both over the years and found both entertaining fifa needs to get out of its own arse a bit and PES needs to license teams . <p> james <p> Initially I was PES , then in the last 5-6 years I moved to FIFA . This time I 'll go back to PES . I decided to boycott EA from now on . <p> Anonymous <p> Pes of course <p> willis <p> if you play fifa u wo n't bother playing pes <p> Floyd <p> this article is wrong all this picture from to pes 2013 <p> Santiago <p> I think you got it backwards FIFA has a much faster pace and is much more unrealistic than PES I 've been playing FIFA for a while now and it just does n't  add up , the ref misses incredible fouls all the time , and the players simply do n't  have any hint of intelligence , they never generate spaces on the attack and is quite normal to have the forwards just staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just really nerve-wracking ! This year I 'm definitely going with PES . <p> ricarbonero <p> fifa is an easy to play game , if you learn how to play pes ( 2013 ) you see that you have a lot more posibilities than in fifa . fifa is really simple and the goals are always the same , players do n't  miss passes , .. in pes you need to learn how to control ballth ( pessing R2 at firs touch , do n't  turning 180- unless players are skilfull , etc ) , once you learn that you wont play fifa <p> I just do n't  understand why people like FIFA . Its ridiculously easy to play . Can ask anybody that had played both games n I 'm sure theyll say PES is a challenge ( specially with manual shooting ) . <p> salman <p> I played FIFA 2000-2008 all versions . Than I experimentally tried PES 2009 and I was shocked being fooled for so many years that FIFA is a best soccer game . I must say there is no match between FIFA and PES . PES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphics wise also better . And the positive think is they are evolving . I checked 2013 again after that i left it since 2008 just to check there potential but unfortunately they are still far behind in game play <p> Zado <p> Boy what are u talking about PES and FIFA.This. are you playing the wrong games ? PES = Arcade and FIFA = Realistic ? Man what game did you play ? ? ? probably neither . FIFA SIMULATOR ? " head shake " . License , I have the FUCK License . with the PES community i got every license of the world every team there and I want to play the league in Bangladesh then I can on the original team in the original stadium with original shoes on the correct original lawn with original ball without fucking license . maybe not on the cheap console but on PC.Ill pass on details to go here . <p> Evans <p> Well said , I laughed a bit but yeah , you on point . <p> dacosta <p> dacosta says ; we are talking about reality here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare each with real football . pes is the best and feels you are controlling everything . <p> PodySchweiny <p> FIFA 14 Wins again this year . FIFA 14 Takes the Lead with its NEXT Gen version on Xbox One and PS4 with Newest Engine called Ignite Powered by EA Sports . PES just has to accept the the truth that PES Can not fight AGAINST FIFA undoubtedly . BOO ! ! ! PES <p> adrick <p> I AM die hard fan of pes but i thought let 's give a chance for fifa 14 I searched INTERNET youtube every where about the pes 14 vs fifa14 so i wanted to bring one this games all the children n youths said fifa is best in each n every way even in gameplay so i spent my money buying fifa14 yesterday i was excited that every thing is improved in this game so came home started to play after one match trust me i was dissappointed with the graphics , especially for gameplay the players runs like zombies n animation is fucked up n i saw pepe clapping after the match he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this shit i payed my pocket money to buy this shit controls TO ALL THOSE GUyS IN INTERNET STOP TELLING BAD ABOUT PES14 N I LIKE PES13 MORE THAN FIFA 14 BECAUSE GUYS DO NT GET FOOLED BY INTERNET CAUSE I BOUGHT FIFA 14 N I AM REGRETING A LOT <p> Sajal Jain <p> I 'm afraid this couldnt be the reason for 3rd world war.lolzz <p> yeah .. if you are playin for enjoyment and excitement .. go for FIFA But if you are seeking for realistic gameplay .. PES is for u <p> well i play bothdepending upon my mood and friends with whom i am playing <p> Tee Wee <p> Fifa is top in promoting the beautiful game but somehow they always disappoint . I love the way they write but it is the action that counts in the end . PES2014 is pretty lame in promoting their game but they are way ahead of Fifa in terms of gameplay I am still waiting for my Fifa 2014 , just hope that the gameplay has changed . In terms of features Fifa has almost everything whereas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be if we can have both FIFA features and PES gameplay . Anyway I am hoping that Fifa 2014 will spring a surprise . Then again it may just be wishful thinking . <p> Treasure <p> after these comments I 'm getting me a PES 14 no doubt , thank you <p> halldors78 <p> are you actuallly talking about pes and fifa ? ? ? ? Fifa has always been the arcade ping pong game while Pes has been much more like soccer were games sometimes end 0-0 with few shots on goals and then other games end with alot of goals . Fifa have the same kind of goals and is more for kids . <p> DSD27 <p> PES is not an arcade game anymore ! ! ! ! ! ! ! since pes 2008 its becoming simulator , and now in 2014 simulates better than fifa <p> pedrosaul1 <p> Well what I know ea its a monoply it has licensed logos in all sports like madden fifa etc it has more teams and pes only has a few but quality or quantity u decide and I know cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing is repition in all ea games in pes well its like life you have random goals like real life it happens when do n't  expect while in ea you have to score of a goal kick or cross in pes I once had a cross go in a goal <p> Let me watch the world burn <p> *grab popcorn* <p> 212121 <p> Pess is a very good game . this is much better then FIFA . Because it has very good graphics &amp; this is enjoyably games . because I 've played this 2 games . I 've seen that pess is very good <p> poiu <p> But FIFA is also a good game . BUt in this games c.ROnaldos Face is not good .
