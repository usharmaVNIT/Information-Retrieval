Both of them were having terrific years , both undefeated and with fantastic ERA 's .

@@37748432 @6748432/ <h> TOPIC : SJU 's campus and SJU in general <p> There 's been a lot of talk about the SJU campus , and as one of you commented , maybe you have n't been on campus in a long while . <p> I 've been as critical as anyone on redmen.com concerning the quality of student SJU is attracting and about the school in general . I 'm still critical , but recently my outlook has been raised considerably . <p> As I typically try to do , when we have a position open we post at SJU in their career development office . When we did , we were told there was a jobs fair the following week and would we be interested in exhibiting . The jobs fair was the day after I would arrive home very late at night from a 4 day west coast trip , so I declined . There was a $200 fee per company , which I thought was foolish considering the benefit to the university of hiring their students . <p> When we declined , we received another offer inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decline , but they were so gracious about the offer , decided to accept . They also offered that one of the Deans would like to meet with me if I had time , so we worked that in also . <p> The jobs fair was in Taffner Field house , which is a really nice building . As with the better conferences we attend , SJu staff was very gracious in helping us get set up , and also came by to thank us for participating . We met some really terrific kids , and offered two of them internships , one that has the potential of FT employment after . These were really bright , personable kids , and would represent SJU well in any era of the school . One was very near the top of his class in pharmacy school , 3.92 GPA in pharmacy , and also is in the President 's society , students government , and drama club . The other had a full schoalrship to SJU and was an honors student and Stuyvesant HS grad . <p> At the conclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escorted us to the library , whose exterior is familiar , but on the interior bears no comparison to the library we knew . There is a coffee shop on the first floor which is first class , and the upper floors are now offices which are also first rate . If memory serves me , they used to be classrooms . The Dean was impressive and gracious , and new to SJU . Unlike many academicians , she had solid industry experience and success , had fantastic academic achievements of her own , and was as warm and gracious as could be . Rather than lecture me about the school , she conversed easily and asked my opinions on some of their programs and offerings . She is seriously interested in forging relationships with the local business community to strengthen SJU in all ways . <p> I am still kind of dumbfounded at the transformation underway , and sheepishly embarrassed that as I have taken shots at the school some very good stuff is happening on campus that will make all alumni very proud of SJU . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downsizing of her long term position with an industry struggling to convert to the digital age . I am thrilled to have gotten such a high caliber resource and person . The kids I interviewed at the jobs fair were all terrific students . <p> If you have n't considered hiring an SJU kid for an internship or FT position , I 'd strongly advocate you do both if you are in a position to influence such hirings . I 'd also encourage any of you to visit the campus , which is dramatically improved over the campus we attended . <p> Was in grad school in 2008 and 09 , when D'Angelo Center was being completed . I recall that it was a fairly nice campus with lots of new architecture . It was more compact and less sprawling than some of the smaller town big football campuses I 've been on .

Some kids want a nice campus to live on , some want a big city to live in . Some kids want to go away , some want to stay home . Some want good academics , some want good athletics . Some want a winning program , some want the most playing time possible . Every kid is different and it 's the staffs job to find out what each kid wants . <p> As for the campus itself , I graduated in 2014 and it was pretty nice . Nowhere near as nice as some of the other schools I 've seen in the area and down south , but nothing to be embarrassed about in a big city . <p> Some of these kids want a great nightlife with the great weather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be able to offer .

Every school goes through the same thing , even some of the blue bloods . <p> To be honest while we may not have the " most Beautiful " campus it is Nice and pleasant to walk around . The recently added architecture is quite nice . To me the big " No sell " to students is the declining academic rankings and the fact that it is still primarily a commuter school The dorms built in the 90 's ? we a tremendous help but not enough ( IMHO ) ...

@@37748434 @6748434/ <h> TOPIC : The new and improved Coach Mullin <p> I know I have been simultaneously one of Coach Mullin 's biggest supporters and biggest critics - which appears to be a dichotomy , but not really . <p> I want him to be an awesome coach , mostly because he represented SJU as an amazing athlete and continuing to be a regular guy who is approachable . He started out here with zero experience and almost a zero roster - not a good formula for success . <p> I have been very vocally critical about how he delegated responsibility and was almost a silent observer on the bench as others provided in game coaching . Before this mini run and after a devastating loss to Penn State I posted that Mullin had finally assumed HC bench coaching , being engaged end to end . He still was largely vacant from the timeout huddles , and that bothered me . <p> Last night that ended . <p> I documented every timeout huddle , as I was surprised that the very first huddle it was Mullin and Mullin alone speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , third , and finally the entire game . Everyone was the same : <p> St. Jean stayed on the outer rim of the huddle and it was Chris directing his players . Win or lose , this is how it 's got to be . Basketball coaching is n't rocket science , but it can be overwhelming even if you played HOF caliber ball yourself but never had to run the whole show . Mullin , to me , has finally stepped into those shoes . <p> From here on out , I 'm now totally confident that Chris will continue to grow as a competent , confident coach , get better players , and win here . Last night we hung in against a top ten team with a lottery pick freshman center , even on a night where Lovett and Ponds were n't at their best . <p> Better days ahead .

It is amazing how finally mainstream publications and advocates like James Altucher are finally attacking higher education inflation . I think the goverment needs to get out of the education business and colleges need to do a better job of reining in expenses . <p> It is amazing in 25 years how SJU has become afforable only to the wealthy or to the poor who receive federal taxpayer grants . The middle Cathoilc working class which was their base from the 1960 's - 1990 's is being squeezed to no end . <p> The question is will middle class families who live in the NY DMA like me and others on this board be able to afford to send their son or daughter to SJU in 10-15 years , without putting their child through $100,000 of debt when they graduate ? <p> It is time for SJU to step up and become a leader in tuition reform . The Catholic HS Schoraship is a start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other mid-tier private colleges tuition bubble bursts , and it will. - <p> - IMO unless you get financial aid or have a very rich father , A school like SUNY makes more sense then SJU . College grads are having a tough time finding jobs . 50% of recent grads are un or under employed . My son graduuated last year and is working as a security guard at night , . Fortunately he has no debt . Kids should n't be graduating college w a $ 100,000 debt burden unless its an Ivy league school or a school like Stanford . <p> - The fact is you do not need to acquire a 4 year degree today , to have a great career . Students should look at professions that require license , certifications , or specialized training programs .

Particularly surprising is how the staff has masked their lack of size and depth in the last two games . Honestly while I watched those loses at the Garden it reminded me of the 1998 season when we lost the two games back to back to Stanford and Purdue . In those loses , that team was able to realize that it could compete with the upper echelon , which was far more important than the actual results .

Not like he has to rely on getting his own shot , likely to get very good looks with all the attention guys like Lovett/Ponds draw .

However , as I said in my post , they are now practically free ( excluding Room &amp; Board ) when financial support is factored into the equation . As you may know , here in New York State , beginning next school year students can take advantage of The Excelsior Scholarship . Under this program , more than 940,000 middle-class families and individuals making up to $125,000 per year will qualify to attend college tuition-free at all CUNY and SUNY two- and four-year colleges in New York State . This is similar to the Sanders proposal but fairer to the tax payers and better for the State . I firmly believe tuition should be tied to income . Families earning over a quarter million $ should be able to afford the full cost of the already low state tuition . Like the free tuition at our military service academies , students will be required to work in New York for the length of their scholarship , thereby giving something back . Remember , the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarships . Athletes , regardless of I.Q. , get free rides .

As in education , this would help mostly the poor and many middle class citizens while the well-to-do can continue to afford expensive health insurance and go to the best doctors and private hospitals .

Georgetown is now looking for their version of the eighties with Ewing , however at least he has NBA coaching experience . <p> No one is apologizing for anyone , if you think there is enough of a body of work to judge Mullin as a coach , judge away , I do n't and that 's all I am saying . And money has nothing to do with whether he turns out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely silliest argument you could make . And if you expected there to be any possibility of an " 80 's version " of SJU by now you are just kidding yourself . <p> I ca n't possibly see Patrick Ewing doing well at Georgetown , which warms my heart . <p> Do n't be so sure . Ewing has 15 years experience as an NBA assistant and has a very good rep within the NBA of coaching big men and bigs always seem to want to go to G'town . Let 's see what kind of staff he assembles before righting his epitaph . That said hope he does n't succeed but if you really want your heart warmed it would have been better if they kept JT3 . <p> Yeah Drexler inherited the Golden State Warriors . Again any other coach and I would openly be questioning this process . I am not , no matter what happens but you ca n't get mad at the comparison because it is not ridiculous . He is Chris Mullin . Really hope it works but would not bet my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least . <p> Not at all mad and comparing Mullin 's situation to any other coach makes no sense . Name me another coach who inherited a roster in the spring completely devoid of legitimate D1 players . And the jury is certainly still out on Mullin as a coach but judging him now in any way is nonsense IMO . <p> This post is spot on ! ! Mullin inherited a dumpster fire The team was markedly better at the end of this season than when he took it over Unless there is a major injury , it is fair to expect a post season berth next season If we do n't make the NIT ( at least ) , people would have a right to question the hire But to have expected much better than this after two years is downright foolish IMO

I have not seen them play and transfers are difficult to evaluate . They are transferring for a reason . Especially a highly-ranked prospect like Simon , was he overrated coming out of high school or was Arizona a bad fit ? <p> Last year we had some bad early losses , which can be expected from such a young team . But we went 7-11 in the Big East and looked really good at times . Another year will bring more consistency and efficiency . I predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting an additional interior grad transfer was disappointing , but not end of the world . It would also be nice to have added some college coaching experience on the bench , but perhaps that happens . If not , so be it .

Landing 4 star kid in Wilson late &amp; getting what appears to be a steady player in Dixon via transfer . <p> 3 . They seem to have puncher 's chance with Little in 18 , although Florida will be tough to beat . Staff also still seems to think Luther M is still well in play . <p> 4 . They have some very good players in 19 in reach like Precious A &amp; Aiden I. <p> 5 . Would expect player &amp; coaching maturation this season &amp; at very least contending for a Dance spot . <p> 6 . Matt not perfect , but plays transfer game well ; Owens , Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would expect he continues that approach with success . <p> We will see . Glass half full for the moment . <p> Outstanding post Outstanding insight Outstanding poster , of course Is this a good time to follow the Red Storm Or what Oh and agree w you RMW - maybeglass 2/3 to 3/4 full or at least headed in that direction - in a mere 2 years ! <p> I think the glass is more than half full , and an NCAA birth a real possibility . <p> There will always be recruiting miscues and misses , but I am happy ( more than happy ) with the talent that the staff has brought in . It has been a steady upgrade , and with the new additions this year , additional upgrades ( assuming that the assessments are remotely accurate ) . <p> The 19 class by all accounts could be a monster if we get a little lucky .

By Patrick Toner on May 31 , 2017 2:24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The college basketball season is still five months away , but who does n't like a little reminder that the Big East is set to be a very competitive conference yet again this season ? <p> May 24th was the final day for all players to withdraw their name from NBA Draft consideration , most recruits have committed , and impact graduate transfers have announced their decisions for the most part . Simply put , barring any off-season injuries the rosters are pretty much set in stone from here until the college basketball season . <p> Top Dogs Villanova- The Wildcats will remain here until it is proven another team deserves this spot . Jalen Brunson is primed for a BEPOY-caliber season , and the addition of five-star Omari Spellman down low will keep the Wildcats elite . Donte Divincenzo will need to continue to build off of last year 's success , though . Xavier- Trevon Bluiett and JP Macura were the Musketeers two most important players from last year 's Elite Eight team and they return . Oh yeah , Chris Mack also has the 11th ranked recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team who can make yet another deep run in March , possibly to their first Final Four . Seton Hall- The Pirates can easily be in Xavier 's spot right now . The only separation between the teams is that while both teams return key experienced players , Xavier 's returners have lead their team deeper into March . With that being said , Angel Delgado is the top returning center in the nation from last year , and the Pirates top three returning scorers are all 1,000 career point scorers . Seton Hall will add needed depth with a solid incoming recruiting class . Look for Kevin Willard 's squad to be strong contenders to win their second Big East title in three years . All Alone 4 . Providence- I do not think Providence will be quite good enough to crack the top 3 , but I also believe they stand out alone as considerably better than the rest of the teams in the conference . The returning core of Rodney Bullock , Emmitt Holt , Jalen Lindsey and Kyron Cartwright should definitely be enough for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Pack 5 . Butler- This is where it gets interesting , the Big East could be a seven-bid conference again come March . Teams five through eight are very interchangeable . Butler gets the top spot in this group because head coach Chris Holtmann has demonstrated he can win , even when his teams are not loaded with talent . Last season 's leading scorer , Kelan Martin , returns for his senior year , along with Tyler Wideman and Kamar Baldwin . Production will need to be made up for as Tyler Lewis and Andrew Chrabascz both are gone . <p> 6 . St. John's- The Johnnies can be a very scary team . Chris Mullin has himself one of the best backcourts in the nation in Shamorie Ponds and Marcus LoVett who combined averaged over 30 points a game last season . Four-star power forward Sidney Wilson signed with the Red Storm recently , giving St. John 's some help down low . <p> 7 . Creighton- Marcus Foster deciding to return for his senior year will help big time , having Khyri Thomas returning helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be dependent on the impact next season 's freshman will have , and Creighton 's recruiting class is solid . <p> 8 . Marquette- Sophomore Markus Howard returns after a very impressive freshman campaign . The Golden Eagles are a heavily guard oriented team who will hope for 6-11 center , Harry Froling to make an immediate impact down low . <p> Living in The Basement 9 . DePaul- I put the Blue Demons here because I am confident in the ability of Eli Cain to lead his team to more wins than Georgetown , who I believe may just be a mess next season . You will be hearing DePaul 's name being called on Selection Sunday 3-4 years from now . Things are turning around in Chicago as DePaul is already looking at a promising 2018 recruiting class and will begin playing games in their brand new Wintrust Arena this upcoming season . <p> 10 . Georgetown- Way too many questions to be answered here . Can Patrick Ewing coach at the college level ? This team also has way too much roster turnover to predict a successful first year for Coach Ewing .

@@37748508 @6748508/ <p> If I recall correctly , Sonny died in an auto accident while driving a taxi cab during a snow storm .

I think Sonny was hoping to get experience and notice and perhaps move into a more substantial job in broadcasting . I also seem to remember that fatigue may have played a role in the tragic accident . <p> I remember seeing him play CYO around 1973-1975 . Back in those days , CYO had divisions that extended up until the age of 21 , and beyond that an unlimited division . I think the upper divisions went Tyro , Junior , Senior , and then unlimited . The unlimited division had some former college players . I remember Mel Utley played for St. Mary Star of the Sea , in Far Rockaway .

@@37748509 @6748509/ <p> The Yankees and Athletics have had recent trade discussions , sources confirmed to MLB.com , although it remains unclear whether the Yankees have greater interest in Oakland right-hander Sonny Gray or first baseman Yonder Alonso . <p> Gray has become an increasingly appealing target for the Yankees over the past several days , with the news that Michael Pineda will be lost for the next calendar year due to Tommy John surgery .

@@37748605 @6748605/ <h> TOPIC : UCONN and US a recurring nightmare ! <p> My hatred for UConn basketball and Jim Calhoun is probably almost equal to my love of St. John 's hoops . I suppose it is because I get this sick feeling of Deja Vu that whenever they do well it seems to coincide with some ominous and strange vibe going on with our program . <p> It was harmless enough in the beginning , UConn 's presence in the Big East as a perennial also ran was a regular thing in the early days of the Conference . Back in the early to mid eighties they played the part of the outclassed opponent to Louie 's powerful teams that were composed of great New York City talent . Our teams regularly made appearances in the NCAA Tournament year after year . They were the annual soft part of our conference schedule .. However in 1986 ( the year after the great Chris Mullin Walter Berry Mark Jackson team made our last run to the final four ) Dom Perno left and Jim Calhoun came in . Soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nineties everything began to shift Louie left and St. John 's regular tourney appearances stopped . Uconn became a regular tournament participant while we sat at home . Finally in 1999 Mike Jarvis with some great recruits from Fran Fraschilla had a team that was going to put St. John 's back on top . Instead Ken Johnson and Ohio State blocked our run to the final four . I then had to watch in horror as UConn led by Rip Hamilton and Kalid El-Amin upset Duke and won their first national championship . <p> We moved in to the next century and five years after UConn 's title our program had hit rock bottom . Mike Jarvis had destroyed the once proud St. John 's Hoop tradition with a unique blend of arrogance and neglect . The scandal at Pittsburgh left us with no scholarship players and an Interim coach and a group of hard trying undermanned walk-ons . We wound up at 6-21 Meanwhile back in Storrs , Emeka Okafor was dominating inside while Ben Gordon ( a player Mike Jarvis passed on for Willie Shaw ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cemented their reputation as a true national power . On the other hand St. John 's had the coming of the Norm Roberts era to look forward to . <p> Fast Forward another seven years later and again we are on the road back ! Norm Roberts had finally left after a six year tenure of mediocrity and now West Coast Steve Lavin was coaching up Norm 's players with style and panache . Eleven Days after the Red Storm blew out a number three ranked Duke team in the Garden , number ten UConn came in to the Garden for a February 10th showdown . St. John 's led by the stellar play of guard Dwight Hardy ran the Huskies out of the building leaving the outclassed UConn team , including star guard Kemba Walker , gasping for oxygen . They are done I proclaim ! ! A month later DJ Kennedy blows out his knee and that same Kemba Walker takes UConn on a wild and insanely improbable ride through both the Big East Tournament and then through the NCAA tournament . Somehow , someway Calhoun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be I ask ? Has this guy sold his soul to the devil ? <p> Moving forward the scales are fortunately tipping back . It appears that the good guys are on the rise again and the bad guys are finally getting what they deserve . Yes UConn has finally been exposed . The school 's basketball program had to be put on Probation for recruiting violations and academic improprieties . Calhoun had to resign and there is a black cloud over the whole program . It will take many years for them to be relevant again I say . Meanwhile Steve Lavin had been bringing St. John 's back to prominence and drawing top talent back to Queens . Finally I think everything is back to where it should be again . <p> Fast forward to March 8th. 2014 . St. John 's goes on the road and wins its regular season finale in a thrilling double overtime victory at Marquette . It is their eleventh victory in the last fourteen games and the season looks like , after a slow start , it could blossom into something special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like a bad CYO team in a 81-48 blowout loss to Louisville . <p> At the end of that March day some believe that St. John 's was poised to go on a run in the Big East Tournament and then make a run in the NCAA 's . Their roster of highly athletic , top rated , talent brought in by master recruiter Steve Lavin had the reputation of potentially being a problematic match up for anyone in the country . UConn despite a couple of good guards was not expected to have much of a postseason . <p> Now four weeks later we know the nightmare continues . The wheels have fallen off the St. John 's bus . A Big East first round bow out to Providence , followed by an ultra embarrassing first round debacle , at home in the NIT , to bottom seeded Robert Morris . This was then followed by seriously troubling roster defections . Now St. John 's future does not look very bright and Steve Lavin 's tenure has come into question . <p> On the other side of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made another improbable run through the NCAA tournament . Their new young and dynamic coach Kevin Ollie ( a Calhoun disciple ) has brought them to their fifth final four in the last fifteen years . Shabazz Napier ( who four years ago as a freshman guard was part of that February 10th UConn blowout loss to St. John 's ) has emulated Kemba Walker and put the Huskies on his back and returned them to the promised land . <p> With the final four yet to be played I must say that I really really hope that UConn does not win another national title . As they thrive , somewhere like Dorian Gray , there is a picture of St. John 's basketball in a closet rotting and withering <p> All very true and well said , however if the shoe was on the other foot and you were a UCONN fan you would be sitting pretty . What they do has nothing to do with St. John 's . They are not even in the league anymore . Johnnie 's are in a tough place right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes adversity will bring out the best . Let 's hope so . <p> It 's not about UConn - its about SJU . Comparing both schools is like comparing Varisty vs . JV . We are a independent catholic commuter school with limited resources and an average scholastic reputation . we have very few alumni who go to games given the size of our alumni base and not enough alumni who have the same pride in their school . Students with connection to the school will support sports programs . Our does n't ... Has n't for a very long time . Perhaps 1 out of 50 graduates care about SJU college BB program . It 's not a nightmare son its reality . <p> ..... They are doing much better than I expected and it seems like Ollie is going to keep them relevant . <p> I am not sure whether the American Athletic Conference will help or hinder Yukon . This season the AAC had Louisville as a billboard program but next year Louisville exits to the ACC and Rutgers exits to the Big Ten and replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The AAC may help Yukon because it should dominate the league of left overs <p> It may hurt Yukon because it will be playing in a basketball conference with a relatively slim television contract against teams outside of its geographical area . <p> Next season the American Athletic Association basketball league will be composed of - - relative basketball irrelevances Central Florida , South Florida , East Carolina , Tulane , and Tulsa with - - sometime relevant Temple , - - new found relevant SMU and - - relevants Cincinnati and Memphis . <p> Who would ever have thought this would be the case sitting pretty as a SJU fan in ' 85/86 . <p> Now Uconn is on top and we 're down there with DePaul , another so called basketball rich tradition school , that has been down for a long time . <p> Let 's hope it changes and soon . <p> I do n't care that Uconn is good ( or for that matter bad , since they are not in our conference anymore ) , but first things first , Calhoun built them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nice job and not too many people thought he could do it . Kudos to them . <p> Let 's get our ship straightened out and headed in the right direction .

Too many Ohio State , Michigan State , Kentucky and Florida--huge rich state schools , argh ! <p> Interesting opening post . It made me wonder if the change in the direction of the two programs coincided with Nadav Henefeld mysteriously ending up at UConn , after being brought to the US , from Israel , to play for the Redmen . Never got the full story on that recruiting loss , which was far more damaging than the Wiggans loss . <p> I 've stated many times I became a fan during the norm years , so can someone please explain to me what the Pittsburg scandal is ?

I 'm certain he was there . <p> Abdul-Jabbar was born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor , Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manhattan in New York City , the only child of Cora Lillian , a department store price checker , and Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor , Sr. , a transit police officer and jazz musician. 12 At birth , he weighed 12 pounds , 10 ounces ( 5.73 kg ) , and was twenty-two-and-a-half inches ( 57.2 cm ) long. 3 He was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended St. Jude School in the Inwood section of Manhattan . Later in life , he converted to Islam. 4 He initially joined the Nation of Islam in 1968 , before retaking the Shahada and converting to Sunni Islam that same summer. 5 <p> From an early age he began his record-breaking basketball accomplishments . In high school , he led Power Memorial Academy to three straight New York City Catholic championships , a 71-game winning streak , and a 79 " 2 overall record. 6 College Lew Alcindor ( Jabbar ) with the reverse two hand dunk . <p> Lew Alcindor played four seasons for the UCLA Bruins ; on the freshman team in 1965-66 and from 1966 " 69 under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of 88 wins and only two losses : one to the University of Houston in which Alcindor had a not fully healed eye injury ( see below ) , and the other to crosstown rival USC who played a " stall game " ( i.e. , there was no shot clock in those days , so a team could hold the ball as long as it wanted before attempting to score ) . <p> Your line " Lew Alcindor played four seasons for the UCLA Bruins ; on the freshman team in 1965-66 and from 1966 " 69 under coach John Wooden " clearly shows that he graduated Power Memorial in 1965 , about which I 'm 100% certain . ( For one thing , when I was a HS freshman , my school 's Mt . St. Michael 's freshmen team won the Catholic city championship , and we all had high hopes for winning future varsity titles . Then , the next year Lew showed up at Power , led them to the freshmen title , and once he joined the varsity in ' 62- ' 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we knew our hopes of a varsity title were crushed . Talk about dominant ! ) Lew 's teammate Jack Bettridge did graduate in 1964 , and the hope was that , in addition to being a major player , he might help lure Lew to St. John 's . Bettridge , who about 6-3 or 6-4 , was good but he never lived up to the coming-from-Power Memorial hype ... and as for Lew following him to St. John 's , the rest is history . <p> Redken has the dates right . When Alcindor was a sophomore at Power Sonny Dove was a senior at St Francis Prep . They met up in the city championships and Sonny took him to school . From Alcindor 's junior year at Power until he graduated UCLA he was the most dominant force in basketball ( The UCLA freshman team beat the varsity in a pre-season pep-rally game when he was on the freshmen team ) . <p> As you would imagine , when he was freshman at UCLA the pre-season basketball magazines ran articles about him . The only pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Houghton was the point guard on Power with Alcindor and was in the background of some of the pictures and he would brag about how he made the magazines . <p> Jack Betridge was another story -- very gritty -- a tough , in-your-face- City kid . <p> The story about Coach Lapchick retiring as being the reason that we did n't get Alcindor is the one that always seemed to be the most often stated over the years ( and on this site ) . I guess we 'll never really know .

If the kids are n't going to put forth the effort , there are no defensive schemes that are going to stop the opposition . <p> And doubt two transfers next season will cure the problem alone , takes commitment and effort across the board . Not looking for a grind it out style approach , but a culture embracing defensive importance , discipline &amp; execution . Yes , team is young and physically overwhelmed most nights , but I sense we will never have the personnel to shoot it out with teams on a nightly basis . To me cheating , looking for steals occasionally bears fruit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; too often a result of guys blowing by defenders . Lastly , open threes seems perpetual problem &amp; big cause of digging early holes . <p> Obviously staff sees this and will hopefully over time get pendulum moving in right direction . It has been a decent season record wise , but a lot of work to be done , as expected in total rebuild . <p> Lack of.leadership has been an issue all year . When things are going great on offense , it masks the problem . But when things are not going well we do n't have one kid on the team that can take the lead and be a calming influence , kick some figurative butt when needed , etc . I 'm hoping and expecting that Clark especially can help fill that void , and possibly Simon as well . Both seem to possess leadership qualities . Time will tell . <p> Its a little hard to criticize Lovett and Ponds for not scoring enough early . They are the only ones who can pass the ball . Earlier in the season Ellison was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is an awkward player at this point . Hopefully next year with Clark and Simon there will be more options . <p> As for Ahmed while his numbers are n't bad his field goal percentage is terrible for a forward and he has to pass the ball more . He has a lot of athleticism but seems to make his shots more difficult with his wild moves . I really hope the coaching staff can get the most out of him next season . <p> I 'm using the same logic with this that I do when I buy my powerball ticket . All I need is a dollar and a dream/quote <p> Have n't hit the powerball maybe because I do n't waste my money . However , just recently hit a jackpot at one of our newest casinos in Arizona .

What did Obama , in 8 years as the 1st President of color do for the plight of primarily black urban dwellers , except make them MORE dependent on government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to the handout lines than he did the plight of marginalized Americans , and I as a WHITE CONSERVATIVE am racist ? Hardly , not at all . Now I cite Obama specifically but the Bushes were just as bad , the Clintons are more a crime family than anything else . Trump was elected to dismantle the totally corrupt swamp that any objective , clear thinking person knows Washington DC to be , not to continue the charade about a " bipartisan " government .

@@37748734 @6748734/ <h> TOPIC : Dr. Richard Lapchick / Basketball HOF / Sept. 6 <p> Johnny , Not disrespecting your point of view in any way , but in my opinion , your observations require perspective with regard to history . John Thompson was a pioneer of sorts in my opinion . His place in the history of college basketball occurred during a period of tremendous social upheaval . As a man in my mid sixties , I remember this game when black players at universities were an exception to the rule , rather than what has become a norm . I watched while places like Kentucky and North Carolina integrated their ball clubs with considerable reluctance . There was racial tension on many campuses . The nation was coming off an era when to be african american , meant being treated differently and with less respect . Black coaches were far and few between . Why would you find it odd and surprising that this large and imposing black coach would find it appropriate to make a statement with regard to being a black man , leading a mostly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport that not that long ago , would have locked him out . History will honor John Thompson ... including his light-hearted attempt at making fun of Coach Carnesecca 's sweater. - <p> Here 's some more interesting stories about Dr. Lapchick . When I was 11 , I moved from north to south Yonkers . I attended sixth grade in the same elementary school as Rich Lapchick . There were two sixth grades and we would trade classrooms for music and art . The first occasion of this change , both classes lined up on opposite walls in the hall . When I looked across at the other class , most of the kids were roughly the same size , but there was one kid who towered by almost a foot over the other kids . That kid was Rich Lapchick . Rich won the foul shooting contest for all six graders that year for the entire city of Yonkers . Since his dad was coach of the NY Knicks at the time and a great player in his own right , everyone was of course predicting a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . We would play basketball in the garage at the Lapchick home . You had to shoot over wooden beams to score . Rich was a wonderkind for the next couple of years and everyone wanted him as the center on their team . After the eighth grade , Rich was rewarded with a basketball scholarship to Manhattan Prep , where he played along side Billy Jones ( who eventually would be a starting 2 guard at St. John 's , but played center for the Prep ) . Bill , at 6 ' 5 " guarded Lou Alcindor ( now Kareeem Abdul Jabbar ) in high school . Anyway , Rich , who was probably 5 ' 10 " in the sixth grade , never grew another inch , and while remaining a fine player , he was always a big man trapped in a guard 's body . Fortunately , Rich 's academic acumen would lead him in a different , but not less important direction . We both eventually attended St. John 's and rode to school together from Yonkers for several years . Rich convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most indebted to him to this day . Many of my lifelong friends have come from that decision , and I still play weekly golf with frat guys . Rich was in my wedding party when I married in 1972 ... I sang at his wedding .. and he remains a close lifelong friend . We 've shared many important life moments together , and his presence in my life has been a blessing of unmeasurable proportions . <p> I respect your opinion doc &amp; I understand the history of racism but when its reversed its just as Evil in my opinion . IAM respectful of the great Hoya turbo defense developed by JTSr - but he did create a intimidating hoya paranoia with its us ag. the white media.His tactics have molded Ewing into unwanted head coach due to Ewings personality not favored by nba owners.Dealing with the media was not a talent JT had &amp; passed onto his players . Louie was a media darling because he respected the job people had to do &amp; that respect was mirrored back to him . JT was jealous of Louies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion . I was a student sitting courtside at that game that was hyped like a Frazier vs Ali " Do the wrong thing " Spike Lee loved those all black Gt teams &amp; I saw him root ag. his NY 's johnny team mixed with white&amp;black players but coached by a white man . When JT coached the 1988 olympic team he chose his point guard from Gt charles smith as the starter which hurt the team bigtime with much better players available . the usa lost to soviets which inspired the dream team. - <p> Every black man that has stood up against racism is accused of being racist himself . It is an easy way to delegitimize his stance . <p> There were vile , racist things said about and to Ewing when he was at G'town . That a coach would shield his players from the press and the public does not make him racist . Picking Charles Smith over better players might make him a " homer " but I do n't see how that makes him racist . If race were the deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . <p> As for Spike Lee , irrespective of what his racial preferences are , the Hoyas were the NY Yankees of college basketball back then . Legions of people who did not have allegiance to a specific team became Georgetown fans . Hoya gear outnumbered St Johns gear 100-1 even in New York in 1985 . <p> Coach Lapchick was the coach , and personal mentor , in my years at StJ . Richard was a fraternity brother , as was his dad ( honorary ) and a classmate in one or two courses . I am personally thrilled with his honor . He is and was a thoughtful and composed individual and a likable chap . I have followed his efforts for opportunity in coaching over the years with a huge rooting interest . As for Coach Thompson , he is a great coach and a great man and , if he had a bias , it was tha same as Richard 's , to provide a fair opportunity to sportsmen of all backgrounds . I saw John play at Providence and in the pros . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played for him against a BE opponent at BC . At the start of the game he walked his team off the floor to the locker and refused to come out until an offenseve handdrawn sign was removed from the crowd . It was a bold move at the time and few coaches would have done that . ( Lapchick would have been one of them read the book LAPCHICK . Most coaches would have told his kids to suck it up and played without comment . Big John did n't and almost all of us learned from it . Some in the audience saw the move as " uppity " and it started a reputation . Anyone who was a real fan applauded the move and began to look to John for leadership in the sport at the college level and he gave it to us . I think he was one of the finest men ever to coach , and I would add , if he found a 7 footer who could play like Ewing and was white , he would play for G'town in a heartbeat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges and a kid who reveled in being the bad guy but we have had a small share of guys who were sort of like that over the years . Thompson is a great man and his son has the makings of being his equal . The only large group of fans I know that dislike Thompson as a group and perpetuate nasty stories about him is the crowd in Syracuse and that 's beccause he kicked theit a$$es on a regular basis and grinned about it on every occasion . Once he even took a bow after being tossed from a game ! He loved to beat them and did it regularly . With us he tasted defeat on occasion but responded with the dignity Looie and the fans gave to him as a winning coach , The game would be enriched with more Lapchicks , Thompson 's , Looies , and Knights ; different styles but great teachers . - <p> - Also does n't hurt JT1 to have passed through the influence of one William Felton Russell and Arnold " Red " Auerbach in regard to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yes , Coach Lapchick 's demeanor going all the way back to the Rens is one of the beacons lighting the way .

@@37748766 @6748766/ <h> TOPIC : Paying College Athletes <p> The idea of paying college athletes a stipend is nothing more than a PR move by the NCAA to divert attention from the corruption that pervades the recruiting process in both basketball and football . I have no problem paying athletes , I support it in theory , but it is not going to change the current corrupt practices one bit , except in the spin coming from the NCAA . The problem is , eventually it will lead to the further demise of less popular sports because down the road some greedy administration is going to decide paying athletes in sports that do n't generate revenue is just bad business and taking money out of their pockets , so bingo , eliminate lacrosse and you 've eliminated the problem . <p> Well the NBA is doing some of that on their own .

Here the government enforces the rule and even abets the practice by providing funding to NCAA universities . <p> the relaity is that most high D1 athletes coming from the poorest areas are black . <p> No . It 's not close to " relaity " : it 's something you made up because you obviously have peculiar views regarding race . Most college athletes are white . There are twice as many poor whites as there are poor blacks . More white children live in poverty than black childen . The vast majority of the poor come from rural communities , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in rural communities . And in urban areas , in the projects you 're bleating about , the majority of the poor are hispanic , not black . Those are the facts . Feel free to choke on them . <p> I 'd love to see study of where these kids are after there playing days are over . A while back , Curtis Redding was a security guard in a dept store . In today 's dollars a kid who leads a team to the Final four , as Redding did , would have made a ton of money for his school - he got nothing but a chance at an education . <p> - <p> Curtis Redding led his team to the final four ? In what sport ? <p> - <p> I was wrong about Curtis Redding , but he did have such a successful freshmen campaign , that he received votes for student government president as a write in .

If the NBA does n't want to use age to discriminate , they can always just do it under some other ruse . <p> - I always found it ironic that the most revered institutions of higher learning are the perpetrators and benefactors of all the abuses of the system . I believe the solution lies in seperating true student athletes from pros in waiting . The universities are the only organizations in a position to police this . If all scholarships were fixed as four year endowments and not replaced when students leave early teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the pack in a heartbeat . Then , the schools with the best graduation rates would be in the final four instead of all the opportunistic cheaters . Of course revenues would plummet but academics would soar . Revenues in the devopmental leagues should climb though and a lot more kids could make a buck playing hoops in the US which is their dream to begin with . The baseball model is much closer to the ideal and a lot of non major leaguers manage to make a living in the process . Of course I 'll hear cries that nobody would pay to see scholar athletes play but I would . At least the very term " scholar athlete " would cease to be the joke it 's become however and I believe that would be a good thing . I 'm going to run and hide now having offered my 2 cents on an issue that really could use a major overhaul . See you at the Gtown ( normally a very respected academic institution ) " game . " - <p> I would like someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race ) that is recruited to play at a D1 school and works 30 to 40 hours per week perfecting the activity the school brought him to do , and is put by the school at an academic disadvantage to other students at the college for example : ( i ) has had his academic schedule managed by the schools academic advisor , ( ii ) had his cpourse schedule and courses taken created toaccommodate practice schedule , ( iii ) has taken a reduced credit load to ensure continued NCAA eligibility preventing graduation until after NCAA eligibility is exhausted - should not get a lousy $175+/- weekly stipend as WAM to assist with purchases of calculators , soda , snacks , ball point pens , note books and other items which any college kid needs but the college can not pay for on his behalf and the athlete has difficulty . <p> Thoughts ? <p> - <p> My thoughts to your three arguments . I really do n't think your first two statements are a negative thing at all . The universities are doing everything in their power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the athletes were the first ones to schedule to make sure they got classes that did n't interfere with practice . I do n't see how they are at a disadvantage when it seems the schools are trying their best to accommodate the student athletes . I would have loved to have just showed up and had my schedule and everything planned/picked out for me . Apparently you never had to go meet with an advisor or professor and ask them for special permission to get into their class or something because it was already full when you tried to schedule it . <p> For your third argument ..... never really heard of anyone taking a reduced workload in order to ensure they maintain their eligibility , but would n't doubt if it does happen . But if it does , is n't that more of the student 's fault ? There are tons of college athletes that are really good on the playing field , and still graduate in 4 years . It happens every year . Hell , there are even students that play sports and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called not being lazy and being willing to put in the time and effort to make it happen . <p> I agree that they need money in order to buy school supplies and have some spending money , but there is zero reason as to why they ca n't get jobs during the summer or their offseason . Look at our basketball team during the summer ( I am assuming that all the players are on campus during the summer ) . I do n't see them taking a full class load during the summer . So they could take a class or two , spend a few hours a day at the gym , and still have time to get a part time job . No one ever said it would be easy , but it is definitely possible . <p> As far as the $175/week stipend . While it would be nice in theory , it could never work . It would cost the universities way too much money , because they would have to pay every single student athlete in the school . You could use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports . However , what constitutes a top sport ? People could say that the obvious top sports are football and basketball . While that may be true for most schools , it is not true for all . Look at Cal-State Fullerton . They are a top baseball team mostly every year , and who knows/cares if they even have a football team . Would you not pay their baseball team because they are n't in one of the two " top " sports . Then you could argue that they should pay the most successful teams and especially the ones that generate the highest revenue . But that wo n't work either . I will use both Michigan and Notre Dame as examples . Their obvious top sports are football and basketball . However , in the world of college hockey , Notre Dame is currently ranked #3 in the country , and Michigan is #15 . So if you go by success , one of either teams ' " top " sport 's athletes would n't be paid . You could go by revenue generated , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the stadiums obviously makes football the highest money maker . Penn State 's Beaver stadium is going to make the school more money than the basketball team 's Bryce Jordan Center . Not because the football team is that much better , but because Beaver Stadium holds 102,000 people compared to the BJC holding like 10,000 . And then how would a school like Penn State explain to their women 's volleyball team ( who had won 4 straight national championships coming into this season and sellout almost every game ) that they are n't being paid , just because they play in a smaller arena . <p> You just ca n't pay some athletes and not others . For what would be the non-paid athletes , it would be like the school is saying that they do n't care about all the time and effort that they are putting into the sport that they love . It 's just not possible . <p> I was wrong about Curtis Redding , but he did have such a successful freshmen campaign , that he received votes for student government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me how you might be privy to Curtis Redding 's electoral status at K State but what 's even less clear its relevance , except as evidence that you do n't know what you 're talking about even as concerns SJ basketball , in which you fancy yourself an expert . <p> &lt;hose&gt; <p> Are you trying to say that the top athletes in NCAA D1 basketball and football are not black ? <p> No . Are you saying that the " top athletes in division 1 basketball and football " fail to graduate college and end up back in " the projects " ? Because most of the top d1 athletes go on to lucrative athletic careers . It 's the sucky ones who do n't . So the top ones are irrelevant as well . <p> I do n't think you know what you are trying to say , actually . <p> I suspect most people know what I 'm saying but since you seem to be having trouble following along I 'll spell it out . I 'm scoffing at your antedeluvian racial attitudes : your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that blacks are ill equipped for college and not intelligent enough to graduate in 6 years with a degree in sports management , like white people ; and that if blacks ca n't make a living at playing basketball their dream is to make $11 hr checking your crotch for explosives at the airport like that character Tyrone or Rastus or whatever that you invented last year when you shared an allegory about wandering around LaGuardia asking random black people if they knew the score of the SJ game and stumbled up Dwight Hardy 's teammate . It 's only a wonder that he was n't noshing on a fried watermelon . <p> ( Since you need a narrator , I 'm finished scoffing at your racial attitudes and will now be moving on to mocking your math . ) <p> Your statistics are percentages and hence they 're meaningless in this context . Consider . There are 10 people , 8 whites and 2 blacks . If 100 percent of the blacks live in poverty , and only 50 percent of whites do , there are 200 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because there 's 4 times fewer blacks : that 's why they 're called a " minority . " <p> The problem for you is that D1 athletes comprise a number , not a percentage . That is , the number of division one athletes is countable : there are 21000 . Eighty percent of whom are white . That means that there are about 4000 black division one athletes total . <p> Now . In the US 75 percent of blacks live above the poverty level , so we can toss them out . 25 percent of 4000 is 1000 , which is therefore the number of black D1 athletes who lived below the poverty level . Of those , " although poverty rates are highest in inner cities , only 23 percent of those in poverty live there . " That means that 75 percent of the remaining 25 percent of poor blacks live in rural areas . Therefore , 25 percent of 25 percent - about 6 percent or 250 actual poor black D1 athletes - live in urban areas , much less in your " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , because its unlikely you understood it the first time . I 'll wait . Tick tock tick tock . Get it now ? The tiny minority of poor blacks who play D1 sports are 4 times more likely to live in a shack in Appalachia than in a Brooklyn tenement . Thus is your rationale for paying college athletes - that they 'll starve to death back in the ghetto otherwise - easily disproven . Most athletes are white ; most athletes come from rural areas ; most black athletes are not poor ; and only a tiny minority of those who are come from the inner city . <p> I do n't know but I see minimum age limits with respect to hiring in some fields . Maybe you can she 'd some light . I remember that one of my colleagues could not practice medicine in NYS until he was 21 even though he had graduated .

Irrespective of making or not making Reid or anyone else 's list , just seems like SJU has made a habit recently of having unconventional staff construction . Former NBA players with no experience at the college level ( Richmond/Martin ) . Former NBA Player Development guys with no experience at the college level ( St. Jean/Hines ) . I do n't think any of these guys even had any formal assistant coaching experience , in the NBA or otherwise . And this was to surround head coaches who had been out of coaching for 7 years and had no college coaching/head coaching experience , so an argument could at least be made that they could benefit from experienced , more traditional staffs . To top that off the two coaches with the most college experience by far ( Slice/Dunlap ) made it all of 3 years combined . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success .

Heck I 've been with my fiancee for 8 years and we only got engaged a month ago . <p> I had the friends get married after college stage ( although they had jobs at the time so that 's different thaan what you are saying is happening now ) <p> This being said prepare for a lot of mi$ery coming up . <p> In order let me show how this is going to cost YOU <p> 1 . Your friends get engaged then decide to throw engagement party ( you will be forking over either cash or buying things where they are registered in order for the priviledge to attend this event ) <p> 2 . You will have a bachelor party to attend ( although I 'd say this one is a very worthwhile expense in your early years but once you go to the one where the girl shoots hard boiled eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way out with a wiffle ball bat it all kind of pales in comparison after that ) <p> 3 . Those same friends then a year later get married ( beyond expensive since this will be a cash only event and you will be paying for 2 people unless you know there will be some hot single girls at the wedding . ) <p> 3.75 If you are in the wedding party you 're renting a tux also ( just buy one now unless you plan on getting fat like us and cant fit into a medium anymore . lol ) - actually scratch that . Each wedding you are going to be getting matching tuxedos for the wedding party so you are screwed no matter what <p> 4 . Then those broke friends of yours will start popping out babies and you are buying presents for them when they are born <p> 5 . Then you are going to have the great pleasure of being single and being invited to the ultimate single guys nightmare . ( The annual kid birthday parties ) . So every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail and slowly opening it with dread wondering whose birthday it is this time . <p> Then you will go buy the gift and show up at this birthday party in the middle of a saturday or sunday afternoon ( most likely hungover ) with some of your friends ( most likely not many because the smart ones who already have kids are smart enough to cancel on the party coming up with the perfect excuse-MY KID DOES NT FEEL WELL ) thus leaving you stuck at this party with a bunch of people you do n't know with a bunch of kids running around with a big purple barney dinosaur singing and the only single girls there are staring you down not because they want to bang you but because they are now trying to figure out if you are the guy who is going to father their future kids . <p> 6 . Then comes marriage problems and now you have to go out with your friends as they do n't  want to stay at home and no matter what day it is as long as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 7 . Then comes the divorce and your friend now really needs to go out all the time ( be prepared to hear about how your friend never wants to get married ever again and just plans on banging every available girl ) <p> 8 . One year later those same friends are all now engaged again and the cycle starts all over again

Why you hating ? <p> Notwithstanding my obvious bias , let me just go on record as saying that if Mussini sticks around , IMO there 's a productive roll on this team for him over the next couple of years . Yes he 'll always have challenges defensively , so the staff will have to figure out how to use him accordingly , but the kid is only half way in to his sophomore year and will continue to grow as a player . He 's got court smarts and obviously can shoot , plus he 's a spirited and unselfish kid who by all accounts is a good teammate and representative of the school . Plenty of high D1 teams have kids with similar skills sets and limitations , and figure out how to find useful rolls for them . Let 's not push him out the door so quickly . <p> It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . With Simon , LoVett or USF kid , Ellison and Ponds , he would be fifth wheel , no ? Still want that dinner though . <p> Yeah , but we may have to go Mexican . lol . Assuming no one leaves , we have same 4 guards + Simon . USF kid likely is n't coming unless Lovett or Ponds ( God forbid ! ) leaves . Therefore same 5 man back court , same make-up with or without USF kid . Ellison and/or Simon can swing some of the time . Plenty of PT for all of them IMO.

Both Temple and West Virginia played in your face man to man defense ; talk about trying to get a shot off without forcing one . Look what happened to Kuric against Kentucky , only got a few shots off . One has to wonder that even if we had the likes of Sampson and Pelle would we still be playing a zone . What a difference man to man defense makes ! <p> This year these guys are learning the intricacies of Dunlap 's various zones . They 'll need to have that base when we get five new guys for ' 12- ' 13 .
