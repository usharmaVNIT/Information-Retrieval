And I wanted to see how it all comes together . After all , I pride myself on being a lover of tequila , but what did I really know about my beloved spirit ? Here 's what I learned , after trying my hand at harvesting , tasting raw ( and roasted ) agave juice and blending my own batch of barrel-aged tequila . <h> Tequila has a sacred and mystical origin story . <p> On our drive from Guadalajara up to the highlands of Arandas , our local guide , Tania Oseguera , explained the history and legend of tequila 's heritage .

The cooked agave smelled sweet , like pumpkin pie , and the natives began eating it and drinking the juice . Once the juice fermented , it took on the alcoholic properties and some might say became even more sacred . Eventually , the Spanish would come and introduce the concept of distilling . <h> It 's strictly regulated . <p> Tequila is a matter of great importance in Mexico , closely linked to the heritage and pride of the country . In order to preserve this legacy , the production of tequila is regulated by the Consejo Regulador del Tequila . They uphold strict standards for production , such as ensuring that all tequila is only made from blue agave , distilled at least twice and bottled in Mexico . <h> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lucha libre show , go .

And agave , like grapes , can be sensitive to the conditions of where it 's growna phenomenon known as terroir in the world of wine . Different growing regions produce different flavor profiles . For example , the highlands of Jalisco , where Cazadores grows their agave , tends to have a slightly cooler climate , which stresses the plants .

The lowlands are drier and a bit warmer , which yields more herbal flavors with a bit more bite . <h> Tequila is one of the world 's most labor intensive spirits to make . <p> An agave plant must grow for six to ten years before it 's ready to be harvested . Then the " pia , " or root bulb of the agave cactus , is shorn of its spiky leaves and cooked . The roasted pias are then juiced and the juice is fermented before being distilled . The tequilas are finished by aging in wooden barrels ; the amount of time aging changes what type of tequila is finally produced .

Slow-roasting the agave is one thing , but what about playing classical music throughout the fermentation process ?

You see , we 've all developed a self-image , an idea of the person we want to be and try to live up to . When we do something wrong or when we fail or are accused of something , it chips away at that beloved self-image . This results in something called cognitive dissonance .

Simply put , metabolism refers to the chemical processes by which your cells produce the substances and energy needed to sustain lifeand the higher it revs , the more energy ( and thus fat and calories ) your body burns . Naturally , it tends to slow as you age . You can also be passed down a less efficient metabolism from a parent . But you can actually trick your body into burning calories more efficiently .

I would save every penny working in high school and college to buy Polo clothing . I read his first book in the ' 80s and that 's what I wanted to be . <p> Faherty <p> It has such a rich history .

I 'll never forget the first time I walked into their Greenwich Avenue store . Blazer striped shaggy shetland sweaters and chambray button downs . Ivy tweeds , and beat up jeans .

And then there was the drive to help build meaning and experience within the brand . We were a diverse group of people working to make one hell of a big movie . <h> Is there a " Ralph Lauren way " of doing things ? <p> Bastian <p> I think it all starts with those massive inspiration boards for every project and season . I definitely bought into that one . First thing we bought for the office here was a huge rolling cork board and a million aluminum push pins . <p> Snyder <p> They call it " rigging . " It 's when you style out a room for mood and color using vintage apparel and inspiration photos . I walked into one of those rooms my first week and was blown away . It sets the whole stage for the collection you 're about to design . <p> The all-important inspiration board <p> Ciongoli <p> I was consistently in awe of their ability to take a single image and use that as a base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brimming with ideas and inspiration . It is a straight forward , concise path for getting from an abstract concept to a final collection . It is hard not to work that way once you have experienced how inspiring a concept rig room can be . <p> Georgiou <p> All the great ideas were anchored in some historical or tangible reference . A great shape from a bygone era . Wonderful interpretations of heritage product . <p> Carleton <p> Creativity was driven by research and reference and then activated by modern terms and conditions . This is exactly how I approach my work todayit 's sort of like being an anthropologist merchant . <p> Goldstein <p> Definitely , the " Ralph way " is to pay attention to every detail and constantly push to do things better and make the best product . <p> Mashburn <p> No shortcuts . No is not an answer , everwe were encouraged to push for ideas and practices that were not accepted in the industry at the time ( early 90s ) . For example , wash standardsno one had ever washed caps or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get-go . At the time it seemed crazy . They were real pioneers in that way . <h> Favorite part of the job ? <p> Muytjens <p> Just the fact that you 're literally surrounded with good taste . It really gave me the opportunity to immerse myself in American history , icons and culture . To have the opportunity to work on the collection and see it come together is like being a part of a really good movie set . <p> Bastian <p> I got to spend my day creating these amazingly detailed worldsit was really more like theater design than retail . <p> Carleton <p> It was fantastic story tellingwriting a narrative that added meaning and context to beautiful products . <p> " <p> I suppose that Ralph helped reveal to me the distinction between ' a job ' and something bigger .

He was the hardest working person I ever met and it was tough to keep up with him . His work ethic brought me to another level . <p> Carleton <p> There was a level of quality and consistency at Ralph Lauren that was a bear to produce . Helping to grow that message at scale was nothing short of difficult . You were n't really allowed to have an " off day " . There was a good dose of healthy self discipline that we needed to have . Or learn quickly ! <p> Faherty <p> Working for the pickiest guys in the worldRalph , and his brother Jerry . But it 's what has made them so successful , that attention to taste and detail . <p> It was a daily competition for outfits . This was well before the Sartorialist or being photographed on the street , and all the creatives dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But on a more serious note , Ralph and Jerry and the team demanded real excellence and the very best from us . It required a lot of hours and total commitmentnot a job for the faint of heart . <p> Ciongoli <p> For me , it was being bound by a single product category . I always knew I wanted to tell a complete story , not solely a single element of one . <h> What 's a lasting memory or lesson that 's stayed with you over the years ? <p> Miller <p> I remember a walk through with Ralph and he randomly picked up a pair of corduroys and hated the quality of the goods . He started ripping into people about keeping the quality up . It was at that meeting that I had a revelationthat he , literally RL the man himselfis responsible for keeping the quality up and that is why his company is still standing while everyone else has sold out or gone out of business . I also learned a lot about how the finance arm of a creative business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it has to answer to shareholders . <p> Ciongoli <p> My former boss ( and longtime mentor ) John Yang taught me that , more than anything , great clothing has a clear purpose , context and sense of history . I remember , shortly after I started , a time when he asked me to design a field jacket . After about an hour of furious drawing , erasing and repeating , I presented him with something I thought looked very cool . We sat down together to review it and the first words out of his mouth were " This is a mess . " Incredulous , I asked why . " Because what you 've drawn comes from nowhere and everywhere at once . The silhouette is obviously based on an L.L. Bean hunting coat , but it 's belted like an international jacket . You reference an M-65 with the collar shape , but it has the pockets of an M-43 . You need to really understand and respect all of these garments and why they were created before you start throwing them all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgiou <p> He definitely taught me that disrupting the process often resulted in a better collection . <p> Spurr <p> One thing that really stuck with me was RL 's focus and attention on building the brand . Designing and manicuring each individual collection each season was important to RL and to us as the design team , but it was the over arching concept of building brand consistency that stuck with me after I left the company . At the time , much of what we did seemed to be so tightly woven into a sort of RL formula , and at times appeared to be a little repetitive . But it was only later that I realized that it is this regimented consistency that has defined RL as one of the greatest icons in men 's fashion and that has significantly contributed to building one of the most powerful and internationally recognized brands in the world . <p> As we were starting RRL , we talked about how we needed to make a very authentic looking jean . One that you could n't tell apart from a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing process in our lab in North Carolina and our production facility in Texas . We developed a double tinting and washing process that produced impressive results . I made a bunch of jeans in different fabrics using this process and was so excited to show them to the team back in New York . We all reviewed them and thought they were greatready to show Ralph . I was 23 years old at this point . We rigged the room with mannequins fully dressed . We put a few in our new jeans and a few in vintage . Once we were ready , I called in Ralph . He looked around and was impressed . He commended me on the work and it was clear we were all happy with the results . But a few weeks later , I got a phone call from Ralph 's office . He wanted to see me in the showroom . When I went into the room , there were a bunch of jeans on the floor and Ralph simply said , " We ca n't launch a new denim line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can do better Eric . " I was devastated and not sure what to do . After much thought , I ended up in an old dry cleaning facility in Kansas City , where we processed leather in the past . I had the idea of running denim jeans in a dry cleaning process to impart colorsomething that was never done before . After many tests and hundreds of jeans later , I had a few that I felt were nice enough to show to Ralph . Once again , I set up the showroom with the new jeans and called him in . He loved it , really loved it this time and a few weeks later , he called me back to his office and said he wanted to patent the process . He felt strongly that we needed to own it and protect it . Well , it 's now registered with the US government as patent #5,653,770 . <p> Carleton <p> I had an inspiring get together with Ralph in his office on a cold , wintry evening on Madison Avenue . His warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He invited me to explore his amazing collection of unique objects , art and curiosities while sharing with me their backgrounds . I realized then that the source of his narrative is based on an authentic connection . His love for history , stories , people and travel is so real . It 's like his life 's work is a montage of his internal passions . His business is the by-product of who he is . Once you engage your inspiration , it becomes an incredible source of motivation . Your work becomes an extension of what you love . I suppose that Ralph helped reveal to me the distinction between " a job " and something bigger . <h> Can the Legacy Continue ? <p> L <p> Last month , Ralph Lauren turned 76 and also announced that he would be ceding the role of chief executive at his company , a role he 'd held for nearly 50 years . Headlines rang out with " end of an era " cries , but the next day he clarified his position with an urgent message for his employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stepping back , " asserted Lauren , who retains roles as executive chairman and chief creative officer . " My passion for beauty , for authenticity , and for creating timeless , classic products that people all over the world want as a part of their lives is what drives me today as much as ever before . As always , each of you plays a role in bringing these dreams to life . Your creativity , hard work and loyalty have always inspired me , and I am excited to continue working with you as we move forward . " So , it sounds like there 's still plenty of lessons to learn from the old guy . And there 's no doubt that the fortunate young men and women currently matriculating at Polo U are taking notes .

There 's always going to be something popping up , making you feel like you could ( or should ) be earning a better salary , spending less or saving more . And then there are all these arbitrary financial rules we 've all heard for years that can make you feel like you 're not handling your money correctly . But , it turns out , not all these mandates are universal . Herewith , five rules you should be breaking . <h> Small purchases are making you broke <p> Picking up a bagel in the morning , an afternoon coffee run or grabbing a drink after work ... no doubt that it all adds up . Do you need them all ? No way . But just like depriving yourself of sweets on a diet , pinching every penny can make you feel pretty bad and eventually lead to a spending binge . Rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past month and prioritize which ones you can cut and which ones bring you joy or pleasure . <h> Buying things on credit is bad <p> Credit cards are not evil . When they are used responsibly , they can actually help you save money . No one knows this better than savvy consumers who pay for goods and services with rewards credit cards . Or those who take advantage of the " no interest " policy on items purchased on a store 's credit card . Plus , according to Beverly Harzog , author of The Debt Escape Plan , they 're vital to building a good credit score . She suggests choosing a card with no annual fees , and only getting a rewards card if you 're sure you can pay off the balance each month ( they typically have higher interest rates ) . <h> Save MoneySave Your Health <p> An easy way to save money is to swap flavored beverages for water .

First of all , personal finance is n't an all-or-nothing practice . And secondly , managing debt is now a fact of modern life . If your debt is relatively low-interest , there are some serious benefits to paying it off more slowly in favor of saving money first ( such as for retirement or major expenses ) . Remember , compound interest has immense value , and the more money you can invest earlier in life , the more you 'll have in the long run and the less money you 'll have to invest overall . And while it can be tempting to forego 401(k) contributions when your paycheck is lean , you 're essentially leaving money on the table and you 'll only have to save more later in life to catch up . <h> Always put away 10% of your income <p> This is a somewhat arbitrary rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach your savings goals . Focus on the amount of money you need saved in the end and work backwards from there .

Online banks offer higher interest rates than standard banksfor example , $3,000 in your account could earn $150 in interest over five years versus the paltry two bucks you 'd get in a typical account . <h> Buying a home is better than renting <p> Owning a home remains the centerpiece of the American dream , even though more American households are renting than buying homes today .

Here are their top five . <h> Rolex Submariner <p> When it comes time to issuing a hat-tip to style , capability or just historical provenance in the world of watches , it just would n't be a proper roundup without some mention of a Rolex Submariner . Sure , it was created in the 1950s for man 's race to the bottom of the sea , and changed only subtly in over fifty years in existence , but Rolex 's adherence to its own traditions by making only incremental improvements has yielded an absolute masterpiece of a modern watch . Perfectly sized at 40mm and dressed to kill in ceramic and 904L stainless steel , today 's Sub is more relevant , more capable and still more wearable than eversinglehandedly writing the book on versatility when it comes to an everyday watch . Now , though there are entire lists dedicated to the greatest Rolex Submariners of all time ( spoiler alert : McQueen 's 5512 takes that cake ) , we 'd recommend starting with a modern no-date variant , for the final word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind 's most arduous test : time . <h> Omega Seamaster <p> If it 's good enough for the world 's most famous agent in Her Majesty 's Secret Service , you can rest assured the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean is more than up to the taskwhether you 're dressed to the nines in bespoke Tom Ford , or dispatching baddies whilst racing a motorcycle across terra cotta rooftops in Istanbul . Do n't let the good looks or lithe silhouette fool you though , the SMPO ( as it is affectionally referred to ) is the quintessential modern tool watch . It 's ridiculously capable , and unafraid of the deep end of the pool , as the helium valve-equipped case ( professional saturation divers , that feature 's for you ) is rated to 600 crushing meters of water resistance-far deeper than any mere mortal might dive . And unlike many of its peers , the SMPO is also available in both 42mm and 45mm ( XL ) diameter variants , ensuring there 's a perfect fit even for wrists that have never once skipped arm day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You never actually own a Patek Philippe , you merely take care of it for the next generation . " It 's not the wrong sentiment by any means . Especially if you 're looking for oneand only onewatch for you , and your lucky next-of-kin to enjoy . Think of it like the Mercedes Benz GL63 ; at the apex of sport luxury , where lines begin to comfortably blur between embellishment and capability . Stuff like applied white gold markers , and over ten times the water resistance of a typical dress watch of this stature , come to mind . Besides sharing a namesake with Jules Verne 's famous submarine , the Nautilus also owes its seafaring proclivities to that unique porthole-shaped bezelan iconic signature inspired by yacht architecture and originally conceived on a paper napkin by famed designer Gerald Genta in 1974 . Together with its unmistakeable textured ' shutter ' dial , the design endures today , as a category-defining hallmark for those seeking a beautiful , heirloom-quality watch built to withstand the rigors of multiple lifetimes of wear . <h> Tudor Heritage Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nice watch " barely ever agree on anything , but the Black Bay by Tudor is that rare exception . Hearkening to an era in the 1970s when a good watch was a diver 's lifelinethe Black Bay is legible , easy to operate and unfailing under pressure . Oh , and versatile above the waterline , though it 's unlikely that the French National Navy divers that once relied upon its source of inspiration would have cared as much about the broad-shouldered stainless steel case , colorful anodized bezel and neatly contrasting gilt dial-classic details that easily transitions between the workplace , the beach and damn-near anywhere between . It 's not difficult to see how the Black Bay fortifies Tudor 's position as one of the most compelling propositions in watchmaking , because here we have a sport watch that 's not only handsome and historically significant , but one that 's also markedly accessible , making it an easy choice for just about anyone . <h> Cartier Santos <p> In a way , the Santos is to the dress watch as the Submariner is to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved species of a purpose-built vintage classic . Except where the Submariner 's history started more recently around the middle of the century , the Santos took flight at the height of the industrial revolutionborn out of necessity for pioneering aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont , who requested a durable and legible watch to be custom-built for him by Louis Cartier . A century later , the Santos still exhibits the bold opaline white dial beset with thick roman numerals , contrasting blued handset and strong art deco lines of the original-all signatures that go from business to casual as effortlessly as putting the top down on a Citroen DS convertible . Wearing one is joining the ranks of guys like Cary Grant , Warren Beatty and Sammy Davis Jr. , who all understood that there are some rarefied periods in history that just got it right the first time .

Heed this advice and you wo n't ever find yourself pissing off the boss , annoying your colleagues or buried under the weight of a reply-all email chain . <p> A good email is brief . <p> More and more people are reading e-mail on the go . Last year , nearly 68 percent of emails were opened on a mobile device . Which means that all the important information in your e-mail should be visible in one smartphone screen , which displays about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get everything you need to say into that 100-word threshold , or feel that you need to add in a lot of extra explanations to subtle ideas , that 's a good signal that you should pick up the phone and call . <p> Try to curb the fake enthusiasm . <p> Just like the article we referenced before , you do n't need a lot of forced pleasantries to start and end your emails . You do n't need to add in unnecessary emojis ( especially when you 're not sure if the person you 're emailing with is an " emoji person " ) . You do n't have to be curtstarting out with a friendly " Hi " will suffice . And there 's a whole movement against disingenuous sign-offs like " best " and " warmest regards . " Experts now agree that you can simply end your emails without a sign-off . <h> Email Is Not Dead <p> There are over 4.35 billion email accounts . This figure is predicted to reach 5.59 billion by 2019 , which is a growth of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to receive . Which is why you should n't underestimate the significance of a descriptive subject line , says David McDowell , who served nearly a decade as a Yahoo ! Mail VP . He suggests letting the recipient know what is expected of them by including such phrases as " Heads Up " or " Action Requested " right there in the subject line . The more specific , the better . For instance , when e-mailing a resume , he advises writing " McDowell Resume for Manager Position " in the subject line instead of simply " Resume . " <p> There 's a right way to make introductions . <p> Just dropping into someone 's inbox trying to play matchmaker is n't the way to do it . Before you email , ask both parties if they 're comfortable with an email intro . If you asked for the email intro , make sure to reply quickly , thanking the person who introduced you . Then make sure you remove the introducer from the email chain so they do n't have to be privy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be a dick with your out-of-office reply . <p> We get it , you 're going to be unable to get back to us , so letting us know is a good idea . So is including specific information about when you 'll return and whom to contact in your absence . What 's not necessary is a humblebrag about where you 'll be vacationing or an attempt at humor . The joke might be funny once , but if your coworkers have to copy you on communication , that gets old really fast . Also , most e-mail clients have the ability to tailor an out-of-office reply based on the sender , which can come in handy providing the right level of detail to various contacts . <p> And watch the reply-all . <p> This one 's an amateur move , but we can all make the mistake of absent-mindedly replying to everyone on a mass email . No one wants that , and you 'll find yourself getting all sorts of " I did n't need to get this " replies as you enter Email Chain Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email , always remember to check that cc field before hitting send . <h> Email Is Not Dead <p> There are over 4.35 billion email accounts .

You hand over your hard-earned money for a quality cut , cook it with the best intentions and a trusted recipe . But when you cut into it , you 're confronted with a dry , tough , grey-ish slab that ca n't be saved by even the best steak sauce . Thankfully , there 's a way to cook steak at home that delivers steakhouse quality results every time . It 's called the reverse sear and it 's deceptively simple . <p> It starts by roasting the steaks on a low heat to get the desired doneness , then searing it on a hot grill or skillet to achieve that deliciously crisp , smokey crust .

And it 's not just for amateur cooks either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my steaks , " says grill master Kevin Ward of Atlanta 's Four 41 South BBQ Co .

Sure , this method requires a meat thermometer , but it 's an affordable tool that will continue to prove its worth . Other than that , all you need is some salt and pepperbecause steaks this good require little else . Now get cooking . <h> Technique <p> Place your steaks on a rimmed baking sheet fitted with a rack . Season generously with salt and pepper . <p> Roast in the oven for 40 minutes to 1 hour , until an instant-read thermometer reads 125F for medium rare , 135F for medium . <p> Take the steaks out and let them rest for five minutes , while heating up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast iron skillet or grill is extremely hot , add a tablespoon of oil and sear steaks one to two minutes per side , until a dark brown crust forms . <p> Let rest another five minutes under foil , then slice and serve . <h> Take it to the Next Level <p> Ward suggests searing your steaks in bacon grease to add a subtle depth of flavor to your steaks .

You 're better off brushing your meats and vegetables directly with oil just before you put them onto the grill . <p> 4 <h> Waiting for YourSteak to Warm <p> We often hear about letting your meat come to room temperature before cooking it , but when it comes to grilling steaks , that can easily lead to dry , overcooked meat . " Cooking with cold steaks allows you to control the temperature more , resulting in a perfectly cooked steak , " says Michael Lomonaco , chef and managing partner at Porter House New York .

He might 've just cut into one of the steaks to see if they were done . Most chefs do n't use thermometers either . They prefer to poke the meat because they know how a rare and a medium rare steak feels . But you 're likely not that experienced . And cutting into your meat is a rookie move . Simply stick it with a meat thermometer .

A Harvard study of more than 60,000 dieters found those who cut back on bread , pasta and starches lost more weight than those who simply cut back on fat and calories .
