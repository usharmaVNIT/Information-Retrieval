I-ll post my data in a few days . <p> WEEKEND WOBBLE DATA Hello everyone , Torsten . Here is my weekend wobble data . We are using life360 which is an app that allows one to keep track of family members . It tells you when they leave home and when they arrive . The idea was to monitor a family member and see if life360 reports the person leaving home when they are actually home sleeping . This did happen three times this weekend and here is the data . <p> Sat Sept. 3 , 2016 1:53 am-9:38 pm home 9:58 pm-10:13 pm left home . <p> Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday 2:23 am-5:08 am home 5:28 am-5:43 am left home <p> All of the " left home " were to the same address and roughly 12 hours apart . We were all at home and no one left . This could coincide with the earth wobble where the gps for life360 was unable to keep up with the earth wobble . I will keep monitoring the data to see if it is consistent with the earth wobble for my area . Life360 sounds an alarm when a family member leaves or arrives home but the times that it reports for a person leaving and returning home depend on Internet connection so my times might not be exact as I was in a remote area . With a good Internet connection and the gps running , it might be possible to detect greater earth wobbles way before they affect an area .

@@36454325 @5454325/ <h> Determine Your Safe Locations - 7 Steps <p> Step 1 is to research your location in the Safe Locations information ( http : **36;309;TOOLONG ) on the ZetaTalk website . In this you should examine not only your country , your state or province , or your city but also any nearby . Your specific town may not be covered but the whole river valley may be predicted to flood and to flood permanently . This would be a clue that your specific town will be likewise affected . We can not and have not addressed every spot on Earth , due to time and energy constraints , as we expect you to have a brain and take this approach . <p> Step 2 is to research your location from the standpoint of the climate that will exist after the pole shift . This is quickly ascertained by looking at the New Geology map . This is a free map which can be cut out and taped together and will give a general idea of the latitude to expect . If your chosen location is where one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you need to rethink or plan a migration route . This is likewise the case if your chosen location will be on land that will sink below the waves entirely , such as India or western Australia . <p> Step 3 is to research your elevation above sea level . A handy and free tool is Google Earth ( http : **33;347;TOOLONG ) which can be downloaded into a PC and will show the exact elevation of any spot the cursor passes over . HeyWhatsThat- is a website that provides you with a color coded map based on a changing elevation . Our advice to be 100 miles from a coastline and 200 feet above sea level to avoid the coastal tidal waves during the pole shift should be applied . You can determine your current elevation and whether your location will be 675 feet above sea level where the water will rise within 2 years after the pole shift . A rough guide in this matter is the map Nancy created . <p> Step 4 is to determine the effect if you are in one of those regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be below the waves as of the time of the pole shift , and being pushed down before the pole shift . Japan gains 150 feet , New Zealand gains 500 feet and eastern Australia benefits also , Spain loses 50 feet , western UK loses 150 feet , New England gains 450 feet due to the Seaway rip , Florida loses 150 feet , and Vancouver Island gains 100 feet . <p> Step 5 is to research the effect of swollen rivers which will likely be in a backwash during the pole shift . We have stated that ALL rivers will be over their banks , so the worst possible scenario should be assumed . What will happen if the river can not drain ? Despite having a good sea level elevation , any land that does not have an advantage of being at least 200 feet in elevation over a major river bottom in the vicinity is likely to be flooded . A backwash from the main river in your vicinity should be assumed , so that creeks will not drain , for instance . Water on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scours , and will undercut the soil under buildings so they will tilt and tumble . Being on solid rock that will not melt in this scenario is advised . Tidal bore along cliffs facing the ocean can likewise have water climbing up , or funneled up by ravines which will direct water all the way to Guadalajara from the Pacific , for example . Think this through , for your location , and be on the safe side . <p> Step 6 is to examine your volcanic or geographic risk due to mountain building . We have advised a 100 mile radius from all volcanoes that have been active within the last 10,000 years , and that Yellowstone will not become a super volcano . You can determine if the new westerly winds will blow volcanic ash in your direction . Consider that what was formerly north will now be west or east . Fire storms , though extremely rare , almost always occur near erupting volcanoes during the hour of the pole shift . We have advised that if in areas subject to mountain building that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive , and newly fractured rock is a clue that more of the same might be expected . Older mountains as the Alps and Appalachians are considered safe , where the Sierras and Andes are building . <p> Step 7 is to ascertain if you need a migration route . It is possible to survive the pole shift by avoiding tidal waves and staying outside of structures that will crush you , but to be in a position to be flooded within 2 years after the pole shift . Siberia is a case in point . Here the land is so low in elevation that vast swaths of land will be flooded , and survivors must plan to migrate on foot or via boat .

The Council of Worlds , who oversees the Awakening , must first determine the spiritual orientation of the transforming world . This is determined based on polling the entities that emerged on the world scheduled for harvest . Next , having made this determination , the Council decides what type of intelligent species will serve as physical bodies during incarnations . This determination waits on the determination as to orientation , as entities in the Service-to-Self and Service-to-Other have different requirements . For instance , the Service-to-Self want little telepathy and the Service-to-Others ca n't get enough . Next , and last , the schedule is determined . <p> The Transformation , and the Awakening that precede it , is paced to be in sync @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth , this means that the Awakening can not proceed too fast , so as to tilt the spiritual orientation mix toward the Service-to-Self . Fear and anxiety so tilt this mix , as the fearful and anxious seldom think of others , so the Awakening is paced so as not to heighten these emotions . The Transformation is not dependent on the Awakening , however , but is rather dependent on the spiritual mix of the entities incarnated or awaiting incarnation on Earth . When this reaches approximately 89% operating in the Service-to-Others orientation , the Transformation to 4th Density , in the physical sense , will occur . The Transformation to spiritual 4th Density , in effect , has already occurred by that time. - - http : **32;588;TOOLONG <p> No matter how bad things get , possibly bold help will be generously provided by Service to Other ETs , but such assistance is based on spiritual orientation . <p> The issue of who will be assisted during the pole shift and in the Aftertime , and to what degree , is a very complicated issue .

This occurs whether these humans are acquainted with ourselves or the hybrids or not . In the grip of horror , and at the point of death , the shock of encountering a Zeta or a hybrid is the lesser issue , and they are rescued with relief , not an increase in anxiety , as the result . Eventually all these adults and children will be involved in outreach activites , after the pole shift , in essence no different than if they had remained in human society . <p> Where the Element of Doubt is not an issue , and the area is controlled by those in the Service-to-Other , alien assistance may be bold and wide spread , moving beyond the mere delivery of perpetual batteries and the like .

Those who do not qualify for assistance are endlessly trying to maneuver so they can benefit . They will try to capture and cling to Service-to-Other survivors , thinking this will force aliens to assist the whole community . In that those in the Service-to-Self do not judge Service-to-Other motives well , they are most likely to have captured bragging claimants instead , those who loudly proclaim themselves to be Service-to-Other when they are quite definitely undecided at best . They may also try to keep a watchful eye on developing Service-to-Other communities , thinking to invade them when alien assistance has arrived . None of these maneuvers will work , as their plans are not secret when telepathy tells us of the plans as they are hatched. - http : **36;622;TOOLONG <p> The ZetaTalk message contains hope and , for goodhearted souls , some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of service to other souls , both native and from elsewhere. - You are- not- alone . <p> This is a- fait accompli- the power and wealthy elite ( with their primitive technology and precarious , destructive civilization ) would be wise to accept . <p> ZetaTalk : Meaning of Life- ( written Oct 15 , 1995 ) <p> Humans , unsure of an afterlife and without proof that reincarnation exists , often wonder what the point of it all is .

In situations where 3rd Density entities are told the outcome of their decisions they almost invariably announce they are Service-to-Other , when in fact they are dithering between the orientations and have n't decided . Then hypocrisy sets in as self-centered motives are masked , and when the entity can not deny to themselves that they are acting with self-centered motives they may abandon the effort altogether in self-defeating rebellion . When unaware , they are more honest with themselves , ponder the results of actions and how they feel about this more openly , try various alternatives more playfully , and in general proceed with the business at hand in a more genuine manner . <p> During the Transformation few entities complete their 3rd Density lesson under the duress of the rapid pace of change .

@@36454344 @5454344/ <h> Mangled Magnetosphere <p> " This series of BATSRUS images shows complete confusion and discombobulation in the Earth 's magnetosphere . In essence , it has no magnetosphere , as from the time when the magnetons leave the N Pole and attempt to form into magnetic field lines they are tossed about like flotsam on the waves or birds in a hurricane . They appear scrambled due to conflicting assaults and directives . The Sun is still the dominant magnet and in those rare times when its voice can be heard , holds sway . Then Nibiru 's voice is heard , coming from the side and slightly toward the Sun , pushing the Earth into a daily wobble and also twisting the Earth 's magnetic field . <p> " The scrambled confusion seen in these BATSRUS images are due to the electro-magnetic charge in the tail of Nibiru , which is increasingly wrapping around the Earth and thus , surrounding the Earth . This is the source of the increasing EMP affecting mankind 's electronics . No longer evident only when an airliner goes off radar or crashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tracks , it has become an almost daily interference for many with their household appliances , cell phones , and Internet connections full of static or malfunctioning . <p> " Where is this leading ? Even after the full truth about Nibiru is revealed to the public , excuses will reign . Just as the Sun was blamed for any EMP in the past , it will continue to be painted as the demon . NASA may even display old images of the Sun to use as props for these lies . Meanwhile the public will find their electronics erratic , so that they only work well at certain times of the day or night , or burn out and have to be replaced too frequently . Communications will be quick and to the point , and the postal service may find long letters to loved ones in the mail back in fashion .

This tumbling action keeps the Earth and the other planets caught in the eddy flow from leaving this trap. - That an eddy flow of magnetons has formed behind the Earth , for the first time , shows that the blast coming from Planet X is stronger , covering a vast area around the Earth , so these magnetons have no escape ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first minor eddy was observed within Earth 's magnetosphere in November 2010 , magnetospheric turbulence has increased in severity and regularity. - Once again , what was a rare magnetospheric anomaly has become a frequent occurrence . <p> " The Earth 's magnetic field is regularly deformed by the Solar Wind coming from the Sun , from the right . But what would deform the Sun 's magnetic field ? We have described the time of the Pole Shift as one during which Planet X could so supplant the Sun 's magnetic influence on the Earth that Planet X , aka Nibiru , is the only voice the Earth hears .

NC was already high on my radar and hand picked spots all over New England had also been high on my radar. - A lot of hard work in the research department went into finding the right spot. - There 's so many things to consider that a regular real estate search does n't include . Do gas pipelines run through a community , nuclear facilities in the area . flooding and landslide history , the lay of the land , etc . <p> I found a cottage on a knoll with an acre and a half that had a gravity fed water system in place which means that my water graciously comes from a mountain spring head about a mile and 1/2 up from my home , goes into a cement cistern about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed into my basement holding tank via 2 " black poly pipe that has been insulated all the way up to the cistern . I 've had a blockage in the water lines twice in five years and had to use a gas power washer to flush the system from the cistern way up in the forest . I 'm not sure how I 'll get that done after the shift when I have no gas . I 'll probably have to cut the line and let it work its way out however long that takes and use connectors and clamps to re-attach the poly pipe . <p> As for my septic which will be useless when full , I have a camp porta potty I 'll use like a composting toilet with some tweaking . <p> . <p> When we experience the great mag 9 quakes , my creek bed may move , the cistern may crack , my spring head might be lost but if you understand how these things work then you can re-apply them . <p> I collect water runoff- from a pipe that was sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I 'll use extensively when I build a greenhouse nearby . Mountain water is very cold and plants tend to like lukewarm water . <p> I have a claw foot tub as a water trough but the goats do n't drink from it . They much prefer to jump in and out of it when it 's empty so it will be better used up at my house for my makeshift wood fired hot tub after the shift . Just raise it up on a few cinder blocks , dig a hole underneath and lay your firewood. - A hot bath under the stars . <p> I did a 4 year rent to own on a 10 x 20 Mennonite shed which I turned into a barn , using a steel gate as a divider to create stalls . The steel was my final aha moment because just using wood as a stall divider did n't work out at all and I 've had to rebuild the stalls 3 times . The buck has smashed and flattened the steel now so when I 'm forced to replace it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't bash through. - They 've broken all the windows in the barn while rough housing so I would have been better off taking out all the glass immediately . I use plastic to cover the windows in winter but I 'd like to build outdoor shutters with a latch for a more permanent fix to keep inclement weather and the cold out . <p> In this picture you can see the- smashed metal of their stall divider . <p> I knew that I wanted goats and chickens so fencing the property was my first priority . I originally put in 800 feet of fencing with paid help and about $3000 thinking I had done a good job but now I have about 1500 ' of fence in areas that I needed to keep the goats from like all my basement windows which now have shredded screens from their curiosity . Goats are curious about everything which is adorable so you have to stay one step ahead in the " What could possibly go wrong " arena . I have a giant pet door that leads to my basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use and have found all my goats in there on several occasions , getting into all the feed and making a huge mess . They also use their lips to turn door handles and unlatch gates . <p> I started out with 2 goats that were 3 weeks apart in age . I bought them home when they were 3 months old and they were about the size of a medium sized dog . They 're now the size of a pony . A gorgeous cashmere ( Kashmir ) buck for fiber and a Saanen goat for milk . I researched for months before I chose my flock . We had one Great Pyrenees ( Wolfgang ) which would be the flock guardian and he and the buck ( Benjamin ) became best buds until the buck grew enormous Ram like horns and nearly impaled the dog during play . When goats play they stand up and then ram their opponent with their heads down so their horns can lock . This was becoming very dangerous . <p> Benjamin <p> More fencing was needed to separate the dog from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog to keep a watchful eye . Next came a full time buddy for the dog ; another Great Pyrenees ( Alice ) who 's a rescue . Wolfgang is in charge of keeping everyone safe and he takes his job very seriously. - Also Great Pyr 's eat very little for their massive size . I feed them 2 cups of food each twice a day . In the summer they eat less and drink more . <p> Wolfgang <p> My Saanen goat ( Lacey ) was disbudded at birth which meant her horns were taken out . All goats have horns which I did n't know at the time . They are as strong as a horse and they can knock down fencing in the blink of an eye which they 've done time and time again . Last year ( 2016 ) a neighbor and I ran railroad ties along the bottom of all the perimeter fencing as the goats would tag team their escape by horns used to lift the bottom of the fence or rip a fence seam and then use mass weight to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence but so far so good . It seems to be working . <p> What I wish I knew up front was that goats have some weird Houdini gene and they always seem to want everything on the other side of the fence . Planning out every portion of fencing beforehand is important . <p> My point is , do it right the 1st time . I 've spent around $8k putting up 1500 ' of fencing when It could have been closer to $6500 had I done it right the 1st time . Your fencing is your big ticket item . Make it strong and impassable . Had I had the time to scout out used fencing and timbers , I could have saved 1000 's . <p> Keep in mind that you need a safe access to your barn without fear of being knocked down in their frenzy for food . I had n't thought about that and will have to add an additional fence and gate soon for my safety . Right now I feed the buck through the farthest end of the gate so he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn with the rest of the food raised above my head . They will knock you down to get at that food . Also make sure your mower or tractor can fit through all gates . I made the mistake of putting in a standard gate at the front of my property and I ca n't fit through with my ride on so need to use a push mower there . That will be moot after the shift once you 've run out of gas unless you can run it on vegetable oil so I have an old fashioned human powered push mower and a 4 foot sickle with a 26 " blade . I have many files on hand to sharpen blades . <p> Up at the front of my house I have an additional picket fence that surrounds all my garden beds and fruit trees but the goats were knocking down a picket everyday and amazingly squeezing through into the garden and eating everything . I 've since lined the pickets with chicken wire . Problem solved . <p> One year I put in 2 rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buck used his horns to disconnect the shock system and it was a waste of time and money plus there wo n't be any electric after the shift and any solar panels you have would be better served elsewhere . Goats are like dogs and they will stay close to home . I do let them out of the pasture whenever I 'm mucking stalls and they do n't travel more than a couple hundred feet off the property . I call them and they happily come home . <p> My fence was made from heavy duty chicken wire from Tractor Supply and 6 ' T-posts and landscape timbers . Every 8 feet stands either a wooden timber or a metal T post as this was most cost effective . I can fence an entire property on my own now when I knew nothing at all about it before . Learn by doing is how I roll . The wooden posts were set in cement for stability . I own a few post hole diggers and a heavy metal post driver . I have plenty of nails , u-nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a year and I had my 1st set of twins . I learned to cut the cord and clean off the baby which is n't necessary as momma would learn to chew it off and lick it off . Goats are sometimes born with worms which can kill them so the vet was called out and wormed everyone . I did everything right that 1st birth but looking into natural remedies for these things is a must because we wo n't have access to meds in the aftertime . I 've lost 2 babies since then to worms and a broken neck as I no longer call the vet out and I just let nature take its course . The strong will survive . <p> As for milking , goats wo n't produce enough milk for both babies and you till the 2nd or even 3rd year but you 'll know when it 's time for you to take milk . I milk twice a day to ease her pain when she 's engorged but it was like coralling a bull . She does n't like the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat and the milk stand I bought was too high for her to jump when engorged so I have to build a ramp for her . One of us held her down in a corner while the other did the milking . <p> Cows are much easier to milk I think . To hand milk , it is a squeeze turn pull motion that hurts my arthritic hands so I was so happy to find a clever milker with attached 2 qt. bottle . She gave me roughly a gallon of milk morning and night but I could have taken more . That 's just one goat so that 's amazing . That 's 14 gallons of milk in a week until it starts to taper down after a couple of weeks . Good for butter , cheese , soap . I have books to teach me how . <p> I sell off the babies twice a year at 3-5 months . I have a momma and baby now that will leave the farm by summer and my neighbor is eager to have them as he 's in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 4 goats on the property and I spend about $40 a month on pellets ( 100 plus pounds ) and feed them only 2 cups each in the evening and another $25 a month for their bedding which is pine shavings . Good ole dirt will have to do after the shift . Babies try to mimic eating pellets but do n't really start to eat until they 're about 4 months when milking stops . Daily grazing is all they need . Goat poop looks like rabbit poop and at first I tried to scoop it out like a in a cat box but that grows old real fast and now I wait till their stalls are nasty before I muck them out . During the winter I just add more shavings over the nastiness as it keeps them warmer then if I had mucked and added fresh shavings . It 's a huge chore in spring to muck out the stalls but I have a garden trailer hitched to my ride on mower and I make about a dozen trips to my composting pile which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goat and chicken poop needs to dry for a year before you can add it to garden soil . It 's amazing what rich beautiful soil it creates along with salad scraps , eggshells and tea and coffee grinds . <p> Goats do n't eat everything like some joke about . Mine refused to eat apples 1st time I gave it to them . They have to acquire a taste for new things . They snub what they do n't like . I recently found out they love honeydew rinds . They refuse to eat corn husks and do n't care much for corn cobs which surprised me but I already know they love pumpkin skins so I 'll make sure to grow enough as the dogs love pumpkin too and I add it to their food often . I have n't put in a grain garden yet since a neighbor helping out when I was sick , mowed over my newly planted corn field thinking it was weeds . I 'm planning on corn and barley or oats . <p> After I had the goat thing figured out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coop on the property . Once again I had to build fencing around the coop because the goats would break the lock and knock down the door to get to the feed . A friend built me a new stronger coop door . <p> I raised 6 chicks from a local store in a large tupperware in my guest room <p> and as soon as they were able to fly out of the tupperware it was time to put them out . Turns out I had 4 roosters and 2 hens and I still have n't figured out how to sex them properly . I 've been through a couple dozen chickens since then before I settled on keeping 2 wonderful hens who give me great big brown eggs . I had wanted to keep a rooster to have babies but roosters can turn mean sometimes and dangerous too so I 've banned them from my farm for now after too many altercations- with a garbage can lid and a whip. - I know I 'll need one after the shift but I can ask for one of my neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing population . The hens are easy keepers and have loads of personality. - They free range the property and are happy birds . They love the dogs and spend most days up at my front porch looking for leftover dog food scraps and bugs . I 'm blessed with beautiful soil so there 's worms aplenty . I 'd like 1/2 dozen more egg producing hens . Some hens just do n't produce and will end up on the dinner table . <p> I 'm planning on getting guinea fowl this year because they eat ticks like crazy and they keep snakes away which is a problem here in the mountains . Two years ago both my dog and cat were bitten by a copperhead . What I learned from that experience is most poisonous snakes will not completely venomate unless they plan to eat their prey . It 's the bite itself that becomes infected with trace venom and if you can live through the first 24 hours you 'll make it . I now own a snake bite kit . It should be in everyone 's bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can knock a hawk out of the air like ninjas . They tend to roost regally in trees , are very noisy and I heard they 're hard to keep in a coop but that 's ok . I have lots of trees , no snakes or ticks makes me happy and my neighbors are used to the farm noises already . <p> This is where I do all my reading , thinking and planning . <p> This year I 'll be making a few bat houses with my grandson to keep the mosquito population down . <p> I ca n't afford to pay someone to mow and weed whack so I 'm doing all that now too . - There 's always a solution to every problem . <p> I have a 100 gallon water tank out there now for an additional garden . <p> This year I 'll re-plant the grapes , peaches , pears and apple trees that the goats ruined last year . Fig trees and nut trees are next . <p> I 'll start my seeds tomorrow and am looking forward to growing the seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll try to grow lemons from seed this year but they need to be soaked and bagged for at least 10 days till they sprout . I get lots of hot sun at the front of my house and think I could get lemons to grow . We 'll see . I have a fig tree that will get potted this weekend . I ca n't plant anything in the ground because of the animals so growing dwarf varieties in large pots will suit me and I would love to reestablish a vineyard which was once here but with no one caring for them for many years they toppled over and died from the weight. - I 'll have to research the proper way to start a hobby vineyard and you guessed it . I 'll need to fence it . <p> Every little experience is rewarding when you have determination and the creative skills to get things done . <p> Many a night I cried myself to sleep because every inch of me hurt and I 'm so tired .

While many grow to be enormous in the wild and are native to perpetually sunny conditions , there are a number of dwarf plants that will do just fine " and even fruit ! " in a big pot in your living room . Proper care and conditions ( and a reliable nursery for sourcing them ! ) are extra important if you want an indoor fruit tree to prosper , but with freshly grown produce is the goal ( and no garden required ) , we have confidence in your drive . Here 's a primer on fruit trees that you can grow indoors . <h> 1 . Figs <h> Fruit ? <p> If you want a fig tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which wo n't even consider it . Instead choose a small cultivar like Brown Turkey ( also known as Negro Largo or Aubique Noire ) , which tolerates heavy pruning , is self-pollinating , and can thrive indoors . They 'll sprout pretty oblong leaves . <h> Planting &amp; Care <p> The size of the pot you choose will factor into how large and productive your tree becomes ( opt for a larger planter for more fruit , smaller if you need the fig tree to stay small ) . Water it about once a week , until it comes out of the drainage holes , and prune when it reaches the size you want . <h> Habitat <p> While inedible fig trees do fine in indirect sunlight , edible cultivars will need to be positioned in bright light " right in line with a northern exposure would be ideal . They do n't like the cold at all , so keep away from drafty doors and windows . <h> 2 . Lemons &amp; 3 . Limes <h> Fruit ? <p> If you want to grow lemons and limes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Meyer Lemon ( which does n't require as much heat to ripen the fruit ) or Kaffir Lime ; they 'll yield the quickest crop and the plant will stay a manageable size . <h> Planting &amp; Care <p> The best soil for growing healthy citrus trees is slightly acidic and loam-based ( meaning 2:2:1 sand to silt to clay ) . They also like lots of moisture in the air " up to 50% humidity , ideally ! " but you can simulate that environment by spritzing them regularly with water from a spray bottle . Let the soil fully dry out before watering . <h> Habitat <p> No surprise here : Citrus plants need a whole lot of sunlight " 8 to 12 hours of it every day . Place your tree in the sunniest spot you have " better yet if it 's a room with double exposure ( southern and eastern , say ) . And if you have any outdoor space , they 'd appreciate a few months in the fresh air if you have a balmy summer . <h> 4 . Olives <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can produce as many as 20 pounds of fruit a year ) , olive trees do not require much care compared to other fruit trees . When shopping for an indoor olive tree , keep in mind that many cultivars are purely ornamental , meaning they wo n't fruit , but there are great indoor varieties that will : Consider an Arbequina " which is slow-growing and will drip water through the leaves ( called " weeping " ) " or a Picholine , which is more upright . <h> Planting &amp; Care <h> Habitat <p> An olive tree needs at least 6 hours of solid sunlight each day . Place it near a sunny , south-facing window ( but not too close or the leaves will frizzle ) . <h> 5 . Avocados <p> Fruit ? <p> To be clear , it 's very very tough to get an indoor avocado tree to fruit but it is n't impossible . Instead of growing one from a seed ( that is , the pit " see above left ) , seek out a grafted starter plant that has some tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small trees " like Wurtz , Gwen , and Whitsell " are your best bet , and they do n't have to be cross-pollinated to fruit . <h> Planting &amp; Care <p> Add some sand to the bottom of a pot and fill in with regular potting mix so your tree does n't get wet feet , and water it regularly without letting the soil get sopping wet . Ripe fruit can be left hanging on the tree for a few weeks . <h> Habitat <p> Warm-season plants , avocados like lots of bright light . Right in line with a south-facing window is your best shot at finding it a happy place ! <h> 6 . Bananas <h> Fruit ? <p> Some banana trees produce edible fruit while others produce fruit you ca n't eat " and again you 'll want to get a dwarf plant " such as Super Dwarf Cavendish or Dwarf Red " so that it does n't grow too huge . They 're self-fruitful , meaning they do n't require a pollinator . <h> Planting &amp; Care <p> Your banana tree 's soil should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing strong . They like lots of water due to their enormous leaves , but you 'll want to let the soil dry out fully between waterings . The leaves can be misted to simulate a humid climate . <h> Habitat <p> Lots of bright indirect sunlight is best , so set it up near a southern-facing exposure if possible . Rotate the plant periodically so that all sides get light . <h> 7 . Mulberries <h> Fruit ? <p> Yet again , you 'll want to opt for a dwarf mulberry tree such as Dwarf Everbearing if you 're growing it indoors . The fruit of a mulberry tree , which will look something like a blackberry but smaller , should be picked as soon as it 's ripe " and the tree 's fruit supply will ripen over time rather than all at once . <h> Planting &amp; Care <p> Regular potting soil works fine , as will regular watering ! Mulberry trees are slow-growing and like roomy pots . <h> Habitat <p> A warm , bright , sunny space is best for your mulberry tree ; move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , if possible .

@@36454358 @5454358/ <h> EMP caused by Planet X <p> How will the damage from electro-magnetic pulse caused by Planet X differ from that caused by the solar flares or lightning man is familiar with ? As we have often mentioned , man is only aware of a few sub-atomic particle flows , less than 1/1000 of those known to the Zetas . Thus our explanation can not be given by citing only those particles known to man . It is more than electro-magnetic flows that are generated . It is more than the flow of electrons in space , what has been termed recently in your media as Dark Lightning . We explained at the start of the ZetaTalk saga that the path lightning takes is laid out and readied by other particles , similar to electrons , else how did the electrons find their way ? - <p> The Earth is currently in the grip of two magnetic fields " the Sun 's dominant field and the approaching field of Planet X. The Earth stands upright in side-by-side alignment with the Sun , but Planet X attempts to accommodate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present is causing it to point its magnetic N Pole outward toward the Earth . This can be seen in the dramatic Red Filter photos Alberto takes , where Planet X , to the right , blows its charged tail across the face of the Sun so the Moon Swirls cluster at the left of the Sun . The magnetic field of Earth has increasingly skewed during this blast so that the Earth 's magnetic N Pole has been pushed to Siberia , and the Earth into a more exaggerated wobble. - <p> As man is aware , electrons and magnetons like to flow together . This is the reason an electrical field can be generated by rapid movement around a magnet . By blasting the Earth from the side , Planet X is creating hot spots where magnetons are crowded , and this attracts electrons to those hot spots . When rock is under pressure , there is also an electric screech that alarms animals in the area and creates static on nearby radios , as water within the rock can conduct electricity more readily when the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic hot spot forms over rock under pressure , - which the bending Sunda Plate endures , which happens to be under water , a known electric current conductor ? The crowded electro-magnetic field will ground , and the electronics in the hapless plane in its path silenced. - <p> An electromagnetic pulse " EMP , is an intense burst of electromagnetic energy- caused by an abrupt , rapid acceleration of charged particles , usually electrons. - An EMP can contain elements of energy over a large part of the electromagnetic- spectrum , from very-low-frequency radio , to ultraviolet , wavelengths . <p> A typical example is a lightning strike that produces a localized EMP . As the- lightning makes contact , it can direct a large electrical current in nearby- wires . A single current surge can damage sensitive electronic circuitry , such as- wires and connection contained in computers and ancillary equipment . <p> By definition , an explosion results from the very rapid release of a large- amount of energy within a limited space . This definition applies to a lightning- strike , a conventional explosive like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the energy produced by any one of these explosions results from different means .

Gamma ray bursts can have harmful or destructive effects on life . Considering the universe as a whole , the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution suggests that life as we know it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies . All GRBs observed to date have occurred well outside the Milky Way galaxy and have been harmless to Earth . Currently , orbiting satellites detect on average approximately one GRB per day . Earth 's atmosphere is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays , so these types of radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself . The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level , lasting from less than a second to tens of seconds . The long term effects from a nearby burst are more dangerous . Gamma rays cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving oxygen and nitrogen molecules , creating first nitrogen oxide then nitrogen dioxide gas . The nitrogen oxides cause dangerous effects on three levels . First , they deplete ozone , with models showing a possible global reduction of 25-35% , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would last for years . This reduction is enough to cause a dangerously elevated UV index at the surface . Secondly , the nitrogen oxides cause photochemical smog , which darkens the sky and blocks out parts of the sunlight spectrum . This would affect photosynthesis , but models show only about a 1% reduction of the total sunlight spectrum , lasting a few years . However , the smog could potentially cause a cooling effect on Earth 's climate , producing a " cosmic winter " ( similar to an impact winter , but without an impact ) , but only if it occurs simultaneously with a global climate instability . Thirdly , the elevated nitrogen levels in the atmosphere would wash out and produce nitric acid rain . Nitric acid is toxic to a variety of organisms , including amphibian life , but models show that it can not reach levels that would cause a serious global effect . The nitrates might in fact be of benefit to some plants . GRBs close enough to affect life in some way might occur once every five million years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth began . <p> Of course a Gamma Ray event did not cause the 2004 Ache earthquake , as the Gamma Rays were received long after the earthquake . Nor have such light shows caused any impact on Earth in the past . Distant Gamma Ray bursts are recorded daily by Earth satellites . They are common ! The theoretical- impact where such an outburst is received on the surface of the Earth is a slight increase in UV , lasting less than a second . This is hypothesized to decrease Ozone at the point of impact also , reducing sunlight received by 1% in that locale . There are also beneficial results from an increase in nitrates in rain. - <p> All in all , a Gamma Ray event is nothing more than a light show for astronomers , the man on the street and life on Earth blissfully unaware that it is going on . So why the fuss ? Why the attempt by some to attach a cause and effect to a Gamma Ray event in 2004 to the huge Ache earthquake ? - Just as the- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life into- #HillaryClinton , just so the #NeverNibiru crowd will not die easily . They will now claim that any new earthquakes are due to this December 26 , 2016 Gamma Ray event. - <p> Based on the fervent effort to provide- alternative- reasons for the Earth changes , we can presume that the truth about Nibiru is about to burst forth . Earthquakes have been increasing in magnitude and frequency lately , and despite the reduction in published and admitted magnitude by more than two full magnitude points , and despite the tsunami buoys being desensitized or turned off , and despite the live seismographs being so desensitized they are practically dead " the public is becoming aware that the plates are moving . Cracks appear , water mains burst , bridges and buildings drop , yet all are ignored or denied. - <p> The elite have much to gain from the cover-up over Nibiru continuing. - Their reasons for starting the cover-up have not changed .

The Zetas have predicted that one or more of these scenarios will occur before the end of 2010 , but until this past week have not stated which event could be anticipated to come first . They have not sequenced them . Previously , the had described the folding of the Mariana Trench against the Philippine Plate , which likewise will tilt and fold against Indonesia . This area of the Ring of Fire will be folding like a deck of playing cards being swept up and gathered up off a table top . <p> **30;874;TOOLONG is the pressure from the Pacific that is the issue , as the Pacific is compressing .

Imagine the domino effect of the Mariana Trench folding against the Philippine Plate , tipping this sideways to drive the western edge under the tongue holding Indonesia , which is at the same time breaking and bending to subduct under the curve of the Indo-Australian Plate . <p> The Zeta sequence is as follows : ( 1 ) a tipping Indo-Australia Plate with ( 2 ) Indonesia sinking , <p> ( 3 ) a folding Pacific allowing ( 4 ) S America to roll , <p> ( 5 ) a tearing of the south Atlantic Rift allowing ( 6 ) Africa to roll and ( 7 ) the floor of the Mediterranean to drop , <p> ( 8 ) great quakes in Japan followed by ( 9 ) the New Madrid adjustment , <p> ( 10 ) which is followed almost instantly by the tearing of the north Atlantic Rift with consequent European tsunami . <p> **32;906;TOOLONG 7 of 10 scenarios describe plate movements , and for this to occur something has to release the deadlock , the current stalemate where the plates are locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plates start moving , sliding past each other , new points where the plates are locked against each other develop , but these are weaker locks than the one at present . The current lock , as we have so often stated , is the Indo-Australian Plate which is being driven under the Himalayans . This is no small lock , as the height of the Himalayans attests . Nevertheless , the activity in this region shows this likely to be the first of the 7 of 10 scenarios to manifest . Bangladesh is sinking and the Coral Sea is rising , showing the overall tipping of the Indo-Australian Plate . Now Pakistan is sinking and not draining its floods as it should , while Jakarta on the tongue of Indonesia is also sinking rapidly , showing that the tilt that will allow Indonesia to sink has already started . <p> Meanwhile , S America is showing signs of a roll to the west . Explosions on islands just to the north of the S American Plate occurred recently , on Bonaire and Trinidad-Tobago , and the Andes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indo-Australia Plate lifts and slides , this allows the Pacific plates to shift west , which allows S America to shift west also . This is greatly increased by the folding of the Mariana Trench and the Philippine Plate . But it is the Indo-Australian Plate that gives way to incite change in these other plates , and this is what is manifesting now to those closely following the changes . Once the folding of the Pacific has occurred , Japan has been destabilized . We are not allowed to give a time frame for any of these plate movements , but would point out that it is not until the North Island of Japan experiences its strong quakes that a tsunami causing sloshing near Victoria occurs . There are clues that the New Madrid will be next . <p> Where the N American continent is under great stress , it has not slipped because it is held in place on both sides . The Pacific side holds due to subduction friction along the San Andreas , and the Atlantic side holds due to the Atlantic Rift 's reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S America rolls , almost in step with the folding Pacific , it tears the Atlantic Rift on the southern side . This allows Africa freedom to move and it rolls too , dropping the Mediterranean floor above Algeria . What is holding the N American continent together has thus eased , so that when the Japan adjustments are made , there is less holding the N American continent in place than before , and the New Madrid gives way . We are also not allowed to provide the time frame between the Japan quakes and New Madrid . Other than the relationship in time between the New Madrid and the European tsunami , no time frame can be given . The sequence of events is , thus : <p> a tipping Indo-Australia Plate with Indonesia sinking , <p> a folding Pacific allowing S America to roll , <p> a tearing of the south Atlantic Rift allowing Africa to roll and the floor of the Mediterranean to drop , <p> great quakes in Japan followed by the New Madrid adjustment , <p> which is followed almost instantly by the tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> You need to be a member of Earth Changes and the Pole Shift to add comments ! <p> Due to the rise in sea level to 675 feet within two years after the pole shift , the N American continent will appear to be two separate land masses in the future . The 7 of 10 will not effect this change , but will tear most bridges on the Mississippi River when the New Madrid adjusts . This will of course affect travel and distribution of goods , but in that the Mississippi employs barges , a workaround will be arranged quickly enough . But after the pole shift the eastern half of the continent will certainly be more isolated . Travel across the widened seaway by boat , across the flooded Mississippi Valley by barge , and by foot through the swampy land of what is now northern Illinois will certainly be possible .

Nor did they include the tsunami that large quakes in Japan always involve , which we have recently stated could be considered to be as high as 150 feet for the South Island quakes . After the New Madrid adjusts the West Coast adjusts , as we have stated . We have not detailed this , as compared to the New Madrid this is minor . All the fault lines closely watched on the West Coast will adjust , the volcanoes nervously watched will erupt , and certainly the waters off the coast will be choppy if not generating some minor tsunami during the plate adjustments .

Where in human society education is viewed as preparation for life , when young , and retraining for an occupation or to a minor degree self improvement , when grown , the Zeta have a different attitude . Self improvement is at the fore , always . The young Zetas finds themselves in a smorgasbord of stimulation , surrounded by toys and games that allow their curious minds to fully explore physics , chemistry , biology , and the social studies . Unlike human schools for their youngsters , where physics and chemistry experimentation is limited to lab time or simplistic at-home experiments , the Zeta youngster is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require the youngsters to be a certain age or grade before they have an opportunity .

Johnny gets to organize the field trip because the teacher likes his engaging smile . Zeta youngsters are counseled when they are having difficulty , and given assistance to a degree that would astonish humans , when in need , but the roles they assume in play are self chosen , and when they succeed at these roles it is based on honest interaction between the youngsters .

In the Service-to-Other camp , being happy in one 's work is an automatic outcome , as one chooses one 's tasks , and thus this is without resentment . As to joy , there is always joy at doing for others , at feeling important for their welfare , and seeing what comes about because of one 's efforts . Service-to-Others is not a grim dedication to tasks , with no time out for exploration , no music or presentation of arts and theater , no fancy meals , and no luxurious baths .

We are portrayed as emotionless , as we are disciplined and fail to react when humans attempt to provoke us , feeling helpless in our grasp and desiring some kind of satisfaction .

Humans should realize that when they meet with us , or are attended by us , that we are at work . Do humans dance when at work ? <p> - What do they do for entertainment and relaxation ? <p> - <p> We , the Zetas , have the same range of activities that humans do . Why would we not ? It 's true we do n't go out to eat as much , and with our muted sexuality we do n't look forward to getting laid . But where you look forward to occasionally getting into a hot tub , our refreshment baths are a big deal .

Where the game involves mental concentration , the goal is to improve upon and practice strategic planning . Where the game involves cooperation among players , the goal is to improve social skills and cooperation . Where the game involves close timing and precision from the team , the goal is to gain skill at delegation and rapid hand-offs . Watch children intent at play . Are they not preparing for life ? <p> - And the arts ?

The means of travel is not what humans assume , propulsion . Humans use propulsion . As humans can only move by a snails pace unless they are propelled , they assume that interstellar travel is by propulsion . It is not , it is by attraction , and a quick kiss it is .

Children are not allowed into the computer room , nor into the Air Traffic Control tower .

Gravity particles exist in the space within this barrier or tube , but only create their own gravity dance among themselves - not enough time or quantity to coalesce a gravitational giant . <p> And what is this barrier ? It is composed of gravity particles themselves , glued with an overabundance of another particle it does interact with , unlike the majority of sub-atomic particles which interact with gravity particles only in a mechanical manner . Does this not produce a situation where the space or tube might become permanent ? There is a time factor , such that we must continually reproduce a space for our craft to hover , and quickly use the tube arranged for instant space travel . The barrier degrades , in a wink , equalizing into the surrounding area where it was gathered to be the glue . You can equate this to your use of electricity , where it dissipates quickly into becoming electrons behaving normally in the surrounding matter as soon as interference by man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time travel ? <p> - <p> The Council of Worlds strictly administers time travel , as should one go back in time and really work at it , changes would begin to appear .

This confusion can be settled if one understands that the Earth is not having visitors from the future , no matter how this may have been stated . The future has not been written . You are writing it now , moment by moment , decision by decision . Travel back in time is done for such matters as capturing genetic material long lost , for instance . Future travel is done only to coordinate activities of contactees and ourselves , where one has to be , as you say , in two places at once . <p> - Are Zetas service-to-self or service-to others ? <p> - <p> We are Service-to-Other Zetas .

We utterly trust each other . <p> - <p> Of course there is a degree of selfishness in the Service-to-Other . If there were not , chaos would reign . Service-to-Others is defined as being at least as concerned about others as about the self . An even split . Of course , there are degrees , where some individuals almost never consider themselves , and others often . And then , just as with your society , the point where selfishness turns on differs among individuals . One would think nothing of sharing a garment with another , but insists on maintaining a small horde of food , as this individual experienced starvation in its past and has yet to recover from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fall back at all though times are lean , but insists that their wardrobe not be shared as they are vain of their appearance and have taken special care to enhance this . All intelligent species , when in a Service-to-Others group , display a self interest that maintains the individual . Without this self interest , as an integral part of the species , the species would not have survived throughout evolution . <p> - How does Zetas society operates without money ? <p> - <p> For simplicity 's sake , you can consider we operate as though everyone were a charity case . We will be explicit . The apple grower , when in need of some item other than the apples he grows , simply goes and takes them . Likewise , others simply come and take apples , as needed . If there are too few apples , then there is distress communicated telepathically and a meeting of the group is called , or perhaps the issue has come up during the regular meetings . As there is distress , others in the group weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discuss alternatives . Essentially , someone who may be on sabbatical in order to devote to learning may cut this short to assist , or someone who has taken responsibility for doing laundry may find they have extra time on their hands , and volunteer . Or , it may be that in weighing the activities of all , the conclusion of the group is that apples are of less importance , and an agreement is reached to parse the existing supply out more carefully . In this way , money is replaced by communication and cooperation , and this works just fine . <p> - Do Zetas keep secrets among themselves ? <p> - <p> In Service-to-Others there are no secrets . This is primarily because of the spiritual orientation , where there is great concern for others . As this agenda does not need to be hidden , we are open about our motives . Secondarily , there are no secrets because telepathic ability is vastly increased . One 's thoughts are read by and known to the others as quickly as they are entertained . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain of one becomes the pain of all . Communication is greatly enhanced by telepathy also . No need for the phone , no need to write notes , no silent suffering . <p> - Are there any pros and cons for Zetas being so telepathic ? <p> - <p> Telepathy is a curse for the Service-to-Self , and an advantage to the Service-to-Others . Being only vaguely aware of telepathic qualities , humans wonder . Those humans with telepathic abilities relay that this is a mixed blessing for humans . They can become distracted at unwelcome times . They can become aware of the emotional tone of another , as well as the thoughts , even though this may not be desired . However , for the Service-to-Other entity , who desires to know where the others are , this is not a burden . Annoying emotion , such as rage or loss of control , is not present . What is present is valid concerns about the needs of the group , and information on joint projects . Think of team work , in your present human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal .

This made the headlines before the alien presence became an increasing threat to the establishment , and thus was reported as relayed by the contactee , and not as wished by the spin doctors . Thus , what was reported stands as true facts and not a distortion . This couple was chosen specifically for this contact , which we in the Service-to-Others orientation anticipated would get reported and reported faithfully . The accurate depiction of the constellations allowed a curious mankind to correctly identify our star system of origin . Thus , the name Zeta was ascribed to us , to which we willingly answer . <p> - Why are the Zetas here ? <p> - <p> Issues of the coming pole shift , of the ecology , of nuclear disarmament or how many years the Sun has until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers mankind .

We are not only volunteers , we are extremely dedicated volunteers , as we all went in with our eyes open . <p> Does Zetas know what is the end of our universe ? <p> - <p> The vast Universe , which so intrigues man , has mysteries seemingly out of the reach of man .

Does the Universe have physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to know . To us , with our instruments and in our travels , it appears to be boundless .

We too use probes , set to take their measures and return . This is the manner by which your Solar System was located , not by us , but by others . If the probe returns with data that indicates an environment that would be poisonous or quickly fatal , we do not , understandably , explore that part of the Universe . Different sections of the Universe have different compositions . By this we mean the elements are found in different proportions and the resultant chemical reactions that ensue therefore have different characteristics . Some worlds have silicon based life . Some suns emit radiation that is poisonous to us and would be to you also . Those environments contain severe dangers , as silicon based microbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defense against . <p> Beyond some simple statements , we are not at liberty to explain the Universe to humans , as we are restrained by the Rule of Non-Interference and also by our ignorance . For you , it seems that the Universe is limitless , and boundless , and is not an illusion . So be it , as for you that is a reality and in particular the reality which you must live in . It is also the reality which we , the Zetas , must live in , and in truth we do not know that much more about the functioning of the Universe than you do . The Universe holds secrets that we are not allowed to know at this time , at our stage of spiritual growth . These questions must go unanswered , for the time being . <p> - Does zetas have any religions ? <p> - <p> Regarding religion . We have a religion . In fact , everyone does . Even those who profess not to have a religion have a religion in their protestations . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the Universe . We are emotionally connected to the Universe . We are within the One . We have kinship with one another as parts of the One . We have reverence for the Universe and its workings , as a thing of beauty which we wish to understand . Each soul is in the hand of God , within God , to our way of thinking , and thus needs no intermediary . We , the Zetas , do not impose schedules on when God will be present , or we should all gather and listen to someone interpret God 's words and thoughts for us . Each is left to his own communications , which needs no other intermediary . <p> Our religion is not like the major religions of the Earth , which deify entities human in appearance . These religions , where the message given to humans was to draw them to the light , have been corrupted over time by the forces of darkness . These religions preach against knowledge , against self initiative , against free thought . They restrain with rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human religions , however well founded , have invariably been twisted by the Service-to-Self crowd until they have lost all semblance of the original intent , our faith is not so affected . The pure adage to Love thy Neighbor as Thyself stands as the rule by which we guide ourselves , and there are no Thou Shalt Not 's included . Where human religions , having been infiltrated with the structure the Service-to-Self crowd feels comfortable with , have pomp and ceremony and severe strictures for evading the controls , we have no ceremony to express our faith . Was it not Jesus who said , insofar as ye love the least amongst you , so ye love me , or words to that effect ? Jesus was relaying a true Service-to-Other philosophy of faith , as we believe that each of us , the least included , represents a part of God , is included in God 's plan , and is God 's handiwork . Where we are not much clearer than you are on what God is , this is our faith . <p> Neanderthal Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his concurrence , into a later form of man . The start of genetic engineering goes back many multiples of the step back to Neanderthal Man . Tiny apes were changed to make them larger , to make various parts of the brain expand , to make them dextrous , more adventurous , etc . These were stages and steps , in each case . At each stage , the specimen was placed back on the Earth to see how it fared , whether the experiment worked or was tinkering required . In most cases , tinkering was required . Should every change be tried at once , there would be a muddle and a mess . The specimen would fail , and die . So changes are done in stages . <p> What mankind calls the Missing Link will not be located as genetic engineering often took place in tiny labs , islands where those being engineered would not escape and breed with species or individuals not selected for breeding . If one wants to develop a line of thoroughbred horses , one does not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduces the stallion of choice , and subsequently selects offspring of choice for the next round . Bluntly speaking , when one is trying to increase the IQ of an ape , and does not wish to spend eternity on a world doing so , one takes such steps . Thus , leaps , or missing links , are often on islands that may have been washed over by great waves during subsequent cataclysms , or even gone under the waves and be ocean bottom now . <p> Originally , as a result of numerous genetic engineering efforts , the six races were what we will term Northern White Man , African Black Man , China Man , Indonesian Man , Gypsy Man , and Angola Man . Angola Man has not survived , passing early and leaving no genetic mark . Angola Man was not black at all , but pale to the point of being bluish . This color was due to the transparency of the skin , which gave the oxygen depleted veins and capillaries on the surface dominance in setting the color tone . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with hair , fine , short , and laying flat . This was not thick enough to be called fur , but should we have chosen to call the original races by their appearance , rather than point of origin , we would have called him Fuzzy Man . Angola Man was the least aggressive of the six races , and this is in no small degree why he passed early , leaving none of his genetic heritage in the vast billions that swarm the surface of the earth today . Angola Man literally allowed an attacker to overtake him while making neither a move to escape or to defend himself . He was eaten , regularly , until gone . <p> Indonesian Man in the pure form also died out , but through casual encounters with Gypsy Man merged into what we will call Polynesian Man . The Australian Aborigines also can point to Indonesian Man for a large portion of their genetic heritage , being , like the new Polynesian Man , a combination of Gypsy Man and Indonesian Man , with the addition of some Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled with a small band to that part of the world . As an oddity , and tall in stature compared to their tallest warrior , he was treated as a god and given all the women they could muster . He considered this a pleasant retirement . Indonesian Man was short and stocky , with a rounded belly . He had a dominant forehead which protruded out over his eye sockets , giving him the natural equivalent of shades . He was not swift , but moved in a ponderous manner , and thus his demise . He could not run for safety or rescue others quickly , and his lack of agility and rounded shape prevented him from taking to the trees or cliffs for safety . Indonesian Man had what we might describe as a stubborn rage that when lit would not soon quell . Where he stood to fight , and won some , he was invariably bested by large predators . He too was eaten , irregularly , until gone . <p> Gypsy Man , as the name implied , moved about . His descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Arab countries , and , of course , in the Gypsies themselves . Gypsy Man was slight , and slid from confrontation , a factor of his hominoid genetics as well as the root ape , which took to the trees to escape and confronted only when escape was not possible . He learned to plot evasion rather than employ confrontation . This legacy can be seen today in the Gypsies , who disappear in the night , the Arabs , who likewise fold their tents and slip away , and the Hindus , who actively work at evading reality through meditation when they are forced to stick in one place and can find no escape . The hominoid contribution to Gypsy Man was Pleiadean , so a gentle , nonconfrontational nature compounded the desire to evade conflict . It is not by accident that Ghandi was able to sell the masses in India on passive resistance . It came naturally to them . <p> Northern White Man first emerged in a climate that was not at that time cold , nor was it even in Europe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desserts of Africa , and migrated across the Mediterranean , which in those days was not the water barrier it is today . White Man were few at first , a few hundred , and migrated in different directions . Some took a loop south , along the southern edges of what is now the Mediterranean , which in those days was a swamp , and then looped north and east . This band is seen in the large noble noses of the Turks , Afghans , and Italians . The band that headed straight north is seen in those with light hair and fine features . However all are from the same stock . Where White Man entered the world in temperate climes , bad weather descended during a subsequent pole shift and survival became a game not easily won . Warm clothing needed to be constructed and fur bearing animals trapped or hunted down with the least amount of effort . Survival required plotting and planning , and White Man found his stock being shaped in this manner , so that the clever planner survived . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are innovative and industrialized , and at the forefront of technology developments . Of the races that survived , White Man had the hottest temper . Quick , flashy , but quickly cooled . The root ape for White Man defended itself by a loud bluster , shrieking and hopping up and down . You 've heard the expression , hopping mad , and this is where it comes from . White Man , even today , blusters and bluffs more than he engages . <p> African Black Man also underwent a shock to his system , but not because of climate changes . During the pole shifts the dice did not toss a pole into Africa , but the effects of winds and rain patterns brought dessert conditions . The particular hominoid stock forming Black Man emerged from a portion of the Family of Man that relied on physical skills and social harmony , and this was the legacy Black Man carried when the dessert descended , creeping over his hunting lands until there was less and less to share . Black Man adapted by broadening his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see this in the tradition of the extended family in most black communities . Black Man 's inheritance was a combination of a benevolent large ape which spent a good part of its time basking in groups . Like the Elephant Seal , this ape had no natural enemies , so the population was held in check by surges in the food supply . Sometimes plenty , sometimes dearth . No need to fight , as there was nothing to fight over . Larger family circles translated to forced civility for longer periods . Those able to suppress their irritability until they could release away from home were kept in the band , and the others expelled where they did not survive to reproduce . Black on black violence occurs , but seldom inside the family circle . <p> China Man was developed to offset the ruthlessness of the inhabitants of Planet X , who interbred with humans during their mining operations . The Oriental is slight , and given to ponder and consider the feelings of many before proceeding . It was foreseen that Earth 's humanity would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate Earthling was the target , and China Man was engineered accordingly . The hominoid stock used to build China Man was from those least likely to be impulsive , where deliberation brought rewards and had thus been selected for survival during evolution . In addition , a different ape was chosen as the base , one with a placid nature , where the apes selected for the other races did not have this quality at the fore . These qualities can be seen today in the descendants of China Man , who consult with one another , proceed only when there is consensus , and succeed best at those endeavors that require group dedication . <p> Reincarnation occurs because birthing envoys , gather up the soul after death and discuss the entities progress and growth . You may think of this as a school conference if you wish , where the young soul and its guides have a conference with the birthing envoys . The lessons to be learned are formulated , with the most pressing lesson taking priority . In this the young soul itself has little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their curriculum . Many call this karma , where what one did in a past life comes back to haunt one . The young soul can not end an incarnation , except through death or the temporary vacating of the physical body during Out-Of-Body experiences . Some souls require fewer incarnations . The key is whether the lesson to be learned has been sufficiently learned . In some cases an incarnation will generate more lessons to be learned than it resolved . The soul moves backwards , so to speak . <p> Tapping past lives is much in vogue , especially in California . Since the proposition can not be disproved , the claimant 's wax poetic . All the past lives are invariably romantic or impressive - they lived in interesting times , in elegant surroundings , and were always hale and hearty , intelligent , and attractive . Although the vast number of past lives on Earth were marked by struggle for health , with broken teeth , missing or maimed limbs , and the health problems that plague mankind today present in the extreme - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even vibrant health . Where all but perhaps 5% of the world 's populace is of average or dull intelligence , the past lives claimed invariably involve stations in life which would require a relatively high IQ . And where most of mankind 's history has gone down ignominiously and unrecorded , past lives published seem to all be placed smack in the center of either momentous historical times or well-recorded historical times . <p> What is going on here ? Are these past lives remembered simply fiction or are the memories selective ? Humans delving into their past lives face many hurtles . Past lives are a leap into history recorded nowhere on Earth - living conditions , cultures and traditions , and physical appearance all beyond the imagination of humans alive today . A past life spent as a cave-man , where the diet consisted of bugs and worms and even on desperate occasions of the feces of herbivores , would not be remembered . Thus , past lives remembered do tend to fit into written history . Add to this selective memory the human tendency to deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behaved atrociously would likely not be given center stage , and past lives are pruned and amended by humans remembering them just as they have selective memory about their current incarnation . <p> Past lives are most often remembered by subtle message the soul gives to the current incarnation , the body . If the soul is strongly into integrating , fixing past mistakes , it may be firm during these messages , so the human has no rest until they are in sync and with the program . It is during such incarnation that humans report they have uncovered past lives . But unless such a situation exists , mediating and begging the soul to play out in full color and sound and fury the interesting past lives is not honored . The soul considers this idle curiosity on the part of the human , who is treated not as an equal during incarnation . Thus , such attempts , where not called for , are futile . Thus , humans seeking to reconstruct their past lives are fighting an uphill battle , and will never get close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many intelligent species . In fact , all , where the capacity to inflict injury and , in effect , take one 's enemy out of the arena exists . Where entities seek dominance over each other , violence exists . Another factor of violence is that it is often a necessary ingredient for primitive life . Depending on the environment , violent tendencies may in fact be crucial to survival . Your Earth was such an environment . During genetic engineering projects in the past , those intelligent species developed without violent tendencies did not survive and flourish . On the contrary , they died out . <p> What is violence , and the tendency to use violence , and why was this a necessary ingredient in the past ? First off , species eat each other . As has been often stated , the species on your planet generally use fight or flight when confronted with this possibility . Where it is assumed that these two reactions differ , they have more in common than not . Adrenaline surges , the heart beating wildly and all thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestion or favoring an injury , put aside . If it is determined that fight is not possible , flight or its variant , playing dead , will be set into motion . In flight the adrenaline is put to good use in pumping legs and frantically scrambling arms . If it appears that escape is not possible , then a last attempt at deflecting the attack is tried - playing dead , or otherwise appearing as an undesirable morsel to the attacker . Thus , defecation and fainting may ensue . <p> Now , if fighting off the attack is possible , then a different set of staged defenses ensues . First , the defensive posture , where the body is fluffed up to appear larger or weapons such as teeth and claws are flashed . The defensive posture is quite familiar to humans , as the stiff legged circling , with neck hair fluffed and lips curled back over teeth , is seen frequently in canine pets . Humans recognize this in themselves . The refusal to sit down in a relaxed posture when in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck , and not wanting the enemy to one 's back . The sneer , attributed to arrogance , is in fact equivalent to curling the lips back over teeth in preparation for a fight . <p> Next , if the defensive posture does not succeed in deflecting the attack , taking the offensive in a parry is undertaken . The element of surprise is used as much as possible . Thus , the defensive posture is dropped and replaced with what is termed blind rage . The one under attack is now the attacker . Savage fury is unfurled . Everything in sight is devastated , without remorse or hesitation . When this defensive posture is completed , with the defendant finally spent , the attack will have either been deflected or the outcome of the battle will be in the other direction . One becomes a meal . Blind furry is seen in canine pets frequently , although it goes by different names . Humans assume their guard dogs are the aggressors , when the exact opposite is in force . The vast amount of violence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers dash their crying babies against the walls . A distressing situation that can not be dealt with in any other way may result in blind rage . <p> The fight or flight mechanism is not , however , the source of the violence that distresses students of human society . Regimented or ritualized violence is the horror . Soldiers marched off to war , where they are set against each other like pit bulls , forced into defensive postures against each other . Kill or be killed , not because the soldiers personally have any interest in this activity , but because elites at a distance desire territory or power . Individuals savaged as examples to others , such as the flaming tires placed around the necks of blacks in South Africa by other blacks . The message is cooperate with the whites and this is what will happen . Regimented or ritualized violence occurs because humans are intelligent enough to use the fight or flight mechanism to their advantage , quite outside of the original setting . Is one about to be eaten during territorial disputes ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the situation , or by those who hope to be in control , more often . <p> Evolution in the Universe takes many paths , but all the paths that corporeal life follows require consumption of other living matter . Eating one another starts early . Unlike the spiritual realm , where consumption of one spirit by another is never required and in fact can not happen , carnivorous behavior is intrinsic to corporeal life . Why God so structured the world in this way is not known , but considering that all forming souls begin their life incarnated , there are certain lessons that are guaranteed . As empathy in some degree is also intrinsic to corporeal life , a conflict between the self and the other is a given . <p> Humans are omnivores , as during their evolution they required the ability to eat a broad diet in order to survive . Carnivores develop in species that are swift and voracious , but only where a continuous and ample supply of prey exist . Imagine a tiger with nothing but grass to eat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger pangs get strong enough , but his digestive system wo n't process anything but meat . Carnivores die when their prey dies out . Species that are vegetarians also have specialized digestive tracts , designed to break down the tough fiber that is intrinsic to plant life . They have multiple stomachs in many cases , digesting in stages . All species that eat plants consume insects as a matter of course , as insects are scattered throughout the plants they munch on , and thus are always part of the intake . Thus , species that evolve are either carnivores , vegetarian , or omnivores . The omnivore , of which mankind is a member , evolve to meet wildly swinging cycles of food availability . Early humans , being land animals and highly mobile , could travel during drought to areas lush with vegetation . <p> Strictly vegetarian animals do this likewise , but as their digestive tracts digest fiber effectively , they can nibble on dried vegetation on the way . Humans , evolved from apes which were adjusted to eating fruits and insects as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber . Thus , while on the road during droughts , they would have starved unless able to kill and eat meat . They have dual digestive systems , in effect . Humans are designed , due to the influence of food availability during evolution , to eat either vegetables and fruits or meat , but not both at the same time . This is a fact not widely recognized or understood by humans , and thus they do themselves damage by eating both foods at meals , routinely . Imagine the cave man on the road , traveling to lush fields of vegetation where fruits and grains and tubers could be located with ease . The troop kills a deer or elephant , and feasts on nothing but meat and blood for days , consuming the entire kill before it can spoil . They do this repeatedly while on the road . When they arrive at their destination , they find they no longer need to take the physical risks that hunting invariably presents - flailing hooves and charging frightened beasts . They become vegetarians . <p> Modern man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vegetarian periods . They did not live strictly on vegetables and fruits and grains . They ate any and everything that was handy , and this included numerous insects and slow moving life forms such as mollusks and possums . They ate less meat , but the diet was highly varied and included occasional small bites from sources other than plants . Thus , those modern humans who try to live what they interpret to be a strictly vegetarian life suffer from malnutrition - poor immunity , anemia , lack of strength , and inability to deal with stress . Man was not designed to live by vegetables alone , and must accommodate their body with protein sources from living creatures other than plants , or suffer the consequences . <p> The smooth surface of calm waters can be deceptive . She or he appears so serene , so calm , their feathers never ruffled . Then one day there is an explosion , and murder and mayhem ensue , or else suicide . Perhaps it would have been better to have a bit less serenity , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repress their emotions , and how is this possible ? Do all intelligent species do so ? Humans have a genetic capacity for repressed emotions that is not present throughout the Universe . Few intelligent species have this capacity , and it arises only when genetic engineering has created this confusion . Repressed emotions do not occur naturally , during evolution . Then how did this come about , in humans ? Originally all species on the planet Earth were reptilian , and this is a common form throughout the Universe . The ability to repress emotions comes from the fact that humans have several brains - the forebrain , which is mammalian , the midbrain , which is a mixture of the mammal and reptile , and the early brain , which is reptilian . <p> When humans wish to remember all , they record the information in all their brains , although the information may vary in the different data banks . When humans wish to forget , they disconnect the memory chains between their forebrain and the other brains , and amnesia ensues . The midbrain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , and does so responsibly . Blind rage erupting during the day can get one fired or exiled , and thus the ability to repress emotions has been , if anything , selected for propagation . Those who could not repress appropriately were repelled from the tribe or city , and did not fare well enough to propagate their genes . <p> Worry is the greatest drain , as the body is fighting the issues endlessly , with no end . Your body was not designed for this . It was designed for fight or flight , not endless battle . In your primitive past , when presented with challenges , you either fought off the threat or were eaten or destroyed . The matter was over quickly . Modern society presents situations that are neither over quickly nor changed quickly . Thus the battle stage is drawn out endlessly , and the soldiers grow weary . Put the battle to an end somehow , if only by deciding not to engage . If there is nothing you can do at the moment , and you can have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be at peace . <p> The desire to forget one 's troubles , experience more intense sexual pleasure , or boost one 's sense of confidence , via recreational or even prescription drugs , is not unique to the human animal . Such urges are intrinsic to all life , as why would they not be ? Does not the turtle , feeling the warmth of the Sun 's rays , linger longer in that spot ? Does not the amoebae , feeling the burn of a caustic , shrink back ? Does not the Beta female in a wolf pack , having an opportunity to break away and become the Alpha female of her own pack , take this opportunity in preference to being in second place ? The fuss over recreational drugs and alcoholic excesses is not the desire to use , it 's the lack of control . Were everyone to stop at two drinks a day , AA would not exist . Were everyone smoking dope to be of age and not returning to work or driving or operating dangerous machinery or lecturing school children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intensely destructive to unborn fetuses and even fatal , during an overdose , why would anyone be concerned ? Does society cast rules regulating how many calories can be consumed , even when obesity kills and might be considered to be giving children the wrong message ? Why is overeating exempt , and smoking dope not ? The crux of the matter is control , as society does not care if its members are miserable or quietly killing themselves , as long as they do n't make a fuss or a mess . Getting high makes a mess . <p> The drunk drives on the wrong side of the road and picks fights with strangers . The pot head fails school and ignores his responsibilities . The crack user breaks and enters in order to afford his habit , and if he is a she , delivers terribly damaged babies to be cared for by the state . Messy . We , the Zetas , routinely avoid mind altering substances , as this avoids , rather than addresses , the issue . If one is in pain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned that this be so . If one lacks confidence , they are given encouragement and offers of assistance . Avoiding problems does not resolve them . Humans , in their existence , find many of their problems intractable , and to be borne in silent agony . It is this that is the driver behind excesses of drug and alcohol use , and this is what should be addressed as a solution . <p> Humans often dream about what they like to call a perfect world - no need to work , sleep until noon , anything they want to eat or drink , limitless sex , and no rules regarding indulgences of any kind . They strive toward this , reducing their work time and increasing their play time , and moving the menu in the direction of the fun foods , desert first . A lack of exercise , which at first feels good because one feels rested rather than weary , can result in a very unhealthy body . Likewise , fun foods , aka junk food , can be just as destructive . Junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cave men lingered longer at the berry patch because the berries were sweet , and thus got their dose of vitamin C. They ate fat laden foods with gusto , and thus stocked up on calories before the lean times set in . And they ate anything salty they could get their hands on , because they were always on the edge of being depleted , especially when inland rather than along the shore . But cave men were kept in check by their harrowing existence . Overindulgence was the least of their worries . Civilization has in essence allowed man to follow his appetite , unchecked . If sweets taste good , then indulge into diabetes or hypoglycemia . <p> If fat foods taste better than lean , then indulge into obesity and cardiovascular disease . If salt puts zing into food , then apply the shaker until your blood pressure sky rockets . Only when health is shattered do most humans take notice . For those who have more than occasional access to junk foods , or even sweet , rich , or salty staples , common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how awful you 'll feel if fat , apoplectic , and in the grip of blood sugar swings . Drink too much and you have a quick lesson in the comeuppance that a hangover provides . Junk food has a longer curve , but the comeuppance can plunge your life into the grip of misery which wo n't be cured in a day . <p> It is not by accident that a person coughing or choking is frequently thought to be a person having a good laugh . Likewise the start of a hearty laugh is often mistaken for a shout or sneeze , and the rhythm of laughing is similar to the heaving rhythm of sobbing . Do these similarities mean that laughter has a physiological basis with sobbing and coughing or a defensive bark ? They do indeed . An analysis of situations found humorous invariably uncovers a tense situation . In fact , to discern why one person finds a situation funny while another does not , look to why the amused person is experiencing tension . Muscles tensed without relief naturally begin twitching and cramping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also due to the evolution of effective relaxation methods . Those creatures that cramped without release did poorly , and those that twitched into a different state survived . Thus laughter or sobbing or barking - a tension release . <p> Socialized humans given to denying their hostilities excuse their laughter as benign , which of course in the main it is . If they were n't laughing they might be murdering each other or endlessly fighting , so laughter is encouraged . When there is nothing one can do about it - joke around . Situations of intense jealousy bring forth sarcasm , which is hostility thinly veiled as humor . If someone else gets the promotion , joke around about his qualifications in a semi-sarcastic manner , and you might get away with throwing him a verbal punch . If you have a dominating wife who insists that the doors be opened for her as though she were a helpless queen , the thought of someone like her dropping her parcels when the doorman gets distracted and let 's the door smack in her face allows the fuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Humor is thus an effective safety valve for hostility that would prove disruptive , and can even be used to deflect antagonism from others . Oops , the jokes on me . <p> Our goal is to genetically engineer a Homo Sapiens who carries enough Zeta Reticulan genetic structure to be more intelligent , more telepathic , more caring , less violent , and we might add , not prone to fat . Should the Earth be a planet not prone to pole shifts , this would occur anyway . The genetic infusion would be more gradual . At some point , we would elicit the cooperation of the populace being genetically engineered , as at some point the general orientation of the populace would be Service-to- Other . These parents , in all likelihood , would want for their offspring a better life . <p> After the pole shift the majority of the Service-to-Others humans due to remain on Earth will require new housing , so to speak , and our task has been to provide sufficient infant hybrids at that point in time . We are rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of hybrids are numerous . How are we stepping up our hybrid program ? Is everyone having sex all the time , and popping babies out yearly ? Are we using genetic engineering techniques , such as in-vitro production , where our genetic sampling is sufficient to go into mass-production ? Neither is the case . The hybrid program has yet to be allowed to go into automatic , where we can let nature take its course . <p> We are still braiding the genetic thread , correcting flaws with insertion of missing DNA , and working around the clock on these issues . Because of the large heads , due to increased intelligence , and smaller hip size , due to our Zeta Reticulan contribution , infants are not carried to term by the mother . This is not , technically speaking , necessary . Infants within the mother are close to her heart , but infants developed outside the mother can be sent our love too . <p> Thus , eventually , perhaps within 100 years or what you might call a generation , the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly human , but will begin interacting with the other communities , intermarrying , and will thus merge . <p> One should also not assume that full-blood humans will die out entirely . This almost never occurs during species transitions , especially when a certain level of intellect is attained . There may be Service- to-Other groups on Earth composed entirely of humans that continue , isolated , and content with their level of intellect , for instance . There will be Service-to-Self humans , taken before their human form is terminated , who will be human on other planets . This occurs frequently in the Service-to-Self orientation , as surviving infants are hard to come by in this orientation . Nurturing is rare . Thus , those choosing this orientation often are required to keep their current incarnation . <p> Given the population explosion , why would n't the human race be back in business in a hurry after the cataclysms ? Three reasons : <p> 1 . A high mortality rate , where babies wo n't survive , and the birth rate will be less than zero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . A movement of the Service-to-Others toward living with or near the high tech centers of the hybrids , where intermarriage will occur . With high tech food production and medical treatment , babies do survive . Intermarriage is something that occurs naturally when young people live near each other . <p> 3 . A tendency of the Service-to-Self to eradicate themselves , and each other . How long would the violent and unscrupulous population inside a prison live , if left entirely to their own inclinations ? The Service-to-Self will go off on their own , rummaging through the wreckage and living off what others have lost . <p> - <p> So what goes , during a genetic engineering project such as the Zeta-Human hybrid creation ? Do we just mix sperm and ova together , from both sets of parents , and hope for the best ? <p> Human participants in development of a hybrid species assume that their eggs and sperm are taken so that the desired Zetan genes can be mixed in during conception . Often female participants assume that they have been impregnated via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetus reinserted for a brief gestation period . In the main , mixing the egg and sperm is the process , but several steps are involved . <p> * Prior to combining the male and female strands , the strands are examined for undesirable traits such as heritable diseases . Thus , it is not simply the fastest swimming sperm that becomes daddy , nor the nearest and most available egg that become mommy . <p> * After selecting the human male and female contribution , snipping and replacing occurs . In this process Zeta genetics routinely replace certain human genetics - some human genes are routinely discarded , and some Zeta genes not present at all in humans are inserted . <p> * In some cases genes from an ancestor are used to replace the human genes secured from the male and female donors . Almost invariably these are taken from data banks we maintain , but on rare occasion we are allowed to go back in time to secure a needed sample . This step inserts and accentuates a desirable human trait . <p> Genetic diseases are concomitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . Obesity is a protective maneuver , to maximize food consumption during times of plenty , gone wrong . Food stuffs do not spoil when packed around the ribs in the form of fat . All genetic diseases , when their cause is understood , can be seen to be a normal maneuver of the body gone wrong . In the animal kingdom , afflicted animals quickly die out . You protect your afflicted , allowing them not only to survive , but to propagate . In this way your genetic diseases almost seem to increase . <p> Humans have noted , in mapping human genes , that a number of DNA links are dormant . The number casually noted by humans in no way reflect the vast span of dormant portions in the human physiology . There are many , many portions of the human body which are remnants or leftovers , unused . The appendix is one . Your DNA is rift with genes which if allowed to express would horrify and surprise humans . The hybrids that we are creating will have many dormant genes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humans , which evolved to allow humans to live on a planet where large predators exist . Were it not for your violent nature , you would not have survived past a couple of generations . We suppress that violent nature in our hybrids , yet those genes exist . Just as you would be horrified to develop tentacles , or a gaping mouth in the center of your stomach , with smacking lips ready to take in whatever might float by , in the future the new hybrids would be horrified to find their dormant violent nature expressing from hidden genes . <p> Other than genetic diseases , what else is getting snipped out from the human contribution ? <p> Human emotions are something we are including , along with many other characteristics . The list would be too long to include in its entirety , but we will mention a few . Your hair and soft skin , although we have n't had much luck with hair . Your desire for touch . The physical relationship of parents and caregivers to young , where nursing and holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to nurse , and are having luck with the desire to touch and hold . The sex drive is definitely included , and where this drive varies among our hybrids , this is in proportion to the variance among humans , we have found . Intelligence has been increased , as has the ability to communicate telepathically . Curiosity and creativity have also been increased , as these are factors of intelligence . Introspection has been increased , as the tie between the conscious and subconscious has been strengthened . <p> Our IQ is higher than yours , and also different . You will observe when comparing your intelligence to this or that animal , that some things relate and are similar , and some things are radically different . Consciousness is one such difference . The Chimpanzee is clever , can learn sequences and apply a certain amount of logic . They use tools , in a limited manner . However , they are n't conscious in the same sense that you are . They do not ponder their immortality . They do not ruminate about their guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heavens in the manner that they do . Most particularly , they do not think about how they relate to the larger scheme of things . They are not conscious of themselves as an entity . <p> In comparing our increased intelligence , numbers alone do not describe the situation . Where your mind carries on dozens of thoughts simultaneously , ours carry on thousands . You are unaware of most of the thinking your mind does . You are only aware of the conscious thought at the front of your mind . Yet parts of your mind are concerned with sensing distance around you , the need to shift your position , sensing the body language of others around you , calculating your physical hungers and plotting how these will be satiated , etc . In terms of IQ , should we Zetas take one of your IQ tests , which measure speed and accuracy , we would measure around 287 IQ points . <p> If human emotions are a valued trait , to be included , is this missing in the Zeta ? <p> Regarding whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joy , or are we cold fish . We are not cold fish . The issue of emotion has been misunderstood . What is meant by emotion ? Humans experience a range of emotion , a wide range that they know by name and recognize and a wider range of emotions they have not even catalogued . We will enumerate . The positive emotions are love , which can include a sense of bonding , or a sense of affectionate possession , or a sense of desire for the loved object . Bonding love expands to comradeship , protection of those dependent and weak , affiliation , loyalty , and pride of association . Affectionate possession , a common form of love among the spiritually immature , is less an empathic concern for the other than a pride of ownership . It can lead to the O.J. Simpson syndrome . Desire for the loved object can involve love of food , as passionate consumption , or love of a sex object . <p> How do we Zetas compare to humans on these positive emotions ? We feel a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its forms . Affectionate possession is also possible , but in the Service-to-Others orientation this does not come to the fore and command the attention it does in more spiritually immature entities . Desire for the loved object is blunted in the Zetas , so that we are aware of our need for food or sex , but this is a very quiet voice . Those who wonder if the Zeta have sex should be aware that where we no longer use our sex organs for reproduction , we still have mild sensations in this regard . Not lacking imagination , the Zetas are looking forward to a return to a full sex life , when incarnate in the hybrids . Affection for food is not the driver and foci that it is for humans , but we Zetas are aware of the weakness that comes from a lack of nourishment . Thus , we feel affection for our renewal baths . In genetically engineering the hybrids , we are not including a compulsion for food stuffs , with consequent obesity . <p> The negative emotions are primarily control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removes the entity from primary control of the environment . All this is all too familiar to humans . The desire for control leads to an emotion of glorying in control , that of wallowing in power . <p> - <p> So just why DO the Zetas have a more blunted emotional life than humans ? <p> Do we have emotions ? Yes . Do we have sexual feelings ? Yes . Are these greater than human emotions and sex drives ? No . Why the difference ? We evolved on different worlds , under different stresses and selective determinants . The Earth , as we have stated , is a particularly violent world , large carnivors on every continent , so that many can scarsely be free of this worry , day or night . Big cats , wolf packs , immense bears , sharks , and thus to survive , the quick reaction to attack or danger was emotion . What do you suppose fear , or anger , is ? Does an evolving creature need this , per se ? It is to incite action , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likewise , a mother 's concern for her baby , a dominant males concern for protecting and retaining his harem , are survival related emotions . <p> The passive human got eaten , the human with strong emotions survived and passed on their genes . A strong sex drive is likewise selective , as those males with a strong drive would fight for their harem , where those with a weak drive would turn their backs and let the harem get eaten ! A sex drive in the female is also survival selective , as the horny female will stick close to the dominant male , get intimate often , and thus enhance the bond and desire on the males part to protect her , as well as keep her close to the protector . <p> We have stated that on our world , the worlds within Zeta Reticuli which we evolved on , there were no large carnivores . We were transplanted there , onto worlds that could do no more than evolve moss and bugs . Thus , our large eyes are for seeing , in very dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , sex was for procreation , and the process of natural selection more related to cunning , being able to figure out how to solve problems , how to create technology or extend a food supply , than brute force or rage . Likewise , emotion was not only not required , it was a disruptive element . It would never evolve , and if it expressed due to genetic mutation , then this Zeta was less likely to have a harem than another , so was selected out during sexual partnering . <p> Our hybrids , as we have stated , will have the emotional range and sex drive and variation that humans have , not our more limited range . This is because the Earth is our new home , the home of the hybrids , and these characteristics are native to the Earth . <p> The Zeta are accused of having a group mind , seemingly operating like insects , by rote , and without individuality . Where did these assumptions come from ? First , we reproduce by cloning , so our appearance can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is telepathic , over the heads of humans who for the most part sense no conversation going on at all . Third , there is a lack of argument and indecision that humans see in us when we are at work attending to our contactees , as we have all agreed ahead of time on how to handle issues that might arise . <p> Humans who see us having a group mind are drawing these conclusions on scanty data . Imagine how adult male humans would appear to an alien race encountering them only at work . There they all are in their standard dark gray business suits , white shirts , and ties . Similar hair cuts . Beard shaved off . Carrying identical black briefcases . Greeting each other with the standard hand shake . Clearly , this is a group mind . When the leader speaks , the others all nod and smile slightly . They even clap as a group ! The data missing from this picture distorts it . <p> So what are the emotions of humans , regarding the development of a Zeta-Human hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all likelihood ? <p> They hear emotional stories of mothers holding babies they instinctively recognize as theirs , where it seems the babes are torn from their mother 's arms to be returned to emotionless alien nurses standing at the side . Those who actually participate in these dramas understand the underlying framework , and where they may be expressing emotion , they do not express rage or even resentment , though perhaps some sadness . Those who participate in the hybrid program are doing so because they agreed prior to their birth , prior even to their next incarnation being selected , to participate . They understand the situation , that their hybrid children can not live on the Earth in human society at this time . <p> They understand the rich and loving environment their hybrid children are being raised within . Being solidly in the Service-to-Other orientation , they do not wish to remove their offspring from this environment to be placed in a human setting where they in all likelihood would be maimed and killed and taunted . Custody rights over the hybrid children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes an issue with those who are inserting themselves into the drama , outsiders as it were . In that they scarcely understand the many factors at play , and most certainly do n't understand the resolve and commitment made by the human participants , they are not even armed with the facts . <p> Prebirth agreements are relatively rare . Our hybrid program has been granted permission to institute more prebirth agreements than in previous centuries , where it was close to nil , because we need to ensure cooperation with those who hold genetic parentage . Without a prebirth agreement , its a toss of the dice on what might incarnate into a piece of genetic material , the babe , and that babe choosing not to cooperate with our hybrid program . So we have certain key DNA parcels , the babes , incarnated with prebirth agreements without too much hassle . Those who have a prebirth agreement become aware of it at a fairly young age . They sense something different , and become fully aware of it when the time is right . Nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hybrid program runs along family lines . When combining genes from a human with Zeta Reticulan genes , there is some unfortunate loss . This loss is recaptured in subsequent efforts . This is not unlike a braid , where the strands are woven back in . The braid is stronger than loose hair or twine . <p> Some humans feel they should be in charge of their own genetic engineering , or in charge of the question as to whether genetic engineering is even necessary . This is not reasonable , although those being denied this authority may fuss and argue . These issues were decided after much deliberation . This is not a matter done casually , nor is this a one-time matter . This has been done repeatedly to Homo Sapiens , who are only able to complain , having a voice and mind , because of just such a process in the past . Of course we poll humans to learn what they desire to continue , what characteristics they appreciate . Those humans who will be reincarnating into the hybrid form , the Service-to-Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously as to their preferences . They are not voting on the steps to be taken in order to genetically engineer . You may give the plastic surgeon your desires on the shape of the nose , but you do not hold the knife . <p> Zetan genetics are being used as the intelligence of humans can not be more than doubled using human genetic structure . The best that could be accomplished is a human at the genius level , and what we seek , what we are required to attain , is so very much higher . Telepathy , something your species can barely support , is another issue . Genetic engineering does not make something from nothing . It alters what already exists or inserts something already in existence . A third important issue is the level of violence in your human species . Blinding rage is firmly rooted in your genetic heritage . To carve this out would leave too little remaining . This must be counteracted where it is found , in all the reaches of the brain , rather than simply rooted out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatic that Earth belongs to Homo Sapiens , and usurpers should leave . It matters not that they were at one time the usurpers . The decision to phase out humans , as hard as it may be for those affected to comprehend , are not without input from those affected . Neanderthal man was in agreement with having his version of mankind die out , afflicted as they were with tummy problems not pleasant to live with . A Vote was taken , and they were in agreement . Votes that are a true vote are not akin to the voting that occurs on Earth , publicly announced . In these votes , there is hardly a choice , the choices placed before the voters not what they would put there , but what the elite have allowed to be placed there . In addition , actual counts , as the 2000 US Presidential election demonstrated , are hardly what matters or to be reported accurately . Why would parents not want their children , or themselves for that matter , to be more intelligent , less subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote went to be engineered , for future incarnations . It was a slam-dunk , as you say . <p> Our hybrids are living in many places within your solar system , close at hand , as well as elsewhere nearby in other star systems . Clearly , as our hybrids as well as ourselves expect to be on the future Earth , we do not want our bodies to become accustomed to a lesser gravity . We are primarily in residence outside of the solar system , in another nearby star system , where a commensurate gravity is available to us . Relocating to Earth is a simple matter , involving : 1 . setting up residences which have already been constructed and can be relocated , intact , and quickly so ; 2. selecting a spot on Earth which is previously uninhabited , such as the newly warming Antarctica , or new land emerging from the seas . <p> So what can we expect , when reincarnating into those new hybrid bodies ? <p> Our life span is much longer than humans . The life span of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Zetas currently enjoy . In your Earth years , this is 400 years . We experience debility for only the last 50 years of this span . In our culture we also do not rule against suicide . Therefore , if any Zeta finds his life circumstances unbearable , he can end his life in a painless manner without strife . <p> The expansion of human lungs is visible , yet our trunks seem firm and immobile . Do we have lungs ? We do indeed , but they work asynchronously , rather than in unison , one expanding while the other exhales , so the motion is all internal . Our hybrids , however , have unison breathing , but in a pinch could switch over to asynchronous breathing - a latent capacity . The human diet is voluminous and fibrous , reflecting the diet of the base apes that formed the human race , and in truth reflecting the reality of vegetation on your planet and the adaptation that animals evolving on your planet were forced to deal with . If an animal is vegetarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and deal with digestive gasses . Few animals become successful predators , an obvious fact as if all were predators there would soon be nothing to prey upon . So humans have as their base an animal that eats masses of fibrous vegetation , daily . <p> We Zetas , on our world , had a different diet . Mosses , bugs , algae , crustaceans , and when we ate almost nothing went to waste . In our hybrids we have attempted to take the best of both worlds . Humans , we feel sure , would not object to less farting and burping . In the highly civilized world of the future , cultivation will focus on those foods that return the highest nutrition . Less eating , less elimination , virtually no digestive gasses , and surprisingly constipation will not be a concern as the shape of the bowel , being a single straight shoot , lends itself to guaranteed elimination . In humans the kidney works constantly , filtering waste , but in the Zeta click in only when certain blood chemicals raise to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between beats , the Zeta kidney rests between Zeta meals . The reason for this pacing is the more complete absorption of nutrients in the Zeta digestive tract , placing a burden on the kidneys which then require a rest period in which to recoup . Likewise , the Zeta liver is a workhorse that goes the distance after meals and requires a recuperative period . <p> Zetas who overeat get more than overweight , they get sick . Our thinness is not due solely to genetic tendencies , we simply do not overeat . Do the Zetas store fat as humans do ? Yes and no . We have this capacity but our physiology does not make use of it ordinarily . Since we do not digest excess food without getting sick , our bodies keep all nutrition at the ready , as a store to be used up before the next meal . No packing it away in fat cells , no saving it for a later day . Our hybrids have the best of both worlds . They are slender because their physiology uses , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should they for any reason decide to overeat , they do not suffer as we , the Zetas , do . The Zeta were selected for production of a hybrid race with humans in part because our physiologies are similar . <p> Our blood is also hemoglobin based , and where a chemist would find all the many Zeta blood components differing from comparable human blood components in quantity and composition , the differences are not dramatic . Likewise with the endocrine systems , which have comparable glands and functions . Here , however , there is one dramatic difference . The Zeta do not sleep , though there are regular rest periods where activity essentially stops . There are blood chemistry differences in humans between the wakeful and sleep states , but in the Zeta these differences do not appear . Our hybrids sleep , as we have found the physiology more resilient when able to rest . However , the sleep requirements are much reduced , requiring perhaps 1/5 , rather than 1/3 of the day , and the onset of sleep deprivation does not occur with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if need be . <p> - <p> - <p> Were there things the engineers wanted to change , but could not ? Were there any failures ? <p> We prepared ourselves for the task ahead , some thousands of years ago . Our early attempts were failures and died in infancy due to nutritional problems . Soon our proto-hybrids were living into adulthood and data gathering was in full swing . <p> * Nervous system difficulties arose and were corrected early , where the brain portions either communicated too effectively or incompletely with each other . For those proto-hybrids , life was a perpetual bad trip , as you say - too much noise and not enough comprehension . <p> * Sexual dysfunction showed up not as lack of interest in sex but as infertility , though this was not personally distressing to any of the proto-hybrids . <p> * Lack of hair , in a hairless Zeta community , was also not an embarrassment , but the sporadic hair that appeared on some of our proto-hybrids was a source of consternation . Imagine facial hair spaced every few inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of hair distressing enough to those born with it that genetic engineering leaned toward hairlessness as the lesser of evils . <p> * Our tiny mouths and small teeth did not line up well with human genetics in all cases in our proto-hybrids either . At times tiny teeth in a big mouth , at times big teeth in a tiny mouth . <p> Digestive problems were continuously smoothed , and are still being addressed . Early proto-hybrids had many nutritional problems which required supplemental nutritional aids . Many of our problems were due to the high standards set by ourselves regarding digestion . No farting , no burping , no fainting from low blood sugar , and no tendency to get fat . We have achieved our goals in this regard . <p> Where earlier phases of the hybrid program had as their goal dealing with basic requirements like digestion , reproduction , and intelligence , our recent goals have addressed details like appearance , the senses , and memory . Skin tone has been improved to where it is neither a reddish blush or a pallor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , we went in the other direction - hairless . Far better bald then with a strand here or there . Breasts are small , but functional , a high priority goal of ours due to the bonding that occurs during nursing . The sex drive in the hybrids remains as varied as it does in the human animal . <p> Sight and sound reception is closer to what the Zetas are capable of , vastly higher ranges than humans have ever experienced , due to our dim Sun and relatively inhospitable planet . Those who could not peek through the gloom or follow a faint sound simply did not survive to reproduce . Where the human animal has many memory levels - short term , long term , subconscious , conscious , and others unknown and thus not labeled by humans - the target hybrid has a cohesive memory , much like the Zetas . <p> Having perfected our 90 's model , we are now into mass production , as the cataclysms are fast approaching .

@@36454410 @5454410/ <p> These are troubling times indeed with economic , climatic , and social upheavals and wild gyrations of every type in every corner of our planet . Although I would not specifically ever rate myself as a " survivalist " I do believe in being prepared for any eventuality : One of the most important factors towards this type of preparation is to ensure that there is an adequate food supply to last out any emergency , whether short- or long-lived . <p> Many foods simply can not last without refrigeration , and one of the key aspects to being prepared is to acknowledge that electricity supply may be sporadic if it exists at all . Therefore , when all of the options of the various comestibles are carefully considered , it turns out that the only type of food product which can be safely and conveniently stored for prolonged periods of time is grain . <p> Grains are extremely nutritious and if they are paired with sources of animal protein , can go a long way towards forming a properly balanced diet . At times of no refrigeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ongoing basis , and it is not my intention to delve into a fishing and hunting guide Hub . There are more than enough sources of that information readily available . <p> If you 're intending to store food for a prolonged period of time , buying grains locally is a great idea . There is one thing you definitely want to watch out for and that 's that you most certainly do n't want to store treated seed prepared for planting . It is always colored to warn you , usually with a pink or red dye . Depending on the kind of seed , that coloration indicates that it is covered with pesticides or fungicides . Do n't ever try to eat this as it is extremely poisonous . <p> If you live in wheat country and get wind of a neighbouring farmer who is going to plant some winter wheat , you might want to ask them if perhaps they would sell a bit to you in the spring . Keep in mind that wheat straight out of the combine still has a lot of chaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the spring before the farmer plants their wheat they get it cleaned and treated at a seed cleaning plant which takes all that foreign matter out so you do n't have to . Ask your farmer friend if they will clean a couple of extra hundred pounds for you . Then get it before it 's " treated " with those red chemicals and you 'll have a supply of perfectly good , edible grain . <p> You have heard " store foods in a cool , dry place " your whole life , and it 's absolutely true . The best storage temperatures are below 10 degrees C ( 50 degrees F ) and the optimum storage temperature is close to 4 degrees C ( 40 degrees F ) . It 's also extremely important to make sure that the temperature is as constant as possible . Big swings in temperature can ruin stored foods in a very short time . <p> According to The United States Department of Agriculture , ( USDA ) : " Each 5.6 degrees Centigrade ( 10 degrees Fahrenheit ) drop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course the bottom level of this scale is at the freezing point , at which level it is irrelevant to keep reducing the temperature . <p> Another important aspect to maximize food storage times is to limit or outright eliminate the access to oxygen of the food product you 're storing .

However , you do n't have to order these plastic containers by the hundred from your local supplier and pay thousands of dollars . If you need access to free plastic containers your local donut shop , pizzeria , or grocery store deli and bakery should be able to provide all your needs . <p> These types of food establishments receive a large percentage of the ingredients they utilize in their daily activities in large , food grade plastic containers which can readily be re-used . When they are empty , the managers of these businesses have to confront the expensive process of having dozens , hundreds , or even thousands of these perfectly good and totally re-usable plastic containers carted to the landfill or away for recycling . <p> The best way to proceed is to contact the manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all containers they are about to throw away .

These items are all food grade so you certainly do n't have to worry about any chemicals leaching out and contaminating your food . <p> Once you get the containers home make sure to scrub them energetically with hot , soapy water inside and out . Most labels will soak right off in hot water alone . A readily available product called GooGone will take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit onto the label and let it soak . In a few minutes the label will lift off with a minimum of scraping . It is also a great idea to soak the containers after scrubbing with a little bleach to disinfect them both inside and out . Make sure to rinse thoroughly with lots of fresh running water as you certainly do n't want the active ingredient in bleach , sodium hypochlorite , to come into contact with your food . After this , if any plastic containers retain a smell of their previous contents or even the bleach , fill them with crumbled newspapers sprinkled with baking soda and put the lid back on . Set these aside for a couple of weeks in a warm spot . Most times it takes the aroma clean out and leaves nothing but a neutral scent . <p> If you find that the managers at the local food establishments will supply these containers to you , do n't forget to send them a note and let them know how much you appreciate their efforts .

There are various ways of getting around this : <p> 1 . Get rid of the bed box springs . Put down one layer of buckets or two layers of boxes and lay a 1/2 inch piece of plywood ( or pieces if you have a larger bed ) and throw your mattress on top of this .

If you do this in a room that is already on the cramped side , you 'll have to become accustomed to the smaller space . <p> 3 . Have one of the kids sacrifice their closet for the cause and let them double up their clothes with a sibling in another closet . <p> 4 . Do you have a dry crawl space ? Throw it in there . Do n't store any food in the attic as it 's way too hot in the summer time . <p> 5 . Be as creative as you can . Look around your house to find places to hide it or build around it . <p> If you live in a climate where it 's almost always humid and hot , like south Florida , you might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six gallon buckets that have an additional Mylar bag outside for extra protection . These buckets have n't been government approved for storing in the ground and there is n't any data to support this idea either positively or negatively . If you are going to put them in the ground , please do it at your own risk . <p> The Mylar bags will have to be sealed and the easiest way to ensure an airtight permanent seal is by using a hot iron . It is a very good idea to experiment first by slicing a few strips off a Mylar bag first and testing your iron to make sure it 's at the correct temperature . This technique works just as well if you 're using smaller bags to just store food in directly , and not using the Mylar bags to add an additional level of seal protection to a big six gallon pail . <p> Generally you can use the iron setting on Polyester / Wool / Cotton . All irons should have this setting , as it is extremely common . Let the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to flannel : an old pillowcase would be perfect . Fold over the end of the Mylar bag . Place the cloth over the top of the Mylar and hold the iron on the material for about twenty seconds . Then you can move to next section of Mylar and hold the iron on the material for another twenty seconds . Continue this process all along the length of bag until you 're finished . The Mylar will be extremely hot so make sure that you do not touch it at this time . If you do n't wait for the Mylar to cool , you will be able to open the edges . Once it cools it should be well sealed . <p> It would be many times better to build some kind of underground room to store your long term food stash than to actually bury your buckets . Many buckets would permit small amounts of moisture into the bucket over many months or years . It actually would n't take a lot of moisture to make your dry packed food unusable . <p> Some folks who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallon trash barrels into the ground . A power auger does a great job of loosening up all of the dirt to do this , otherwise it is one heck of a tough hand shovelling task . you would need to place the bottoms of barrels three feet under the surface grade level . You leave only about an inch or two of the perimeter of the barrel above ground--just enough to fit the lid on securely . Obviously , you do n't put the barrel or the hole it 's meant to fit into out in the hot sun , especially in the warmer latitudes . The best place is in a covered spot that is shady , in a shed , etc . <p> Depending on your weather you may want to pile loose straw or hay on top of the barrel tops , or even some attic insulation will work : anything that minimizes the daily fluctuation of temperature . This works in both hot and cold climates . Folks in frigid areas often use these buried barrels as miniature cold cellars to store garden veggies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their region . <p> Keep in mind that these buried storage methods are in no way the optimal method for long term food storage . The best way to store grain for both the retention of the extremely valuable nutrients and for its future viability as seed is to subject the grain to subfreezing temperatures . It is extremely important to ensure that the grain must be extremely dry : the ideal level is 8% moisture . 10% is still acceptable but as soon as we start approaching the 15-20% mark , we run into problems . <p> These exceedingly low moisture levels are such a strong prerequisite to any stored grain because water expands as it freezes and forms ice crystals . If there is an excess of water left in the cytoplasm of the cells of the grain , the expanding crystals will skew the structure of the water containing molecules and can even rip the cell walls : effectively killing the seed . Once the seed has been frozen it is still acceptable for some food purposes . These grains would not be suitable for grinding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rice , orzo , or couscous substitutes , in soups , chowders , and other similar preparations . <p> Do n't worry too much about requiring sensitive scientific instruments to measure the precise level of moisture in any particular grain . The general rules of thumb to ensure that the moisture level is low enough are : <p> Long seeds that are bent must break cleanly in half with an audible " snap " sound . <p> Corn and wheat seeds must shatter and turn into powder when smashed with a hammer . <p> Peas , beans and other large seeds must shatter , but not necessarily powder like corn . <p> If the seed has been dried well and stored in air-tight containers with silica gel or another desiccant in them , there should be zero effect on either food nutritional or germination quality . <p> When foods are packed in air they can not keep as well as when they are packed in oxygen free gases . The reason for this is because air contains 78% nitrogen , 21% oxygen , and approximately 1% of a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere alone which oxidizes the majority of the chemical compounds found in food . Bacteria is just one of several things which make food turn rancid and the vast majority of bacteria require an ample supply oxygen to grow . <p> There are basically two different processes for removing the oxygen in stored foods : <p> Oxygen Displacement : This process involves purging out all of the air in the food container to be stored with nitrogen . The reason why nitrogen is utilized in almost all cases is due to the fact that it is the most inert gas in the atmosphere . However , individuals who are accustomed to doing their own packing in some cases apply dry ice which gives off carbon dioxide , a gas that works about as well as nitrogen . <p> Oxygen Absorption : If the oxygen from the air in a sealed container is absorbed , what remains is almost pure nitrogen in a partial vacuum . Military food storage methods often include a small package of oxygen absorber being added to the bread ration . This oxygen absorber contains salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . The process of " rusting " involves the oxidation of the iron and the process will use the oxygen in any surrounding atmosphere as long as there is any significant moisture to feed the " rusting " process . It will also work with water but at a slower pace . It is important to ensure that the container is completely and hermetically sealed , otherwise oxygen will leak in and obviate the effect of the oxygen absorber . These oxygen absorbers are readily available from a multitude of sources on the internet . <p> Once you get around to opening up your grain storage you have to keep in mind that opened wheat will keep well for a considerable amount of time as long as it does not become infested or wet . Moisture will make it mold and ruin the grain and you definitely do n't want to eat moldy grain . Not only can it make you sick , but the witch hunts in the early Americas may have been accentuated by a form of mold in wheat that has hallucinogenic properties . ( No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wet grain is that it will quickly become a home for all sorts of insect pests and unless you like your grain with a side of bug , that could not be too palatable . <p> However , you can just dump your wheat into buckets and not worry about insects ... just be sure to stock plenty of oil so that you can fry up the insects and the grubs when you open the container up again . While you do lose some calories eating fried bugs and grubs , the protein is animal protein and therefore more complete . <p> The average protein level in grains is 12 percent of calories , in nuts and seeds 13 percent ; in pulses 26 percent ; and in fish , meat &amp; poultry 28 percent . Most insects are up to 80% protein , and it 's just as high quality and nutritious as the protein from any other source ! <p> Whether or not you are interested in harvesting bugs from your wet grain , or if you want to try to eliminate them , these are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatch . The supermarket I regularly shopped at when I lived in the Caribbean had bugs running around like crazy in the spice and nut jars as well as in the pasta packages . You could just pick up a plastic bag of pasta and watch the bug races . The pancake mixes ( which of course had the basic ingredient being wheat flour ) were subject to exactly the same problem , except that they were packaged in kraft paper bags so that I would n't notice until I got the package home and opened the bag to find all sorts of tiny teeny cobwebs , or a very small kind of fly that could even chew its way clear out of the bag ! Yikes ! <p> 2 . It is well nigh impossible to effectively clean all eggs out of the grain products that are available in the supermarkets at the original source so you certainly have no chance of doing that yourself . There are simply too many nooks and crannies for the bugs to lay their eggs in , and there is no way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in food processing plants allow the product to " pass " if there is an allowable percentage of insect eggs , fragments , and other bits and pieces of the good Lord know what do not exceed the allowable amounts . Hard to believe but true . <p> 3 . Nitrogen flushing done in sequence followed by a complete vacuum pressure evacuation of the food storage jar or bag prior its sealing is just about the most effective process that anyone can complete in order to eliminate oxygen to the greatest extent possible . Assuming that you have comparable densities , there would be far less air in a bag with 10 pounds of wheat versus a bag with 10 pounds of golf balls , as the volume between the golf balls would simply not be possible to completely evacuate to satisfactory extents . In roughly equal quantities of grain versus beans , grain would be the better food product which would allow itself to evacuate more air . <p> Consider the brick packs of ground coffee that you may see on the grocery shelves : the ones that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag that they are as hard as a brick , and when you rip them open they " whoosh " . Even with this high level of vacuum the process still will not eliminate all of the air out of the container . Take a brick box of coffee with you the next time you go from sea level to the mountains , you 'll be amazed ! You will find that the brick pack will soften a bit at high altitude and that is due to the lower air pressure up there . <p> The bottom line is that maximum oxygen evacuation , nitrogen flushing , and immediate sealing with a quality vapor barrier container preferably with multiple layers is the best way to ensure effective long term storage . Naturally , the place where you store these containers must be consistently cool and not subject to considerably warmer temperature fluctuations . It is feasible that the container will have such a tiny amount of oxygen that whatever little bug manages to hatch will suffocate shortly afterwards , but I certainly would n't want to take all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not what was happening and the darned bugs started to multiply like crazy . Keep in mind that excessive moisture could still be a problem in the formation of mold regardless of the extensive precautions mentioned in this Hub so it pays to be vigilant ! <p> Part of the Mormon food storage folk lore is that you toss a couple of sticks of spearmint gum in a bucket of wheat before you seal it . It is supposedly effective to stick several bay leaves in the flour canister as well . <p> Another way to treat grains that are intended for extended storage periods is to add Diatomaceous earth around them . Diatomaceous earth is actually the defunct carcasses of a series of microscopic , one celled protozoans . These are cells with sharp , complex , pointy , virtually crystal-like " shells " when their moisture is taken away from them and they are dried . Diatomaceous earth is primarily harvested from areas where seas were once present . <p> This Diatomaceous earth is a primary component of toothpaste : it 's the grit that actually scrubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for automotive applications and various other products where microscopic " sanding " is required . These sharp edged dead protozoans are lethal to soft-bodied insects who end up impaling their bodies on the super sharp protrusions and spikes of these " shells " which are actually quite pretty when observed under the microscope . <p> The insects that prey on beans and grains are primarily categorized into larva and beetle sub-groupings . Larvae are quite vulnerable to death by the sharp spikes of diatom , but armor-covered beetles are much more resistant . Diatmaceous earth is an excellent product to sprinkle on the soil around plants you want to protect from the various slugs and snails who want to make a meal out of them . The diatoms pierce their tender bellies and kills them ! <p> Storage in grain bags or sacks made out of burlap or any other cloth-like material is most certainly not an effective manner to keep those grains comestible for long periods of time . Both rodent and insect pests as well as mold can destroy a cloth bag of grain in less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground at a cool temperature in a dry area . If the sack is left on the ground or on a moist surface such as damp concrete , the period of time that can elapse for full contamination can be less than a week ! <p> When you open a bucket of grain you should make a point to use it as quickly as you can , and you wo n't have to worry about what happens to it as it will be gone before it can go bad . <p> Once the grain has exceeded the acceptable limits of moisture it most likely will have to be dried before it can be consumed or milled . To test whether a particular grain which has exceeded the recommended moisture limits is still suitable for human consumption , sprout some . If it sprouts , it is still quite good to eat , but if not , it should not be consumed by humans or pet / livestock animals . The time it takes for grains to sprout can exceed a week , but remember the old dictum : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good use of grain if you can catch it just as it gets wet is to sprout it on purpose . Sprouted grain is very sweet and crunchy and makes a quick , handy , readily portable and highly nutritious snack ! <p> If you take careful precautions and are extremely meticulous in your efforts to control the various aspects of emergency and survival food storage , you will find that grains are close to the perfect long term stored nutrient . And they taste great too ! <h> You need to be a member of Earth Changes and the Pole Shift to add comments ! <p> Tins and ice chests and anything you can store sealed stuff in sounds great , we have found bins on sale at times in the dollar stores over here and will be useful for laundry washing or anything else you can think of . <p> You guys are great thanks so much for all the lovely info here ; D <p> Definitely Kari and Raven , there will be some gmo out there for a little while we ca n't really control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic plants to seed first , we wo n't be wasting much on edibles that year , it would be best to use up the hybrids on possible failed crop and if for nothing else but to draw pollutants out into the plant .

There have been worse pole shifts in the past , but not by much . These kind of pole shifts , as this one , cause the Earth to attempt an almost 180 degree shift . However , the crust does not really succeed in going that distance , because the core separates from the crust as it rips the 180 , so the crust only makes it about a quarter turn , a 90 degree shift .

OR , if we make those lines for angles to persist , then all other distances do not persist ? <p> SOZT The 14 million miles reached , as the closest point between Planet X and the Earth , occurs during the outbound acceleration of Planet X as it exits the solar system . We have referred to the Point of Passage as equivalent to the point where Planet X pierces the Ecliptic , as in the early days of ZetaTalk this was understood to be the point where the pole shift is about to happen . In later detail , the last weeks , encompassing approximately 7 weeks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the point where Planet X is EXACTLY at the Ecliptic . In that we were speaking in general terms early in the ZetaTalk saga , and have lately been far more explicit , these details have emerged . The issue in those days was yes or no , is Planet X going to arrive in 2003 , with the reassurance that the populace could count on 3 days of darkness and 5.9 days of rotation stoppage prior to the shift . Since then , far more detail has emerged . <p> As we have explained , the ZetaTalk triangle is reached after Planet X has made its first 270n roll . When Planet X stands upright , and Earth follows suit , they try to part as far as possible . This is achieved by Earth moving back in her orbit again , to the farthest possible point within the cup of particle eddy flow coming round behind Planet X. At this point , the triangle is reached . But Planet X does not linger there .

At this angle , it is aiming above the Earth . The Earth again finds itself caught in a magnetic grip , and is drawn forward along its orbit , moving slightly toward Planet X , but the major party in this kiss is Planet X which at last feels free to move and move quickly .

EOZT <p> Zetas say that Earth will be pulled closer to PX from 43 million miles to 14 mm. to maintain Zeta Triangle angles proper , we have to move Earth to stand practically in Venus orbit ! Closer to the Sun ! <p> And this situation that i got in my slides , when placed everything according to what Zetas said resembles three orbs from Secklendorf crop circle ! Three planets lined up in a row before the Passage ! <p> This issue about Earth pulled closer to the Sun is interesting for two reasons . One is that a Q was asked about this , and here is what Zetas answered : <p> Q. : Ok , so Earth , when it is pulled 30 million miles by PX , will not be pulled in the same path as its orbit . Therefore , it will be pulled toward the Sun enough to be noticeable ? Enough to heat the Earth more than now ? Enough to put us at higher risk from solar corona effects ? Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface ? Enough to ruin all unprotected faraday cage electronics ? It is still not clear whether the Earth will be pulled further from the Sun or closer to the Sun . As PX is between Earth and Sun , it is presumed it will be closer to the Sun . Thus the Sun should appear larger in the sky every day , and heat everything more , making storms more powerful as more water evaporates . Perhaps roasting crops and animals and people in desert locations that already have temperatures of 110-130 . So we are 93 million miles from the Sun now , how close will we get , and how close have we gotten in the past , assuming this has already happened before . <p> SOZT The week of rotation stoppage is a week of terror for the people of Earth . The Sun either stands still in the sky or refuses to rise . But even though the Earth is temporarily drawn toward the monster Planet X in the skies , making it seem to grow in size as it writhes with its many tentacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much change in the temperature of the atmosphere . Planet X is blocking the way , blocking the path between the rays of the Sun and the Earth . The massive dust cloud of Planet X is being hosed directly at the Earth , and thus the seeming appearance of tentacles reaching toward Earth . Dust clouds are a shield from sunlight , as those under a volcanic gloom can attest . EOZT <p> and second reason is ancient legends of Nanai ( Golds ) people living in middle Amur river basin in Russian Far East . I 've knew about this tale long ago and it was a puzzle for me. i thought that either it was an exaggeration , or Earth had to be pulled closer to the Sun . <p> Amurian golds ( Nanai people ) describe the World Catastrophe : " three luminaries rose instead of one .

When fishes jumped out of water they lost their scales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed themselves and night became so bright that people could n't fall asleep " <p> So Earth assuming Venus orbit temporarily could be the explanation .

It is speculated there is only one object , a moving object , but there are two . If they were found 6 Sun-Pluto distances away , Sedna , which orbits the Earth , was found to move- 3 Sun-Pluto- distances away during its orbit . Are these new objects in orbit around Earth ?

There will be many who will just sit down and die ( if they are not already killed ) post PS because they ca n't handle the loss . For those of us in the First World , who essentially live like only Kings could live in the past .. it is a long way to fall . However go back 150 years and most people lived in relatively primitive conditions quite like we will have post PS . Many in the 3rd world live like that right now .

Primitive survival is hard .. but quite possible . And it is quite possibe to be happy .. enjoying the simple things of life .. good company , and family . A spirit source told me that surviving the Earth Changes was like crossing a stony desert to get to good land on the other side . Attitude is everything . You should endure the hardship and discomfort with good grace knowing that it is temporary and that things will be better on the other side . Just get on with it ... if you bitch and moan you will just make things worse for yourself and everyone else .

When we analyzed some hoaxes in 2004 we pointed out the characteristics - straight , rather than curved , lines , small in size , and in locations distant from public view . This current hoax also has very easy access from side roads . " <p> " In the past , crop circles have been laid down over immense areas and with great complexity , involving hundreds of items . This presented challenges to the hoaxers , claiming to have laid them by boards and string . <p> " In the past , we resisted explaining the meaning of crop circles , encouraging the public to come to their own conclusions and listen to their subconscious while gazing at the circles . But in 2004 , this changed , and we did a series of analyses on their meaning . By late 2004 , a different kind of hoax emerged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment . Rather than try to duplicate circles while hoaxing , they would violate original circles , distorting their meaning ! <p> " In 2005 , the circle makers reacted to this disinformation technique by returning to extreme simplicity , returning to complexity only late in the season with designs that would be difficult to deface.In that Earth changes have intensified , and thus the threat circles represent have likewise intensified , the circle makers have once again returned to extreme simplicity for the 2006 season . " <p> CROP CIRCLES ( 2006 - 2009 ) <p> The following chronological summary contains authentic crop circles interpreted by the Zetas from 2006 through 2009 . <p> Crop Circles Part 2 includes more in-depth background on hoaxes and contains crop circles from 2010 through 2011 . <p> Crop Circles Part 3 explores the development of crop circle hoaxes and authentic crop circle defacing , and includes crop circles from 2012 to the present time . <p> Many thanks to Nancy Lieder , the Zetas and the Circle Makers for their tireless efforts to alert humanity of the coming times . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Avebury crop circle , where the magnetic fields emerge from the Earth and Planet X in a normal manner between them , but assume an abnormal range on the far side . The rings on the far side are preparing to merge , using the center of the combined fields as their point of exit and return . When this process completes , the Earth is literally bonded with Planet X , in a side-by-side position , which occurs during the week of rotation stoppage . <p> " Prior to this merged field situation , the Earth first attempts to hold to the Sun 's dominance , staying upright , then is forced into an end-to-end alignment with Planet X as it leans to the left and rolls into the 3 days of darkness and days of sunrise West . What Avebury is showing , as the present situation , is that the fields are clashing , at the point of merging , so the Earth will have difficulty remaining independent . " - <p> " These two crop circles , both appearing in Germany , have a singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle was given to the German people because of their renowned mechanical intelligence , which can grasp the meaning better than most . <p> " The circle represents defense , a perimeter , the 5 pointed star an unbroken line forming a series of triangles , also known to be difficult to break in structural analysis . What is approaching to break this defense ? Something with two large appendages , which Planet X and its two major moon swirls is known to be , the Winged Globe of lore . Planet X is turning in place during its 270- roll , pointing its N Pole outward toward Earth , and it is this action that penetrates the magnetic defenses of Earth . <p> " This turn is implied in the increasing size of Planet X in the April 23 crop circle . As it approaches and draws near to Earth , Earth backs away , trying to escape , temporarily changing the angle of these moon swirls as viewed from Earth . But still Planet X draws nigh , and the Earth begins to lean to the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles coming from the N Pole of Planet X. <p> " We have mentioned recently that Planet X was approximately 150- along in its roll , but the point when the Earth 's defenses were penetrated is already past , come earlier , as noted on the July 1 crop circle . This point occurred when the lurch , the temporary lean to the right , occurred . " <p> " Most of the legitimate circles laid this season are reflecting the quiesent period of late , the last couple months , while the Earth is attempting to align with Planet X in a type of side-by-side arrangement during his 270- roll , and thus not jerking back and forth in an attempt to align magnetically with the Sun . We have explained that this is temporary , a return to the wobble and lurch and a lean to the left to start , with a vengeance . Imagine Earth in the center of this Winterbourne circle , being battered back and forth between two opposing magnetic fields ! <p> " The Sun is dominant , with its N Pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be pointing its N Pole out . The poor Earth , who swings her N and S poles around daily to present to the Sun and Planet X , will attempt to please both masters . If you thought the wobble was extreme before , just wait ! What will this mean for the plates , which have been loosened up , rock fingers along the edges broken off , so they are slippery . More quakes , larger quakes , more distance during each movement , and the stretch zones pulled upon hard . The New Madrid , already showing stress , will not hold out much longer . " <p> " What is immediately noticed is that this is not a hoax , as the circular lines are too precise , in a barley field , too narrow to allow for correction in a manmade circle . The second immediate observation is that this circle is an oddity , compared to prior circles . <p> " Spirals have existed , but the placement of circles like beads along the spiral is new . Where the spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no pattern . We would point to another recent circle showing the jaring , rattling effect that competing magnetic fields will have on the Earth , soon . <p> " We have long warned that the lean to the left , leading into the 3 days of darkness , would be a time of great change on Earth . We have stated that there will be Earth changes we have not detailed , deliberately , so as to knock the establishment off its equilibrium so that the coverup might crack and the common man become aware of that which the establishment has been hiding from them . <p> " What does this crop circle tell man , about the next events to unfold ? That they will be increasing in severity , thus the number of beads as the spiral unfolds . That the Earth wobble will surely get worse , and be accompanied by events that will happen irregularly . That these events will have no discernable pattern that the establishment can use to plan their path . " <p> " If Yatesbury was telling you that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Eastfield circle is relating the annual cycles to the Magnetic Trimesters . As we have explained , the magnetic particle flows assaulting the solar system are strongest during May-Aug , weakest during Sep-Dec , and fairly quiescent from Jan-Apr . Thus , the active period is now . <p> " As we have explained , magnetic alignments during the strongest trimester are most intense , and more violent . At present the Earth is attempting to align side-by-side with Planet X as it is pointing it 's N Pole increasingly outward , away from the Sun . This is causing a slight lean to the right , the sun rising and setting too far to the North . At present , this has been a quiet period , as the Earth has not been lurching back and forth , attempting to align alternately with the Sun and Planet X , during this time . <p> " There are two factors that will end this quiet period . One is the steady progress of Planet X in his 270- roll , pointing his N Pole more directly at Earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand directly between the Earth and the Sun . The second factor is the end of the current Magnetic Trimester , which has Earth and Planet X glued more closely together , less lurching about for Earth . The lurch will return . " <p> " Night and day are clearly depicted in Abbots Down . But note that there is no tilt of the Earth present ! We have described the Lean to the Left as a point where the Earth will be basked evenly , in the Sun . At this point , when the Earth is falling on her side , there will be no doubt that Global Warming is not the cause of the weather irregularities , no doubt that solar emissions are not the cause of a warming Earth or electromagnetic surge on Earth , as neither would cause such a phenomena ! Rotation would continue , but the Sun would be rising and setting at a radically different place , worldwide . <p> " This crop circle , so simplistic in its presentation , is most direct . What else could it be representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were non-existent ! And as man presumes his tilt to be an ever present feature of life on Earth , what would cause such a situation ! Thus , this simple crop circle is designed to get those who view it thinking , at least subconsciously , about what might be tugging on the Earth , and to start to glance up at the rising and setting Sun , for verification that all is still normal . Of course , it is not normal , and this will increasingly be noticed . " <p> " Here again , the Magnetic Trimesters are depicted , showing an extreme during one trimester . One trimester is shown as weighted with a double weight , in fact , or certainly outside of what is expected as the other two trimesters are shown as equal . What will occur , during the dance going into the 3 Days of Darkness ? If the pole shift itself is the culmination , it is preceded by a slowing rotation , and a stopped rotation that will last almost 6 days . But by the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already been around the dance floor and are numb with the gyrations the Earth will endure . The Lean to the Left happens over a period of time , which we decline to define , and is not a lineal affair nor one where the lean is the only phenomena going on . Then the N Pole of Earth slides away to point into darkness , point away from the Sun and Planet X which lies on a line between the Earth and Sun . <p> " In her desire to get her N Pole away from the magnetic influence of Planet X , who is pointing his N Pole directly at Earth at this time , Earth over compensates and almost stands upside down for 6 days , which Islamic literature describes as 6 days of sunrise West . Then straightens back up for a side by side alignment with Planet X who by this point has likewise straightened up , North up , South down . <p> " Milkhill is stating that these dramatic changes will take place in the main during a single trimester . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to safe locations , a strong Lean to the Left is the clue . At this point , clinging to your old life , paying your bills and showing up for work , is no longer relevant ! " <p> " How extreme will the wobble become ? This crop circle is speaking to that . Note that the wobble is most extreme when Planet X is at a distance , and least extreme when it is close . Why would this be ? The wobble is caused by the Earth attempting to adjust to both the magnetic fields of the Sun and Planet X , at the same time . <p> " If the magnetic N Pole of Earth is hidden , the alignment is with the Sun , if exposed , pushed away by Planet X as Earth attempts to align with Planet X in some manner . This is the wobble in its extreme . When Planet X is close , it dominates the scene , and the wobble is replaced by a singular alignment with Planet X , as during the week of rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prior to the strong lean to the left moving into the last weeks , this crop circle is a clue ! " <p> " Westbury shows the course the N Pole of Earth will take during the months between now and a rotation stoppage . Note the N Pole first leans toward Planet X , as it has lately to a slight degree , then away from Planet X as moving into the 3 days of darkness , then aligning straight up for a side-by-side preceding the rotation stoppage . <p> " The implication is that the Earth will be virtually upside down , and rightside up , at least twice , in addition . We have hinted that the Earth will have many gyrations before it is pushed into the inevitable path leading to the 3 days of darkness , and this crop circle give detail on some of those gyrations . Man will be stunned at what the Earth will do , as litter along the highway that Planet X must travel . " <p> " Circles around a central circle are often interpreted to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens when moons , many moons , are hovering around a large planet . The planets in the inner solar system have few moons , the Earth one , and Jupiter , the largest planet in the solar system , having more than a dozen . Planet X , as we have stated , has at least two dozen , which form into swirls trailing behind Planet X as it travels . One of the moons even has its own moon . <p> " Looking head on toward Planet X one sees a dance between these swirls , which appear as wings to the side , the- Winged Globe of legend . The two major moons attempt to position themselves equidistant on either side of Planet X , thus the wings , each complete with a portion of the charged dust cloud that clings to Planet X. <p> " What does the outer ring of 14 moons represent ? That these minor moons keep their distance from the action , arranging themselves in one of the major moon swirls or another , depending upon where the tail is wafting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field lines , this crop circle shows a hapless planet caught at the boundaries . The planets in the solar system all try to align with the Sun , as we have explained , aligning along the magnetic flow lines if not on the Ecliptic , or in the case of the gaseous planets , the reverse of the Sun 's magnetic flow as these giants act as a conduit . But when a strong magnet comes near , as will occur during the passage as Planet X passes the Earth , there is a clash . Here , in this crop circle , the Earth is just starting to be touched by the field of Planet X , the current status . " <p> " We have hinted that high drama will occur during the passage , not yet detailed by ourselves and thus a surprise to the establishment . We hope for the establishment to be discombobulated , so that the cover-up shatters and the truth is blurted out by the media . The approach and exit of Planet X is often depicted in crop circles as increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as viewed from Earth . At first , as infinitesimal as a dim star , but at passage as large as the Sun due to its dust cloud and writhing moon swirls . We have stated that Planet X pierces the Ecliptic at approximately the halfway point between the Earth and the Sun , 45 million miles or so . At this point , it stands upright and draws the Earth close to it , for a distance of 14 million miles . At this point , the slowing of Earth 's rotation to a stop occurs . This would all seem to imply that a single approach of Planet X to the Earth occurs , as then , after the pole shift , Planet X zooms on out of the solar system . <p> " The Eastfield crop circle implies that Planet X draws near , then retreats , then draws near again during a severe wobble where it seems to be in two places at once in the sky , then draws the Earth close during the rotation stoppage , then takes off again . At present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , so close as to be lost in the glare . Planet X is closing the gap , coming ever closer and will come near enough to be visible to many on Earth . But as we have explained , the Point of Passage places Planet X further from the Earth , as shown by the angles of the ZetaTalk Triangle which appeared in two Wisconsin crop circles on July 4 , 2003 . As Planet X swings its N Pole toward Earth , there is a clash , the N Pole of Planet X wanting to evade the N Pole of Earth , and vice versa . Thus , Earth pushes back in her orbit as far as possible , creating this distance , so that Planet X will diminish in size . Nevertheless , Planet X is still coming closer , closing the gap , more distance from the Sun , less distance from Earth , even though offset to the right . <p> " How will the establishment explain a temporary appearance of Planet X in the sky , followed by a diminished size offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Planet X in the sky along with a severe wobble ? A dancing asteroid ? A permanent solar flare that dances around the Sun ? And what of the wobble ? " <p> " This beautiful design is in the formation of a butterfly as all of humankind is familiar with their fluttering wings , which point skyward together when at rest , or out to the side , while sunning and airing . Yet regardless of position , the wings always touch at the top of the butterfly 's body , the pivot point . <p> " We have stated that Planet X is coming toward the Earth in a retrograde orbit , now slightly to the right of the Sun as the Earth scuttles back in her orbit to avoid the pressure of magnetic particles coming from Planet X , which is increasingly pointing its N Pole toward Earth . <p> " We have mentioned that as Planet X turns in place and the Earth is forced into an extreme wobble by the repulsion of their respective N Poles , that Planet X will seem to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triangle position , becoming more visible in the skies as it does , so as it can now reflect sunlight at a proper angle for Earth viewing . <p> " Does this changed position mean less stress on the Earth , as the N Pole of Planet X will be temporarily pushed away ? No , as with the butterfly wings , there is some point where the magnetic fields will touch , and this clash point can not be evaded . " <p> " This is a legitimate circle , and is speaking to the subconscious of man regarding the effect of rotation on planets and their atmospheres and moons - in effect on all that a rotation drags around with it . The Earth is currently experiencing a wobble that has many unaware of the presence of Planet X puzzled . They see the errant location of the Sun and Moon at times , and are getting no answers from the establishment . <p> " Such a wobble forces air over Europe , causing fierce storms . It creates weather extremes for N America - cold and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds or prevailing westerlies dragging behind the turning Earth , then what is causing these extremes ? This crop circle is intended to make mankind wonder , and notice the extremes . " <p> " As we have mentioned , there are three planets caught in the cup , the eddy flow of subatomic particles coming round Planet X as they flow outbound from the Sun . The Earth and her Dark Twin are very close in dimension and mass , which is why they assumed the position of a shared orbit in the first place . Venus is likewise close to this size , being slightly less in mass than the Earth . <p> " The crop circle indeed represents their restless life in the cup , as the sweeping arms of the Sun push them together periodically . When the Earth came round in her orbit in December , 2003 and encountered Planet X in her path , she halted her orbit . Venus and the Dark Twin later joined her in a halted orbit when they later arrived . Once in the cup , a ricochet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the timing of a sweep . <p> " The sweeping arms of the Sun are outbursts of particle flows and occur 8 times a year . This is depicted in the Barbury Castle crop circle as 4 lines , each line having at least two clash points associated with it . The sweeping arms burst out from both sides of the Sun , uniformly , and thus are in opposition on the crop circle design . <p> " The Earth halted in her orbit in December , 2003 but has since been pushed back counterclockwise in her orbit to the September position , which the small solid dot next to the Sun in relation to the three planets represents . What is the message being given by this crop circle design ? As Planet X draws closer , pushing the three planets in the cup closer together , ricochet will occur with more intensity , resulting in more violent earthquakes on Earth . " <p> " This stunning crop circle is speaking to mankind about the current Earth wobble , which will soon develop beyond the simple Figure 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The two Figure 8s are seen overlapping , assuming first one posture and then another in an almost smooth line . This movement is a predecessor to the severe wobble which the Earth will at some point assume going into the 3 days of darkness . The Earth wobble , the Figure 8 , will have another wobble superimposed upon it , a back and forth motion of the globe . <p> " It has been noted that the overlapping Figure 8 is also a symbol meaning that associated text quoted is legalese , quoting law . In that man can not escape the pole shift , the behavior of your home planet Earth is only adhering to laws governing your portion of the Universe , so to speak . " <p> " Looking like an interlocking YinYang symbol , or perhaps the symbol for infinity , this crop circle has been understood to have significant meaning by all who view it . What do the scallops mean around the edge , and why the count of 25 for the tiny dots found there ? Once again this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documented by Nancy during 2004-2005 and again confirmed in 2007 and 2008 . Move ahead 25 months from June 20 , 2008 and you arrive at late July , 2010 . Make of this what you will ! " <p> " The Secklendorf crop circle has merged many elements of the coming pole shift . We have warned that the pole shift will occur toward the end of a magnetic trimester , and the trimesters are clearly central to this design . The notched circles are indicative of trauma points , with major trauma at the end of one trimester . Minor trauma is experienced during the pole shift year during the other trimesters . <p> " What of the orbs in the outer circle ? These seem to be planets , of equal size in many instances , but what does the placement mean ? Earth , Venus , and the Dark Twin are of equal size . Earth and Venus are allowed to be crowded together , caught in the cup , the eddy flow in front of Planet X , as they are in separate orbits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal size , the Dark Twin , is behind the Earth in their shared orbit as the Repulsion Force keeps them apart . But what of the odd cluster on the opposite side of the circle - planets of unequal size ? <p> " Going into the pole shift , approaching the end of the magnetic trimester when the pole shift will occur , there will be clashes between the planets , including clashes with Planet X itself . As Planet X approaches the Earth , the cup of the eddy flow tightens , forcing Earth and Venus toward Planet X , the larger orb , as it does so . The Dark Twin falls outside of the cup at this point , thus becoming a minor element during the last weeks . " <p> What the Zetas can tell about a- crop circle near Zierenberg , Germany ? This cropcircle has any communication with cropcircle " Secklendorf " ? <p> " This crop circle is a simplistic reminder of the magnetic trimesters , where Secklendorf was complex . Secklendorf included major Earth change notches , and the positions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Dark Twin . There is endless speculation among those hungry for a timeline clue , as to how the present and past line up , so a timeline to the future can be grasped . But since the planets and notches do not come with labels , this has proved to be an elusive conclusion . By the time Secklendorf is understood with certainty , mankind will be well on its way to being in the 8 of 10 scale point , and the issue will be moot . " <p> " This circle and the addition a day later are both legitimate designs , not hoaxes . If you assume the original circle to represent the Earth and its core , then the additions indicate the effect on the Earth of a consistent and violent wobble . We have described the Earth turning under her mantle of air and the waters in her oceans , so that the wobble increases air turbulence and high tides . But herein as described is more that is affected by a wobble , as there are thousands of particle flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affected , as will the magma under the surface , so that man and his equipment will be affected as the wobble worsens . Of this we can say no more . " <p> " The Wayland crop circle is completely balanced within its four parts . What does this mean ? We have made the statement that the seasons will seem to blend into one another before the pole shift . Since the Earth experiences four seasons , on both hemispheres , this is the message . Expect snow in summer , warm days in winter , and the complete confusion that ensues creating even more crop shortages . " <p> " In the Wiltshire crop circle , the opposite message is being delivered . The three magnetic trimesters , which each comprise four months of the Earth year , are shown equally balanced except for the dots closest to the center . Here , the trimesters differ , with one being stronger , one weakening , and one a full dot short of being equal to the others . Do you notice the differences while looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a timeline design , and clearly shows three stages . Planet X is the larger planet with more than one moon , and the Earth the smaller planet with a single Moon . At first , the Earth tries to align with Planet X , and thus the wobble has ensued . This is represented on the right where the planets are on top of one another with the wobble depicted as a fork , one side of the wobble ( or prong ) more extreme than the other . <p> " Next , in the center design , the Earth goes end to end with Planet X , almost tipping over in this attempt during the 3 days of darkness which morphs into 6 days of sunrise west as the globe overcompensates while tipping over . This is also a time of some twisting and turning by Planet X , which shortly rights itself when it crosses the ecliptic and is in a position , as depicted in the design on the left , to align with the magnetic field lines on the northern side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowing her rotation and drawing closer to Planet X , both planets are in a side-by-side arrangement . " <p> " Elegant in its simplicity and sure to get attention as the first of the season and quite early in the season , this crop circle is making a single point . Wherever on the globe , in whatever country , whatever the leadership may be emphasizing , and whatever the concerns of the populace of the attitudes of the culture - all people 's of the Earth expect there to be four seasons . These seasons may differ , depending upon the latitude or hemisphere , but they are recognized and relied upon as guideposts for living . Farmers plant by the seasons . Street plowing services maintain snow plowing equipment based on the seasons . And families plan vacations based on the seasons . There is no citizen of the Earth who could look upon this first circle of the 2009 season without being reminded of this fact . Thus , with this image lingering in their minds , they also can not help but make the comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . Anything but regular . It begs the question - why the change ? " <p> " This crop circle represents the wobble , with the variations in the wobble as experienced on various parts of the globe represented where there are differences in the pattern . Where the pattern has consistency in the circle , this represents what would be the normal rotation of the Earth , sans the wobble . " <p> " The Claford crop circle is once again showing the steps we have outlined for the passage . At first , Planet X and the Earth are in their own sphere 's , barely influenced by each other . The first undeniable sign that Planet X is in the vicinity will be the prophesied 3 days of darkness for the northern hemisphere . This is where Planet X is pointing its N Pole almost directly at the Earth , and to evade this hose of magnetic particles , the Earth tips its N Pole almost directly away from Planet X. After this , Planet X prepared to pass through the Sun 's Ecliptic , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth once again to gain its balance , doing the same . But following this period these two planets are drawn closer in a side-by-side magnetic alignment . This is represented in the crop circle by the dual bar arrangement . In that the Earth is the lesser in bulk , it is drawn closer to Planet X during this phase , causing the appearance of Planet X to increase in the sky and terrifying the populace . Finally , there is a pole shift and Planet X moves off to continue its journey . " <p> " We have explained that the Serpentine Dance represents the magnetic interplay between Planet X and the Earth . The planets in your solar system orbit counterclockwise , and rotate counterclockwise . Planet X during its periodic passage of the Sun orbits in a retrograde manner , clockwise , and also rotates in a clockwise manner . The particle flows that sling out from any planetary body as it turns thus clash when the Earth and Planet X come close to each other . <p> " What this recent crop circle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the clash become more than an influence causing the Earth to wobble . There is an addition swoop superimposed on the Serpentine Dance , that is immense . It is depicted as laying sideways to the serpent , representing the effect on the Earth which will lay on its side during the pole shift , and at a point prior to the pole shift during the lean to the left that precedes the 3 days of darkness . <p> " This diagram is trying to relay to mankind the extent of the magnetic confusion and consequent adjustments that the Earth will be forced to assume . If the Serpentine Dance has created your current weather and quake increase , your current Earth wobble , then this has all just been a cake walk , an easy path . The real dance is before you , and will be horrific . " <p> " The jellyfish is well know to the population , and this crop circle certain to be recognized as a symbol of such a sting , often fatal . Planet X , as we have so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirling around and giving the complex the appearance of a writhing dragon in the skies during the last weeks . The tail lashes the Earth , filled with debris and red dust , peppering the ground with hail . This is a warning that even when the monster itself seems to have passed , that the tail may continue to whip and lash the Earth for several hours afterwards , during the passage . It is the stingers of the jellyfish that burn and poison , not the soft head . " <p> " The symbolism of a buzzing dragonfly has been depicted before in a crop circle . Our explanation was at that time that the dragonfly represented the struggle Planet X has in punching through the crowded Ecliptic , and this still applies for this more recent crop circle . <p> " What has changed ? This time the gyrations that occur during the pole shift are depicted on the tail of the dragonfly . Reversals , from one side to the other . Times when the Earth will have a long night or a short night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the first scenarios going into the last weeks . " <p> " What does the image of a bird with a smoldering tail relay to mankind , especially when the bird itself has a pecking bird upon its back ? Some static situation , as neither is in flight . What is the Earth enduring today ? Planet X has worked its way past the S Pole of the Sun , turned in place to point its magnetic N Pole outward away from the Sun , and is positioned to hammer the Earth during the last weeks before it takes flight and leaves the solar system . This is the larger bird . What of the smaller bird , pecking its back ? This represents what Earth today is enduring , small in proportion to what the larger bird would inflict . The worst is yet to come . " <p> " This is a genuine circle and not a hoax . It was amended on the two days following to show a progression . We have explained that in the last weeks the Planet X complex will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , Planet X is visible now , on occasion , as a Second Sun or object with tail on SOHO images , but we are talking about a visibility that can not be denied . The complex will look as large as the Sun , approaching from the direction of the Sun . At first the appearance will be of an irregular orb , striated . By the next day , the tail will be visible and unmistakable . By the third day , the double helix appearance which showed up as Planet X made its entry into the inner solar system will be visible . " <p> " This crop circle depicts the 5.9 days of rotation stoppage , which ends in a 90 degree crustal shift during the hour of the pole shift . Planet X approaches in a retrograde orbit , coming at the Earth from a clockwise direction during the passage . This is shown by the clockwise lines swinging into the crustal shift . Pressure builds during this 6.9 day stoppage , represented by the increasing size of the orbs over this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by the material added on the second day . The Earth appears to be almost in a pincer during this time , which it is . It has the dictates from the Sun , and the dictates from Planet X , to which it finally succumbs . " <p> " In a year when crop circles had assumed the shape of familiar animals or insects , the familiar mushroom emerged . The flight of Planet X has been compared to the flight of a bird or an insect , as its approach in the last weeks will be seen as unrelenting . But what of the approach at the current time , when Planet X is almost always lost in the glare of the Sun , and the dark cover of the cover-up is in place . Mankind has been left in the dark , due to the cover-up , to grope about for meaning in the increasing earthquakes and fireballs . The wobble , signified by the shifting positions of the orbs in the mushroom cap , will become increasingly erratic , swinging from side to side as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lean to the left . Meanwhile , like the spores from the bottom of a mushroom cap , debris from the tail of Planet X are making news on Earth . Still , the public is not told the truth . Mushrooms also appear unexpectedly , and it is in like manner that Planet X will appear to mankind . " <p> " Here the increasing size of the Planet X complex as the time of the passage approaches can be seen . The double helix swirl blowing back from either side of the planet corpus . Folklore reports that the complex increases in size just before the passage , growing in size to equal the size of the Sun or Moon in the sky . This growth happens not only because Planet X is steadily moving outward toward Earth , but primarily because the Earth is drawn toward Planet X. <p> " We have described this in ZetaTalk . This occurs during the week of rotation stoppage and the few days preceding it . Planet X will be approximately midway between the Earth and Sun to start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two planets .

Measurements made over the past six months confirm the general trend of the field 's weakening , with the most dramatic declines over the Western Hemisphere . But in other areas , such as the southern Indian Ocean , the magnetic field has strengthened since January . The latest measurements also confirm the movement of magnetic North towards Siberia . <p> The Earth 's magnetic field has been confused and disbursed , seen as weakening by the scientists , for some time .

It therefore reflects all wafting about that the liquid core might do , from this side to the other , or up and down . When the Sun is centered over the Pacific , the polar push point , the magnetic N Pole of the core is pushed to Siberia , which is why intense magnetism shows there on the Swarm graphic and to the left of S America near Antarctica .

The- South Atlantic Anomaly- is a weak point in the crust that acts like a second S Pole . The South Atlantic Anomaly is on the opposite side of the globe , at the same latitude , as the traditional Tasmania S Pole . If the magnetic N Pole of the core prefers to remain in Siberia , the magnetic S Pole prefers to remain near Tasmania .

@@36454515 @5454515/ <p> Stretching along the Atlantic has been recorded during 2002 , when trail derailments , exploding buildings , and sudden sinking of land occurred . In the Pacific , compression has resulted in increasing volcanic activity along the ring of fire , but also in movement of the continents in the direction we have predicted they would move during the shift ! We have stated that new land would emerge between the tip of South America and Africa . This is caused by a plate that extents into the Pacific being pushed down there , so it pops up between the tips . During this , the tip of South American moves into the Pacific . This has repercussions in the Caribbean and Central America . This part of the world , the Caribbean , is obviously in a stretch zone , as roads and fences can be seen under the waves off Bermuda . Stretching in this part of the world will cause volcanoes to ooze , explode , as the surface will be weaker . As the Pacific pushes under the North American continent , simultaneously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are moving up as well as under , as the compression goes in all directions . Thus , there is continuous pressure for the slip-slide of the many fault lines along this stretch to move , which they are doing . That this is new , a type of quake not reported in the past , should not be astonishing . Where are the quake statistics to compare against , 3,600 years ago ? <p> ( 2 ) Zeta94 : Torque Effect ; written May 1 , 2004 <p> What happens under the stress of whiplash applied every few days to the Earth where the surface plates are tugged apart and rubbed along or over each other until weak places have separated or snapped and the plates now ready to move ? For the past year , the surface plates have exhibited Global Quakes , but until the Dark Twin arrived at the Earth 's rear door , these were relatively benign . Whiplash , a back and forth jerk , is more than twice the effect of a single jerk in one direction , the mode during the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one direction , and in one direction only , occurred because the Earth was tugged back from its normal rotation direction . This may break rock , fracture rock flakes that create resistance at the fault lines , but the whiplash that has now set in snaps these rock flakes off by tugging in opposite directions . <p> First the Dark Twin bumps the Earth from behind , causing it to move faster in the direction it is going , normal rotation . Thus rushed , it encounters the magnetic field of Planet X where the Atlantic Rift is grabbed and jerked back from normal rotation direction . When the Sweep nudges the Earth again into the arms of Planet X , and Planet X hops the Sweep to press back against the Earth , the effect on the Earth is no worse than before whiplash set in , but for the smooth surfaces now along many fault lines , allowing the plates to move more freely . When the Earth is thrown back on the Dark Twin at the end of the Sweep cycle , there is a repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first encouraged to rotate faster by the glancing blow the encounter in essence is , and then is jerked back by being pushed closer to the magnetic field of Planet X which grabs the Atlantic Rift again . A double whiplash , at the start and at the end of the cycle . <p> By gripping the Atlantic Rift , the cause of the Global Quakes that have racked the Earth for over a year , Planet X is creating a slow continental drift . The Atlantic Rift is held back when it faces or is in opposition to Planet X , creating not only a pile up in the plates following the rift , but also tearing apart the rift by the momentum to the East . This process continues during whiplash , but what is the effect on the plates on either side of the rift when a void is created ? There is a slide into the void , on the side experiencing a pileup , and thus the N American Plate is dropping into the void , relieving the stress of compression along its northern border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does so . During the pileup in the Pacific , the Indio-Australian Plate is being jammed under the Himalayans , causing this plate to drop and creating another void in the Indian Ocean . This is the cause of the African Rift , and this great continent once again is pulled into the void , thus the recent noticeable stress in the region of the African Rift . <p> The overall effect of this drift , which will increase in speed and force as the whiplash proceeds , will be a torque . Hold the globe with the left hand on the N Pole , the right hand on the S Pole , and turn in opposite directions first this way , then back . The N Pole going in the direction of rotation with the S Pole held back , the torque forces the N American Plate down and into the Caribbean , East moving in the direction of SE . The S Pole pulled back by a grab on the Atlantic Rift in the Southern Hemisphere with the N Pole held rigid has the Indo-Australian Plate plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again East turning to SE . This does more than sink the SE United States and pull apart the African Rift , it pulls the entire oil rich Middle East into a skew . How is it that all that oil dropped into the cracks in the rock in that region , eons ago , during prior pole shifts ? The rock was shattered , during just such torque maneuvers . Thus , where we stated that something would occur to pull victory from the jaws of the Bush/Blair coalition before the pole shift , something that would take the breath out of the body it would be so dramatic and unexpected , this region is ripe to present many surprises to those who would be kings in the Aftertime . <p> ( 3 ) Zeta261 : N American Rip ; written Feb 10 , 2006 <p> We have discussed what we call the stretch zone , where a land mass is pulled apart so that the rock flakes pull across each other , silently , creating sinkholes and rifts and manifesting as broken gas and water mains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the African Rift area and in the SE United States and in the UK during the past couple years . When Planet X arrived in the inner solar system in 2003 and began seriously tugging at the highly magnetized Atlantic Rift , it accentuated this stretch on either side of the Atlantic . What went unstated during these discussions is why a stretch zone occurs . Look at S America , on the large S American plate . As the Atlantic is pulled apart , the Pacific compressed , it is required to have the upper part migrate to the West more than the tip , which is anchored at Antarctica . It moves as a whole , in the main , crunching the small plates in the Caribbean and Central America as it does so and popping the plate holding the Galapagos Islands which lies just to the west of S America . It can move , in short . But what of the African and N American plates ? <p> The African Rift is caused because Africa is not free to move . It is bulbous at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south end . It is anchored at the south end , at South Africa , so when the Atlantic pulls apart , the bulbous northern part of the African plate moves directly eastward , yawing open the African Rift , along with the Red Sea , which is also widening . This inability of plates to move during the ripping apart of the Atlantic and compression of the Pacific is what will create a new rift up through Pakistan and above the Himalayas into Russia during the pole shift , equivalent to the St. Lawrence Seaway in N America . The Indio-Australia plate moves in the direction of the Himalayas , diving under them . Hawaii rises up during compression of the Pacific , so can move , if only up . Japan likewise is forced up , violently so , during Pacific compression . The Antarctica plate , as we have mentioned , is pressed down in the Pacific so will pop up on the Atlantic side , creating new land there ultimately during the pole shift . <p> The giant plates of N America and Eurasia are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other due to their shape . Slip-slide along the West Coast , measured as a creep by geologists , is due only to slight adjustments along that edge of the plate , primarily due to adjustments within the small plates to the west of the N American plate , which move to accommodate pressure . The N American plate does not move , pre se , but other dramas occur . We explained , months before it expressed enough to show up on IRIS charts , the Earth torque caused as the N Pole continuing to rotate to the East while the S Pole was held back by Planet X , tending to open the globe like a jar of pickles . This creates a diagonal stress on the N American continent where New England is pulled to the east while Mexico is pulled to the West , so the New Madrid is put under slip-slide stress where one half , east of the Mississippi , will move toward the NE while the other , west of the Mississippi , moves toward the SW . The virtual hook of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid rock and will not snap off to become a separate land plate , nor would this ease the deadlock along the N American and Eurasian plates even it if did . These massive plates can not move . <p> The stress on the N American plate will resolve by ripping . Ripping the St. Lawrence Seaway open . Pulling the SE down into the crumbling Caribbean and into the widening Atlantic , as neither of these sinking fronts will be able to support the edge of the weighty N American plate . There is pressure along the West Coast , of course , and as the N American plate confronts the compressing Pacific , this will only result in the predictable volcanic increases and West Coast earthquakes . But the primary drama preceding the pole shift will be the ripping action that a plate unable to move must endure . The notable area of catastrophe during this is the eastern half of the continental US . From Houston to Chicago to New England , the diagonal pull will tear the underpinning of cities and create a catastrophe for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A widening Seaway also does not affect just those land masses bordering the Seaway , as buckling occurs inland and afar . What does man assume caused the Black Hills to be so rumpled , with the appearance of a recent bucking and heaving ? This is the center of a land plate ! The tearing of the Seaway does not end at Duluth , MN , it travels underground to S Dakota ! <p> ( 4 ) ZetaTalk Chat Q&amp;A for June 12 , 2010 <p> The Pacific Plate is assumed to be a single plate , but it is not . Hawaii , which rides higher after every major adjustment in the area , is rising , and this can only be the case if there is subduction of a plate somewhere , pushing the plate that Hawaii rides on up . The Society Island are on a chain that forms a line with the Hawaii Islands , and such a rise is not a coincidence . This is also a fault line , where a plate that is subducting under the Americas is rising commensurately along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kamchatka to the Society Islands , and both will rise during the pole shift .

New Zealand is expected to rise a total of 500 feet during the pole shift , which will essentially offset the 675 foot rise in sea level expected worldwide within two years after the pole shift . Thus , the islands of West Samoa can anticipate being , in the main , above the waves . There is likewise a portion of the Pacific Plate pushing under Japan and forcing the Philippine Plate to dive under Indonesia . This is tipping this part of the Pacific Plate so that the Marshall Islands and parts to the southwest of those islands are rising . These islands will benefit from the pole shift , though will not gain the altitude that West Samoa will . <p> ( 5 ) ZetaTalk Chat Q&amp;A for June 19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Earth changes , and well before the tipping of the Indo-Australian Plate during the hour of the pole shift . We have mentioned that plates being raised will often bend at the point where they are rising up from ground level , and thus losing the support they used to enjoy . This is occurring along the East Coast of the US at or around Pennsylvania and Maryland , where all the sinkholes and bursting water mains are occurring . North of that point , the land is rising as it is freed from connection to the banks of the seaway . South of that point , it is sinking as it is pulled down when the Atlantic spreads . For Australia this breaking point occurs 1/3 of the way across the continent from the eastern shore . East of that point it is rising from the magma , and west of that point being pushed down into the magma so the plate can plunge under the Himalayas .

The southern islands are situated on the great Eurasian Plate , and fare the best because this plate is massive and stable . The northern islands are on a tongue of the great N American Plate , but this tongue is likewise stable although it comes under extreme stress particularly at its tip , sometimes called the Okhotsk Plate . It is the pressure from the Pacific that is the issue , as the Pacific is compressing . Likewise , the Philippine Plate is at issue , as it loses in the compression game and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tipping , rising at the Mariana Islands and diving under the tongue of the Eurasian Plate that holds Indonesia . This tongue is itself being pushed down . Imagine the domino effect of the Mariana Trench folding against the Philippine Plate , tipping this sideways to drive the western edge under the tongue holding Indonesia , which is at the same time breaking and bending to subduct under the curve of the Indo-Australian Plate . This is a domino pressure , happening almost simultaneously . The scenario guarantees that the islands of southern Japan will be doing mountain buildings , particularly at the point where these plates converge at Mt . Fuji . The pressure from the compressing Pacific is applied directly on the northern islands of Japan , however , where the Pacific Plate is pushing under these islands . Thus when plate movement begins , there will first be a tipping and pushing down and under the south of Japan , and then as resistance here is eased , pressure on the northern part of Japan increases until an adjustment is made there likewise .

This part of the globe is held back , daily , which the globe attempt to turn during its rotation . This not only pulls that portion of the globe which is to the east of the Atlantic Rift forward , stretching the Atlantic Rift , but creates a pileup to the west .

Finally , the plates will be pressed to the point where major movement is next , as those weak points have already been exhausted . Hard rock against hard rock and NOW we see what will move . Lifting mountains along the Andes and Sierras is obviously no small thing . It is likewise true that pushing the Himalayas up is no small thing . But what is not obvious is that tipping a plate under the ocean is no less strenuous . We have described what will happen in Asia during all this tipping and subduction , but what about the plate movement in the Pacific that faces the Americas ? <p> As we indicated , the line of islands from Kamchatka through the Hawaii chain down thorough the Society Islands are a rise because the Pacific plate they are on is rising on that edge , and plunging under the N America Plate . <p> The Nazca Plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Andes and its western edge is rising . There are two forces driving the mountain building in the Americas that will occur prior to the pole shift . The first is Planet X holding back the Atlantic Rift so that a pileup occurs along the western coastlines of the Americas . The second is the pressure that rotation rolling forward during such times causes on pushing the Eurasian Plate over the plates in SE Asia and the Pacific . This is the squeeze the Pacific experiences daily . All points are under this pressure , but what must give first , as we have stated , is the brake point where the Indo-Australian Plate must tilt up and under the Himalayas .

" <p> Units of the Indian Army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force ( ITBP ) have reported Unidentified Flying Objects ( UFOS ) in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir . An ITBP unit based in Thakung , close to the Pangong Tso Lake , reported over 100 sightings of luminous objects between August 1 and October 15 this year . <p> According to a national news magazine , India Today , in reports sent to their Delhi headquarters in September , and to the Prime Minister 's Office ( PMO ) , they described sighting " Unidentified Luminous Objects " at day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the horizon on the Chinese side and slowly traverse the sky for three to five hours before disappearing . These were not unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVS ) , drones or even low earth-orbiting satellites , say Army officials who have studied the hazy photographs taken by ITBP . <p> Drone sightings are verified and logged separately . The Army has reported 99 sightings of Chinese drones between January and August this year : 62 sightings were reported in the western sector , the Ladakh region , and 37 in the eastern sector in Arunachal Pradesh . Three of these drones intruded into territory claimed by India along the 365-km-long border with China in Ladakh , manned by ITBP . Such mysterious lights have been sighted before in Ladakh , a barren , 86,000 sq km heavily militarised zone wedged between **25;1285;TOOLONG and Chinese-occupied Aksai Chin . The persistent sightings by the ITBP this year , however , worried the Army 's Leh-based 14 Corps . The ITBP , did not respond , the India Today said . <p> In September , the Army moved a mobile ground-based radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any object-to a mountaintop near the 160-km-long , ribbon-shaped Pangong Lake that lies between India and China . The radar could not detect the object that was being tracked visually , in dicating it was non-metallic . The spectrum analyser could not detect any signals being emitted from them . The Army also flew a reconnaissance drone in the direction of the floating object , but it proved a futile exercise . The drone reached its maximum altitude but lost sight of the floating object . <p> In late September this year , a team of astronomers from the Indian Astronomical Observatory at Hanle , 150 km south of the lake , studied the airborne phenomena for three days . The team spotted the flying objects , Army officials say , but could not conclusively establish what they were . They did , however , say that the objects were " non celestial " and ruled out meteors and planets . <p> Scientists however say , the harsh geography and sparse demography of the great Himalayan range that separates Kashmir Valley from Ladakh , lends itself to unusual sightings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and is one of the most isolated places in India , " says Sunil Dhar , a geologist at the government Post Graduate College in Dharamshala , who has studied glaciers in the region for 15 years . <p> Yet , none of the experts from the National Technical Research Organisation ( NTRO ) -in charge of technical intelligence-and Defence Research Development Organisation ( DRDO ) , has been able to identify the objects . This has caused embarrassment rather than fear in the establishment . " Something is clearly wrong , if our combined scientific resources ca n't explain the phenomena , " says a senior Army official in Delhi . Intelligence officials say these objects could be a crude psychological operation by China , or sophisticated probes attempting to ascertain India 's defences in Ladakh . <p> " We ca n't ignore these sightings .

Vij , had angrily dismissed the reports as hallucinations . <p> Scientists say the mysterious objects are not necessarily from outer space . There is no evidence of UFOS being of extra-terrestrial origin , says reputed Pune-based astrophysicist Jayant Narlikar . The implication of them being alien objects is fancy , not fact , he says . <p> There is still no explanation , however , for what is believed to be the clearest UFO sighting yet , in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh less than 100 km south of Ladakh in 2004 .

Copies of his detailed report were circulated to the PMO , ISRO , the Army and several intelligence agencies . Kulkarni established his team had n't seen natural phenomenon .

Pole " S.

It is no coincidence this article appears in Japan 's mainstream press given the abrupt termination of Japan 's NICT MagSim immediately after the infamous magnetosphere reversal . <p> As recorded in the magnetosphere deformations blog , Earth 's magnetosphere has been undergoing severe compressions with increasing frequency since 2009 and during a period of unusual dormancy in the Sun 's 11-year magnetic activity cycle . <p> The Zetas have long predicted the Establishment would blame the Sun for the many abnormalities visited upon the Earth by the unstoppable approach of Planet X.

Air heats up and the turmoil increases and this affects the weather and the weather creates earthquakes . That 's why we have a rise in earthquakes .

Since a C3 event is tiny , as solar flares go , they immediately took their SOHO satellites offline for " bakeout " maintenance so the non-event could not be viewed .

Thus , the many moons seen on SOHO and the Stereo images , with a drifting tail of dust , were to be explained away . By inferring that the Chile quake altered the rotation time span of the Earth , they are trying to put into the public 's mind the idea that quakes can affect rotation .

Solar flares affect the activity of fish and kelp in the sea , in that water bends and deflects some energy rays and thus concentrates them . Just as humans find themselves more restless during a full moon , life in the sea is a bit more restless during solar flares - energized . Solar flares do not affect the core of the Earth , nor are they causing increased earthquake activity . This explanation by the establishment for increased activity in the Earth 's core is to avoid mentioning the approach of the 12th Planet , and is easily rebutted .

It 's almost twice the size of Jupiter and just beyond our furthest planetoid , Pluto . Although it 's not a planet , it appears to have planets or large satellites encircling it . It 's what astronomers call a " brown dwarf star " and its official name is " G1.9 " .

When Planet X was inbound from 1997 to 2003 , we , the Zetas provided coordinates by which a dim star with bright fuzz around it could be seen tracking to our coordinates . Then in early 2003 when it passed from the night sky to be lost in the glare of the Sun , there were dramatic photos showing an approaching planet surrounded by a swirling double helix dust cloud on either side . After that , we entered the era of the Second Sun , when Planet X was close to the Sun in the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impact on the Earth 's magnetosphere . Now that their desperate attempts to blame the Sun or Global Warming for the Earth changes and Earth wobble , they are hoping to grasp the reins of leadership and announce they have found the source of all these perturbations ! Yes , it is G1.9 , which astronomers have suddenly located ! Is this the Sun 's binary ? No , the Sun 's binary is 18.74 Sun-Pluto distances away in the direction of the constellation Orion , and is static , not moving . Is this even a brown dwarf ? To fit in mankind 's description , a brown dwarf must be gaseous and huge , so that it could be , theoretically , an unlit star . Certainly the photos they are providing do not fit this description , as there is a light source from somewhere illuminating the red wings on either side , and if from this so-called brown dwarf , why is the dwarf itself unlit ? Is this , perhaps , a complete fraud , as amateur can not find this body . Astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Planet X have indeed invented a complete fraud . NASA is pretending to argue and ignore these astronomers , to give the illusion that they are not working together . Liars , all of them . <p> Do the Earth 's poles ever suffer a reversal during a pole shift ? No . The Earth 's polarity , where the magnetic North Pole points consistently in one direction as though focused on a distant point in the Universe , does not change , ever . This is an illusion , a hypothesis that humans have concocted to explain what they find in the Earth 's crust . In this hypothesis , they are assuming that the Earth 's crust does not move about , but it does . What humans are measuring is the confusion in the crust , and not the direction of the magnetic North Pole . Between pole shifts , however , there are slight movements of the magnetic North Pole , especially during the time just before and after a pole shift - approximately a hundred years on either side . The giant comet speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy into the pole shift will argue endlessly that it is the poles that move and reverse , and any discussion with such scientists should begin by first clarifying the pole shift premise . Sometimes , during a pole shift , the movement is slight , and sometimes literal reversals take place , where the crust does , as you say , a 180 . The coming shift will come close to that , being better than a quarter turn . Having only the Earth 's crust to examine , and being in denial or unaware of pole shifts , a human could only assume that the poles had moved , rather than the crust . - All rights reserved : ZetaTalk@ZetaTalk.com <p> The Zetas have long warned that in addition to blaming the Sun , the establishment would try to blame asteroid swarms for the increased debris in the skies from the tail of Planet X. <p> Here 's the NASA info and the new ZT on this matter : <p> LONG ... present a dynamical investigation of a newly found asteroid , 2010 SO16 , and the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The object 's absolute magnitude ( H = 20.7 ) makes this the largest object of its type known to-date .

@@36454537 @5454537/ <p> " What starts the process of the last weeks , with all their extreme gyrations , is a threshold being crossed . The dithering we have been describing - where Planet X , the Earth and the other planets caught in the cup ( Dark Twin and Venus ) are all bouncing around , reacting to movement in another , to crowding of magnetons or other particles " reaches an explosive point . During this time Planet X moves to the right as far as possible , to evade the ever increasing particle crowding , but is still outbound , steadily . Thus , visibility is enhanced , and Second Sun sightings are common . This is the start of the 7.3 week period we described , where it would be unmistakably visible to all on Earth . Venus escapes the cup . The Dark Twin escapes the cup . And the dance of many becomes a deadlock grip by Planet X on the Earth . It is no longer an issue of the Earth wobble or temporary leans to the left of into opposition sufficing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the years and months of the Earth wobble were the wrestlers positioning themselves at the edge of the mat , then the last weeks are full contact , and neither can let go of the other .

The Earth 's first evasion is to tilt her N Pole away from the oncoming Planet X to such a degree , and so violently , that she leans all the way over to the left and then REBOUNDS as a reaction all the way to the right . This is the severe wobble , for a length of 9 days , as a resent crop circle http : **39;1556;TOOLONG depicted . Finally , the rebound is repressed , for a lingering lean to the left of 4.5 days or so . Then a progression where the N Pole of Earth is pushed away from the Sun and the approaching Planet X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable . This progression is another 2-3 days in time . Then the 3 days of darkness and the 6 days of sunrise west , which is a momentum and turnaround for the swing into the 3 days of darkness . <p> " Then the Earth rights herself , side by side with Planet X , and begins her rotation slowdown . It is during this time that the Earth is drawn toward Planet X , so that Planet X quickly increases in size in the skies and is the writhing monster of legend . Slowing rotation is not a linear matter , but exponential as the Earth is pulled closer to Planet X. The Earth moans , groans , and complains as the core pulls at the crust but the crust is gripped , increasingly , and held by Planet X. The slowing is a lurching matter too , as when the Atlantic Rift is exposed , the grip slows the rotation , but when hidden , rotation tries to return . All this causes earthquakes and stretch zone accidents . Emergency management teams are beyond exhaustion , government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . " - ZetaTalk <p> - <p> Note : 3 Days of Darkness applies only to the northern hemisphere. - The southern hemisphere will experience " three days of light , from dusk to dawn without nightfall . " ZetaTalk - Oct 3 , 2009 <p> I have read information on your webpage . You claim , the earth will lean to the left before the pole shift and the sun will rise in the west . But sunrise in the west is not possible , even if the earth would stand upside down . Therefore the earth will have to stop first and begin to rotate in the opposite direction . So there is something wrong with this information . Look at this picture for example . Here stands the earth upside down , but people in Florida could see the sunrise still before it could do people in California . <p> " You are incorrect and not thinking this through , but confusion is understandable . Nancy has reviewed our ZetaTalk on this matter and there is a missing piece of the puzzle , which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to rotate in the direction it does today . When the globe is tipped almost upside down , and turning in the same manner as today , land is still moving from what was formerly west to what was formerly east . Sunrise west occurs just after the lean to the left with the globe then sliding its N Pole away from the Sun into the 3 days of darkness . These steps occur because Planet X is approaching from the right , in its retrograde orbit . Even during the 3 days of darkness and days following when the Earth is trying to right itself from being almost upside down , the N Pole is thus still leaning somewhat to the left , avoiding the approaching N Pole of Planet X. The time when the Earth is almost upside down is very brief , not even the span of a day , with the remainder of the 6 days of sunrise west occurring when the Earth is righting itself from the position it was in during the 3 days of darkness . Thus , the N Pole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . These gyrations of Earth occur as the Earth is rolling with Planet X during its 270- roll , in which it moves from having its N Pole nosed into the S Pole of the Sun to pointing its N Pole outward toward Earth ( a total 180- turn ) and then standing upright with its N Pole up ( the remaining 90- ) . Planet X has been doing the first part of the 270- roll for some years now , ever since it passed the S Pole of the Sun in 2004 and began moving outbound . <p> " The last weeks begin because Planet X moves to station itself almost directly between the Earth and Sun . Before that point the Earth merely has a wobble , allowing its N Pole to be pushed away daily . But as Planet X moves between the Earth and Sun , the Earth comes into the grip of Planet X completely . During the last weeks , the Earth changes from being in an end-to-end alignment with Planet X to being in a side-by-side alignment . It is during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N Pole directly at the Earth , that the lean to the left and 3 days of darkness occur . But as Planet X continues in its retrograde orbit , its N Pole is no longer coming from the right , but is located to the left of the Earth , and the Earth adjusts by slinging its N Pole to the right . Thus , during the 6 days of sunrise west , the Earth still has its N Pole tipped away from the Sun and the approaching Planet X , but rather than a lean to the left , it has a lean to the right . It is at this point that the Earth switches from being in an end-to-end alignment to being in a side-by-side alignment with Planet X. When Planet X is just at the Ecliptic , it stands upright in alignment with the Sun , the dominant magnet in the solar system . As it switches from pointing its N Pole at Earth , as it had during the many years of the wobble , to completing its 270- roll and pointing its N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that the Earth is drawn closer to Planet X , so that only 14 million miles separates them . It is then that the Earth slows in her rotation to a stop , for the week of rotation stoppage . " <p> I have n't studied it yet either , but putting it on a calendar was very helpful and appreciated .... remember pole shift at end of trimester , either month of Aug , Dec or April . Please keep posting the additions , this is great work ! . <p> The Earth tips away from PX and then overcompensates into 6 days of Sunrise west , as Planet X completes it 's first 270 degree roll to stand upright . The Earth will align and remain upright with Planet X as Planet X grabs Earth and pulls it closer , slowly causing an inevitable rotation stoppage that will last for 5.9 days . Planet X will grow in size as viewed from Earth mainly because Earth is being pulled towards it , and this will take some time . The 7.3 weeks of visibility should occur during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Earth , so should n't be confused with the normal second sun sightings . <p> " We have stated that a Sunrise West will occur , as prophecy predicts and folklore attests , as a result of a 270- Roll by Planet X as it crosses the Ecliptic . Planet X seeks to align along the tight magnetic flow lines just under the Ecliptic to the tight magnetic flow lines just above the Ecliptic , which have radically different alignment dictates . Under the Ecliptic , the flow lines are returning magnetic particles to the Sun , but above , they represent an outward bound stream , which does not tolerate a N. Pole pointed toward it . Planet X must roll , and does this as a sideways roll , the path of least resistance , then rising its N. Pole to align side-by-side with the Sun at the end of this 270- roll . The Earth is hardly a passive observer , but participates when it finds a hose of magnetic particles pointed at it by deflecting its N. Pole . This is reflected in folklore as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biblical prediction of 3 days of darkness , which is not related to the week of rotation stoppage as during this time Egypt finds itself under a blazing Sun . As the Earth continues to roll , in synch with Planet X , keeping its N. Pole pointed away , the Earth is unmistakably turned upside down , again well documented in folklore . During this time the core and crust are glued together , and the rotation of the Earth follows the rotation of the Sun , as always , in direction , thus sunrise West . <p> Following days of a sunrise West , this roll of the Earth continues its momentum until the Earth returns to align side-by-side with the Sun and Planet X , a comfortable position for magnets forced into proximity with each other . It is in this position that the daily grab on the Atlantic Rift begins significant slowing of the Earth 's rotation , as Planet X and the Sun now speak as one in their magnetic dictates , but Planet X as an every closer magnet is now insisting that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward dusk or dawn pulling to the side and thus resisted . What then causes the shift , that hour when the crust of the Earth is pulled in one direction , and the core in another ? Rising past the Ecliptic into the magnetic flow lines above the Ecliptic , Planet X aligns itself with the flow of magnetic particles coming from the Sun , just as it pointed its N. Pole toward the Sun 's S. Pole while rounding that . It has escaped the crowded particle flow that its presence created under the Ecliptic , and is picking up speed , and coming ever closer to the Earth . Moving from a position of being side-by-side to one aligning with the magnetic flow lines , Planet X is again doing a roll , pointing its N. Pole directly at the Earth , forcing the crust , particularly the magnetized Atlantic Rift which it has a firm grip on , to go along . The crust wants to stay glued to Planet X as a magnet , and strains to return to that position . The core , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , wants to stay side-by-side with the Sun . The point where this argument is settled is when the crust tears from the core , and they move independently . This is the hour of the shift . " <p> Question : " What will the Earth do during the interim phase between the last day of sunrise west and the first day of rotation stoppage ? Could the Zetas more precise , please ? " <p> SOZT : " We have stated that this time period will be weeks , not days , but decline to state the exact number of weeks . The reasons are obvious . After a severe wobble with the N Pole tipping away into 3 days of darkness , and after the Earth seems to tip almost upside down for 6 days before righting itself , those who have not gone insane will be gripped with the necessity of figuring out what has just happened and what they are to do about it . It is during this time period that many will be trying to move to safety , as the coastlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this will be a clue as to the relative danger of living on the coastlines in general . <p> This is not a time when travel is likely to be blocked , but if the government , either at the state or federal level , knew the exact number of weeks and days , they would be able to manipulate travel restrictions to their liking rather than giving the common man latitude . Even with an Obama in the White House , fairness can not be mandated . During Hurricane Katrina many bridges exiting out of New Orleans were blocked because local law enforcement wanted to protect rich neighborhoods . Such blocks will not be put into place if anticipated to be needed for a long period , as this is untenable . But if anticipated to be needed for a short period they would be put into place . Thus , we leave this time period uncertain . " <p> " Is the pole shift going to happen during this magnetic trimster ? It does n't  seem violent enough . " <p> SOZT " We have stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The current trimester started at the end of December and lasts until the end of April . The last weeks include , counting backwards , a week of rotation stoppage , some weeks of rotation slowing , 6 days of sunrise west , 3 days of darkness , a lean to the left , and a severe wobble . We also predicted that emergency management teams would be so exhausted that at the state and local level they would not be listening to the Bush White House regardless of what they say . We did not specify where in the timeline such a situation might exist , so there may be overlap with the last weeks , or there may not be overlap so that this point occurrs before the last weeks . It is up to you to count how many days are involved in the last weeks or to watch the signs . We will say this . You will not be taken by surprise . " <p> This live chat question suggests that the entire final weeks could be roughly 7 weeks . They said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it could be just a little longer than that , with the 9 days of severe wobble . I 'm not sure though . <p> " So the pole shift wo n't happen during this current trimester ? Not enough happening so I assume the next candidate would be the August trimester for a possible pole shift ? " <p> SOZT " We have given enough description on the last weeks - the sequence and timing - to allow mankind to gauge the timing of the pole shift when the last weeks commence . Nancy has computed the whole sequence to be approximately 7 weeks , and this is accurate enough . That we have previously stated that the Planet X complex would be seen in the skies , undeniably , 7 weeks before the shift is another clue that this guess is not far off . We have stated that the pole shift would happen at the end of a magnetic trimester , at the end of an April , an August , or a December , approximately . Thus , for this particular trimester , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen at the end of this April . Correct . <p> I too feel the severe wobble will be before visibility , Sherry . I 'm now thinking that visibility could start when the Lean to the Left is in full effect , putting PX to the right of the Sun far enough to be visible . It wo n't become a monster in the sky until after the 6 days of sunrise west , I think . <p> This " The Earth will align and remain upright with Planet X as Planet X grabs Earth and pulls it closer , slowly causing an inevitable rotation stoppage that will last for 5.9 days . Planet X will grow in size as viewed from Earth mainly because Earth is being pulled towards it , and this will take some time . The 7.3 weeks of visibility should occur during that time .

We now have a computation period for slowing rotation . 7.3 weeks - 5.9 days of stopped rotation . <p> Let me retract as it was no ZT that said 7.3 weeks of visibilty is just after the 3 , 6 , days etc .

The Sunda Plate will sink to the level we described . The great quakes predicted for the S American roll has been proceeding in smaller steps , but the Caribbean islands will eventually sink to the level we described . The African roll , basically a silent roll , will result in a creeping separation at Sinai and Gibraltar as we predicted . And the New Madrid is likely to occur in steps and stages so land shifts and drops and bridges separate , but without the jolts formerly anticipated . <p> Does any of this mean that earthquakes will stop , volcanoes will go to sleep , and until the Pole Shift arrives trauma need not be a worry ?

In that the Indo-Australian Plate is the brake , holding all other plate movement back , it is certainly one of those places .

@@36454541 @5454541/ <p> The MUFON " UFO Stalker " places sightings on a map instantaneously . This shows activity for August 2011. ( image credit : www.UFOStalker.com ) <p> Several media outlets covered the story of increased UFO sightings in the late summer of 2011 , including Fox News , MSNBC and the popular UK paper , the Daily Mail . It all started when the International Director for the- Mutual UFO Network- ( MUFON ) , Clifford Clift , told reporter Benjamin Radford , that- over 1000 UFO reports were received in August 2011 , doubling the typical 500 or so they receive on a monthly basis . I have collected all of the data I could to take a closer look at this UFO wave to try and determine what might have been the cause . <p> In the story , Radford and Clift , tried to speculate on some of the reasons reports may have increased . Some of the ideas listed were : more people looking up in the summer , accidental duplication of data or that perhaps the increase in UFO movies this summer has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected can dispel a few of these otherwise plausible theories . <p> Some of the stories stemming from Radford 's interview with Clift implied that UFO sightings have increased recently . Some of these headlines even pondered the possibility of an impending alien invasion . Most of these headlines were tongue in cheek jocularity , although some were dead serious . In order to test this I graphed out the number of sightings that MUFON has received over the past few years . I was a MUFON investigator for many years , and a functional Director , and have been accumulating data for a long time from the- MUFON 's online database- ( nothing that is n't publicly available mind you ) . - MUFON began collecting UFO sightings through the database in mid-2006 . There has also been an ongoing effort to scan all old paper reports and get them into the database as well . <p> However , this data was still not in a form that could be easily exported into a spreadsheet , so I painstakingly ported the information out . Anyone can go query the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for light perusal , you can see it would be a bear to format it into something you can graph out . It has taken me years to get dates and places . Some of the data also comes from MUFON emails , when you subscribe to the MUFON email list , Clifford conveniently emails monthly statistics . I also put those in the database to get some information regarding sightings this year . <p> When we look at sightings per year , we can see that 2010 was actually a slower year for MUFON than 2008 and 2009 . In fact , it appears that 2011 was on track to come close to the 2009 numbers before the increase in August . With the increase in numbers in August , even if MUFON averages 500 reports for October , November and December , this will be a record year for sighting reports . To me this would indicate that we do n't necessarily have a vast increase in overall sightings , but that this August event pushed this year to the top . <p> When we look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had described . The average number of sightings per month was steady around 500 until August when it doubled . September ended up with nearly 800 reports , which was also significant . One suggestion was that UFO reports increase in the summer because more people are outside . That makes perfect sense , however , when I graphed out - all sightings on a month by month basis , we do see a slight spike in July , but no overall increase for other summer months . <p> 2011 UFO reports by state . The first section ranks August reports , the second is YTD . Data source : MUFON ( image credit : Alejandro Rojas ) <p> I then decided to graph out the August 2011 reports by state to find out if the increase was regional or not . As you can see in the graph , the year to date data is similar to the August data , meaning that the areas that normally receive more reports also received a lot of reports in August . The only state that received a relatively unusual increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports a month , in August they received 38 . <p> I took a look at the individual reports and I did discover something interesting . Only 4 of the reports in August were of sightings that occurred in August . There were a couple in July , but most were historical accounts from last year or the 1980s and older , including one from 1965 . To me this would seem that somehow locals became aware of the MUFON and reported these sightings , possibly by local media , but I have not found any local media coverage that may have prompted this . Still , although this would account for an increase of 30 or so , it does not account for the 500 or so overall increase for August . The rest were spread throughout the country . <p> Since I could find no regional spike in sightings , I decided to look at the shapes that are reported . In Clifford 's monthly emails he also breaks this information out . However , here again I hit a dead end . As you can see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year does not differ greatly from the shapes reported in August . <p> In conclusion , I am left with two possibilities . In his interview with Radford , Clifford speculated that perhaps the increase in UFO movies this summer had an effect . I suppose that is possible , I did figure some sort of media attention for MUFON would be responsible , but there was no major coverage that could account for this . So Clifford could be right , of course the other possibility is that there were just more UFOs of every kind flying over our heads this summer . Let us know if you see something in these graphs I missed or have another explanation .

March 23 , 2012 The first news of the approchement an intruder planet in our solar system , from the self Chilean astronomer Ferrada Carlos Mu+oz ( who died in October 2001 at the age of 92 years ) . On 11 June 1940 he announced to the world the existence of this planet he called " Planet-Comet " because it has the mass of a planet with the orbit of a comet . His astronomical and geophysical predictions made ? ? him famous . Later he predicted other earthquakes such as the 1945 Ligua and the 1985 Santiago , Chile . He also announced the trajectory and suffer disruption of Halley 's comet , changing its speed , which occurred when the Halley walked 36 hours of its orbital period , to 85 kilometers of the Sun , the distance the shortest in history . To explain their observations and predictions , Carlos Mu+oz Ferrada developed the theory of geodynamics , which is based on the attractions of the heavenly bodies , large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this method he predicted earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , climate change , he discovered new planets and comets , deciphering their trajectories and other features . He had a special gift : the gift to enter into a trance when he was researching and that , in this state , he wrote and drew what he received , and that it gave him much success as enemies throughout his life . He provided us with other data in the television and multiple media . These data are as follows : - 92 km / s = speed of the planet Hercolubus turning around the Black Sun . - 76 km / s = speed of the planet Hercolubus when it revolves around the Sun in the solar system . - 300 km / s = speed of the planet Hercolubus halfway two suns. - 14,000,000 km = closest to the Earth in the path of the planet Hercolubus Point . - 32 billion km = distance from the Sun Black Earth . - 300,000 km / s = speed of light . 9 460 800 000 000 m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star pass inside the orbit of the Earth with a satellite speed of 66 kilometers per second , and at the same time , on that date , its perihelion only 139,100,000 km from the Sun .

Elliptical Earth 's orbit would be parallel to the celestial Equator . Both poles removed at the same time , as in the days of the equinoxes in spring and autumn. - and from another- http : **34;1668;TOOLONG Ramatis delivered lectures to standing room only crowds through human instruments like Brazil 's Chico Xavier and Luis Muzio . Ramatis discussed the imminent destruction of Earth by an orphan planet named Hercolubus , orbiting an invisible sun named Tila , whose trajectory brought it through the solar system every 6,666 years. - and from another- http : **35;1704;TOOLONG In 1950 a celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide Ramatis . Maes predicts that the earth 's axis will change through ninety degrees due to the gravitational pull of an enormous new planet which will enter our solar system soon . <p> We were asked to address the prophecies on Hercolubus , directed through several channels by the- entity Ramatis . These individuals , who received the messages at various times over the past century , gave various interpretations which are notable more by their consistency than differences . We have stressed , when asked about valid prophecies that seem to differ on some points , to focus on the similarities , as no communication vehicle is perfect . Chico Xavier , Hercilio Maes , and Carlos Mu+oz Ferrada all have channeled Ramatis on Hercolubus , aka Planet X , aka Nibiru . Many other authors and frauds have- also attempted to attach themselves to these channeled works . <p> Some misinterpretations that emerged were an orbit period of 6,666 , due to Biblical influences . Another is that Hercolubus must be larger than Jupiter , which was an attempt by some channels to explain the size being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Sun in the swirling dust cloud. - Ramatis , using Carlos Mu+oz Ferrada , attempted more precision due to Ferrada 's astronomical skills . Reknowned for his ability to predict a major earthquakes in Chile and for his ability to describe a change in the orbit of Haley 's Comet before it occurred , Ferrada got more specific . Nevertheless , his message as received is not 100% accurate . <p> ZetaTalk is a telepathic conversation . There is feedback where Nancy relays what she has understood , and we correct the interpretation . Material is repeatedly addressed , over the years , and the readership has noted a remarkable correlation from one piece of ZetaTalk material to another , years later . Consistency is a hallmark of ZetaTalk because of this feedback mechanism . The message is- notscrambled . ZetaTalk was accurate enough to- pinpoint in 1997- where Planet X , aka Nibiru , would appear in March , 2003 some 6 years later . This prediction was so close to that RA and Dec on arrival that it was astonishing . <p> Ferrada worked as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A channel allows the entity to use the body and mind , and thus is limited by what the mind of the channel can encompass . Channeled work is thus often vague , or if precise , the precision is inserted later by the channel who is attempting to record the message received . How else to explain differences in channeled work from the same entity ? That said , what are the similarities and differences between the Ferrada interpretation and the ZetaTalk message ? <p> Both- ZetaTalk and Ferrada state that Planet X is a planet acting like a comet , and is a planet with a tail . Both describe a Pole Shift . Both state that the Earth 's axis may change as a result . <p> Both ZetaTalk and Ferrada state that Planet X moves at the- speed of light- between its two suns . <p> ZetaTalk states an average orbital period of 3,657 years , compared to the ancient Sumerian 3,600 period . Ramatis channels stated variously 6,666 years or 13,000 years ago as the last passage . <p> ZetaTalk describes the orbit of Planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turnaround some distance away , where Ferrada predicts perihelion at the Sun . ZetaTalk also described the passage coming within the orbit of Venus , where Ferrada states perihelion occurs barely within the orbit of Earth . Nevertheless , they both bring Planet X close to the Sun during the passage , and within the orbit of Earth . <p> ZetaTalk describes a virtual creep of Planet X past the Sun , where it is only now outbound after arriving in 2003 . ZetaTalk ascribes the slow pace to the Repulsion Force keeping large planets from collisions with each other . Ferrada describes a slower pace for Planet X when it is near one of its suns , which can only be understood as a version of the Repulsion Force as why else would the gravity pull- lessen- during a passage when the body goes at the speed of light between the suns ? Thus the Ferrada version is incomplete , but not in conflict with ZetaTalk . <p> Both ZetaTalk and Ferrada describe a dark twin of Sol , but differ on the distance between the two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark twin in the direction of theconstellation Orion . Ferrada 's distance is only a third of this distance as Ramatis was describing the location of Planet X at the time of the channel , when it was already on the move for the passage past the Sun , and this point was confused by Ferrada . <p> ZetaTalk describes in the- Point of Passage- discussions that the Earth will be drawn closer to Planet X so that there is only 14 million miles between them , but specifies that the Moons of Planet X will be no further than 5 million miles from Planet X. Thus , the Moons will be at no time closer than 9 million miles from the Earth . Ferrada states that the closest it will come is 14 million km , which equates to 8.6 million miles . Where this seems to be a difference , Ferrada is describing the distance between Earth and the Moon Swirls . Thus , both agree .

When this is done violently during the 7 of 10 roll , the crumbling we have described for these lands will occur . The small islands just to the east of Central America will participate in this crush .

This is an issue not so much of sinking as of unpredictability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may survive from the jumble , or disappear entirely . The hump of the S American Plate intrudes into the Caribbean , and as it moves to the west it will push the Caribbean Plate above Colombia down forcefully . The trend has already been noticed this past year along the Colombian coastline. - Aruba , Bonaire , and Curacao ride on the hump , and thus will survive . The island chain along the eastern edge of the Caribbean Plate was formed when the Caribbean Plate was pushed up during expansion of the Atlantic . But this is countered by the hump of S America pushing the Caribbean Plate down , overall . Thus those islands in the chain close to S America will lose in elevation , while those islands at the top of the chain will not . From Antigua south , the islands in this chain can expect a minimum of an elevation drop of 57 feet , on average , with this being irregular throughout due to the trauma to the area . Islands just to the north of S America will be affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the highest points , losing several hundred feet in elevation , and Trinidad will be torn apart in addition to sinking as it rides on the plate border. - A plate , being solid rock in layers , tends to move as one . Thus if the southern part is pushed down , it will tilt , the northern part lift up . The larger islands along the northern part of the Caribbean Plate could be assumed to gain elevation except that the entire Caribbean Plate is losing , overall . Thus the southern shores of these larger islands will experience some elevation loss , where beaches may emerge on the northern shores . To the extent that fracturing is occurring in the plate , as occurs for Haiti , fracturing can be expected . This will be a rough ride for all , with sloshing and clashing water and the Caribbean Plate which at first may seem to rise , then drop as the roll proceeds. - ZetaTalk , January 15 , 2011- http : **33;1781;TOOLONG

Chinese general Zhu Ge-Lin was the first to observe cyanobacteria poisoning about 1000 years ago . He reported the death of troops who drank green coloured water from a river in southern China . The first published report of an incidence of cyanobacteria poisoning dates from the poisoning of an Australian lake in 1878 . Also , in China and Brasil , people died after drinking water from a lake . All these incidences have been attributed to cyanobacteria and the toxic compound microcystin-LR. - Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. - Cyanobacteria prefer to live in water bodies such as lake , ponds , reservoirs , and slow-moving streams . When the water is warm there are enough nutrients available for the bacteria to survive .

Algae blooms during the summer have become more frequent and troublesome around the western end of Lake Erie , the shallowest of the five Great Lakes .

Below the ground surface , ice wedges that formed thousands of years ago are melting . Even though northern winters are still cold , recent summer temperatures have been warm enough to melt the top portion of the ancient ice in just a few years . That 's creating deeper channels above the ice wedges that often fill with water . Those depressions sometimes connect up to form small streams , allowing water to drain away . <p> Because ice makes up a good portion of the underground foundation of northern Alaska , thawing has dropped the landscape as much as three feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arctic Coastal Plain is sinking , " Liljedahl said .

Over several decades , they can grow again after plants pop up in the troughs , cast shade and insulate the ground from summer heat . But that process requires dependable cold , winter and summer . <p> " We do n't have a steady state anymore , " she said . " We get more and more of the deep troughs and it 's harder to recover .

And likewise , Alaska , due to have a virtual tropical climate in the Aftertime , might find this takes a year to settle in firmly due to the melting of the North Pole ice and the prevailing westerly blowing air and ocean currents in their direction .

All points around the northern border of Africa will move commensurately . S Africa will find itself similarly 125 miles further south , and westward by about 35 miles . <p> . <p> ZetaTalk Chat Q&amp;A for October 16 , 2010 <p> The fact that the African Plate , during previous rolls , created mountain building can be seen on a relief map . Morocco and Algeria have mountains due to the rolling in the past . One can see in the mountains of Spain and Italy and the Balcans and Turkey that this was the case there , too , in the past . The Alps themselves were built during previous African rolls .

The border of the African Plate slices across northern Algeria , and thus when the plate rolls and drops , the Mediterranean floor there will suddenly find itself unsupported . Where the land mass housing Morocco and Algeria will not lose elevation , in the main , retaining its floatation strength to ride on the magma beneath , the floor of the Mediterranean is of a different composition . It will sink there , unsupported on the African side where the plates will pull apart . The Mediterranean coastline of Algeria will then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of elevation by 12 feet or more .

What sinks and what continues to float on the magma beneath is a factor of the rock density , and the floor of the Mediterranean above Algeria has only been floating as it has due to the connection with the African Plate . Elsewhere , where the Mediterranean floor spreads during the roll , the floor is either too deep for a change to be noticed or at a distance from the plate border . <p> Tsunami will not occur to any ostensible degree because there is a void being created , where the waters will rush . However , turmoil and wave action can be anticipated . The shifting of the African Plate will also not incite any mountain building in Italy or the Balcans or Turkey , as the northern edge of the African Plate is not the solid , jutting line through the center of the Mediterranean that mankind assumes .

Jakarta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean the big 7 of 10 for Indonesia is at hand , nor did the many volcanoes erupting in Sumatra and Java in October signify the 7 of 10 had occurred . Towns along the coastline in Columbia began crumbing and sinking , and villages on the N Andes fault line in Colombia and Ecuador were clearly mountain building in late October , and all this following oil rig eruptions in rigs in Trinidad and Tobago and the island of Bonaire in the Caribbean . But all of this did not indicate the 7 of 10 roll for S America had occurred . We stated the sequence of events would be Indonesia 's drop , then S America 's roll , then Africa 's roll . What you are seeing is a warmup , precursors , in all these regions . We stated that the trend would be obvious before the actual event , and you are seeing the trends. - The edge of the African Plate was outlined with quakes , occurring in the Indian Ocean , the Atlantic , the Mediterranean , and of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African continent showed up during this time on the live seismographs , which showed a peculiar jiggle in those countries being stretched during the roll nudge . Note that some of these countries are above the Mediterranean , as the plate border through the Mediterranean would be tugging at them , too . - . <p> The Zetas have described the roll of the African Plate as a dropping down of the plate as well as a twist of the top to the east . As the Atlantic Rift pulls apart in the southern hemisphere , the Africa Plate has room to drop down a bit , pushing into the Atlantic Rift near S Africa . This eases the pressure on the Mediterranean , during the roll And from : - ZetaTalk Chat Q&amp;A for January 29 , 2011 - ( http : **37;2430;TOOLONG ) <p> - My question when Africa roll after South America roll Red Sea will be larger and larger will this bring EQ for this area ? Sorry for repeating but to be more specific I mean the Red Sea itself will have EQ ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so there will be eruption of new volcano in Red Sea and will have a new volcanic island like Hawaii is it true ? and from another Violent Seismic Activity Tearing Africa in Two Jan 20 LONG ... The fissures began appearing years ago . But in recent months , seismic activity has accelerated in northeastern Africa as the continent breaks apart in slow motion . Researchers say that lava in the region is consistent with magma normally seen on the sea floor - and that water will ultimately cover the desert . - Like the great crevasses that have been opening up in this region , the 7 of 10 stretch will not be accompanied by great quakes . The stretch zone is silent , in the main . Jiggling and shuddering might occur , with minor quakes jolting now and then , but basically a silent process . Of course there will be lava , hardening into a new surface , as the plates are being pulled apart and beneath the plates is magma . And where the surface is thin , magma may bubble up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or erupting volcanic region , as Hawaii is , because it will not be under pressure from colliding or compressing plates . <p> . Thus : - The South Atlantic Rift is tearing , thus allowing for South America to roll west . whereafter Africa is also free to roll. - The roll of Africa , as we have described , will be more of a twist in place , so that the southern tip of the African Plate shifts somewhat to the west , toward the void opened up by the spreading Atlantic Rift , while the plate overall drops enough that having the top part shift to the east does not do damage along the plate boundaries . The Straits of Gibraltar will open an additional 125 miles and the northern point at Morocco will move 50 miles further east . All points around the northern border of Africa will move commensurately . S Africa will find itself similarly 125 miles further south , and westward by about 35 miles . Indonesia , as we have described , is already buckling and sinking.And from : http : **37;2469;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its base at S Africa firmly nailed and unable to move , the top rolling to the East as the Atlantic yaws open . This action is what is causing the African Rift to spread so rapidly , in the Afar Triangle , where huge crevasses appear before astonished eyes and the land is dropping hundreds of feet . The Mediterranean will be destabilized . The African plate is a straight line across the top , and when it turns it will create a YAW in the Mediterranean , causing volcanoes in the area to become active as lava is exposed to the surface , and certainly destabilizing countries just to the north of the fault line dissecting the Mediterranean from East to West . The Mediterranean , in the past , was a swamp , but now is a sea . What caused the land to drop ? The Black Sea participated in this drop , being inundated where formerly land above water . Istanbul lies at the center of the area that will first be affected when a serious roll of Africa occurs . <p> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and widening the Red Sea , the isthmus holding Istanbul will tear , dropping the city into rubble . During the hour of the pole shift , what is left of Istanbul will find water sloshing back and forth between the Mediterranean and Black Sea , and will be gravely affected by quakes along the various fault lines that traverse the area . Tsunami will not be the issue during the Earth changes affecting Turkey , as the fault lines move horizontally and will not raise or lower plates on either side to create a mass of water on the move .

Those in India are advised not to seek high ground within Indian 's interior , but to head to the Himalayas , to Tibet and Nepal and China or the high mountains that are officially Indian territory - Srinagar . Pakistan will also be high ground but the area will rupture to become a new seaway , so this is unstable territory and the lowlands will be flooded during the hour of the shift .

These are busy entities , as they watch over many young spirits , but they prioritize well . Something like distress over trying to sort out one 's role during the coming times is not an immediate issue , but would get a response from more than one source within hours if not within minutes . Those who feel they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and the role they did play during past disasters . If this was a success , helping others in the vicinity and making an overall difference in their lives , there is likely to be little confusion but more likely a determination to repeat the success . If , however , the young spirit 's current incarnation does not afford a similar role , due to one 's station in life or physical handicaps of some kind , there is trepidation . Should one repeat the past , or attempt this , or strike out in a new direction ? If the young soul has tried and failed in the past , at least in their own eyes , then they may be determined to have a better outcome in the future . Such a sense of failure can linger through many lifetimes , for an astonishing length of time , if personal guilt is laid upon oneself by the young soul . Where learning from the past is an admirable step , it is better overall to sort out the current situation and make an action plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wise souls , but it is better to critique them briefly and then get on with life than to agonize over them . A mistake is , after all , just a mistake ! <p> Thank GOD for Nancy , the Zetas , this site and all that is associated with it ! - Knowing can be a lonely and overwhelming feeling sometimes- my family , friends and those I have choosen to share this info with all think I am crazy and remain in denial. - I have actually been shunned and ostracized by some : ( <p> That was and still is a shock to me ! - However , I do have a great hope and faith that all will be OK and BE as it will ! - Spiritually , I know and feel the evolution of myself and this world now-- It is my hope that I meet like-minded individuals and I pray that I can be of service and my path lead me in the direction I need to go and place me where I need to be- <p> In my early 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite make sense to me at the time , however , I knew it was somehow relevant. - I wrote it down , kept it and now after many years I have finally come to know what the meaning is- <p> " Being silent is the hardest part of knowing " -Azzuue <p> Still , there is a small part of me that questions why I have come to know these things- <p> Hello everyone ! I 'm new to this blog . Was aware about the pole shift since 2007 and been following Zetatalk ever since . I live in the bay area California and recently prepared for what is coming . One problem that I ca n't figure out is where the safe locations are for me and my love ones to go to . <p> SOZT The Haiti quake of course was downgraded , as are all quakes these days . Haiti is on a fault line which has historically sustained large quakes , and can expect more . We have warned of this repeatedly , in our Safe Locations information for instance . Few will survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy also attended group meeting of contactees where she was shown a hologram vision that included the crumbling of the Caribbean well before the pole shift or last weeks , as a result of the rolling of the S American plate . This is what caused the Haiti quake , but there is MUCH more to be anticipated . We reiterate . The Caribbean is NOT a safe place to be , nor Central America . LONG
