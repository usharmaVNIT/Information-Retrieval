Periodically , you would load them into your car , drive to a collection center that would be established at our Public Works Department located on Hembree Road , and unload the glass into the collection container . Glass could not be placed into plastic bags or mixed with any other recyclable or waste product .

The red light camera program is intended to be a supplement to existing law enforcement methods , helping the police department achieve more consistent traffic enforcement . <p> This consistent enforcement will send a strong message to residents and visitors that the City of Alpharetta is committed to providing safe and passable streets . <p> The system uses multiple cameras placed at the intersection to record video evidence of the red light runners . Using time and distance calculations , the system predicts that a vehicle will run a red light and then activates three independent video cameras . These cameras capture video evidence of the rear of the vehicle , the license plate and a video showing the vehicle behind the stop line while the light is red and then proceeding through the intersection while the light is still red . <p> This program is about getting drivers to stop at red lights through awareness and enforcement . With that in mind , the City of Alpharetta will post signage at each intersection that is has a red light camera system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following intersections : <p> Red light cameras have been in operation worldwide for over 30 years and were first introduced to the United States over ten years ago .

The reflector is placed on the hydrant side of the roadway and is placed in the middle of the lane to avoid motorist inconvenience . <p> The water departments of either Fulton County or Alpharetta are responsible for repair of fire hydrants .

Red is traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several problems with red . It fades more quickly than white , it is harder to keep a good shine on red and most importantly , red tends to fade into the night and is much harder to see . Alpharetta has chosen safety over tradition . White is simply more visible . <p> As explained in the previous answer , sometimes several units are dispatched to the same incident . The first unit may have arrived on the scene , assessed the situation and informed the dispatcher that the situation was under control or that a single unit could handle the emergency . All other responding units were cancelled and put back into service , ready to take another call . <p> Most likely , when you see an emergency vehicle with red lights and siren go through an intersection and then slow down and turn the emergency lights off , they have been cancelled from the call they were responding to . <p> This is called " venting the roof .

When a hole is made in the roof , the building is " vented . " The smoke and gases escape because heat and smoke rise . This makes it safer for the firefighters in the building to see and to move around . This also reduces the possibilities of a " backdraft " ( explosion ) and flashover . <p> Another reason for venting the roof is to see how far the fire has progressed . One of the fastest avenues through which fires spread is the attic . Heat and smoke rise into the attic where the fire can move quickly . Firefighters may go ahead of the fire on a roof , cut holes to access the attic and stop the fire from spreading through the attic . <p> In most cases , when you see a fire engine in front of a building , they are not shopping or conducting personal business , but they are most likely doing an " in-service " inspection or conducting a " pre-fire plan " of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be serviced twice in this way each year .

This must be done on the fire trucks , but at all times , the crew is in instant radio contact with the 911 dispatcher and they stay in their response territory and are ready to go when needed . <p> Fire Department units are dispatched according to information received by the 9-1-1 operator . The department thinks overcautiously when they respond to citizens in need of help . In other words , the firefighters are prepared to deal with the worst that could happen .
