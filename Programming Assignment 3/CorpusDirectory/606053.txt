Some we 'll mention here and dig into these thornier issues with more detailed articles . Many of these problems run into deeper issues if they 're not dealt with adequately . For instance , because of the newfound freedom of dorm life sans parental oversight , many new students stay up late , party and lose sleep . Too much lost sleep can eventually lead to falling grades , stress and even depression . So it is best to try to notice minor mess-ups early on and catch them before it becomes a bigger issue . <h> Roommate Issues <p> Every college student will have to deal with roommate issues sooner or later . Whether it is your roomie using your stuff without permission , or coming in noisily at 4 a.m. and waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group over every single night , you 'll have to confront them , nicely of course , and let them know it 's a problem . Even though it will feel awkward , start the conversation , which is the best way to deal with a minor mess before it reaches uncomfortable levels . <p> As mentioned in an earlier article , start off right with your roommate by having a frank discussion about ground rules . Settle certain items right off the bat . Can she use your stuff or borrow your clothes ? Perhaps you 'll give a qualified yes , that is , if she asks first . Perhaps you had sisters who stole your clothes all the time so this is a definite no . Whatever your feelings on it , be upfront and say so . Help your roommate to do the same , because you do n't want to be stepping on her toes either . You and your roommate are going to live together in close quarters for months , and you 'll be much happier if you two can reach comfortable compromises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ground rules for yourself . One of the biggest changes of coming to college is that your parents are no longer around to set parameters for you . Now you have to do it yourself because no one else will . If you want to stay up all hours , skip classes , binge drink and have random sex , no one will stop you . If you choose to eat fatty fried foods and no vegetables or fruits , it 's allowed . If you do n't exercise , that 's OK with everyone around you . The big problem with this behavior is it will lead to bad health and bad habits . You 'll feel awful and probably look worse . It will affect your social life and eventually your academic standing as well . <p> The three essential cornerstones of good health are sleep , nutrition and exercise . You will probably let one or the other or even all three slip during your first year at college , but be careful .

The degree level , that is , associate 's , bachelor 's or master 's , you start with does n't have to remain the final degree you obtain . <p> If you have chosen a career path , for instance , paralegal , then do some research to find out what law firms are looking for when they hire paralegals . If most law firms hire paralegals with associate 's degree , then it would be fine for you to obtain your associate 's degree with an emphasis on paralegal studies .

People often use the terms interchangeably , and both mean money that does n't have to be repaid . There are slight and subtle differences , however , and it pays to know the difference . <p> The federal government , for instance , gives out grant monies for a huge variety of reasons . Many go to fund scientific research and studies , such as the infamous studies on why dogs bark or birds sing . Federal grants are awarded in a number of categories , including agriculture , business and commerce , education , community development , energy , environment , food and nutrition , humanities or cultural affairs , health , law and justice , legal services and natural resources . Grants are given for studies in these categories , for development of environmentally sensitive new products , training for people who have lost their jobs , cultural programs , disaster prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're interested in , however , is grants for education , specifically individual education grants . The government also awards education grants to communities and regional governments for educational development , usually for new college programs based at community colleges . In a recent article , we covered the five basic federal grants awarded through the FAFSA application : Pell grant , SEOG , TEACH , ACG and national SMART grant . These federal grants are predominantly for financially needy students , although a few are based on academic achievement or the course of academic study . <p> One difference between grants and scholarships is that grants for individual education are need rather than merit based . Both , however , pertain to money slated to be used for college education . <p> Another difference between grants and scholarships is the requirements and obligations that come with them . With grants , once you have demonstrated and documented your qualification for the grant through your FAFSA or other application , you will receive the grant and any other grants for which you have qualified . With scholarships , the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more competitive . Scholarships may require an application , essay , answering questions and an interview with a scholarship committee . They may require a certain GPA , high test scores and class rank . Once you 've been awarded the scholarship , you might have to keep up your GPA in order to continue receiving the money . Scholarships tend to be awarded competitively , to those with the best academic or athletic record of achievement , while grants are given to all students who qualify based on their family 's earnings and assets . <p> A third difference is that scholarships are always given for educational reasons , while grants may be awarded for any number of reasons , some of them educational . Grants and scholarships are very closely related , which is why the words can be used interchangeably . All scholarships are grants , while not all grants are scholarships . While the difference between the two might still be somewhat confusing , just remember this . If you need money to help pay for your college education , then focus your searches on scholarships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not only benefit you but your community as well , such as a small business , then you should focus your search on grants , whether they be from the federal or state governments , foundations , organizations , corporation or another party . <p> Education grants for individuals are awarded by the federal and state governments , however , usually based on financial need . Some scholarships may be awarded based on financial need , but most often are given for academic , athletic or other achievement such as community service , musical talent , performing arts , engineering skill , writing talent or pursuing certain academic studies or careers . Scholarships may also be given for relatively oddball reasons such as left-handedness , duck calling ability or best prom fashions created from duck tape . Scholarships may be given for certain characteristics , ethnic background , heritage , minority status , gender or height . <p> To recap , grants and scholarships , while greatly similar , exhibit subtle differences . Both can bring in money for college education that does n't have to be repaid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and competitive , at least for scholarships . Individual education grants from the federal government require the FAFSA to be filed each year you are in school . Scholarships may be awarded for all four years of college or only one year . A few colleges award a full ride scholarship that encompasses tuition , room and board , fees , textbooks and personal expenses . See AcademicInfo 's article on full ride scholarships for more information . If you 're a student heading off to college , you should apply for every grant and scholarship you may be even remotely qualified to receive . You will be surprised at the amount of money you could bring to bear on the cost of your education . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

This interdisciplinary examination of ecosystems covers topics such as biodiversity , groundwater contamination , conservation , climate change , soil contamination , waste management , air pollution , water quality and sustainable management . Earning a degree in environmental science can lead to a profitable career studying , researching and developing new theories about the environment . <h> Environmental Studies Degree Information <p> The need for a scientific team to investigate environmental systems coupled with environmental laws requiring protocols has led to a growing public awareness of the need to address environmental issues , hence the expansion of the major . The interdisciplinary nature of environmental sciences means that many fields are studied within one broad and comprehensive subject . <p> One of the appealing aspects of environmental studies is how diverse the curriculum is , making it a perfect match for someone interested in the sciences but who does not want to focus as intensely in any one field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies concurrently with a degree in management , public policy , political science , economics , social sciences or landscape architecture . <p> Keep in mind that environmental sciences and ecology are separate fields of study , even if the two disciplines overlap . Ecology focuses on analyzing interrelated sets of populations or a population and its relationship to its environment , such as with endangered species , habitat integrity , the impact of land development and the effect of populations by contaminants.Given the research-based applications of environmental studies , this degree is best earned at an established brick-and-mortar university instead of with an online degree . <h> Bachelor Of Arts <p> The Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies comprises several areas of environmental concentration . At the undergraduate level , environmental studies teach students to understand the nature of environmental issues in both the scientific and social sciences , analyze problems and solve them with basic and applied research . <p> Many degree programs integrate teaching and research with public service in the community . Some schools offer leadership programs that focus on collaborative environmental research and service projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Oregon and at Brown University . <h> Bachelor Of Science <p> A Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science requires a stronger emphasis on sciences , particularly by focusing on biology , chemistry , physics or earth sciences , rather than social sciences or humanities courses . This includes the completion of a higher level of courses in mathematics , statistics , ecology and physical geology . <h> Master Of Arts <p> A graduate degree in environmental studies prepares students to work for disciplinary and interdisciplinary environments in the government , public interest groups and businesses while teaching students about the emerging environmental issues and strengthen the skills to manage them . These programs require a master+s thesis that incorporates more specific fields of study , such as marine science and policy , environmental health or forest ecology . <p> Some degree programs , like at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies , offer different degrees related to the student+s area of focus . For example , a Master of Environmental Management prepares students for careers in environmental policy , stewardship , education and analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those interested in scientific research and practice . <h> Coursework <p> Coursework for environmental studies includes basics in mathematics , including statistics and calculus , along with humanities courses , ecology courses , physical geology courses and classes in environmental policy , history , economic , law and policy . <p> Atmospheric sciences study the Earth+s outer layer of gases with an emphasis on greenhouse gaes , atmospheric dispersion modeling , light pollution and meteorology . Environmental assessment appraises environmental protection and sustainable development by collecting field data , while environmental microbiology studies the composition and physiology of microbial communities . Environmental chemistry involves studying chemical alterations in the environment , such as soil and water contamination . <p> Other courses depend on a student+s specific focus , but some of those courses could include international environmental policy , property rights and environmental policy , ecosystem analysis , conservation biology , environmental chemistry , physical hydrology , oceanography , geophysics and environmental sociology .

Public College : Which Would Suit Me Better ? <p> By Patricia Gorden Neill - February 26th , 2013 <p> The main difference between a private and a public college is the funding . States and governments fund public colleges , and private college take in their funding from tuition , fees and private donations , a great deal of the donations from alumni . For this reason , public colleges are usually quite a bit less expensive for students who live in state . Naturally , each type of college has its strengths and weaknesses , its pros and cons for various students . <p> When just beginning your college search , it is important not to limit the types of colleges you decide to consider . Even with the sticker shock you and your parents may feel looking at the price of private colleges , do n't let it put you off . Private colleges often come up with an excellent package of financial aid for students in need . This wo n't be apparent up front , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it may be the one for you , then you and your parents need to make an appointment with the financial aid office and see what kind of help you can get . <p> In general , private colleges tend to be smaller with fewer students . State colleges or universities can be huge with over 20,000 students . Students in private colleges experience smaller class sizes and more personal attention from their professors . Public colleges , on the other hand , have grand lecture halls set up for hundreds of students for their classes , usually taught by graduate student teaching assistants rather than a professor . When looking at colleges , keep the following pros and cons of each college type in mind . <h> Private Colleges <h> Pros <p> Smaller Class Size : Even in larger private colleges , class size is less than that of public colleges . Students can get to know their professors and the professors will know the student by name . If you 're the type of student who enjoys the teacher student relationship , then take a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges encourage students to be active in the college community . This can include extracurricular activities such as sports or student clubs , and college events . Both students and professors exhibit a strong loyalty to their college . <p> Prestige : Many people consider private colleges and universities as more prestigious then their public counterparts , and some private colleges have national name recognition . Professors at private colleges are considered by some to have greater reputations than those at public colleges , although this is n't always the case . <p> Merit Scholarships : Private colleges give out many merit scholarships , especially for students requiring financial aid . While the overall cost is far higher at private than at public schools , private colleges hand out some pretty hefty financial aid to students it deems worthy . Sometimes financial aid packages cover full tuition , room and board . For this reason , do n't cross a private college off of your list until after you speak with the financial aid office . <h> Cons <p> Hard to Get In : Private colleges are more selective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great in high school , then you may get into a private college . <p> Cost : Private colleges cost far more than public colleges , sometimes as much as 10 times more . A year at a public college can run , say , $8,000 , while a private college could top at $40,000 for combined tuition , room and board and fees . You know to talk with the financial aid folks , right ? <p> Less Diverse : While public colleges and universities attract students from many states and overseas , private colleges admit a more homogeneous student body . If you 're hoping to make friends with kids from India , China and France , you may not find it possible at a private college . <p> Transfer of Credits : Public schools have made it fairly easy to transfer credits from one public school to another . Private colleges , however , use different crediting methods and you may find you may find that private college credits do n't transfer easily , meaning you may have to take certain classes over again at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Since governments subsidize public colleges , the cost for students who live in state is less than private colleges . Many public colleges also give financial aid to students , though not as generously as private colleges . <p> Programs : Public colleges can offer degrees in a variety of disciplines . There may be excellent liberal arts degree programs as well as dynamite electrical engineering degree programs . <p> Employment Opportunities : If you 're one of the many students who need to work during your college years , then a public college might suit you better . More on campus positions are available through work-study programs and you will have the flexibility as a student to seek off campus employment as well . <p> Bustling Atmosphere : Generally , public universities and colleges have greater diversity in their student bodies , with students from many different states and nations . Extracurricular activities abound and many public colleges have a very active sports scene . <p> Strong Academics : Public colleges attract teachers with strong academic backgrounds . While some people think highly of private colleges and attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public colleges . While most introductory courses are just that , higher level courses prove to be intellectually challenging for students , bringing out their best academic performance . <p> Ease of Admissions : Many students who are n't quite top notch find it easier to get admitted to public colleges than to private colleges . <h> Cons <p> Class Availability : Some public colleges are quite large if not huge . Classes fill up quickly , and students might not get all the classes they want . Register for the classes you want quickly and you should be able to get the schedule you want . <p> Size of Classes : With large student bodies , classes in public colleges can be quite large , often a hundred or two students per class . Large lecture halls are often the venue for these classes . Some classes will be taught by adjunct professors or graduate student teaching assistants , and student contact with teachers and professors may be limited . However , if you need your professor 's attention to help you solve a problem , be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work harder on fostering this relationship than you would at a private college . <p> Getting Lost in the Crowd : At huge state universities , some of the shyer students may feel isolated and alone in the crowd . If you 're more at home in a small town than a large city , a smaller public college would suit you better . <p> Less One on One : Professors at public colleges may have hundreds of students at a time . Bring yourself to their attention during class by speaking up during discussions . Make appointments with them . You may need to make more of an effort , but rest assured it can be done . Many professors enjoy getting to know their students . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821 
@@118351559 @7351559/ <p> When high school graduates go off to college , they 're in for a big challenge . You may be surprised to learn that many students fail academically in their first year of college . One-third of freshmen students do n't make it to their sophomore year . That 's a huge number , and it worries everyone concerned with higher education . <p> Reasons for this high dropout rate are many ; some freshmen have to leave for financial reasons , say , one of their parents was laid off . Others are purely homesick and ca n't take the stress and loneliness of that tough first year . Some students , shocked by the amount of work they 're required to do at college level , conclude that the main reason they 're in college is to please their parents and friends . These students realize that college is not one of their own personal goals , so they drop out , and probably rightly so . Finally , many students simply can not make the necessary transition from high school to college level academics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college is tough , even for those bright high school students with great GPAs , honors and AP classes and good ACT/SAT scores . Many of these bright students also fail academically their first year . <p> Take John , for instance , although John is not his real name . He had a top GPA , took honors and AP classes , and did great on his SAT . He attended a large public high school in New York City . He flunked his first semester of college , however , because he was simply not accustomed to the demands of college level work . Although he had taken few math classes in high school , he entered his college as an engineering major because he thought he 'd like that challenge . He failed his engineering intro course with an F , got a C- in chemistry , D in calculus and A in a writing class . John was unprepared academically and he realizes now that he did n't know how to study effectively at the college level . <p> Why did such a smart kid fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbook assignments for his classes , but flunked the tests . . What John did n't understand is that college level work demands more than memorizing facts and stating them on a test . In college , you have to think through the problems by doing them so you will understand the concepts and can apply those concepts to other problems . The biggest difference between high school and college is the level of thought required . <p> High school classes demand very little conceptual thinking and understanding the big picture behind the plethora of facts students are expected to learn . In college , facts are n't where it 's at . By the time you reach college , if you forget a fact all you have to do is look it up . It 's easy to find the fact that you forgot , and college level work is n't concerned with memorizing facts . College demands that you use those facts in a variety of ways . What is important is that you understand the concept and learn how to apply that concept in different situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and that requires a different method of learning . <p> That 's why it is n't enough to attend every lecture , take notes and read the textbook for your calculus class . You have to work through the problems in order to understand the concepts . It 's the same in any class , whether its biology , engineering or linguistics . What you 'll be tested on is not facts , but the concepts and applying them appropriately . <h> Directed vs . Self-Directed <p> High school learning is directed by the teacher and is highly structured . Students go from class to pre-scheduled class , doing the majority of their work in class . Quizzes and tests are given often and usually test only a few days to a week 's worth of study . Teachers remind students of upcoming tests and make sure the students are prepared . Teachers , in effect , are in charge of their student 's learning and carefully guide them through it . <p> Colleges do none of that . One of the biggest and hardest transition challenges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be self-directed in their studying and learning . No one is going to hold your hand , remind you there 's a test on Tuesday and nag you to get up in time for your 8:30 a.m. economics class . In high school , little homework was required , at least , in comparison to college . For each hour spent in a college class , students should be putting in two to three hours of study for that class . In high school , you were tested only on what was discussed in the classroom . In college , you will be tested on all of your assigned readings , whether it was discussed in class or not . It 's totally up to you to do the reading and studying necessary . <p> Help is available if you need it , of course . All colleges have an academic center of some kind where you 'll find assistance in any of your classes where you 're having trouble . Unlike high school , the teacher wo n't come to you knowing that you need help . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you require academic assistance , or financial advice or emotional counseling . If you do n't contact your professor or show up at her office hours , she wo n't be contacting you . <p> Your learning at college has to be self-directed or you wo n't get anywhere . In fact , your life must now be self-directed . Your mom is n't going to pick up your room and launder the dirty clothes you left on the floor . You will decide when to get up , what you 'll eat , when you 'll go out with friends and when to go to bed . You 're not used to that level of freedom and chances are you 'll make many mistakes that first semester . Nearly all freshmen do , at first . <p> Students who make a successful transition to college soon get themselves back on track . They have learned that they are responsible not only for getting to class on time , but for doing the necessary two to three hours of studying for each class . They learn not to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day . Students who do n't transition well skip classes , do n't learn how to balance study and social life , do n't study enough or effectively and start the downhill spiral . It 's notoriously difficult to catch up academically once you begin to slip . The best solution to this problem is to prevent it in the first place . <h> Transitioning Successfully <p> Here 's a few things you can do to make your transition from high school to college easier and ultimately successful : <p> Start making friends right away . Go to orientation and meet people , not just students , but faculty , the dean of students , academic advisors and dorm mates . Form a good network of friends from all walks of campus life and you 'll have support when you need it . <p> Get a calendar and day planner and write down everything you have to do such as classes , appointments , study hours and meetings with friends . Write down test days and when papers or projects are due . Make writing in your day planner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary time management skills you 'll need . <p> Tell yourself ahead of time that you will not miss any classes unless you 're on your deathbed . The sooner you learn self-discipline the better . <p> The minute you realize you 're having problems , any problems , reach out for help . If you do n't understand something in class , show up at your professor 's next office hour and ask for help . If you realize you are not sure you are studying effectively , head for the academic skills center and find out how . If you are feeling afraid , confused or depressed , get some emotional counseling . The college has many support services available . Take advantage of them . Do n't put it off . <p> Maintain the three cornerstones of health : eating healthy , exercise and enough sleep . Of course , you 're going to indulge in too much ice cream or late night study snacks . Just do it occasionally , not all the time . <p> Learn to balance study time and social time . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Realize that you 'll make mistakes , but when you do , do n't dwell on them . Pick yourself up and start over . <p> Once you 've made it through the transition , you 'll be fine . You 'll love your time in college and remember it for the rest of your life . The trick is to be aware of how difficult that transition time can be ; plan to do your best and do n't be afraid to ask for help . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

Being on the campus when other students are around will give you a good sense of whether you like the place or not . Your dream college might be set in a large city , but when you get there and sense the harried , hurried city life of the school , it might put you off entirely . Or you thought Vermont had the perfect college , but somehow you forgot how cold it gets in winter . You did n't think you would like the little liberal arts college , but the campus utterly charmed you and the current students seem to love it there . These are all possible reactions to visiting a college for the first time . Walking around on campus will allow all your five senses to explore the place and see if it feels like it could be home . The reason college visits are so vital is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years . Choosing wrong and transferring to another school will set you back in both time and money , so it 's a good idea to choose wisely the first time . <p> Here 's a few things to start thinking about when you 're getting ready to visit the colleges on your list : <h> Junior Year College Visit <p> If it 's possible , consider a quick campus visit during your junior year in high school . If you go during the summer , you can do a quick visit to campus just to get a feel for the place . In the summer , the admissions office people are less busy and can give you some undivided attention . If your family is heading out on a summer road trip vacation , stopping in at various colleges along the way for quick visits will help you prepare your college list and give you a feel for what 's right for you . If you call ahead , you can arrange to walk through the dorms , check out the student commons and see some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Senior Year College Visits <p> In your senior year , go for a longer visit when campus is in session , spring or fall . Call and arrange to join a class , eat at the dining hall and stay overnight , if possible . Most seniors visit in September and October , when school is in session and the campus is jumping . This visit calls for an interview with both admissions and financial aid personnel . You 'll have a list of questions prepared , and feel free to ask away . Take the official tour and take pictures along the way to help you remember the college , especially if you 'll be visiting many college campuses on one trip . Wander around a bit on your own . Picture yourself as a student on the campus . Do you feel comfortable ? <p> One more thing on visiting : if you 're thinking of a school far outside your own bioregion , visit the college when its weather is what you 'll have to endure . That is , visit the University of Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late spring . Will you really be OK with mountains of snow and shivering cold or tropically hot and humid ? Remember that you 'll not only be taking classes and studying there , but living there as well . <h> Talk to Students <p> One of your best sources of information is current students . While you 're on campus , stop and talk to four or five students at random . They 'll probably be more than willing to rate their own school for you . Ask them their favorite thing about the school , the thing about the school they really do n't like and how they picked this college to attend . Ask them what the dorms and social scene are like , and finding time to study . Ask if the school is a party school and if that causes problems . You have a list of questions to ask the admissions and financial aid people , you should have a list of questions to ask students as well . <h> Check Other Media <p> Besides talking to current students , be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find list of activities such as concerts , lectures , art shows , club meetings , yoga classes and other things to do . The newspaper will have ads for film series , movies , town restaurants and current news about the school . You 'll learn how life on campus will unfold while you 're there . <p> Pick up a copy of newspaper of the town while you 're at it . The local paper can give you an idea of town issues , such as local crime and the sports scene . You 'll be able to check what other resources and businesses the town has available in case you 'll be looking for a part-time job during school . <h> In Summary <p> The thing you really want to get from your visit is the sense that you would like to live and study at this college for the next four years . That 's why a college visit is vital . You 'll spend some exciting and challenging times during your college years . You 'll meet new friends that you 'll keep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most likely play pretty hard too .

Up to 33 percent of incoming freshmen do n't know how to study effectively , meaning that while they made read the assignments , do the problems and review before exams , they wo n't be able to apply what they 've learned appropriately . Unfortunately , many students do n't realize that they do n't study effectively , and they assume that the study habits they formed in high school will see them through college . If you do n't do well on the first tests in any of your classes , that 's a sign that maybe you have n't learned how to study well in college level classes . Your best bet , in this case , is to head for the college 's academic resources center and sign up for a workshop or a class on studying effectively . <p> We 've put together some tips to point students in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material at hand . See if any of these tips can help you learn to study better and more successfully . <h> Block off Enough Time <p> In a previous time management article , you learned about scheduling your time so that your classes and studying take center stage . For each hour you spend in class , you 'll need to devote two to three hours outside of class for study . In contrast to what you did in high school , that is , spending five or six hours in class each day , in college , you may spend three hours per week in class , but most of the learning happens outside of class during your study hours . It 's up to you to set aside enough time to study for each of your classes . If you 're taking 15 credit hours a semester , you 'll need to put in 30 to 45 hours worth of studying time a week . That 's a lot of time , but it is central to doing well in college . <h> Set Mini Deadlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big test or a paper due . Count backwards from that date and schedule time each week to study for the test or research and write part of the paper . By creating mini deadlines , you 'll ensure that you have done all the work you 'll need to do to ace the test or write an A paper . This is known as reverse engineering your bigger projects . By breaking down the bigger project , test or paper into smaller goals , you 'll get it all done step by step in time for the due date . <h> Take Breaks Often <p> Research studies show that people can concentrate intensely for about 45 minutes at a time . After that , they get tired and ca n't focus further . Set up your study time so you put a good 45 minutes focus on studying , then take a 10 to 15 minute break . Get up , stretch , walk around and get a drink of water . When your break is up , head back to your studying . <h> Active Learning <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just do the reading assignments and leave it at that . You have to actively participate by underlining , making notes and questioning what you 're read . You need to connect new material to what you learned last week to make it into a cohesive whole . Active reading and note taking keeps you engaged and thinking about the material . Many college professors assign homework , but they do n't pick up and grade every assignment . Homework , even ungraded , helps you to learn the subject , so do all homework whether it will earn you points or not . You 'll end up with a better understanding of the topic , which is the whole point of the exercise . <h> During Class <p> Attend all your classes . You 'll still miss a few most likely , but make it a point to attend all classes . Again , apply the active learning principles : sit near the front , take notes , ask questions and join in discussions . Learning requires your engagement in the subject . You 'll be surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to engage the material . If you do miss a class , ask a class friend if you can borrow their notes . Something from that classes ' discussion period could end up on the final exam . <h> Assistance Outside of Class <p> If you 're not quite getting a concept , show up at your professor 's office hours and ask for her help . Most professors enjoy working with their students and helping them when necessary . Working with your professor can help you understand the material better , and it might also lead to an enjoyable friendship . Do n't be shy , just go . There may be other opportunities for further learning outside of class as well . If workshops or tutorials are offered , take them . It might help clarify something you did n't quite understand or it might offer an opportunity for you to explain a concept to a classmate . Studies show that we retain 95 percent of what we teach to others . By explaining a concept to someone else , you 'll have to have extra clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every Class <p> Creating your own outline of a class allows you to pull all the material together into a cohesive whole . Doing this will move the material from your short term memory into your long term memory . You 'll be able to synthesize the material and understand better how it all fits together . Making an outline also helps you plug information into where it fits in the outline , allowing for easier studying later for the final . Begin making your outline using the class syllabus or your textbook 's table of contents . After each class , add your class notes into your outline . You 'll have to think about how to fit them in , but that 's part of the active learning process . <h> Test Your Knowledge <p> Give yourself practice tests . Most textbooks provide quizzes at the end of a chapter . Take them , and write out your answers as if it were a real test . The act of recalling information to answer the questions and writing it down anchors the material deeper in your memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more you actively think about the material at hand , the more you will remember it . Review and test what you 've learned frequently , rather than waiting until just before the midterm or final . <p> Use these tips to start studying effectively right from the start . It is n't enough anymore simply to read , memorize and cram the night before . For college level learning , you have to engage your brain and participate in learning the material . Hopefully , this will set you on the right path and make your college days a success . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

Since these skills are also essential to an active career , you 'll be ahead of the game by making these skills your top priority once you 're on campus . Conquer these time management skills and the rest of your college career will be successful . Neglect these , and you 'll be swamped even before you get to midterms exams and papers . <h> Keep a Schedule and Get Organized <p> You can use a calendar , a PDA , a checklist or a spreadsheet , but whatever method you choose , you 'll need a way to organize all your work and keep a schedule . Keep the class syllabus for each class as it outlines reading assignments , homework , projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep all the dates noted for work due . Make organized lists of tasks to be done . Write up a to-do list each night for the next day . During your first two weeks , this may seem as extra drudgery , but in a short while , you 'll learn how all this calendar-keeping makes your life so much easier . It is one of the major keystones of time management . If your first scheduling method does n't work for you , do n't be afraid to try another . <h> Keep Up Your Health <p> This may seem a strange thing to include under the rubric time management , but if you become sick , stressed or lack energy because of bad diet or too little sleep , your entire college career could be impeded . Keeping your health by fitting in the essentials such as healthy eating , exercise and sleeping regularly and well every night is far more important than you , as an 18 year old , may realize . You see , at your age , you recuperate well when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for healthy daily patterns until you are too bushed to get up in the morning , let alone do a full day 's worth of classes , homework and hours of study . Eating pizza instead of a balanced meal occasionally is n't a problem . Pizza every night , though , will bring you down , add unwanted pounds and kill your energy . Promise yourself you 'll practice good health habits and it will provide you a powerhouse of energy all through college . <h> Learn To Say No <p> In college , you have to become your own boss . Your parents are n't around and you are on your own . This is a heady trip for most young people , and it 's one of the biggest reasons for college drop outs because students fail to balance school , work and social time . You have to be in charge of yourself . Saying no to the cool party over at the next dorm or a weekend camping trip will be hard .

It 's intimidating even to think about it . Time management experts all say to break large tasks into smaller ones and take the smaller ones step by step . First do the research itself with time at the library , then outline what the paper will cover , then break up the writing into the various sections of the final paper . Work on the paper every week by taking care of the small steps , and it will be done by the time it is due . If you procrastinate until the last minute , you 'll be overwhelmed . Break it down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By spacing out your work , you 're far more likely to be successful . <h> Schedule in Social Time , Too <p> College is such an amazing time in most people 's lives because it is not only exciting academically , socially it 's a blast as well . Fun things to do and fun people to do them with is one of the best things about these years , so do n't neglect to add social time into your calendar . Do this wisely , and you 'll have learned the difficult job of balancing work and pleasure . The hardest trick is learning to do this well , so that you have both but not too much of either one . You need to relax a bit each day , taking time for yourself , as well as working and playing with others . Finding the right balance that works for you can be difficult , but all successful college students learn the trick . <h> Allow Room for the Unpredictable <p> You and your roommate have a big fight , one that comes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week . Because you 've completed half of your term paper and have handed in homework regularly , you 'll still be OK . Life is going to throw some unexpected things your way , and you 'll have to adapt on the fly . If you 've been working steadily all along , you 've built in some room to be flexible when the unpredictable occurs . If your priorities are now screwed up , reprioritize them so that things work . This is something you can only learn when you 're in the middle of it . Learn to roll with the punches , and you 'll have another invaluable skill . <p> In summary , as soon as you hit campus , start setting up your schedule and calendar and writing out your daily to-do list . You 'll soon learn the value of your hard-won time management skills as they will make your college career much smoother and more successful for you . As these skills easily transfer to every other part of your life , you 'll be glad you got them early . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

This is a strong indicator of your interest in the college , which counts when it comes to the admission decision . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

Like all other decisions , this one has pros and cons , strengths and weaknesses for each situation . The main thing to keep in mind is that you want the college you pick to be the right one for you academically and socially . The next few years will be an important time for you . You 'll be growing and changing in many ways , such as becoming more independent , making more decisions unilaterally and adapting to your new life . Whether you 're most comfortable somewhat close to home or desire a brand new situation farther from home is something only you can decide . <p> Before we delve into the pros and cons , here 's a couple of things to keep in mind . A good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 40 minutes away from her home . Yet she almost never went home since she did n't have a car . Then her family decided to move to another state as her father was offered a better job there . So she went to a college close to home until her home moved away from her . While rare , it can happen . Even if you choose to attend a college close to home , you may not get home all that often because you are busy building a new life at school . <p> Eighty-six percent of freshman college students chose a school within 500 miles of their home , according to the Chronicle of Higher Education . Over half of all college students attend a school within 100 miles of home . If you pick a school close to home , relax , you 'll be in the main stream . If you apply to schools far away , consider yourself adventurous . In other words , there 's no right or wrong on this question , just do what you consider best for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : There 's no doubt that staying close to home will save you money in travel costs . Living at home and commuting to school would save you even more , but most students heading off to college want to live at the college as well . However , if you live at home , you 'd save the expense of room and board , which could come to $8,000 to $10,000 a year , or approximately $40,000 for the whole four years . If you live at college , but it 's only an hour or three to drive home , then heading home for a weekend because you 're homesick is n't a big deal . If you 're 3,000 miles away , getting home for a weekend would be possible , but prohibitively expensive . Figuring out finances is a big part of going to college , and facing the reality of your own personal finances is one of those necessary steps in growing up and becoming independent . <p> Familiar : If you live at your college , but it 's within a few hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Family and friends are close enough to lend support if necessary . When you 're not that far away from home , jumping in the car for a quick trip home for face-to-face time is n't a huge problem . This extra level of comfort could make the transition to college life easier for you . <p> In State Tuition : Attending a college in your own state means a lower tuition than out of state public colleges would charge . Colleges often have scholarships for in state students as well . Going to an in state college could cost around $15,000 , an out of state college could cost up to $25,000 , and attending a private college can run you $35,000 a year and up . In state tuition can make a big difference in the cost of college . <h> Cons <p> Familiar : If family and friends are close by , are you more likely to depend on already formed friendships rather than developing new ones ? Will you rely overmuch on parental support when you should be experiencing the world on your own ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hindrance in that you might be too comfortable and reluctant to become more independent . <p> Depends on the Parents : If your parents are mother hen types and insist on visiting you all the time or having you come home more than you 'd wish , then moving farther away might help establish more space for you to grow and develop . You will need that space to become the person you 're growing into in this exciting time of your life . <h> Going to College Far Away <h> Pros <p> New Experiences : Nearly all the people you meet will be new to you . You have a clean slate , so to speak , to find new friends and grow intellectually and socially . You have a new city and a new environment to discover and explore and gradually make your own territory . <p> More Independence : Your family and friends are now hours or longer away and you will have to adapt and become independent if you 're not already . While this can be intimidating and a bit scary , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you discover new facets to your personality that you were n't aware existed . <h> Cons <p> More Expensive : Going to college out of state or across the country will no doubt cost you more than a college close to home . Unless you 're going for an unusual major offered only at one university , such as blacksmithing at Southern Illinois University , then staying in state makes more financial sense . Business administration , however , is offered nearly everywhere . You 'll have to spend more not only on tuition and room and board , but expenses for doing your laundry , eating outside of the college meal plan , travel and getting around town . <p> Travel Inconvenience : Besides the cost of a car , fuel , parking and/or airplane tickets , you 'll have to reckon with the inconveniences that come with travel such as cancelled flights , hazardous weather , waiting for security checks at the airport , lost baggage and so forth . No matter how often or seldom you do go home , it will cost you time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college far outside your experience so far can be eye-opening and exciting , it can also cause some culture shock , especially if you come from Farmland , Minnesota and attend a large state college in southern California . Culture shock can cause stress and discomfort , which might distract you from your studies . Be wary about choosing a college too far out of your life experiences so far . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

In high school , you had very little choice , except maybe to take chemistry rather than biology . However , in college , everything having to do with classes is a choice . You can choose among general education classes , courses you 'll need to take for your major or core classes required by the college , if any . On top of that , you can choose when to take the class , on which days and at what time , morning or afternoon . How do you figure all this out ? You 're afraid you may miss a class you are supposed to take or take too many of the same type of class . <p> The first thing to do is make an appointment with an academic advisor . If you 've already chosen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a faculty member of your major 's department . Other academic advisors , however , are available for everyone to contact . An advisor knows all the requirements and core classes and knows how many general education ( gen ed ) classes you 'll need to graduate . He or she can help you get signed up for the right classes for your first semester . You 'll still have to make all those choices , but at least you can do it with sound advice and assurance . Contact an advisor soon after you get your dorm room straightened out . <p> On the other hand , you might have had help picking your classes during orientation . In that case , you can relax , just make sure you get registered properly and you 'll be all set . <p> Your college may have sent you the college course handbook . If so , be sure and look over it carefully . It will list all required courses , gen ed classes , class schedules , where classes meet and a lot of other information . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's some basics about college classes you 'll need to know . <h> Class Formats <p> The classes you 'll see in the handbook come in different formats . You 'll see them listed as lecture , discussion , seminar and lab . <p> Lecture " lecture classes are large , often 200 to 300 students in a large university . Usually , these classes are introductory courses taught by a professor . In a lecture , profs expound , students listen and take notes . If the professor allows any time for questions , it is generally at the end of class time and only for a few minutes . <p> Discussion section " If the lecture class meets three times a week , two of those classes may be lectures with the other period set aside for discussion . These discussion sections of the lecture might be led by a graduate student T.A . or teaching assistant . Up to 20 to 30 students may attend the discussion section . Discussions focus on the material presented by the professor . <p> Seminar " seminars usually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more personal setting . Taught by the professor , seminars will include both lecture and discussion and may meet either three times a week or in longer classes on Tuesday/Thursday . The seminar format is usually reserved for advanced courses or upper level classes . <p> Lab " Lab classes are usually associated with science classes . Students will take the material they 've learned in a lecture and attempt to apply what they 've learned in various lab experiments . For example , in a biology class , students might dissect an animal in the lab after learning its anatomy and physiology in a lecture . <p> Foreign language labs " many language classes may also have an attached lab class where students listen to tapes and repeat what they hear to work on vocabulary , grammar and accent . <p> Mixed format classes--You can also expect to find mixed format classes where there might be the occasional lecture amid many discussions or freshman seminars which include lectures , video presentations , group projects by students , etc . <h> General Education Classes <p> For most four year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to graduate with 30 to 45 of those being in general education classes . Check with your college as variations exist within many college degree programs . The skills component of the general education curriculum include mathematics and basic communications , that is , being able to reason quantitatively and to communicate both in writing and in speaking . The knowledge domain component includes the arts , humanities and sciences . These classes are in natural science , social science , American history , western civilization , world civilization , humanities , arts and foreign languages . As you can see , you 'll have a wide variety of disciplines and classes to choose from . Some of these classes may also be required for your major . Your academic advisor will be able to guide you in choosing which would be best for your freshman year . <h> What Interests You ? <p> Whether you know what you are going to major in or not , at this point you can pick classes that pique your interest . You 've always wanted to know more about medieval European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will satisfy the general education requirement of a humanities class and it might lead you into majoring in history . You might find psychology fascinating , or discover that you enjoy working in the biology lab . At this point in your college career , expand both your skills and knowledge by studying what interests you and getting credit hours you need for graduation . <h> Be Careful not to Overload <p> In your first year of college , you 'll be going through a lot of transitions , both personally and academically . Each college recommends a certain number of classes and credit hours , and it is best to stick within that limit . While you may feel the temptation to take more classes in order to graduate earlier , you could easily overload yourself and not do well in one or two classes . Take enough classes to challenge yourself , but do n't overload . After your first year , you 'll be better able to judge how much you can take on , but be circumspect at first . Find your balance first . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

Your parents wo n't be around to set parameters and the college rightly figures that your boundaries are up to you since you turned 18 . As the boss of you , how do you want to handle your health ? No doubt you 're aware of the basics , a good diet , exercise , a good night 's sleep and sunshine . Now , with everything else that 's going on like new classes , new friends , new environment and new stresses , you have to create a plan for staying healthy and stick to it . <p> Before we get into the whys and hows of a health plan , you should realize ahead of time that you 'll no doubt make mistakes or cheat on your plan . To a certain extent , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the certain extent " if you keep cheating beyond that point , you 'll be in trouble before you know it . Be careful , then , when you go ahead and allow yourself to screw the plan and go out for that oh so tempting pizza and coke or do an all-nighter before a big math test . Strategize from the first how often you will allow yourself to wander off track . One to three times a month would probably be OK and not set you back too much . Seriously , though , any more than that and you wo n't be cheating your plan , you 'll be cheating yourself . <p> The ideal college health plan will build the basic cornerstones of health into your daily life . You need to incorporate eating healthy , exercise , enough sleep and getting outdoors into your day , so that every day you 're on campus , you are doing the basics without even having to think about it . You walk to classes and after class go for a quick walk , jog , run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices in the dining hall , skipping the sweets and going big time for fruits , veggies and protein . You make sure you get six to eight hours of sleep a night and do some of your exercising outdoors when the weather permits . It 's that simple , except , of course , that you 're a college student who wants and needs to have fun as well as study hard . Still , remember these basics and build them into your day : <p> Healthy diet " fruits and vegetables , lean protein , whole grains <p> Regular exercise " 30 to 60 minutes three times a week <p> Good sleep " six to eight hours a night <p> Fresh air and sunshine " daily if possible <h> Three Danger Zones <p> Bosses know to watch out for any complications to their business plans . As the boss of you , you 'll want to watch out for these three dangers to your health plan . <p> Temptation " this is a biggy , of course . Every day you 'll be hit by wanting that piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for burgers and fries with your friends . You 'll want to stay up late to talk to friends from home on the phone , watch the new DVD or just share laughs with your roommate . You 'll head out to the party swearing that you wo n't drink , but when you get there , you 're tempted . There 's no avoiding temptation , unfortunately . Each person handles it differently , and we are all tempted by different things . How you handle temptation is a measure of your adulthood . Just do your best . <p> Stress " with a faltering economy , it seems everyone is feeling more stress . While stress in life is unavoidable , and sometimes it is necessary , chronic stress can lead to chronic diseases . College freshmen face many demands and challenges and find them stressful . Deep breathing , stretching , yoga , tai chi or meditation can all help you de-stress . Figure out what works best for you and focus on that . If you feel you need help , do n't hesitate , reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up an appointment pronto . <p> Depression " Another biggy that you 'll have to face most likely . The first thing you need to do is notice that you are depressed . A 2011 survey of college students revealed that 30 percent reported depression that made it difficult for the students to function . If you 've noticed yourself feeling sad , anxious , hopeless , guilty , worthless or irritable , you 're depressed . You 'll then notice a lack of energy , you 're no longer interested in your extracurricular activities , and you have trouble concentration , making decisions or falling asleep . Go for help when you first notice the symptoms since waiting wo n't help . Go talk to a doctor or mental health counselor and tell them your symptoms . There are effective treatments that can help , so do yourself a favor and nip this one in the bud . Get together with your friends and let them know as well . You need the support they can give you . Do n't let depression derail your college career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your computer or reading for a while , take a five minute break . Get up , walk around and stretch . Take a deep breath and move around for a few minutes . You 'll return to your studying invigorated . <p> Keep your immune system strong " eating fruits and veggies will help , as will some simple diet supplements . Get some aged Kyolic garlic capsules and take them . Vitamin C and E also boost your immune system . Eat your spinach and other greens . By keeping a strong immune system , you may be able to fight off colds and flu and diminish stress levels as well . <p> Drink water " keeping yourself hydrated will help you in a myriad of ways . The water will flush toxins out of your system , balance your body fluids , energize your muscles , keep your skin clear and keep all your other body systems regular . Add lemon slices for flavor and you 'll get extra vitamin C as well . <p> Avoiding flu " if you 're feeling the slightest bit under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . College students are always in close contact with other people such as roommates , other students and professors , and any one of these may harbor flu germs . Play it safe and get the shot . <p> Develop your support network " start this at orientation and keep building it as you start classes and meet your dorm mates . When you need help , they 'll be there for you . When they need help , you 'll provide what they need . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821

Food for Thought <p> By Patricia Gorden Neill - February 26th , 2013 <p> A debate is quietly raging in America whether a college education is the prime benefit to young people that it used to be . Good , well-paying jobs are scarce , even for those with degrees and competition for them is fierce . College graduates saddled with student loan debt are moving back home with their parents because they ca n't find a job that allows them to live separately and pay down their loans at the same time . <h> College Tuitions and Student Loan Debt <p> College tuition has become hugely expensive . For example , at the University of Pennsylvania in 1955 , tuition totaled $800 , with room and board at $835 and books at $50 per year . In 2012 , tuition had grown to $37,620 , with a general fee of $3,510 . The price for a room in one of the residence halls came to $7,592 and the meal plan to $4,286 . <p> Nearly two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25,000 for many of them . That student loan debt must be paid back with interest . Even bankruptcy does not wipe out student loan debt . The government can and does garnish social security payments to the elderly if they still have student loan debt to pay . <p> Google student loan debt and you can find multiple horror stories of young people caught in this debt 's incredibly sticky web . With the U.S. economy as shaky as it is , and perhaps to remain that way for a time , the wisdom of going deeply into debt to finance a college education must be called into question . <h> Uncertain Employment <p> Employment for college graduates is no longer the sure thing it was years ago . Only 55 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 were employed in 2012 . The unemployment rate for college graduates under 25 years old is 9.3 percent . Hundreds of thousands of college graduates hold jobs as janitors , waiters and waitresses , cashiers and retail sales people . A college degree can be a ticket to better paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Even people with graduate degrees such as master 's and doctorates are underemployed or unemployed or even on welfare . <h> Work vs . College after High School <p> Does this mean that young people should not go to college ? No , of course not " many young people still benefit from the traditional four years of college , both educationally and socially . However , more and more people are recognizing that we as a nation must rethink our educational dogma . For decades the mantra resounded that everyone should get a college education to get a good job and succeed in life . That mantra should be laid to rest . <p> If you are currently in high school and trying to decide whether to go to college or not , then it will benefit you to consider these things . While you may feel pressure to head right off to your dad 's alma matter , just remember that there 's no law that says you have to go to college right after high school . You can find a job you like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're considering " and work for a year or two . With that work experience under your belt , and a much better idea of what that type of work it entails and whether you like it or not , then you can start applying to colleges for the education that will enhance your life and career . <h> Explore Other Options <p> For that matter , if you 're not going to college right away , consider all the other options . You can volunteer overseas in any number of interesting , rewarding endeavors . You can work as an environmental volunteer in Australia or help build houses for the poor in Honduras , for example .

From 2002 to 2007 , student enrollment in online degree programs grew over 19 percent , a huge increase compared with the 1.5 percent growth in college enrollment overall . Many traditional universities and colleges now offer online degrees as well as on campus programs . Thirty-five percent or one in three of all higher learning institutions now offer online degrees . In other words , online education has definitely arrived and joined the establishment . The increase in online or distance learning is due in part to the increase in demand for these courses and to the simple fact that the technology now exists to make online education fully functional . <h> Which is Better ? <p> Is a distance learning degree as valid as an on campus degree ? The answer to that question hangs on other considerations . First , is the online degree program accredited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Education or by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation ? If it is , then the education delivered by the online method is just as valid as that received on campus . Accreditation is important . <p> Second , does the online program use the same curriculum as the on campus program ? While the method of delivery might be different , that is , face to face versus online discussion , if the educational materials are the same , then the validity is the same . <p> Third , it depends on the degree program you are interested in . If you are considering a degree in the hard sciences , healthcare or engineering , then the program likely incorporates hands-on learning components such as lab time or time in the advanced computer technology center . Students in a nursing program are required to train in a supervised medical facility as part of their degree . Prospective teachers will spend a semester or so student teaching . Health care students might have laboratory projects to complete . If your degree requires physical resources such as labs or computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other degree programs translate excellently to the Web , such as healthcare management , information technology or business degrees . <p> Fourth , what do employers think of online degrees in the field you 've chosen ? This question is still being asked and investigated , as more and more employers become more comfortable with distance learning degrees . A survey completed by Excelsior College and Zogby International found that 61 percent of small business owners and CEOs are now familiar with online degree programs . <p> When it comes to your degree , the reputation of college weighs more than online or on campus delivery . Accreditation by a recognized and approved accreditation association matters greatly . If those two things are in place at the university or college you 're considering , then online versus on campus should be decided on your own characteristics . If you are highly motivated and have good time management skills , then online learning would be a good fit for you .

Students fresh out of high school could go either way if they have the self discipline for online study . Universities and colleges also offer hybrid programs that are partly online and partly in class . For some degrees , the hybrid program is a good bet with the best of both worlds . <p> Rest assured , once you check that reputation of the school and its accreditation are good , then the online or on campus decision depends more on your needs and desires than on the validity of the degree .

Proofreading the application once or twice before sending it can also save you from some of these common errors . Most of all , taking enough time to fill out the application without rushing is the key to successfully filling it out .

The college application process entails meeting many deadlines , for the application itself , for financial aid forms for the college , federal or state and scholarships .

Make sure you give your counselor a list of the colleges you 've applied to , and any deadlines for necessary forms . Neglecting to let them know could mean an incomplete application if the college does n't receive your transcript or a recommendation letter . <h> Not Listing Extracurricular Activities <p> Even if the space on the form is small , do your best to tell the college all about your outside the classroom activities .

When you 're done and you press send , make sure the application is actually submitted . If you do n't receive confirmation from the college that the application has been received , then it was n't submitted properly or there was an electronic screw up in the process . The college should send you an email or you 'll get a Web response or a receipt . <h> Letting Your Parents In on the Process <p> You are applying for college , not your parents .

You received acceptance letters from one of your safety colleges and one of your target schools . The one college you 've dreamt about for years put you on their waitlist . It was one of your reach schools because you did n't quite have the academic credentials to make you a natural match . The good news here is that two colleges accepted you , and your dream school did n't outright reject your application . Instead , it put you into college limbo , the dreaded waitlist . The bad news is that you 've only got a slight chance to move from the waitlist to acceptance . According to National Association for College Admission Counseling , about 30 percent of students who are waitlisted finally get admitted . That means there 's a 70 percent chance that you will not get off that waitlist . <p> Waitlists are a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshman class starting in the fall .

Some students will get a better financial aid package from another school . Other students might find their personal financial status has changed for the worse , putting college out of the picture for the present . Colleges must estimate their yield , or the number of accepted students who will actually enroll . When the estimate is short of the number of students the college needs for its next freshman class , the college will alert those on the waitlist , accepting enough to fill out the class . <p> Some colleges rank the students on the waitlist and others do n't . If a college ranks its waitlist , some students on the list will have a better chance of admittance than others . For the colleges that do not rank students on the waitlist , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notified you of your waitlist status , it will ask if you wish to remain on the waitlist . If you decide to move on and enroll in a school that has accepted you , then you 're out of waitlist limbo . If you accept the position on the waitlist , then you will have to wait until the college finds out exactly how many accepted students enroll and send in their deposits , usually on or around the first of May . Waitlisted students can expect to hear if they 've been accepted sometime late in May , June , July or the latest , in August . Some students do n't hear until the week before classes start . <p> Once the enrollment numbers come in , the admissions folks turn to the waitlist and start going over waitlisted students ' applications once again .

How many students are usually waitlisted , and how many offered acceptance off the waitlist ? <p> Is the waitlist ranked , and if so , where you are ranked on the list ? <p> Are there major obstacles in your application to being accepted ? Again , the admission office may or may not tell you . In fact , it 's unlikely that you 'll find out from admission people .

Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are offered admission , will there be dorm room and financial aid available ? <h> Communicate Your Continuing Interest and Commitment <p> Write a letter reaffirming your interest in the school and your intention of enrolling if you are accepted . Tell the school why you are a great match for them academically and socially . Admission officers are more likely to accept waitlisted students who say they will enroll if offered admittance , so if that is the case for you , be sure and let them know . Tell the college that it is your number one choice . Market yourself with a strong letter that emphasizes how well you will fit in at the school and how you can contribute to the college community . Making another visit to the college or asking to interview with admissions if you did n't do it before are excellent ideas that convey your interest and commitment . <h> Send in Significant New Data <p> If you have new application data , you took the SAT again and got a higher score or your spring semester grades improved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got a job or an internship or won an award or had a column printed in the newspaper , tell the college .

Anything that can improve on your application materials can help get you off the waitlist and into the school . <h> Consult with Your Guidance Counselor <p> Get together with your high school guidance counselor for a strategy session . Perhaps he could write another recommendation letter to strengthen your case .

If you thought the FAFSA was challenging , you have n't seen anything until you meet the CSS profile form . A private worksheet for the CSS profile provided by TuitionCoach that explains the questions on the CSS is 20 pages long , so expect a rather long , grueling experience in filing the CSS profile . <p> The good news is that only 400 or so private colleges and universities require the CSS , so check with all the colleges on your list to see if you 'll even need to file this form . You may be one of the lucky millions of students who do not . If you 're shooting for one of the Ivies or any of the elite private colleges , however , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which runs the College Scholarship Service , provides a list of the colleges that require the form , but always check with each college individually . Colleges join up or drop off the CSS program and it is tough to keep the list up to date . Do your due diligence and check your college 's financial aid office Web page . You will need each college 's deadline for CSS and other forms to be filed anyway , and checking the college 's financial aid office page is your best bet for finding out if the CSS is required . <p> Mostly , it is only expensive , elite private colleges that use the CSS to get a more detailed and refined picture of a family 's financial situation . These colleges tend to provide a great deal of money to students they want attending their school , which is why they ask for the information revealed in the CSS . Filing the CSS for these schools has its pros and cons . The good is that a truly needy student could receive a lot more money from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bad is that the CSS looks at a family 's home equity and retirement accounts , which the FAFSA does n't take into consideration . Just as a student could gain a lot more in financial aid from filing the CSS profile , other students could be offered less money because of their family 's equity in the home or other assets . <p> Filing the CSS can be done on a printed form or online , just as with the FAFSA . Either way , register at College Board 's CSS Financial Aid Profile page at least two weeks before your college 's scholarship priority deadline date . If many of the colleges you 'll be applying to require the CSS , then once you 've completed the form , you can have College Board send the information to each of the schools you list . <p> Another CSS bummer is that filing the CSS profile costs $25 plus $16 for each school you list to receive the information . However , you do n't have to fill out the form more than once , and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tips on Filing the CSS <p> To register for the CSS profile , you can start by creating an online account at College Board . While it is n't necessary for registering for the CSS , the College Board account can help in your college search , save all your searches , register you for the SAT and search for scholarships , so it is probably worthwhile to get an account . <p> Once you register for the CSS , the online form will gather enough information from you to determine if you tax status is dependent on your parents or if you 're an independent student . Answers to other questions allows College Board to provide you with a customized CSS profile form so you 'll only have to answer questions that pertain to you . The customized form will let you know if colleges and scholarships you 're applying to require answers additional questions specific to the college or if a non-custodial parent profile is needed as well if your parent 's are divorced . <h> Good Points about the CSS <p> A couple of nice things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help system and the FAQ is extensive and covers nearly everything . <p> Live customer service is available for help in filling out the form . <p> Provides alerts if there is missing or incorrect information . <p> Handy text box near the end of the form allows you to explain in greater detail about extenuating circumstances such as huge medical bills , divorce , a lost job or a death in the family . <h> Bad Points about the CSS <p> It charges a fee to file and another fee to send it to the colleges that require it . <p> The CSS is much longer and far more detailed than the FAFSA because the CSS asks about every detail of your family 's financial situation , asking a lot of questions income streams that the FAFSA does n't consider . It considers everything from retirement accounts and life insurance plans to the car you drive and other various assets . <p> Besides the CSS profile itself , the colleges on your list may also ask additional questions or require extra forms to be completed .

The CSS Profile deadline is November 15 the year before you 'll be attending college for early decision and early action admission students and February 1 for regular admission students . Check the deadlines for FAFSA and CSS profile at each school you 'll be applying to and get the forms filed as soon as possible . Financial aid decisions are often made on a first come first served basis , so you really want to be the early bird to get the biggest , juiciest financial aid worm . <p> In summary , check with all the colleges on your list to determine if they require the CSS profile and be sure and find out the deadline for these important financial forms . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , gather up all the information you 'll need , register for the CSS and get to work . Chances are filing the CSS will help provide a real boost in financial aid for your college education .

Please read this carefully , as high school students need a clear understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each option . Early decision is similar to early action , but with one big difference in that early decision is binding , meaning a student must attend that college if accepted . Here 's a look at your options in applying to college . <h> Early Decision <p> With the Early Decision ( ED ) option , you apply to one college early , usually by November 1st of your senior year . If accepted , you can not apply to any other college or university . Since a majority of colleges accept more early decision students than students out of the regular admission pool , you have a better chance of being accepted . Usually you will be notified of the college 's decision early in December . These are the advantages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college , and knowing if you 've been accepted much earlier than your peers . This would lessen the usual stress of your senior year in high school for sure . <p> The disadvantage is that you are under contract to attend that college even if you are not offered any financial aid , a decision which is made later . You may not apply to any other college using early application options . If you are not accepted by your ED college , you can still apply to other colleges using the regular admission option . <p> For academically qualified students , with good grades in rigorous classes , and high SAT/ACT scores who urgently wish to attend their top choice of college , ED can be a blessing , especially if paying the college bill is n't a concern . Most other students should avoid ED as it locks them into one specific school , not allowing them to apply to any others unless they are not accepted . Students looking into the early decision option should ask their parents ' and guidance counselor 's advice before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Early Action ( EA ) option comes in two varieties . With the EA option , you apply to your number one college by November 1st for many colleges . Some colleges , however , have different deadlines for EA , so check the college you 're interested in . The college then let 's you know their decision by middle to late December . The advantage of the EA option is a better chance of being accepted as colleges have higher acceptance rates for early action . Students not accepted under early action can still be considered with the regular admission students . Early action is not legally binding as is the case with early decision . Students can apply early to other colleges . While you will know the decision earlier than your peers , you do n't have to make a decision until May 1 . This gives you time to work on the financial aid side of things . <p> The second EA option is single choice early action ( SCEA ) . Single choice EA has all the advantages of regular EA , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not bound to attend if accepted , but the college gains the knowledge that you definitely preferred their school . <h> Regular Admission <p> Most colleges and most students by far go the regular admissions route . Students get their applications in between the middle of January and February 1st . Please check the colleges that you 'll be applying to , however , for their specific deadline for applications . Students find out if they 've been accepted sometime in April . The advantages of the regular admission option are that students have longer to fill out their applications and they can apply to as many schools as they 'd like . The disadvantage is that colleges have slightly lower acceptance rates from the regular admissions pool . <h> Rolling Admission <p> Colleges that offer this option will accept applications from students any time during the admission period , generally from September to July . Colleges look at each application when it arrives and makes its decision , sending out letters of acceptance or rejection as soon as the decisions are made . Admission to the college is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rolling admission option should get their application in as early as possible . Once the college has accepted all the students it wants for that class , no other applications are considered . In other words , if students apply later , their chances of acceptance are lower and it is less likely they will be considered for financial aid . <h> Late Admission <p> Many colleges and universities have a late admission policy as well , with deadlines between July and August . A disadvantage of this option is that once a college has all the students it wants for the incoming class , no other students will be accepted . Students should apply as early as possible even for late admissions , the earlier the better . Contact the college first and find out if they 're still accepting applications . <h> Open Admission <p> Online schools and community colleges offer open admissions , meaning if you have a high school diploma or a general education development ( GED ) certificate , you 'll be admitted . Many students who did n't do well in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an associate 's degree , others to get good grades and transfer to four year colleges to obtain a bachelor 's degree . <p> The above are the major admission options . Students might run into other admission terms , however , but they are generally special cases . Some other admission terms include : <h> Early Admission <p> Exceptional students with an excellent academic record are allowed to take college courses even before they 've graduated high school . These students can earn college credits and earn their degrees more quickly than their peers . <h> Early Evaluation <p> Students who apply using the regular admission option can request early evaluation . Applications must be submitted earlier than the regular admission deadline ; students find out if they 've been accepted in March rather than April . <h> Deferred Admission <p> A deferred admission means that a student has applied to a college and been accepted , but they wish to defer their enrollment for a year . This is also called a gap year , where a student takes a year between high school and college to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career options . <p> In summary , students should study these various admission options to see which particular option might work best for them . For the majority of students , the best bet is to get all their college applications in by Thanksgiving of their senior year .

The economy has tanked and times are tough for everyone . Students graduate from college with an average of $27,000 in student loan debt and once out , they face the same dismal employment scene as all the other unemployed . Hundreds of people apply for one open service position . Where there used to be hundreds of job openings everywhere , the help wanted section of newspapers in every town are slim and getting slimmer all the time . Brand new Ph.D . students take jobs at coffee shops to pay at least a few of their bills , and grimace hopelessly when the thought of their student debts pop up . Many American students are opting to attend Canadian colleges as tuition is much lower than in the States . College tuitions have risen 500 percent over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going up about five percent a year for the near future . <p> How can you possibly afford to go to college when the economic situation looks so bleak ? This question is keeping a lot of high school students and their parents awake at night considering ways they could pay for an increasingly expensive college education . These days , students and parents are doing everything they can to control college costs , while ensuring the students get the chance to go . <h> The Good News <p> One bright concept in higher education is gaining traction in 21st century America . It 's an old concept , introduced at the University of Cincinnati in 1906 , but is once again drawing schools , employers and students to investigate this win-win-win higher education model . Co-operative education has students learning in classrooms , then applying that knowledge in a job matched to their educational goals . The cycle repeats as the student returns to the classroom , bringing in new ideas and concerns from the workplace in another semester of book learning , then returns to the job for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the real world and employers gain energetic , intelligent employees who are trained while they 're in college and hired post-graduation if the position works out . <p> The federal government funded co-operative education from 1965 with the Higher Education Act through 1992 , when Congress ended the support . Today , corporations and businesses involved in cooperative education programs pay the students ' salaries while they 're working . In return the student applies constructive energy and cutting edge knowledge and skills learned in the classroom to the job . Payment varies among all the employers in the program , but students can earn between $7,000 to $10,000 on the low end of the scale to $18,000 and up on the high end . The student then pays tuition costs to college for academic credits earned while on the job . <p> Over 400 colleges and universities have cooperative education programs set up for a variety of majors , mostly engineering , science , accounting , finance and business . The cooperative education program is mandatory for certain majors at certain schools . For example , all majors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of Design , Architecture , Art , and Planning at the University of Cincinnati must complete a mandatory coop education program for their degree . For other majors , the coop program is available , but not mandatory for business and accounting majors . Even some liberal arts majors can get in on coop education programs , art history , psychology , English and language majors especially . Students getting degrees in the Hospitality sector can also merge their classroom knowledge with real world job skills in the coop program . <p> Cooperative education is a win-win opportunity for students worried about paying their hefty education bill . They can learn the history , background and theory of their field in the classroom , then obtain hands on skills in real world applications in a job closely aligned with their major . During their semesters of full time work , students earn money to help pay college costs . Future employers love the fact these students have significant work experience to go with their degree . The majority of coop students have jobs waiting for them when they graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities and programs available , many students should be able to ease their financial burden by attending colleges with cooperative education programs , working and getting college credits at the same time . <h> Frequently Asked Questions about Cooperative Education <h> What 's the difference between internships and coop jobs ? <p> An internship is usually a short term , one semester or summer involvement in the workplace . A coop position usually includes three or four semesters of workplace employment alternating with classroom learning . It means more involvement with the employer and advancement on the job as the student progresses . While internships can be paid or unpaid , coop employment is usually long term , full time and paid . Although internships and coop employment are similar , they are not the same thing , even if people use the terms interchangeably . <h> What are the benefits of the coop program for students and employers ? <p> Students benefit by gaining real world experience that fits in with their educational goals , earning money to pay their college bills , developing responsibility , confidence and competence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employers benefit by being able to evaluate student workers prior to having to hire them permanently , training student workers while they 're on the job and in school at the same time , increasing cost effectiveness of training and recruitment and by gaining whatever cutting edge knowledge the student has learned in the classroom . <h> What types of schools offer coop education ? <p> Universities , colleges and community colleges can all have cooperative education programs . Henry Ford Community College in Dearborn , Michigan runs a successful coop education program . At least two colleges in the University of Cincinnati participate in the university 's coop program . Over 400 colleges and universities in the U.S. have cooperative education programs , and the trend for coop education is growing stronger in a declining economy . <h> Do graduates of coop programs have an easier time finding jobs after college ? <p> Yes , coop graduates do find it easier to get jobs after graduation . In fact , 95 percent of coop students have jobs waiting them at their coop employer . While no one can guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that large numbers of students who have participated in coop programs find jobs easily after college . Employers want the real world experience and the skills that go with it . <h> Does it take longer to graduate if I participate in the coop program ? <p> It can , many colleges with cooperative education incorporate the terms of employment into the structure of the degree so that it takes a student five years instead of four to graduate . The student spends nearly a full year working full time for the employer , and is engaged in classroom studies the rest of the time . However , not all coop programs take five years as all can be structured differently . <h> Are all cooperative education programs the same ? <p> No , there is quite a bit of variation in coop programs . Many programs are set up as alternate terms , first a semester of classroom study , then a semester of full time employment , switching back and forth until graduation . Community colleges use a parallel model where the student attends classes part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . However the work schedule is arranged , coop students usually have gained a full year 's worth of real world job experience before graduation , which gives them a boost later on in the job market . The best coop programs provide activities that connect the work and the study segments of the program , including seminars , teachers visiting the workplace and perhaps employers visiting the classroom . <h> If I find a job off campus on my own , is that the same thing as the coop program ? <p> No . While some coop education programs have students find work with employers on their own , and then sign up for the coop program , finding a job off campus on your own does not constitute coop experience . You must register in the program formally and sign contracts and agreements with both the college and the employer . While you 'll no doubt gain valuable workplace skills on your own in getting a job , the coop program arranges for college credit for coop employment and arranged terms of full time work along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coop programs ? <p> Yes , many schools are going global in their coop programs by arranging employment overseas for their students . International coop students take specialized language and culture classes related to the country of their employer , and agree to work five or six months straight overseas . International cooperative education programs are intense and competitive . At the University of Cincinnati 's international coop program , once students are admitted , they undertake hundreds of hours of language and cultural study before going overseas . The requirements are four years of academic study in their field , one year of work experience , usually gained through the regular coop program , and an intensive seminar course to prepare for the job overseas . Both students and employers in the international coop program benefit in a variety of ways . <p> International Cooperative Education ( ICE ) is an organization that has arranged overseas coop work experience for students since 1971 .

At a few of the most selective Ivy Leagues , the interview is mandatory . Colleges manage this by using their networks of alumni in various parts of the country . If you are visiting your college choices , you can arrange for an interview with the admissions office . If you live far away from your dream school , contact the admissions office to line up an interview with an alumnus in your area . Some colleges do interviews via webcam over the Internet using Skype . <p> All colleges differ on the weight they put on different sections of the college application , and while an interview is not the top of the list in importance , it is one chance for a college representative to meet with you face to face . As a student , it allows you to signal your interest in attending that specific college , something all colleges would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can put a face to their grades and test scores . <p> A very few colleges make the intense effort it takes to interview multiple thousands of applicants , usually involving the alumni network .

You 'll be doing interviews for the rest of your life for jobs , for scholarships and for a host of other reasons .

You should know why you have chosen that college to apply to , what attracted you to it and reasons you 'd like to go there , rather than another school . One question you 're sure to be asked is why you are interested in the college . Prepare an answer in advance , but do n't memorize anything . Just be ready to express why you got interested in the school in the first place . <h> Dress Well <p> Dress as if you 're giving a presentation at your school . You do n't have to wear a suit , or anything too stuffy , but neat , clean and what 's called business casual will work fine . If you 're pierced in multiple places , you might want to remove all the body jewelry before the interview .

While you may be nervous , try your best to appear confident and comfortable . Be yourself during the interview by sharing some of your passions in life and what you 'd like to accomplish during your college career . Thank the interviewer when you leave . <h> Have Questions Prepared <p> You should prepare some questions for the interviewer before you go . If your interview is with an alumnus or alumna , ask them how they enjoyed their college stint , or have them explain one of the school 's programs you 're interested in . Interviews work both ways ; the college wants to give a good impression too . The best interviews are conversations between two people with information and impressions going both ways . <h> Practice <p> If you have a teacher , guidance counselor or mentor you 're comfortable with , ask them to interview you as a college rep might to help you prepare .

Relate your passions to the college and its wonderful mathematics or study abroad program . Tying your passion to something the school offers will make you come alive as a person to the interviewer . <h> Leave the Parents and Friends at Home <p> The interview is between you as an applicant and the college interviewer . While some parents have a tendency to hover over their college bound children , it does n't go over well with admissions or other school representatives .

College is one of the best investments you can make in terms of time and money , but it must be done right . Do n't just head off to the Big C daydreaming of fun late night dorm room huddles solving the problems of the world . Kids who do that these days end up deep in student loan debt with a dead-end , minimum wage job . Instead , plan your college career as if you were planning the logistics of a war or political campaign . Know that by using your brains you can cut the cost of your education by thousands of dollars . <h> If You Do n't Know What You Want , Do n't Go <p> This may seem harsh advice , but if you do n't know what you want to do when you graduate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do know what you want to do , then go and do it . If you find your passion and what you 'd love to do first , it will make your college career a breeze . You 'll love even the tough courses . If you go without knowing what you want to do , then you 're likely just wasting time and money . The worst case scenario is if you take out student loans to go to college when you are n't sure of what you want to study or to do after graduation . While millions of kids have done this in past decades , it is a deadly trap today because of increasing tuition costs and a terrible job market . Do n't fall into it . <p> It wo n't kill you if you take some time between high school and college . Instead of college , find a job , go work on a farm , volunteer or start a small business . Find something else to do and learn some skills . Believe me , when you do go to college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go into it knowing exactly what you want to get out of it . <h> Seriously Consider Community College or Go Online <p> Want to save thousands on your college education ? Attend a community college at half the cost of a four year institution . The first two years of a bachelor 's degree are spent taking general education courses , liberal arts such as English , composition , history , social studies and math and science . You can take these same courses at a junior college and either get your associate 's degree , or transfer to a four year college to finish up with a bachelor 's . You can do the same with online classes that generally cost far less than on campus and cuts out the commuting cost altogether . The one thing to look into before taking this path is to find out if the community college or online college credits will transfer to the four year school . Current research shows that classes at community college or online classes provide equivalent educational value as a traditional on campus education . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examination Program ( CLEP ) allows you to take exams to earn college credits toward a degree . Over 2,900 colleges and universities accept CLEP credits . While you will have to pay a fee to take each exam , usually around $80 , you can earn four to eight college credits if you make a certain grade on the exam . With typical college courses costing $700 to $1500 , you can save a huge amount of money by testing on the knowledge you already have . Over 33 CLEP exams exist for five subject areas , including math , science , composition and literature , business , world languages and history and social studies . If you were staying awake in your high school core classes , you could pass CLEP exams and head off to college with 40 college credits already under your belt . See College Board 's CLEP page for more information . <h> Stick Close to Home <p> In state tuition at a public college or university is generally far less than out of state tuition . It could be your family is fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college costs , but if not , stay in state and close to home to save money . While colleges spend thousands of dollars on fancy marketing to make you think differently , there really is n't that much difference between a bachelor 's degree in biology from Penn State and one from University of Montana . You save on travel money sticking closer to home ground , you can maybe duck home to do a huge pile of laundry and you 'll be in a familiar region , which pays off in your comfort level . Unless you can come up with a truly compelling reason to go out of state , such as you were awarded a full tuition and room and board scholarship at an out of state school , stay in state and save the money . <h> Consider a Co-Op Education <p> Co-op education is a real winner . It 's a joint program between universities and employers . While various schools set up the program differently , they all involve students taking regular classroom courses in their major , say for a semester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semester . The benefits for the student are rich : they gain work experience in the real world , they earn money while working and generally they have a job lined up and ready to go when they graduate . For the employer , it 's an opportunity to recruit and train employees , allows more flexible staffing , results in better retention rates among employees and allows evaluation of future full-time employees while they 're on the job as student-employees . Co-op students earn money while they 're in college , allowing them to help pay for their education , usually $11,000 to $18,000 per working semester . These students need n't rely on student loans as much , freeing them from a significant lifetime drain on their incomes . Best of all , according to the New York Times , 95 percent of co-op students have a job waiting for them when they graduate . <p> About 400 universities and colleges have co-op programs available for a variety of majors . To name just a few , accounting , architecture and graphic design , art and art history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chemistry , finance , hospitality and tourism , management , marketing , psychology and all kinds of engineering , including aerospace , chemical , civil , electrical , mechanical , industrial and systems , mining and ocean engineering . While most firmly established for math , science and engineering , some liberal arts majors may apply , including English and communication students , art history and language students . See our article on Co-op education for further information on this fantastic way to go to college and learn hands-on skills in a real world job . <h> Work during College <p> Aside from the co-op education and federal work-study programs , college kids can simply find a job and work while they 're going to college . Even at a minimum wage job working 20 hours a week , students with jobs can earn enough to help with college costs and personal expenses . Getting a job can also teach time management , a real world skill absolutely essential in a competitive job market . Students also learn to manage money better if they 're earning it themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finding another job after graduation . Employers might be looking at a host of bachelor degree candidates for the job , but they 'll focus on the ones with work experience first . Learning to budget your money , avoiding credit card use and other money earning and saving tricks all add up to curbing the high cost of college . <h> Miscellaneous <p> A variety of ways of earning random cash include selling your blood and plasma , participating in medical and science studies such as working part-time in a sleep lab ( by sleeping , no less ) and selling your eggs or sperm . If you own a car , start a Designated Driver business where you rake in the cash giving students rides home from bars and nightclubs . Search the Internet for other small business ideas . Never give up on scholarship searches , no matter what year you 're in at college . Just keep looking and applying . Rent your textbooks , buy them used or use the reserve copy in the library . Some students are using social media to beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her $200,000 student loan debt . <p> Going to college does n't have to mean going deeply into debt .

Combine all the good ideas you can think of and put them to work . With a modicum of creativity and some hard work , you can get a good college education while avoiding the usual costly college traps . 201806 @qwx1061806 201821 @qwx1061821
