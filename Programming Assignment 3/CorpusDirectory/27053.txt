The number of insect species outnumbers all other animal groups combined and affects humans , plants , animals , and the environment in a multitude of ways , some good , some bad . Many insect species attack our crops and our domestic animals , often vectoring diseases along with the physical damage they cause . Many species are beneficial in providing food ( e.g. honey ) , pollination services , and many are biological control agents for noxious weeds and other insect pests . Areas of study within entomology range from the very basic ( systematics and conservation ecology ) to the very applied ( insect pest management of regional crops ) .

About 3 PM on the afternoon of June 7 , 1893 , the worst fire in the history of Fargo began in downtown and spread from wood building to wood building , destroying city hall , the business district and the homes of most of Fargo 's 6,000 residents . The Fargo Forum in a special edition the day of the fire , reported that the fire began when someone threw ashes from the rear of the Little Gem Restaurant on Front Street and started a fire in the rear of Herzman 's Dry Goods Store at 512 Front Street . Another version of the fire suggested that Lily Herzman was burning cardboard packing cartons behind the store and the flames spread to the building . <p> Whatever the origin , the fire spread from Front Street ( now Main Avenue ) to the north . By the end of the day , downtown Fargo was devastated . Over 160 acres were in ashes and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway from NP Avenue to Fifth Avenue North and west to the prairie . By one count , 140 residences and 219 businesses were destroyed . Most of the buildings before the fire were constructed of wood . <p> The picture above shows downtown after the fire . The ashes are still smoldering . The photographer is facing northeast from the corner of Roberts Street and NP Avenue .

One of Fargo 's three fire companies ( the one located across the street from the origin of the fire ) was out sprinkling streets ( a normal fire department duty ) . The nearest fire alarm box was at the corner of Broadway and Sixth Street ( in front of Moody 's ) and no one could find the key . Both of these events delayed getting water on the fire . The buildings at that time were primarily constructed of wood and the fire spread rapidly with a 30mph wind that day . Fargo 's three fire companies fought the fire valiantly but all of the factors mentioned simply proved too much . <p> The city council met frequently in the coming days to deal with the crisis . They authorized dumping of fire debris in the slough where it crossed Third Avenue south , established a city fire inspector , required stone or concrete sidewalks , prohibited using the fire department for street sprinkling , and similar actions to mitigate further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.

But then , when she turned around behind the lamp and I kept feeling her slippery and oily look in back of me , over my shoulder , I understood that it was I who was looking at her for the first time . I lit a cigarette . I took a drag on the harsh , strong smoke , before spinning in the chair , balancing on one of the rear legs . After that I saw her there , as if she 'd been standing beside the lamp looking at me every night . For a few brief minutes that 's all we did : look at each other . I looked from the chair , balancing on one of the rear legs . She stood , with a long and quiet hand on the lamp , looking at me . I saw her eyelids lighted up as on every night . It was then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her : ' Eyes of a blue dog . ' Without taking her hand off the lamp she said to me : ' That . We 'll never forget that . ' She left the orbit , sighing : ' Eyes of a blue dog . I 've written it everywhere . ' <p> I saw her walk over to the dressing table . I watched her appear in the circular glass of the mirror looking at me now at the end of a back and forth of mathematical light . I watched her keep on looking at me with her great hot-coal eyes : looking at me while she opened the little box covered with pink mother of pearl . I saw her powder her nose . When she finished , she closed the box , stood up again , and walked over to the lamp once more , saying : ' I 'm afraid that someone is dreaming about this room and revealing my secrets . ' And over the flame she held the same long and tremulous hand that she had been warming before sitting down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel the cold . ' And I said to her : ' Sometimes .

' Now I feel it , ' I said . ' And it 's strange because the night is quiet . Maybe the sheet fell off . ' She did n't answer . Again she began to move toward the mirror and I turned again in the chair , keeping my back to her . Without seeing her , I knew what she was doing . I knew that she was sitting in front of the mirror again , seeing my back , which had had time to reach the depths of the mirror and be caught by her look , which had also had just enough time to reach the depths and return--before the hand had time to start the second turn--until her lips were anointed now with crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mirror . I saw , opposite me , the smooth wall , which was like another blind mirror in which I could n't see her-- sitting behind me--but could imagine her where she probably was as if a mirror had been hung in place of the wall . ' I see you , ' I told her . And on the wall I saw what was as if she had raised her eyes and had seen me with my back turned toward her from the chair , in the depths of the mirror , my face turned toward the wall . Then I saw her lower he eyes again and remain with her eyes always on her brassiere , not talking . And I said to her again : ' I see you . ' And she raised her eyes from her brassiere again . ' That 's impossible , ' she said . I asked her why . And she , with her eyes quiet and on her brassiere again : ' Because your face is turned toward the wall . ' Then I spun the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I stayed facing the mirror she was back by the lamp . Now she had her hands open over the flame , like the two wings of a hen , toasting herself , and with her face shaded by her own fingers . ' I think I 'm going to catch cold , ' she said . ' This must be a city of ice . ' She turned her face to profile and her skin , from copper to red , suddenly became sad . ' Do something about it , ' she said . And she began to get undressed , item by item , starting at the top with the brassiere . I told her : ' I 'm going to turn back to the wall . ' She said : ' No . In any case , you 'll see me the way you did when your back was turned . ' And no sooner had she said it than she was almost completely undressed , with the flame licking her long copper skin . ' I 've always wanted to see you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep pits , as if you 'd been beaten . ' And before I realized that my words had become clumsy at the sight of her nakedness she became motionless , warming herself on the globe of the lamp , and she said : ' Sometimes I think I 'm made of metal . ' She was silent for an instant . The position of her hands over the flame varied slightly . I said : ' Sometimes in other dreams , I 've thought you were only a little bronze statue in the corner of some museum . Maybe that 's why you 're cold . ' And she said : ' Sometimes , when I sleep on my heart , I can feel my body growing hollow and my skin is like plate . Then , when the blood beats inside me , it 's as if someone were calling by knocking on my stomach and I can feel my own copper sound in the bed . It 's like- -what do you call it--laminated metal .

Her life had been dedicated to finding me in reality , through that identifying phrase : ' Eyes of a blue dog . ' And she went along the street saying it aloud , as a way of telling the only person who could have understood her : <p> ' I 'm the one who comes into your dreams every night and tells you : ' Eyes of a blue dog . ' ' And she said that she went into restaurants and before ordering said to the waiters : ' Eyes of a blue dog . ' But the waiters bowed reverently , without remembering ever having said that in their dreams . Then she would write on the napkins and scratch on the varnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue dog . ' And on the steamed-up windows of hotels , stations , all public buildings , she would write with her forefinger : ' Eyes of a blue dog . ' She said that once she went into a drugstore and noticed the same smell that she had smelled in her room one night after having dreamed about me . ' He must be near , ' she thought , seeing the clean , new tiles of the drugstore . Then she went over to the clerk and said to him : ' I always dream about a man who says to me : ' Eyes of a blue dog . ' ' And she said the clerk had looked at her eyes and told her : ' As a matter of fact , miss , you do have eyes like that . ' And she said to him : ' I have to find the man who told me those very words in my dreams . ' And the clerk started to laugh and moved to the other end of the counter . She kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opened her purse and on the tiles with her crimson lipstick , she wrote in red letters : ' Eyes of a blue dog . ' The clerk came back from where he had been . He told her : Madam , you have dirtied the tiles . ' He gave her a damp cloth , saying : ' Clean it up . ' And she said , still by the lamp , that she had spent the whole afternoon on all fours , washing the tiles and saying : ' Eyes of a blue dog , ' until people gathered at the door and said she was crazy . <p> Now , when she finished speaking , I remained in the corner , sitting , rocking in the chair . ' Every day I try to remember the phrase with which I am to find you , ' I said . ' Now I do n't think I 'll forget it tomorrow . Still , I 've always said the same thing and when I wake up I 've always forgotten what the words I can find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented them yourself on the first day .

' And she , with clenched fists , beside the lamp , breathed deeply : ' If you could at least remember now what city I 've been writing it in . ' <p> Her tightened teeth gleamed over the flame . ' I 'd like to touch you now , ' I said . She raised the face that had been looking at the light ; she raised her look , burning , roasting , too , just like her , like her hands , and I felt that she saw me , in the corner where I was sitting , rocking in the chair . ' You 'd never told me that , ' she said . ' I tell you now and it 's the truth , ' I said . &gt;From the other side of the lamp she asked for a cigarette . The butt had disappeared between my fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I do n't know why I ca n't remember where I wrote it . ' And I said to her : ' For the same reason that tomorrow I wo n't be able to remember the words . ' And she said sadly : ' No . It 's just that sometimes I think that I 've dreamed that too . ' I stood up and walked toward the lamp . She was a little beyond , and I kept on walking with the cigarettes and matches in my hand , which would not go beyond the lamp . I held the cigarette out to her . She squeezed it between her lips and leaned over to reach the flame before I had time to light the match . ' In some city in the world , on all the walls , those words have to appear in writing : ' Eyes of a blue dog , ' I said . ' If I remembered them tomorrow I could find you . ' She raised her head again and now the lighted coal was between her lips . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered , with the cigarette drooping over her chin and one eye half closed . The she sucked in the smoke with the cigarette between her fingers and exclaimed : ' This is something else now . I 'm warming up . ' And she said it with her voice a little lukewarm and fleeting , as if she had n't really said it , but as if she had written it on a piece of paper and had brought the paper close to the flame while I read : ' I 'm warming , ' and she had continued with the paper between her thumb and forefinger , turning it around as it was being consumed and I had just read ' . . . up , ' before the paper was completely consumed and dropped all wrinkled to the floor , diminished , converted into light ash dust .

I remembered that she had also looked at me in that way in the past , from that remote dream where I made the chair spin on its back legs and remained facing a strange woman with ashen eyes . It was in that dream that I asked her for the first time : ' Who are you ? ' And she said to me : ' I do n't remember . ' I said to her : ' But I think we 've seen each other before .

And she said : ' You 'll ruin everything . ' I said : ' It does n't matter now . All we have to do is turn the pillow in order to meet again . ' And I held my hand out over the lamp . She did n't move . ' You 'll ruin everything , ' she said again before I could touch her .

' And she , a little distant , told me : ' I know that better than you . What 's happening is that there 's a woman outside dreaming about the country . ' She crossed her arms over the flame .

If a mutation occurs in that allele , the function for which it encodes is also lost . The general term for these mutations is loss-of-function mutations . The degree to which the function is lost can vary . If the function is entirely lost , the mutation is called a null mutation . If is also possible that some function may remain , but not at the level of the wild type allele . These are called leaky mutations . <p> Loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of the wild-type allele and the loss-of-function allele , the level of expression of the wild type allele is often sufficient to produce the wild type phenotype . Genetically this would define the loss-of-function mutation as recessive . Alternatively , the wild type allele may not compensate for the loss-of-function allele . In those cases , the phenotype of the heterozygote will be equal to that of the loss-of-function mutant , and the mutant allele will act as a dominant . <p> Although it would be expected that most mutations would lead to a loss of function , it is possible that a new and important function could result from the mutation . In these cases , the mutation creates a new allele that is associated with a new function . Any heterozygote containing the new allele along with the original wild type allele will express the new allele . Genetically this will define the mutation as a dominant . This class of mutations are called gain-of-function mutations.

@@13708009 @2308009/ <h> Preface <p> This web site is dedicated to the propagation techniques of cacti and succulents.This site is complete with a step by step explanation and pictorial guide of the Techniques of Cactus and Succulent Propagation.For those of us who are not fortunate enough to have cacti and succulents among the natural habitat of our local neighborhoods , or are just beginning , sometimes it is difficult to recognize what growth habit represents a family or genera , much less to know what plant represents a scientific name.Luckily , a host of showy cacti and succulents are available in local plant markets and superstores ; however , they are often unclassified.Without knowing the scientific name , or at least the genera of a species , it would be difficult for a beginner to make use of much of the literature available on cacti and succulent propagation.For this reason , I have included a brief Pictorial Reference to Representative Genera and Speciescomplete with specific scientific names and References To Other Photo Galleries , as well as general recommendations for which propagation method to use for what growth habit . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authority on botanical classification , or plant propagation principles ; nor does it attempt to simplify concepts to the point of insult.Rather , this web site attempts to provide enough accurate information to get a novice started on the right track , and to provide a reference and opportunity for peer review among enthusiasts.This is a web-based academic review of applied propagation techniques , completed as a course requirement for an undergraduate horticulture course in plant propagation at North **26;57;TOOLONG web site , its author , and North DakotaStateUniversity , do not take credit for , or claim ownership over , the production of any image used in this academic review.All images and information used in this web site are sited in the Source Reference List . <p> Sometimes it is very easy to identify the best was to propagate a cactus or succulent , and other times it is not as obvious.However before you start , the first thing to ask yourself is : What kind of plant do I have ? If you do n't  know the easiest way to learn is to organize the information you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it tall and thin , short and round , or does it have many little leaves ? How does it grow ? Does it grow all by itself , are there many braches , or are there similar tiny plants that poke up out of the soil near it ? Does it flower ? Questions like these are the first ones to ask your self when considering propagation.The next thing to think about is how to propagate your cactus or succulent.Done in the reverse order , you might not have as high of a plant propagation success rate.The web site does not help you identify exactly what kind of cactus or succulent you have.What it does do is help you generalize your plant into a category with a brief Pictorial Reference to Representative Genera and Speciescomplete with specific scientific names and References To Other Photo Galleries.This web site then shows you recommended Techniques of Cactus and Succulent Propagation for each category.For the quickest reference , see the Index Of Recommended Propagation Techniques For Specific Genera . <p> Most cacti can be propagated by seed ; however due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more practical.Cacti with solitary growth habits are usually propagated by seed.Several species grow in this manner including : <p> Propagation by stem cuttings is easy and practical.Many cacti and succulents can be propagated by stem cuttings.In general , if the plant has an elongated stem region that is actively growing , propagation by stem cuttings should be a successful route.Some recommendations are : <p> Grafting requires a hardy rootstock which is compatible with the desired propagation candidate.This compatibility is very important.Without it , success in grafting in unlikely.For cacti and succulents the following rules and some successful grafts have been reported and are shown below : <p> Many succulents asexually propagate been means of underground lateral shoots.These shoots give rise to offsets or plantlets which can be severed in the spring or summer from the parent lateral shoot to produce a self-sustaining new plant.Aloe spp. and some Agave spp. form plantlets or bulbils on their flowing stalks.These plantlets and bulbils can be removed and planted as well.Kalanchoe spp. produce small plantlets on the scalloped edges of their leaves.These plantlets can also be potted in warm conditions to produce self-sustaining plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vilmoriniana <p> Agave fourcryodes <p> Kalanchoe spp . <p> Aloe spp . <p> Offsets <p> Echinopsis spp . <p> Mammillaria spp . <p> Agave spp . <p> Aloe spp . <p> Haworthia spp . <p> Crassulaceae Family <p> Kalanchoe sp <p> Sedum spp . <p> Graptopetalum spp . <p> Tubers <p> Ceropegia spp . <h> Index of Recommended Propagation Techniques For Specific Genera <p> Plant Genus <p> Seed <p> Stem Cutting <p> Leaf Cutting <p> Grafting <p> Tuber , Bulbil , and Offset Division <p> Agave <p> X <p> X <p> Aloe <p> X <p> X <p> x <p> Bryophyllum <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Cereus <p> X <p> x <p> X <p> Ceropegia <p> X <p> X <p> Chamaecereus <p> X <p> X <p> Echinocactus <p> X <p> X <p> Echinopsis <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Epiphytic cacti <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Eriocactus <p> X <p> X <p> Espotoa <p> X <p> X <p> Euphorbia <p> X <p> X <p> Gasteria <p> X <p> X <p> Graptopetalum <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Gymnocalycium <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X <p> Kalanchoe <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Lobivia <p> X <p> X <p> Mammillaria <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Melanocactus <p> X <p> X <p> Neoporteria <p> X <p> Notocactus <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Opuntia <p> X <p> X <p> Rebutia <p> X <p> X <p> Sansevieria <p> X <p> X <p> Sedum <p> X <p> X <p> X <p> Stapeliads <p> X <p> X <p> Sulcorebutia <p> X <p> X <p> Trichocereus <p> X <p> X <h> Techniques of Cacti and Succulent Propagation <h> Propagation by Seed <p> A proportionally small amount of general granular plant fertilizer . ( e.g.1 tsp. fertilizer to 1 or 2 cups soil mix ) . Any more than this will acidify the soil considerably and burn the roots of your plant . <p> Inorganic top dressing such as sand or small rocks ( e.g. aquarium rock , fine gravel ) <p> Step 1 <p> Step 2 <p> Step 3 <p> Step 4 <p> Step 5 <p> Tiny seedling roots <p> Step 6 <p> Step 7 <p> Always begin with fresh , dry seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with specialty cactus soil , or mix your own.Gently press the soil down to level it off.Inorganic grit , sand , or pumice gives the soil the appropriate drainage and aeration.This type of soil composition is mandatory for cactus and succulent growth . <p> Step 2:Just before you are ready to plant the seeds , soak them in warm water for 30 minutes or so.This loosens up the seed coat , and activates germination.Opuntia species have very tough seed coats and require a few days of soaking in warm water.After you have soaked the seeds , sprinkle them across the top of the level soil.Do not press the seed into the soil unless the seed is exceedingly large . <p> Step 3:Gently sprinkle just enough inorganic top dressing over the top of the soil and the seed to cover completely.Try not to bury the seed in the top dressing.Water carefully and allow the pot to drain completely . <p> A NOTE ABOUT WATERING:The use of distilled or fresh water is imperative , as to help prevent bacterial and algal growth during step four.If your tap water tastes of chlorine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider using distilled water.The chlorine will burn the tender young roots and can cause iron chlorosis , adversely affecting or terminating growth.Careful watering can be done by either by letting the pot stand in half its height of tepid water for a few minutes , or by gently watering from the top , taking care not to wash away the top dressing.In both cases , allow the pot to drain completely . <p> Step 4:Cover and seal the pot with some sort of plastic container which allows light to filter through.This could be a supported plastic bag , sealed around the pot with rubber bands , or a plastic tub as shown in the picture.The idea is to create an environment that will trap heat and moisture-just like a greenhouse.Many things will work , be ingenious and creative ! However , be careful not to leave the seedling pot standing in water.Transfer the pot to an area with bright indirect light of about 70 degrees F if you have chosen a plastic cover which is clear and colorless.If you have chosen a container that is clear but colored , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a location with a little more light and do n't  increase the temperature.If you have chosen a container which is slightly fogged or cloudy , you will want to place it in a cooler location , 65 degrees F , which gets at least 4 and no more than 8 hours of direct sun , with the remainder of the day in bright indirect light.Remember , late morning and afternoon sun is considerably hotter than early morning or early evening sun.In general , think of the plastic container as if it were **25;85;TOOLONG plastic allows the most light to penetrate , clear-colored plastic allows a little less light to pass through , and fogged-colorless plastic allows even less light to infiltrate.In all cases , the inside of the plastic container will heat up.Be careful not to fry your tender young plants ! If the walls of your container lose moisture and become dry during germination , water sparingly , reseal , and return to warm well-lit location.If algal growth sets in , remove the cover and allow the seedling pot to air out a little while wiping the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty parts water solution ( 5% bleach in water ) . Allow the cover to dry.Recover and seal the seedling pot and transfer back to a warm and well-lit location.Continue to clean the plastic container as necessary . <p> Step 5:Although above ground the newly sprouted seedlings appear to be well on their way , below ground they have disproportionably small root systems and can not readily absorb the nutrients they require to flourish into maturity.Therefore the seedlings should be kept in plastic container , at high humidity until they are nearly overgrown.High humidity facilitates water and nutrient absorption in the roots and through the leaves until proper roots systems establish . <p> Step 6:After the seedlings have overgrown , protect your fingers by wearing gloves , or wrapping them with tape , and gently remove each seedling from the original nursing pot.This is much easier if the soil has remained moist . <p> Step 7:Gently repot the seedling into a pot filled level , and to the brim , with cactus potting soil , and top dress with sand , gravel , or pumice.Water three or four days later.Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Propagation of Stem Cuttings <p> Soil Mix : <p> 80-95% Crushed lava rock , sand , charcoal , pumice , or Perlite <p> 5-20% completely decomposed potting soil or garden loam <p> Inorganic top dressing such as sand or small rocks ( e.g. aquarium rock , fine gravel ) <p> Cacti Species Step 1 <p> Succulent Species Step 1 <p> Epiphyte Species Step 1 <p> Step 2 <p> Cacti Species Step 3 <p> Succulent Species Step 3 <p> Epiphyte Species Step 3 <p> Step 4 <p> Stem Cuttings should normally be taken at the end of the dormant period or at the very beginning of active growth in the spring , but can also be done in the summer.Although the techniques for propagation are essentially the same , because the growth habits of cacti and succulents are so different , I have included images representative of three major growth habits . <p> Step 1:Protect your fingers , if necessary , by wearing gloves , or wrapping them with tape.Using a sharp , razor blade or knife sterilized with alcohol , remove a stem cutting off of the parent plant.It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a simple tear gives jagged edges.Both usually do not heal fast enough for the cutting to survive without water during the callusing stage . Avoid taking long stem cuttings.They do n't  root out well.It is best it take shorter cuttings from new , active growing , vigorous shoots.Remove the lower leaves , leaving two to four inches of bare stem exposed.Dip the stem of the cutting in a rooting hormone , and let it sit out in warm air so that it can form a callus.This should take a few days to a week.Columnar cacti should be sustained in an upright position during callus formation , to prevent stem arching toward light sources . <p> Step 2:Fill a small pot to the brim with specialty cactus soil with extra grit added , or mix your own from scratch.Gently press the soil down to level it off.Inorganic grit , sand , or pumice gives the soil the appropriate drainage and aeration.This type of soil composition is mandatory for cactus and succulent growth . <p> Step 3:Again , protect your fingers if necessary , and plant the callused stem cutting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss.Water succulents immediately , and wait a few days before watering cacti.Place the potted cutting in a warm , bright , airy , location and keep moderately moist . <p> A NOTE ABOUT WATERING:The use of distilled or fresh water is imperative , as to help prevent bacterial and algal growth during step four.If your tap water tastes of chlorine , it is too chlorinated for your plants and you should consider using distilled water.The chlorine will burn the tender young roots and can cause iron chlorosis , adversely affecting or terminating growth.Careful watering can be done by either by letting the pot stand in half its height of tepid water for a few minutes , or by gently watering from the top , taking care not to wash away the top dressing.In both cases , allow the pot to drain completely . <p> Step 4:After several weeks , the cutting should have established a good root system and can be transferred into a larger container filled with specialty cacti potting soil , or 3 parts inorganic grit to 1 part fully decomposed garden loam , and top-dress.Water succulents immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly potted plant to a warm , bright , airy , location . <h> Propagation of Leaf Cuttings <p> Inorganic top dressing such as sand or small rocks ( e.g. aquarium rock , fine gravel ) <p> Step 1 <p> Step 2 <p> Step 3 <p> Step 4 <p> Step 5 <p> Step 6 <p> Just like stem cuttings , leaf cuttings should normally be taken at the end of the dormant period or at the very beginning of active growth in the spring.Although the techniques for propagation are essentially the same , because the growth habits of cacti and succulents are so different , I have included images representative of three major growth habits . <p> Step 1:Using a sharp , razor blade or knife sterilized with alcohol , remove a single leaf cutting off of the parent plant.It is important to make a clean cut.Pruning shears crush tissues and a simple tear gives jagged edges.Both usually do not heal fast enough for the cutting to survive without water during the callusing stage.Avoid taking leaves from the base of the plant.They do n't  root out well.It is best it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots.Dip the base of the leaf cutting in a rooting hormone , and let it sit out in warm air so that it can form a callus.This should take a few days to a week.It has been my experience that if a leaf cutting begins to wilt during callus formation , it does n't  root very easily.Allow the leaf to sit just long enough for the cutting wound to heal or scab over . <p> Step 2:Fill a small pot to the brim with specialty cactus soil , or mix your own from scratch.Gently press the soil down to level it off.Inorganic grit , sand , or pumice gives the soil the appropriate drainage and aeration.This type of soil composition is mandatory for healthy cactus and succulent growth . <p> Step 3:Plant the callused leaf cutting in the prepared potting mix and top dress to prevent soil loss.Water your succulent leaf cuttings immediately and allow the pot to drain completely.Place the potted cutting in a warm , airy , location with at least 8 hours of bright indirect light and keep moderately moist.Consider misting the cutting with a squirt bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@13708011 @2308011/ <h> McClintock and the Ac/Ds Transposable Elements of Corn <p> Barbara McClintock was the first scientist to predict that transposable elements , mobile pieces of the genetic material ( DNA ) , were present in eukaryotic genomes . She performed her work on corn and specifically followed seed color phenotypes . Before we discuss her experiments , it is necessary to describe the morphology of the corn seed and the parental source of the genes which control its phenotype . <p> Higher plants are characterized by a double fertilization of the female gametophyte . After gametogenesis , the female gametophyte is located in the ovule and contains eight nuclei . Those which are important for this discussion are the egg cell nuclei which is near the location where the pollen tube enters the ovule and two polar nuclei that are in the center of the ovule . The pollen grain ( male gametophyte ) is found in the anther and contains three nuclei , of which the two sperm nuclei are of importance for fertilization . After the pollen tube enters the female gametophyte , one of the sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2n zygote that will develop into the embryo . The other sperm nuclei unites with the two polar nuclei to form the 3n endosperm tissue . For corn , the outer layer of cells of the endosperm is the aleurone layer . <p> McClintock discovered transposable elements by analyzing genetic stocks of corn that were phenotypically unstable . In particular , she was analyzing genes that control the color of the aleurone layer of the endosperm . Remember that this tissue is triploid ( 3n ) . The genes that she was following were located on the short arm of chromosome 9 of corn and were involved in the development of the color of the seed . The genetic map of this region and the allelic designations follow . <p> Homozygous stocks were created and CC bzbz -- females ( without ds , denoted by the dash ) were mated with CICI BzBz DsDs males . The aleurone layer of the endosperm would thus have the genotype CICC Bzbzbz --Ds . Because of the presence of the inhibitor allele , the aleurone layer was expected to be colorless . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few kernels had dark brown colored sectors on an otherwise colorless background . <p> How could this have occurred ? McClintock concluded that in some manner the CI and Bz alleles were lost because chromosome breakage had occurred at the Ds locus . But why the sectoring ? This breakage apparently did not occur during gamete formation , but had occurred after fertilization and during the development of the seed . This breakage and loss of genes occurred in a single cell , but all cells that developed from mitotic division of that cell did not contain the inhibitor gene , so the color expression was controlled by the recessive bz allele in those cells . <p> Female gametes : <p> LONG ... Cbz <p> Male gametes : <p> LONG ... CIBzDs <p> The following is the expected chromosomal composition of triploid endosperm . Because of the dominant CI allele the endosperm should be colorless without breakage . <p> Breakage at Ds had been established by McClintock prior to performing these experiments . The designation Ds was short for dissociation or a locus were breakage of chromosomes occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she realized that Ds alone could not induce the breakage . A second factor , Ac , short for activator , was also necessary . ( Thus , some genetic stocks contained Ac whereas other stocks did not contain that locus . ) This system is called a two-element system and historically has been called the Ac/Ds system . <p> Additional genetic stocks were analyzed by McClintock , and she determined that in the presence of Ac , Ds could move locations as well as cause breakages . She was able to isolate a corn line where Ds had moved into the normal Bz allele and caused a mutation in that gene . But as was mentioned this only occurred when Ac was present . Furthermore , when this new line was used and Ac was present , the Ds element was shown to move out of the Bz locus and reversion to the original phenotype was detected . This mutated allele was designated bzm1 . But in the absence of Ac , bzm1 was a stable allele . Another unstable Bz allele was found that contained an Ac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allele and bzm1 was its higher rate of transposition and reversion back to the original phenotype . <p> So what conclusions can be drawn from these experiments and observations : <p> Ds requires some factor provided by Ac to move , whereas Ac is independent <p> Because of their relationship , Ac is termed an autonomous element and Ds a non- <p> autonomous element <p> . <p> Because both Ac and Ds can move , they are called transposable genetic elements . <p> Somewhat astonishingly , McClintock was able to draw all of these conclusions by genetic analysis of appropriate corn stocks and her in depth understanding of the cytogenetics of corn . Her primary core of research was performed between 1944 and 1950 and was met with a great deal of skepticism . Today , though transposable elements are recognized as important components of many genomes and may have played important roles in evolution . <p> Once the tools of molecular biology became a part of research in plant genetics , one of the goals was to clone both Ac and Ds . As expected these two transposable elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements are identical , 4563 base pairs ( bp ) in length . Ds elements are Ac elements that have undergone deletions . The factor that stimulates the movement of Ac is a transposase protein encoded by the element . Deletions of Ac that created Ds eliminated all or part of this transposase . This lack of transposase activity accounts for the inability of Ds elements to move in the absence of Ac . The transposase that is encoded by Ac elements can move throughout the cell and excise any Ds or Ac element . Because of this ability , the Ac/Ds transposase is said to be trans-acting . <p> What molecular features are required for an element to move ? First , the transposase must be present . This protein works by recognizing sequences that are in common to both Ac and Ds elements . All the elements contain a short inverted repeat sequence ( 11 bp ) at each end that appear to be essential for transposition of the element . Another common feature that results from insertion is an 8-bp direct repeat that is generated on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are footprints that mark were the element has been . Sometimes after reversion , the expression of the allele is changed because the direct repeats altered the properties of the final protein product . Thus , the presence of the transposable element in the allele changes the phenotype produced by the allele . Transposition of the element out of the allele , can also generate a new allele with new activities . 
@@13708012 @2308012/ <p> Several DNA sequences of note have been detected in eukaryotic genes . The first that was described was an enhancer sequence . Enhancers have the ability to greatly increase the expression of genes in their vicinity . More recently , elements have been identified that decrease transcription of neighboring genes , and these elements have been called silencers . <p> Extensive analysis of enhancers have detected several features . First , these elements are functional over a large distance . For example , an enhancer has been placed 3000 nt from the gene , and it can still increase expression . Second , these elements are orientation independent . This means that the element can been be inverted , and it will still affect gene expression . <p> Another feature of enhancers is that they are often associated with a gene that is abundantly expressed . For example , immunoglobulin genes , genes that encode antibodies , often have associated enhancers . This enhancer is located in the intron of the gene . Remember , this feature is important because Burkitt 's lymphoma results from a translocation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This possibly leads to the over expression of the gene and causes the resulting cancer . <p> Other examples of genes with enhancers are the -hemoglobin gene in humans and storage proteins in soybean . One important feature of these enhancers is their tissue specificity . Storage proteins are only expressed in the seed of the soybean seed . How this specificity is controlled is not understood , but may involve the interaction of these elements with tissue-specific , trans-acting factors . In other words , a factor that only is expressed during the stage of seed development when the seed is producing the storage protein interacts with the enhancer and increases expression .

@@13708016 @2308016/ <p> By adding a third gene , we now have several different types of crossing over products that can be obtained . The following figure shows the different recombinant products that are possible . <p> Now if we were to perform a testcross with F1 , we would expect a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio . As with the two-point analyzes described above , deviation from this expected ratio indicates that linkage is occurring . The best way to become familiar with the analysis of three-point test cross data is to go through an example . We will use the arbitrary example of genes A , B , and C. We first make a cross between individuals that are AABBCC and aabbcc . Next the F1 is testcrossed to an individual that is aabbcc . We will use the following data to determine the gene order and linkage distances . As with the two-point data , we will consider the F1 gamete composition . <p> Genotype <p> Observed <p> Type of Gamete <p> ABC <p> 390 <p> Parental <p> abc <p> 374 <p> Parental <p> AbC <p> 27 <p> Single-crossover between genes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes C and B <p> ABc <p> 5 <p> Double-crossover <p> abC <p> 8 <p> Double-crossover <p> Abc <p> 81 <p> Single-crossover between genes A and C <p> aBC <p> 85 <p> Single-crossover between genes A and C <p> Total <p> 1000 <p> The best way to solve these problems is to develop a systematic approach . First , determine which of the the genotypes are the parental gentoypes . The genotypes found most frequently are the parental genotypes . From the table it is clear that the ABC and abc genotypes were the parental genotypes . <p> Next we need to determine the order of the genes . Once we have determined the parental genotypes , we use that information along with the information obtained from the double-crossover . The double-crossover gametes are always in the lowest frequency . From the table the ABc and abC genotypes are in the lowest frequency . The next important point is that a double-crossover event moves the middle allele from one sister chromatid to the other . This effectively places the non-parental allele of the middle gene onto a chromosome with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see from the table that the C gene must be in the middle because the recessive c allele is now on the same chromosome as the A and B alleles , and the dominant C allele is on the same chromosome as the recessive a and b alleles . <p> Now that we know the gene order is ACB , we can go about determining the linkage distances between A and C , and C and B. The linkage distance is calculated by dividing the total number of recombinant gametes into the total number of gametes . This is the same approach we used with the two-point analyses that we performed earlier . What is different is that we must now also consider the double-crossover events . For these calculations we include those double-crossovers in the calculations of both interval distances . <p> So the distance between genes A and C is 17.9 cM 100* ( ( 81+85+5+8 ) /1000 ) , and the distance between C and B is 7.0 cM 100* ( ( 27+30+5+8 ) /1000 ) . <p> Now let 's try a problem from Drosophila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following table gives the results we will analyze . <p> Genotype <p> Observed <p> Type of Gamete <p> v cv+ ct+ <p> 580 <p> Parental <p> v+ cv ct <p> 592 <p> Parental <p> v cv ct+ <p> 45 <p> Single-crossover between genes ct and cv <p> v+ cv+ ct <p> 40 <p> Single-crossover between genes ct and cv <p> v cv ct <p> 89 <p> Single-crossover between genes v and ct <p> v+ cv+ ct+ <p> 94 <p> Single-crossover between genes v and ct <p> v cv+ ct <p> 3 <p> Double-crossover <p> v+ cv ct+ <p> 5 <p> Double-crossover <p> Total <p> 1448 <p> Step 1 : Determine the parental genotypes . <p> The most abundant genotypes are the partenal types . These genotypes are v cv+ ct+ and v+ cv ct . What is different from our first three-point cross is that one parent did not contain all of the dominant alleles and the other all of the recessive alleles . <p> Step 2 : Determine the gene order <p> To determine the gene order , we need the parental genotypes as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent genotypes are the double-crossover geneotypes . These geneotypes are v cv+ ct and v+ cv ct+ . From this information we can determine the order by asking the question : In the double-crossover genotypes , which parental allele is not associated with the two parental alleles it was associated with in the original parental cross . From the first double crossover , v cv+ ct , the ct allele is associated with the v and cv+ alleles , two alleles it was not associated with in the original cross . Therefore , ct is in the middle , and the gene order is v ctcv . <p> Three-point crosses also allows one to measure interference ( I ) among crossover events within a given region of a chromosome . Specifically , the amount of double crossover gives an indication if interference occurs . The concept is that given specific recombination rates in two adjacent chromosomal intervals , the rate of double-crossovers in this region should be equal to the product of the single crossovers . In the v ctcv example described above , the recombination frequency was 0.132 between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ct andcv was 0.064 . Therefore , we would expect 0.84% 100* ( 0.132 x 0.64 ) double recombinants . With a sample size of 1448 , this would amount to 12 double recombinants . We actually only detected 8 . <p> To measure interference , we first calculate the coefficient of coincidence ( c.o.c. ) which is the ratio of observed to expected double recombinants . Interference is then calculated as 1 - c.o.c . The formula is as follows : <p> For the v ctcvdata , the interference value is 33% 100* ( 8/12 ) . <p> Most often , interference values fall between 0 and 1 . Values less than one indicate that interference is occurring in this region of the chromosome .

@@13708030 @2308030/ <p> The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is the most powerful technique that has been developed recently in the area of recombinant DNA research and is having an impact on many areas of molecular cloning and genetics . With this technique a target sequence of DNA can be amplified a billion fold in several hours . This procedure has been applied to forensic analysis where minute samples of DNA was isolated from blood at a crime scene to determine if an individual was actually at the location of the crime . Most recently DNA from mummies and fossil tissue has been analyzed to determine ancient evolutionary relationships . <p> PCR is a DNA polymerase reaction and as with any polymerase reaction it requires a DNA template and a free 3 ' -OH . The template is provided by the DNA sample to be amplified and the free 3 ' -OH are provided by site-specific oligonucleotide primers . The primers are complementary to each of the ends of the sequence that is to be amplified . The three steps of the reaction are : <p> 1 . Denaturation - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-stranded <p> 2 . Annealing - the two primers bind the appropriate complementary strand ; the temperature for this step varies depending on the of size of the primer and its homology to the target DNA <p> 3 . Primer Extension - DNA polymerase extends the primer by its polymerase activity ; this is done at a temperature optimal for the particular polymerase that is used ; currently the most popular enzyme for this step is Taq polymerase , the DNA polymerase from the thermophilic ( " heat-loving ) bacteria Thermus aquaticus ; the extension is performed at 72oC <p> These steps are repeated from 28-35 times . Since the reaction is essentially exponential and since each cycle is about 5 minutes , a large quantity of DNA can be produced for analysis in as little as several hours . <p> The first description of the PCR reaction used the DNA polymerase I enzyme from E. coli , and the reaction was moved manually between the different temperatures . Because the E. coli enzyme is heat sensitive , its activity was killed during the denaturation step at 95oC . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each cycle . The purification , and ultimately the cloning , of the DNA polymerase from T. aquaticus made the reaction much simpler . This organism lives in hot springs that can be near boiling and since it can complete its life cycle at these temperatures , its DNA polymerase would need to be able to maintain its functions after being exposed to these temperatures . This property makes it highly favorable for the PCR reactions because the denaturation step is performed at 95oC . Thus a new enzyme aliquot is not required for each cycle . More recently , DNA polymerases have been isolated from organisms that reside in the vicinity of the thermal vents that are present in the oceans at the junction of two tectonic plates . These enzymes are even more heat stable and may eventually replace the T. aquaticus enzyme for the PCR reaction . <p> Finally , this procedure has been automated by the development of thermal cyclers .

@@13708041 @2308041/ <p> Genetic has provided some powerful knowledge that is changing humanity 's view of itself and its relation to the rest of the universe . This has brought changes of our current philosophies and religions . For instance , the catholic church has accepted the evolution theory ( 1 ) . Genetic , cytogenetic and molecular studies show that we are related to every living thing on the planet , including plants , fungi and bacterium ( 6 ) <p> An important area in which current genetic knowledge is causing revolution is anthropological science ( 14 ) . DNA of the human specie carries more or less the same set of DNA , but small variations in the DNA contributes to human variations . So , genomic variations of the human specie are being studied , through analysis of DNA from populations , families , and individuals worldwide . Ancient DNA is used for to do studies of evolution . <p> Many genetic diseases may be detected early <p> Medicine is a very important area in which genetics is a powerful tool . Indeed , a large proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are caused by abnormal forms of a single or a group of genes that are passed on from one generation to the next . Some single genes responsible for inherited genetic diseases , such as the ones responsible for familial Alzheimer 's disease , familial breast cancer and cystic fibrosis ( 6 ) are being isolated and characterized at molecular level . More complex human hereditary disorders , those which are caused by the interaction of several genes , also interacting with the environment , such as heart diseases , hypertension , diabetes , various forms of cancer and infections , are also being investigated using a molecular approach ( 13 ) . <p> HGP and HGDP a great international effort <p> Many countries are developing a collaborative effort to obtain the complete human genetic sequence and measure the diversity of the human specie ( 4 , 10 ) . The Human Genome Project ( HGP ) was formally initiated in 1990 and has , as its specific goal , the identification of every human gene and the sequencing of the entire genome . Completion of the HGP within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medicine . The Human Genome Diversity Project ( HGDP ) is an international scientific endeavor that complements the HGP . Its objective is to help us understand the fundamental unity of the humankind , human biological history , population movements and susceptibility or resistance to various human diseases . <p> What is genetic screening ? <p> Realization of these great projects and others like them , requires the collecting , sequencing and comparison of many DNA genomes from different individuals and populations . In other words , it requires a massive and exhaustive genetic screening of individuals and populations . <p> Some institution such as the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ) differentiates genetic testing from genetic screening . The first is defined as " the use of specific assays to determine the genetic status of individual already suspected to be at risk for a particular inherited condition , " whereas genetic screening is using the same probe or assay , but distinguished from genetic testing by analyzing a target population . However , the most of the reports are using testing and screening interchangeably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening as the systematic search of population for persons with latent , early , or asymptomatic disease ( 12 ) . Also , in agreement with the HDP , genetic screening searches for disabling genes that , for instance , may confer resistance to specific diseases ( 10 ) . Another purpose of genetic screening is to determine polymorphism that can be used as a simple genetic characterization of a population . <p> For medical studies , genetic screening is normally done to check for certain genes that potentially produce damaging changes in the individuals . So early detection may help to avoid its consequence . In this sense , genetic probes are useful for both prenatal diagnosis and newborn screening for detect rare metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , a disease which causes mental retardation and can be prevented by following a special diet , sickle cell anemia and Ashkenazic Jews for Tay-Sach disease . Screening is also useful to identify individuals that are carriers of a chromosome abnormality or gene that may cause problems for either the offspring or the person screened . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hemophilia , Huntington'disease , neurofibromatosis and brain cancer have been developed ( 6 , 9 ) . <p> Associations between a gene and a disease can often be established by linkage studies . Using polymorphic markers which can be found in the population with a relatively high frequency , relatives ( e.g. , siblings ) affected by a disease are identified . Then , if during this study , one form of one marker ( or of a close linked marker ) is found significantly more often than expected by chance , this marker is said to be close ( or " linked " ) to the disease-related gene . However , some aberrant genes , such as the one for phenylketonuria ( PKU ) was inferred from the discovery that metabolites of phenylalanine , an amino acid , was increased in people with PKU . Following this discovery , the activity of the enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine was found to be absent or decreased in patients with PKU . Recently , with the advent of recombinant DNA technology the gene catalyzing this conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The application and scope of genetic markers is limited to studying the intrinsic features of genetic diseases , such as heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance , which reduce , respectively , the clinical sensitivity and positive predictive value of a genetic test ( 9 ) . <p> Social dilemmas of genetic screening <p> The use of a genetic marker to predict early genetic disorders can be beneficial to the society , so we may prevent symptom development with early medical assistance . But , for instance , in many cases , if a genetic disease is detected in a fetus , the fetus is aborted . Also , there are cases of people that carry DNA mutations associated with a genetic disease , that are being discriminated by health insurers and employer ( 8 ) . So , the genetic screening is bringing new social , legal and ethical dilemmas . <p> ELSI ( Ethical Legal and Social Issue ) working group ( 5 ) , which is a special committee of HUGO ( Human Genome Organization ) discusses the social consequences of HGP . At its first meeting , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These were fair use of genetic test information in areas such as insurance , employment , criminal justice , education , adoption and in military aspects ; impact of genetic information on individuals ; personal privacy and confidentiality of genetic information ; the impact that the dramatic increase in human genetic information will have on genetic counseling and the delivery of genetic services ; influence of genetic information and new technologies on reproductive decisions ; issues raised by the introduction of new genetic information and technologies into mainstream medical practice ; historical analysis of the use and misuse of genetic information and technologies ; issues raised regarding the commercialization of researching results and conceptual and philosophical topics , related to human genetics . <p> Many leading countries in genetic research , such as USA , England , Japan , France , have extensively debate the ethical , legal and social aspects of genetic screening . Consequently , each country has its own committee that is working to identify and define issues and develop policy options to address them according to its own social-political situation . <p> Unites States citizens want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the United States , the most important public debate is related to possible genetic discrimination and health insurance . It is based on the fact that in the past , genetic information has been used by insurers to discriminate against people . In the early 1970s , some insurance companies denied coverage and charged higher rates to African Americans who carried the gene for sickle anemia . Nowadays , some cases of genetic discrimination against people who are healthy but have a gene that predisposes them or their children to diseases later in life such as Huntington 's disease , have been reported . In a recent survey , 22% of the people with a known genetic condition in the family , indicated that health insurance coverage has been denied to them due to their genetic status ( 8 ) . <p> Hudson et al , in " Genetic Discrimination and Health Insurance : an Urgent Need for Reform " ( 8 ) recommended and defined some actions and concepts to federal policy markers , to protect society from genetic discrimination . This recommendation is that insurance providers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual 's request for genetic services , to deny or limit any coverage or establish eligibility , continuation , enrollment , or contribution requirements . Moreover , providers should be prohibited from establishing differential rates or premium payments based on genetic information or an individual ' request for genetic services and , they should be prohibited from requesting or requiring collection or disclosure of genetic information . Also , insurance providers and the holders of genetic information should be prohibited from releasing genetic information without prior written authorization of the individual . They defined genetic information as information about genes , genes ' products , or inherited characteristics they may derive from the individual or family member and insurance providers were defined as an insurance company , employer , or any other entity providing a plan of health insurance or health benefits including group and individual health plans either fully insured or self-funded . <p> Those who agree that genetic screening positively affects the medical care of individual patients and see a need to ensure the freedom of patients , last year presented a bill to the Committee on Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titled " The genetic confidentiality and nondiscrimination act of 1996 " . It proposes the definition of the circumstances under which genetic information may be created , stored , analyzed , or disclosed , and defines the rights of individual and persons in relation to genetic information ; responsibilities of others in respect to genetic information ; protection of individuals from genetic discrimination ; establishment of uniform rules that protects individual genetic privacy and allows the advancement of genetic research and establishment of effective mechanisms to enforce the rights and responsibilities . <p> Health insurance providers state , said that the impact of genetic information on insurance rates and availability is in some cases exaggerated . And that restrictions as the ones mentioned above , which forbid health insurance companies from using information to deny coverage to potential clients , are not appropriate for the viability and profitability of insurance companies . Moreover , genetic information is often costly to obtain , and the benefits of reducing claim cost may not be commensurate with the cost of obtaining the information on the numerous applicants screened every day by insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that genetic screening may be used to identify good genome ( 3 ) , so , those with it will insist on better rates by the insurers . Unlike negative discrimination , an eventual positive discrimination could have a positive effect on genetic research and preventive medicine by encouraging people to participate in genetic tests . But it would raise exactly the same social and ethical issues because insurers , under competitive pressure , would have to lower rates for individuals with a low genetic risk and consequently increase rates for those with a high genetic risk . So , insurers responding to new market demand , will design new products with limited coverage and lower rates , which will be the preferred choice of customers who know they have a genetically low risk , whereas people who know they have a higher risk will incline towards more extensive coverage with higher rates . <p> In the last months , the US Senate approved , unanimously , a health reform bill that explicitly bars insurers from using genetic information to deny coverage to applicants . The main goal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Kennedy , is to prevent people from losing health insurance when they change or leave jobs ( 7 ) . <p> Humanity must be well prepared for the coming of new genetic knowledge <p> Naturally , each one of the topics exposed above such as genetic discrimination by insurers and employers and all moral , legal and ethical dilemmas that brings genetic screening and new knowledge from genetic , has a distinct importance in each country , according to its culture , political and social organization and its developmental state . So , for example , some countries as Japan and Australasia had reported high acceptance of genetic screening and gene therapy ( 11 ) . Other countries in the Scandinavian region , have a different health insurance system than U.S. , and consequently dilemmas such as genetic discrimination have a distinct sense ( 16 ) . <p> In response to many of these dilemmas , recently the International Bioethics Committee of UNESCO published a draft called " Declaration on the Human Genome and its Protection in relation to Human Dignity and Human Rights . " ( 17 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from new genetical activities . So , it declared that human genome is a fundamental component of the common heritage of humanity and needs to be protected in order to safeguard the integrity of the human specie , as a value in itself , and the dignity and right of each of its members . The human genome , which by its nature evolves and is subject to mutations , contains potentialities that are expressed differently according to the environment , education , living conditions and state of health of each family and each individual . Each human being possesses a specific genetic identity . An individual 's personality can not be reduced to his or her genetic characteristics . Every individual has the right to be respected regardless of this characteristics . So , the document articles define specific rights and responsibilities for everyone who participates in DNA human research to help to ensure human right and freedom and to allowed the DNA human genome studies to be successful . Also , there are articles that attempt to promote and rule the international cooperations . <p> Conclusions <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from new genetic knowledge . Indeed , the humanity 's view of itself and its relation to the rest of universe is changing . Now we know that every living thing , included the man , on the planet are related . <p> Due the benefits enormous that may bring the knowledge genetic of the human genome , many countries are developing a collaborative effort to obtain the complete human genetic sequence and measure the diversity of a human specie . These benefits are being seen principally in the medical area . In fact , there are many diseases , such as Alzheimer'disease , familial breast cancer and cystic fibrosis between other , that can be detect early using genetic probes . A early detection of genetic disease may prevent symptom development with a early medical assistance . Both activities , the application of DNA probes to detect early genetic diseases and researching in human genome require a continuous checking of genomes from different individual or populations . The last we can to define as genetic screening , even although there are different definitions . <p> Together with the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of ethical and social dilemmas . Indeed , the early genetic information from a fetus clearly can influence a decision of abort , this today is broadly discussed from different religions . Also , some people have afraid that genetic screening will be used for discrimination against by health insurers and employers . <p> There many initiatives , the most conduced for scientists , sociological experts and lawyers , specially from those countries that are leading genetic researching , that appoints to identify and prevent the possible problems from genetic screening . Always the goal is ensure the benefits of genetic screening and prevent its possible problems . Some countries , such as U.S. , already had at senate level approved a bill that prevent genetic discrimination against by health insurers . <p> In each country in according its culture , political and social organization and its developmental state , the moral and ethical dilemmas that bring the genetic screening are different . Even although , the International Bioethics Committee of UNESCO published a document that attempt ensure and guide , the human right and freedom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great task of Institutions such as ELSI , the International Bioethics Committee of UNESCO that are guiding the public debate about the ethical , legal and social dilemmas from the genetic screening is very important . Indeed , the genetic screening had brought already benefits notable in medical assistance , but there are also report about misuse of genetic information by health insurers ( 8 ) . Then , we need to ensure good social benefits from genetic testing and prevent its misuse , it only is possible with a serious debate in all countries to identify which are the principal problems and dilemmas generated for genetic screening applications and attempts solved it with adequate laws . <p> Therefore , any person or institution that feels that the future of our humanity will be compromised must also participate in these debates . <p> Certainly , our human society is very complex , then is so difficult to estimate with accuracy which are the possible dilemmas and impact that may bring the massive application of news genetic knowledge in medical proposes or another area . Of course , the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify the great effort that are doing scientist and countries to obtain the complete human genetic , and development DNA probes to detect different kind of genes associated to inheritaded diseases . Other interesting goal is to identify genes of disease resistance from human population so , in the future , eventually may used for gene therapy . <p> However , we shall not forget that the human behavior is complex and not so far that sixty years , the world was involved in a racist war . Indeed , recently some french scientists claimed for prevent possible racist impetus ( 18 ) . Also there is a highly publicized book of Richard Hernstein and Charles Murray 's " The Bell Curve " , which claimed that IQ is largely genetically determined and that the difference in IQ between ethnic groups are substantially explained by genetic factor . However , the ELSI Working Group responded to " The Bell Curve " ( 19 ) , explained which were the methodological and concept errors that these authors did in their genetic analysis , and said that the predictability of trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its expression participate many genes and is highly influenced by environmental factors . Moreover the eugenism was qualified as dangerous . <p> Anyway I quite agree with scientists in affronting any possible problem by misunderstanding of genetic knowledged and possible negative effects of genetic screening to prevent them and ensure the great benefits for the humankind.

@@13708047 @2308047/ <h> Gene Interactions <p> The genes of an individual do not operate isolated from one another , but obviously are functioning in a common cellular environment . Thus , it is expected interactions between genes would occur . Bateson and Punnett performed a classical experiment that demonstrated genetic interactions . They analyzed the three comb types of chicken known to exist at that time : <p> Chicken Varieties <p> Phenotype <p> Wyandotte <p> Rose Comb <p> Brahmas <p> Pea Comb <p> Leghorns <p> Single Comb <p> RosePea <p> SingleWalnut <p> Result : The F1 differed from both parents and two new phenotypes not seen in the parents appeared in the F2 . How can this result be explained ? The first clue is the F2 ratio . We have seen this ratio before when the F1 from a dihybrid cross is selfed ( or intermated ) . This observation suggests that two genes may control the phenotype of the comb . The gene interactions and genotypes were determined by performing the appropriate testcrosses . <p> A series of experiments demonstrated that the genotypes controlling the various comb phenotypes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walnut <p> RP <p> 9/16 <p> Rose <p> Rpp <p> 3/16 <p> Pea <p> rrP <p> 3/16 <p> Single <p> rrpp <p> 1/16 <p> It was later shown that the genotypes of the initial parents were : <p> Rose = RRpp <p> Pea = rrPP <p> Therefore , genotypically the cross was : <p> The development of any individual is obviously the expression of all the genes that are a part of its genetic makeup . Therefore , it is not an unexpected conclusion that more than one gene could be responsible for the expression of a single phenotype . We will now discuss this situation . First let 's give a definition . <p> Epistasis - the interaction between two or more genes to control a single phenotype <p> The interactions of the two genes which control comb type was revealed because we could identify and recognize the 9:3:3:1 . Other genetic interactions were identified because the results of crossing two dihybrids produced a modified Mendelian ratio . All of the results are modifications of the 9:3:3:1 ratio . <p> Example 1 : 15:1 Ratio Phenotypes : Kernel Color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzyme A or B can produce a product from a common precursor . The product gives color to the wheat kernel . Therefore , only one dominant allele at either of the two loci is required to generate the product . <p> Thus , if a pure line wheat plant with a colored kernel ( genotype = AABB ) is crossed to plant with white kernels ( genotype = aabb ) and the resulting F1 plants are selfed , a modification of the dihybrid 9:3:3:1 ratio will be produced . The following table provides a biochemical explanation for the 15:1 ratio . <p> Genotype <p> Kernel Phenotype <p> Enzymatic Activities <p> 9 AB <p> colored kernels <p> functional enzymes from both genes <p> 3 Abb <p> colored kernels <p> functional enzyme from the A gene pair <p> 3 aaB <p> colored kernels <p> functional enzyme from the B gene pair <p> 1 aabb <p> colorless kernels <p> non-functional enzymes produced at both genes <p> If we sum the three different genotypes that will produce a colored kernel we can see that we can achieve a 15:1 ratio . Because either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interaction is called duplicate gene action . <p> Example 2 : 9:7 Ratio Example : Flower color in sweet pea <p> If two genes are involved in a specific pathway and functional products from both are required for expression , then one recessive allelic pair at either allelic pair would result in the mutant phenotype . This is graphically shown in the following diagram . <p> If a pure line pea plant with colored flowers ( genotype = CCPP ) is crossed to pure line , homozygous recessive plant with white flowers , the F1 plant will have colored flowers and a CcPp genotype . The normal ratio from selfing dihybrid is 9:3:3:1 , but epistatic interactions of the C and P genes will give a modified 9:7 ratio . The following table describes the interactions for each genotype and how the ratio occurs . <p> Genotype <p> Flower Color <p> Enzyme Activities/TH&gt; <p> 9 CP <p> Flowers colored ; anthocyanin produced <p> Functional enzymes from both genes <p> 3 Cpp <p> Flowers white ; no anthocyanin produced <p> p enzyme non-functional <p> 3 ccP <p> Flowers white ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Flowers white ; no anthocyanin produced <p> c and p enzymes non-functional <p> Because both genes are required for the correct phenotype , this epistatic interaction is called complementary gene action . <p> Example 3 : 12:3:1 Ratio Phenotype : Fruit Color in Squash <p> With this interaction , color is recessive to no color at one allelic pair . This recessive allele must be expressed before the specific color allele at a second locus is expressed . At the first gene white colored squash is dominant to colored squash , and the gene symbols are W=white and w=colored . At the second gene yellow is dominant to green , and the symbols used are G=yellow , g=green . If the dihybrid is selfed , three phenotypes are produced in a 12:3:1 ratio . The following table explains how this ratio is obtained . <p> Shapes of Squash Fruit <p> Genotype <p> Fruit Color <p> Gene Actions <p> 9 WG <p> White <p> Dominant white allele negates effect of G allele <p> 3 Wgg <p> White <p> Dominant white allele negates effect of G allele <p> 3 wwG <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 wwgg <p> Green <p> Recessive color allele allows green allele expression <p> Because the presence of the dominant W allele masks the effects of either the G or g allele , this type of interaction is called dominant epistasis . <p> Example 4 : 13:3 ratio Phenotype : Malvidin production in Primula <p> Certain genes have the ability to suppress the expression of a gene at a second locus . The production of the chemical malvidin in the plant Primula is an example . Both the synthesis of the chemical ( controlled by the K gene ) and the suppression of synthesis at the K gene ( controlled by the D gene ) are dominant traits . The F1 plant with the genotype KkDd will not produce malvidin because of the presence of the dominant D allele . What will be the distribution of the F2 phenotypes after the F1 was crossed ? <p> Genotype <p> Phenotype and genetic explanation <p> 9 KD <p> no malvidin because dominant D allele is present <p> 3 Kdd <p> malvidin productions because dominant K allele present <p> 3 kkD <p> no malvidin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kkdd <p> no malvidin because recessive k allele present <p> The ratio from the above table is 13 no malvidin production to 3 malvidin production . Because the action of the dominant D allele masks the genes at the K locus , this interaction is termed dominant suppression epistasis . <p> Suppressor - a genetic factor that prevents the expression of alleles at a second locus ; this is an example of epistatic interaction <p> Remember that epistasis is the interaction between different genes . If one allele or allelic pair masks the expression of an allele at the second gene , that allele or allelic pair is epistatic to the second gene . Therefore , the following table summarizes the four epistatic interactions discussed above .

@@13708053 @2308053/ <p> The following pedigree will be used to demonstrate another method developed to determine the distance between genes . This approach has been widely adapted to various system and genetic programs have been developed based on this technique . First let 's look at the pedigree below . <p> Several points should be drawn from this pedigree . Even though we are working with the same two genes , nail-patella and blood type , in this pedigree the dominant allele seems to be coupled with the A blood type allele . Remember in the previous example , the dominant nail-patella allele was linked with the B allele . This is an important point in genetics --- not all linkages between alleles of two genes are found to be constant throughout a species . Why ? ? ? Because at some point in the lineage of this family , the disease ( nail-patella ) allele recombined and became linked to a different blood type allele . In even other lineages , the nail-patella causing allele is linked to the O blood type allele . <p> Next let 's determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , we have one recombinant among the eight progeny . This gives us a recombination frequency of 0.125 and a distance of 12.5 cM . <p> We will now introduce a new method to calculate linkage distances called the Lod Score Method . The method developed by Newton E. Morton is an iterative approach were a series of lod scores are calculated from a number of proposed linkage distance . Here is how the method works . A linkage distance is estimated , and given that estimate , the probablity of a given birth sequence is calculated . That value is then divided by the probability of a given birth sequence assuming that the genes are unlinked . The log of this value is calculated , and that value is the lod score for this linkage distance estimate . The same process is repeated with another linkage distance estimate . A series of these lod scores are obtained using different linkage distances , and the linkage distance giving the highest Lod score is considered the estimate of the linkage distance . The following is the formula for the lod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate the principle . We will first use 0.125 as our estimate of the recombination fraction . In this first birth sequence , we have an individual with a parental genotype.The probablity of this event is ( 1 - 0.125 ) . Because there are two parental types , this value is divided by two to give a value of 0.4375 . In this pedigree we have a total of seven parental types . We also have one recombinant type . The probability of this event is 0.125 which is divided by two because two recombinant types exist . <p> What would the sequence of births be if these genes were unlinked ? When two genes are unlinked the recombination frequency is 0.5 . Therefore , the probability of any given genotype would be 0.25 . <p> Now let 's put the whole method together . The probability of a given birth sequence is the product of each of the independent events.So the probability of the birth sequence based on our estimate of 0.125 as the recombination frequence would be equal to ( 0.4375 ) 7(0.0625)1 = 0.0001917 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ( 0.25 ) 8 = 0.0000153 . Now divide the linkage probability by the non-linkage probability and you get a value of 12.566 . Next take the log of this value , and you obtain a value of 1.099 . This value is the lod score . <p> As was mentioned , this is repeated for a series of recombination frequency estimates . The table below gives the lod score for six different linkage estimates . <p> Recombination Frequency <p> Lod Score <p> 0.050 <p> 0.951 <p> 0.100 <p> 1.088 <p> 0.125 <p> 1.099 <p> 0.150 <p> 1.090 <p> 0.200 <p> 1.031 <p> 0.250 <p> 0.932 <p> As the table shows , the largest lod score corresponds to a linkage estimate of 0.125 . In practice , we would like to see a lod score greater that 3.0 . What this means is that the likelihood of linkage occurring at this distance is 1000 times greater that no linkage . <p> The lod score is a widely used technique not only in human research but in plant and animal linkage analyzes as well .

@@13708056 @2308056/ <h> Deriving genotypic and allelic frequencies <p> One definition of a population is its genotypic frequencies . This gives an indication of the genotypes which are the most or least prevalent in the population . The examples that will be used are for the blood type locus . Two alleles are possible , M or N , that can combine to give the following genotypes MM , MN , NN . The following data was collected from a human population . <p> Genotype <p> # of Individuals <p> Genotypic frequencies <p> MM <p> 1787 <p> MM = 1787/6129 = 29 <p> MN <p> 3039 <p> MN = 3039/6129 = 50% <p> NN <p> 1303 <p> NN = 1303/6129 = 21% <p> Total <p> 6129 <p> The population that we just analyzed has just two alleles at the blood type locus , and each individual will have some combination of these two alleles . Thus , this entire population consists of 12,258 ( 6129 X 2 ) alleles at the blood type locus . To deter mine the allelic frequencies we simply count the number of M or N alleles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allelic frequency for the M allele will be : <p> f(M) = ( 2 x 1787 ) + 3039/12,258 = 0.5395 <p> and the frequency for the N allele will be : <p> f(N) = ( 2 x 1303 ) + 3039/12,258 = 0.4605 <p> By convention one of the alleles is given the designation P and the other q . Thus for the data we presented above , p=0.5395 and q=0.4605 . Because we are analyzing all the alleles , the frequencies shoul d sum to 1.0 and p + q = 1 . Furthermore , a population is considered by population geneticists to be polymorphic if two alleles are segregating and if the frequency of the most frequent allele is less than 0.99 . <p> The following quote from one of the classic books on quantitative genetics defines a population in a genetic perspective . The quote is from Introduction to Quantitative Genetics by D. S. Falconer , 1960 , Ronald Press . <p> " A population in the genetic sense , is not just a group of individuals , but a breeding group ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic constitution of the individuals but also with the transmission of the genes from one gen eration to the next . In the transmission the genotypes of the parents are broken down and a new set of genotypes is constituted in the progeny , from the genes transmitted in the gametes . The genes carried by the population thus have continuity from gene ration to generation , but the genotypes in which they appear do not . The genetic constitution of a population , referring to the genes it carries , is described by the array of gene frequencies , that is by specification of the alleles present at every locu s and the numbers or proportions of the different alleles at each locus . " <p> The following example will illustrate how to calculate allelic frequencies from genotypic frequencies . It will also demonstrate that two different populations from the same species do not have to have the same allelic frequencies . <h> Deriving Allelic Frequencies from Molecular Data <p> Populations can also be scored with respect to loci scored with molecular probes . The above image displays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered to be an allele of the locus . No two individuals are the same i n this group . The individual whose DNA is found in lane 1 is homozygous . All of the others are heterozygous .. Individuals 2 and 8 share one allele , but differ at the other allele . Likewise individuals 3 and 10 share one allele , but are polymorphic at their second alleles . If a large number of individuals are scored with respect to this locus , then allelic frequencies for each allele ( band ) can be determined . <p> Now let 's score the allelic frequecies for a locus recognized by a molecular marker . The human population represented by the above image contains individuals with a either 6.5 kb fragments or a 3.0 kb fragment or both fragments . ( Remember that those in dividuals with a single band actually contain two copies of that band . ) The number of individuals scored with respect to each biochemcal phenotype are given above the band . The allelic frequency of each band can be determined in a similar manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequence of the 6.5 kb fragment in the population . Its value is p = ( 2 ) ( 30 ) + 50/200 = 0.55 . The frequecy of the 3.0kb fragment is then q = ( 2 ) ( 20 ) + 50/200 = 0.45

The next step is to insert the ligated DNA into a bacterial cell for propagation . This is done by a technique called transformation . Bacterial cells are treated with either Ca2Cl or Rb2Cl .

An unwanted ligation product also occurs - religated vector . One way to minimize this event is to treat the vector with phosphatase . This removes the terminal phosphate group from the restriction site of the vector and theoretically prevents religation of the two ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so a low level of religation does occur . Thus after transformation you will have two types of cells : those which contain the original plasmid and those that contain a plasmid containing foreign DNA . <p> Plasmids are designed to distinguish the two types of transformation products . pBR322 , the first widely used vector , utilizes differential antibiotic screening to distinguish the two types of transformation products . Let 's say that we clone into the BamHI site of the vector . The insert DNA will then split the gene responsible for tetracycline resistance . But at the same time , the gene for ampicillin resistance is left intact . Transformed cells are first grown on bacterial plates containing ampicillin . This will kill all the cells that do not contain a plasmid . But we still can not say which cells contain foreign DNA . Those cells that grew on ampicillin are then replica plated on plates with ampicillin and tetracycline . Those cells which grow in the presence of the ampicillin , but die under tetracycline selection contain plasmids which have foreign DNA inserts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double screening procedure was time consuming and could be subject to error . In 1981 , a new series of plasmids were developed that permitted the identification of the foreign DNA containing cells in a single screening step . These are called the pUC plasmids . As with pBR322 , ampicillin resistance is used as one selectable marker . The second marker is based on insertional inactivation of the E. coli lacZ gene . The wild type gene can hydrolyze a specific dye X-Gal ( 5-bromo-4-indoyl-B-D- galactopyranoside ) to a blue color , and the bacterial colony is stained blue . A multiple cloning site has been inserted into this gene . This site will accept fragments ending in a number of different restriction enzymes . Upon insertion of DNA into this site , the activity of the gene is eliminated and the colony appears white in color . Thus transformed colonies containing plasmids with inserts can be distinguished from those with plasmids without inserts based on the color of the colony and the ability of the colony to grow on an ampicillin containing media . <p> cDNA Cloning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of obtaining a DNA copy of the mRNAs that are expressed at a specific stage in the development of the plant .

@@13708065 @2308065/ <p> Physical crossing over during meiosis I is a normal event . The effect of this event is to rearrange heterozygous homologous chromsomes into new combinations . The term used for crossing over is recombination . Recombination can occur between any two genes on a chromosome , the amount of crossing over is a function of how close the genes are to each other on the chromosome . If two genes are far apart , for example at opposite ends of the chromosome , crossover and non-crossover events will occur in equal frequency . Genes that are closer together undergo fewer crossing over events and non-crossover gametes will exceed than the number of crossover gametes . The figure below shows this concept . <p> Finally , for two genes are right next to each other on the chromosome crossing over will be a very rare event . <p> Two types of gametes are possible when following genes on the same chromosomes . If crossing over does not occur , the products are parental gametes . If crossing over occurs , the products are recombinant gametes . The allelic composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross involved genes in coupling or repulsion phase . The figure below depicts the gamete composition for linked genes from coupling and repulsion crosses . <p> It is usually a simple matter to determine which of the gametes are recombinant . These are the gametes that are found in the lowest frequency . This is the direct result of the reduced recombination that occurs between two genes that are located close to each other on the same chromosome . Also by looking at the gametes that are most abundant you will be able to determine if the original cross was a coupling or repulsion phase cross . For a coupling phase cross , the most prevalent gametes will be those with two dominant alleles or those with two recessive alleles . For repulsion phase crosses , gametes containing one dominant and one recessive allele will be most abundant . Understanding this fact will be important when you actually calculate a linkage distance estimate from your data . <p> The important question is how many recombinant chromosomes will be produced . If the genes are far apart on the chromosome a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal number of parental and recombinant chromosomes will be produced . Test cross data will then generate a 1:1:1:1 ratio . But as two genes are closer and closer on the chromosome , fewer cross over events will occur between them and thus fewer recombinant chromosomes will be derived . We then see a deviation from the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio . <p> How can we decide how close two genes are on a chromosome ? Because fewer crossover events are seen between two genes physically close togehter on a chromosome , the lower the percentage of recombinant phenotypes will be seen in the testcross data . By definition , one map unit ( m.u. ) is equal to one percent recombinant phenotypes . In honor of the work performed by Morgan , one m.u . is also called one centimorgan ( cM ) . <p> Now let 's determine the linkage distance between the genes pr and vg . We can actually make two estimates because we have the results from coupling and repulsion phases crosses . The coupling phase analyzed a total of 2839 gametes , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) gametes were recombinant . To determine the linkage distance simply divide the number of recombinant gametes into the total gametes analyzed . So the linkage distance is equal to 10.7 cM ( 305/2839 ) *100 ) . <p> We can also perform the same calculations with the results from the repulsion phase cross . For this experiment , a total of 2335 gametes were analyzed , and 303 ( 151 pr+ vg++ 154 pr vg ) of these were the result of recombination . The estimate of the linkage distance between pr and vgfrom these experiments is 13.0 cM ( 303/2335 ) *100 . <p> Obviously , we can conclude that the two genes are linked on the same chromosome . But what is the true linkage distance , the 10.7 cM value from the coupling experiment or the 13.0 value from the repulsion experiment ? Actually neither is correct or wrong . These again are two estimates . Only by repeating this experiments many times using a number of different independent crosses can we settle on a value . <p> Once we have settled on a value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the true distance between the pr and vg genes is 11.8 cM , that is the average of our two estimates . We can next display them along a chromosome in the manner shown below . ( Note that it is customary to use the allelic designantions of the mutant phenotype when drawing these maps . ) <p> The final point that we need to make regards the maximum distance that we can measure . Because of the way in which the calculations are performed , we can never have more that 50% recombinant gametes . Therefore the maxmimum distance that two genes can be apart and still measure that distance is just less that 50 cM . If two genes are greater than 50 cM apart , then we can not determine if they reside on the same chromosome or are on different chromosomes . In practice though , when experimental error is considered , as distances approach 50 cM it is difficult to determine if two genes are linked on the same chromosome . Therefore , other mapping techniques must be used to determine thelinkage relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with distantly related genes and to order genes is the three-point cross .

Planned major changes and possible changes being considered : <p> A possible summary table that shows which devices have which features <p> Information on how to use devices ( those for which it is possible ) for long-term ( hours ) recordings and to obtain more leads/sequential 12-leads <p> Internal webpage links to different sections and contents ( and possibly making the Contents a side panel that can be accessed any time without scrolling ) <p> Links to other sources of related information <p> ( such as discussion groups , message boards , etc. among persons with afib and other arrhythmias ) ; I added some links , as a primer of sorts , to heart irregularities or arrhythmias such as afib etc. in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handheld ECG devices reported in this website <p> The photos have been sized to illustrate all devices to approximately the same scale ( except open views of the two that flip open , shown with curved arrows , to save space ) . The three devices with green arrows pointing toward the right have undergone considerable development and updating , with the most recent shown to the right in the series . <p> OVERVIEW AND A SHORT PRIMER ON HOW TO NARROW THE CHOICES <p> There are so many handheld ECG devices now available that choosing which one to get can be daunting and not easy ! To begin with , choosing a device depends partly on whether you are ( 1 ) a medical provider ( physician , clinic , etc. ) looking for a device to prescribe or send out with your patients or ( 2 ) a layperson with various understanding ( from little or none to much ) about the subject of ECG . If a layperson it will further depend on how much you already know , want to know and work with on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus , say , having no heart conditions but simply wanting to monitor your heart , like checking your own blood pressure , perhaps in association with daily exercise ) , and to what extent you need or want to consult with a physician ( cardiologist or otherwise ) . Then there are a host of other considerations including cost , whether processing and storage of records are done in the device alone or also on one 's own computer and/or external servers ( the " cloud " ) , whether you want/need only brief samples ( e.g. , 30 second ) or perhaps the option of longer ( minutes or hours ) recordings , to what extent you might want/need analysis of results by someone else ( your own physician or an ECG analysis service with ECG technologists and/or cardiologists , usually for a fee ) , and whether simple finger contacts will suffice for recording ECGs or if you want/need the option of using cable/lead-wires and adhesive skin electrodes . <p> IF you are a medical provider : <p> You will need to carefully consider your needs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend that you go with one system so you do n't have to juggle with variation and different learning curves , different software packages , different billing programs , etc. , which are associated with different systems . Some of the devices reviewed on this webpage provide both event-type recording and Holter functions similar to event and Holter recorders of the past . Virtually all of the devices described here produce useful arrhythmia data ( the primary purpose of 1-lead devices ) but , since most patients and efficiency ( including teaching patients how to use the devices ) will require something simple , keep simplicity in mind ( but in combination with something that will do the job for your needs ) . Perhaps start by considering the devices listed for the majority of laypersons in the next paragraph plus take a look at REKA , which was specifically designed for medical providers ( although it might add a layer of cost aspects that could complicate your present payments system ) . Consider whether you want the option of using **31;181;TOOLONG and Holter-type functions ( all of which reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my comments in the " tester 's choices " section below . <p> IF you are a layperson : <p> For the vast majority of layperson users of handheld ECG devices , in my experience with many friends , contacts , and colleagues , you will want/need the device for a given problem such as afib , be using it while under physician/cardiologist care , and only use/need it for a relatively short period of time ( generally less than a year and often even less than a month ) ... until the problem has been better identified and , hopefully , solved by an operation and/or medications . Your role as a patient doing home monitoring is to to simply obtain the recordings and pass them on to your physician , not to read and understand the results , but be able to properly record and either store or immediately send them to your physician . You may also need to learn , with help from your physician , how to recognize the difference between recordings that are not of concern ( and do n't need to be passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your physician should see . For such users , the system should be simple and efficient for communication with the health care provider . Several of the devices reviewed here fall into that category and I suggest considering AfibAlert ( specifically designed just for afib ) , AliveCor , ECG Check , and HeartCheck Pen . Also consider REKA , which is perhaps the simplest and easiest to use device , but it is ( should be ) obtained by the health care provider not the patient , unless you want to ask your health care provider to look into it for you ( as in , " Ask you doctor if it 's right for you " ) . <p> The devices listed in the paragraph above probably provide the quickest communication with your physician . The next level of devices , which are still simple to operate but require the user to upload the data to their computer and then send the files to the physician , are : ReadMyHeart , InstantCheck , and PC-80 ( original ) . <p> For most laypersons , once their arrhythmias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to live with and monitor the condition on an ongoing basis , they get back to normal living and have no further need , desire , or interest in an ECG device . <p> For persons wanting to get deeper into the subject and more long-term monitoring , with more extensive interests , or doing research on their own , including **33;214;TOOLONG professionals who have their own heart problems and already have a background or are willing to learn the details about ECG , and those who want devices for monitoring excercising , etc. , or researchers , and all of whom might want options such as longer recording sessions and cable/lead-wires with adhesive skin electrodes , consider : PC-80B Color , Dimetek DiCare-m1CC ( color version , not m1CP , the older version ) , InstantCheck , MD100E , or the printing device ECG-80A ( or one of the newer versions ) . Between the PC-80B Color and Dimetek DiCare-m1CC , both do good recordings , have the option of using lead-wires , will record for long periods in Holter mode , and have good color displays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and is unobtrusive when worn as a Holter , plus it has a more accurate internal clock over long periods of time ( weeks to months ) , but it is more subject to movement artifacts and the software does not have as many functions as the PC-80B Color . The InstantCheck is a great , updated , solid , and long-popular system but costs slightly more than the others . The MD100E is good but unless and until the software issues are solved , the software can be a hassle to work with . The printing devices are in their own category , see the details in their expanded description below . <p> Tester 's choices : ( added 9/25/2016 , subject to change pending revisions in the other devices and possible new devices that appear and get tested ) <p> For several years in an attempt to stay neutral , as objective as possible , and not express my personal choices , I mostly avoided stating my opinions and making any recommendations on this website . However , in response to numerous emails that I received asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in view of significant revisions in devices and software that some of the companies have made , which clearly improved them over both their own previous versions and the current versions of competitors , it became necessary ( and yet still objective ) that I state my personal choices . The three on this current list are the ones that I myself use routinely . At the same time , I also need to say that even though the various other devices shown on this webpage are not " tester 's choices " , they are still good , all passed my criteria for getting listed on this webpage , some might be better for some persons for various reasons , and all of the others on this website ( plus perhaps others that I have n't tested ) are also worthy of consideration . <p> The three current tester 's choices are : AliveCor / Kardia , PC-80B Color ( not previous versions and not Prince 180B ) , and Dimetek DiCare-m1CC ( not the m1CP , differing in name by only the last letter ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they all have resulted from significant revisions , developments , and major improvements in either or both the devices themselves and their associated software packages . <p> For specific details and who each one is most appropriate for : <p> AliveCor / Kardia has made numerous , impressive , ongoing , and well-tested revisions plus added several options , functions , and features while , at the same time , remaining low-priced . This system is primarily for the general public and/or persons who want a quick ECG sample of a one-channel recording at any particular time using simple finger contacts . It is simple , fast , direct , accurate , and the smartphone app ( for both android and iOS ) is loaded with options and features . New developments are continuing as we speak . AliveCor has a large , active team with much knowledge and experience , including previous work and experience in the medical field and at least one of the major ECG companies . For more information and to purchase , click here . <p> PC-80B Color is the result of several revisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluetooth wireless at higher cost versions ) . It has excellent and very intuitive , user-friendly software with several functions and options including the ability to see a summary of the entire recording or at various levels down to individual ECG waveforms . It has both simple metal skin contacts for quick recordings and cable/lead-wires for use with adhesive skin electrodes and longer recordings up to 10 hr max ( per recording ... which can be uploaded and saved to a computer and then another recording can be run ) . It can be worn as a Holter , including during exercise and daily activities ( including at night while sleeping ) . It has a lighted display so it can be used and viewed easily in the dark . It has three lead-wires ( positive/+ , negative/- , and neutral/0 ) which gives more stability to the signal but also adds an additional electrode to the skin compared to the next device listed below . The PC-80B Color is the device that I myself use most often and I recommend it highly . It is FDA approved . Caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not as functional ( only does 30 sec recordings , at least in the one I tested ... I 've seen a few advertisements for ones that purportedly do the longer recordings but I do n't know if what they are listing is false advertising or yet sigh ! another version with name confusion ) . To be safe , make sure you get the device that is clearly labeled PC-80B with the color screen display ; see detailed description further below on this website . The PC-80B Color is best used by ( or under the direction of ) medical personnel or persons with ( or willing to learn ) more knowledge of ECG than most laypersons . It is available from several sources , including many listings on eBay , from both Chinese and US marketers , at a remarkably low cost ( depending on who you buy it from ) . To find a source , do a general browser or eBay search for it . <p> Dimetek DiCare-m1CC ( not the m1CP which is the older version ) is the second , greatly improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised software . It has slightly fewer software functions than the PC-80B Color but has the added function of displaying PoincarT plots for persons interested in HRV/RRV and it 's waveform displays are excellent , useful , and easily scrolled through for long recordings . It has both simple metal skin contacts for quick recordings and the option of cable/lead-wires for adhesive skin electrodes and longer recordings . There are only two lead wires ( + and - ) which has the advantage of only two electrodes ( quicker to apply and lower cost etc ) but slight disadvantage of being more vulnerable to artifact -- but still providing adequate recordings even during activity including exercise . It has built-in capacity for much longer recordings and more memory for many recordings than the PC-80B Color . It 's main advantage over the PC-80B Color is smaller size which makes it easier to wear conveniently and unobtrusively such as out and about in public during daily life and is slightly less cumbersome when worn at night during sleep . It has lighted display so can be seen in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ( or under the direction of ) medical personnel or persons with ( or willing to learn ) more knowledge of ECG than most laypersons . The DiCare-m1CC is still in the FDA approval process ( which takes a long time ) and not yet available in the US , although it can be imported from the Chinese distributor . I 'm not yet certain what the cost will eventually be ( I received mine as a test product ) , but it might be higher than for the PC-80B Color . For further information until I can get more added to this website , click here . <p> There are trade-offs between the PC-80B Color and DiCare-m1CC , with each having particular advantages over the other as described above . Because I myself do a lot of ECG work and recording , I have both and use whichever one is best suited for a particular application . <p> Note regarding apps and software : <p> In addition to storing and viewing ECG records on ( some of ) the handheld devices themselves , there are two methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with the ECG recordings : cloud-based ( that is , on an external server somewhere else , beyond the user ) or user-operated software programs , on the user 's own computer . There may also be hard-copy printouts or electronic ( e.g. , in pdf format ) that are portable and may be in the cloud and/or on a user 's own computer or various storage devices . <p> The cloud-based ECG devices , with apps designed for Apple iPhone/iPad/ and Android smart phones , plus uploadable via various computers , netbooks , etc. , are : AfibAlert , AliveCor , ECG Check , HeartCheck Pen . and REKA . ( Of these five devices , incidentally , all use metal skin contacts and do short recordings of less than a minute . Only REKA , pending developments by the other four , also has the options for using cable/lead-wires with adhesive skin electrodes and for recordings longer than one minute at a time . ) <p> All of the others require user-operated software programs ( provided by or available from the companies distributing the devices , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ( to the best of my knowledge ) on Windows-based ( or perhaps related PC , e.g. , Linux ? ) platforms , not Macintosh . ( Various of these others include options of either metal skin contactsor **29;249;TOOLONG contacts and short versus longer , Holter type , recording durations . See descriptions for each device . ) <p> Webpage background and additional disclaimers and cautions <p> Intended audience -- <p> This information is intended for the general public , physicians , medical centers , and other health-care providers such as EMT personnel and nurses , instructors and students ( pre-med , other health-related , general ) , electrical and biomed engineers and designers , and manufacturers and distributors . In addition , this information and the comparisons may be of interest to investors because the industry is expected to grow rapidly ( and be highly competitive ) in the next few years . In short , this webpage has been prepared for anyone who might have an interest in handheld ECG devices . Most , but not all , of these are currently 1-lead/channel , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , some of the others can be used to obtain good ( sequential ) 12-lead recordings , and I anticipate new , handheld , 12-lead ( even simultaneous ) ECG devices coming on the horizon . <p> As indicated in the warning section above , the information in this website is provided for **25;280;TOOLONG purposes only . For medical and health-care providers , see the next paragraph . For untrained persons , the devices are potentially useful for exercise- or sports-associated ( by healthy persons ) , research , educational , and non-emergency monitoring use only , not diagnostic or emergency uses . <p> For health-care professionals , however , the information here may be useful for evaluation and consideration of potential 1-lead/channel products ( similar to familiar cardiac event and Holter recorders ) for monitoring of and by patients including post-surgery , monitoring for arrhythmias such as afib , PVCs , PACs , ventricular tachycardia or bradycardia , and related monitoring and recording . <p> A changing and highly-competitive field -- <p> At least for the foreseeable future , this website is expected to undergo occasional revision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; products and software are being revised ; new products appear ; and pending my available time and with accumulated experience , testing of recorders , exposure to new products and software , and input from other persons , I may add , delete , and revise sections as well as reorganize this site . It is also an expanding webpage and continuing to grow . Until internal links are added , you can simply scroll past sections that you are n't interested in to find sections and information that you might want . Thank you for your patience with the site 's current condition . Check back later for updates , possibly additional ECG recorders , and other revisions . <p> Criteria for inclusion of ECG devices on this webpage -- <p> ALL of the ECG devices described and covered in this review are ones that I consider acceptable for their respective uses . They each fill a slightly different niche , as described with the various devices . It is completely up to the potential users to make informed decisions about which is best for their particular needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several brands and models available . Different persons are interested in different ones for different reasons . <p> The only ECG devices listed here are those that I ? ve had sufficient time to evaluate and which I considered worth listing . There are many more available in the market . There have been a number of new handheld ECG systems and various revisions that I tested but which were n't very good in my opinion or worth updating this website for . Thus , I have not included them here . Others I am still testing , including in some cases working with the designers/manufacturers to improve . There are several others that I simply have not had the time , inclination , or other resources to test . There are more out there , and more appearing every day , than I am able to test and report on , sorry ( both to the companies and the readers ) . <p> My principle is ? If you like what you see , tell others . If not , tell me ? . Thus , I will publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my personal criteria . I also will gladly ( pending my time and availability ) test and help designers and manufacturers improve their products by reporting my detailed test results and problems that I encounter back to them for their in-house , proprietary purposes and revisions ( and I treat those proprietary interactions with each company or distributor on a non-disclosure basis , whether formal or implicit ) . I have done that with several companies and the public results shown here generally reflect their latest , revised versions and models . In my opinion , that is advantageous to everyone : users and public health-care , physicians , and the industry as a whole . ( The principle , incidentally , works both ways . If you like this webpage , tell others . If you find any errors , large or small , have problems with anything here , or want to provide various suggestions or other input , please send your comments and any corrections to me so I can revise the webpage . Thank you . ) <p> Although I provide my tester 's choices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website , I do not endorse any given product . Like ? Consumer Reports ? , I do not want my statements to be used by anyone for advertising purposes . The exception is that anyone , including distributors and manufacturers , may freely link to or reference this website as long as they do not expand on it or use my specific statements as an endorsement ( implied or otherwise ) for their product . I maintain my right to objectivity , academic and professional integrity and freedom , lack of influence and bias from vested interests , and , at the same time , my right to work with any and various companies and distributors . I have tried to emphasize the facts and minimize personal opinions beyond what I consider to be my acceptable criteria and recommendations for particular users/situations . Some of the features of some of the devices are truly impressive , however , and I maintain my right to express personal opinions and choices on those points . <p> Sections About the Author and Disclosure/transparency regarding potential conflicts of interest are included at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECG recording devices <p> ECG/EKG basics ( ECG or EKG -- the two are synonymous , just different spelling ) -- <p> Do a web search for more information about the heart itself and the general subjects of ECG/EKG ( recorded heart signals , electrocardiogram or various European spellings such as the German elektrokardiogramm , derived from the Greek " Kardia " for heart ) , also electrocardiography , electrocardiographs ( the machines that do the recordings ) . There are particularly good resources by doing searches at Wikipedia , American Heart Association , Mayo Clinic , and many other sites that you can get from google or other browser searching . <p> ECGs and their different " leads " are complex and have a fairly steep learning curve . IF you want to go into more depth for understanding ECGs and are looking for primers or places to get started : <p> For a webpage that I wrote for our university students and others to introduce the general subject of ECG ( focused on standard 12-lead systems ) , click here.Other good general webpage introductions to ECG are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online lessons on ECG see ECG Academy , EKG Academy ( different from the first one ) , and/or ( another academy ) Khan Academy ECG videos . <p> Arrhythmias or irregular heart beats ( as opposed to other problems like heart attacks ) are the primary targets of 1-lead devices . Here are some examples of what they look like on single leads : ... click on the names . ( Reminder : consult with your physician and learn what particular conditions you have or might have . Do NOT self-diagnose ! Monitoring after consultation with a physician is different than self-diagnosing . ) ( Note that each example illustrated below includes a built-in caliper blue lines that you can grab and move to measure times . ) Normal ( " normal sinus rhythm " or NSR , from the heart 's normal pacemaker ) as an example to compare the abnormal rhythm ones with.Atrial fibrillation ( afib or AF ) , one of the most common arrhythmias of concern.Atrial flutter ( aflutter ) , as with afib and often of concern.Premature ventricular contraction/complex ( PVC ) very common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concern.Premature atrial contraction/complex ( PAC ) , also common but more difficult to see than PVCs , also usually not of concern.And there are ( many ! ) more , but not as common , arrhythmias . For a more complete list , if interested , click here . <p> And , of course , there is a ton more on the internet and in books ( e.g. , click here ) . <p> ECG **26;307;TOOLONG are no longer just the large , bulky equipment that they once were . Even some of the full 12-lead recorders today are small , portable , and operate through desktop and laptop computers or other devices . <p> Now there are even smaller , self-contained , simple , one lead ( or " channel " ) recorders that are handheld , pocket-sized , battery operated , and have their own built-in displays . These new , low-priced , 1-lead handheld ECG recorders have become available for physicians to prescribe for patients and some over-the-counter ( OTC ) for personal , home , and exercise or sports use , much as with home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below for qualifications and complications ) . <p> Note that this technology and availability of personal ECG recorders are new and just now entering the consciousness of mainstream health care . Many physicians and cardiologists themselves are not yet familiar with these devices ! <p> They are potentially suitable in some emergency situations but only by order of a physician and when used by medical or emergency personnel or for obtaining useful information while waiting for emergency help to arrive . Otherwise , they can be used by the general public ( generally in consultation with and approval by a physician ) for non-emergency personal recording of information , such as for baseline information , routine monitoring , or during uncommon cardiac events . The recordings can then be shown to the person 's cardiologist or electrophysiologist or , for non-emergency or simple monitoring purposes , used by the person himself or herself if he or she is able to interpret them . ( See the subsection above for links to learning more about reading ECGs , if interested . ) <p> ECG machines record the faint electrical signals produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the skin . The ECG machine or device picks up the signals by contact with the skin through interfaces called electrodes ( the name of the contact surface ) . The process is non-invasive , harmless , and risk-free . ECG machines are carefully designed to separate any electricity used to power the machine from the heart signal detection and recording process so the machine is unable to accidentally shock the persons involved , thus , insuring their safety . <p> The resulting records of the heart signals , the wavy lines called ECG waveforms or patterns , are generally familiar to everyone . The pattern is seen on monitors in hospitals and clinics , stylized on the sides of ambulances and in advertising , seen on TV and in movies , etc . <p> The " devil is in the details " -- <p> The actual details of the pattern , however , are very complex and require a trained and experienced human eye , normally of a licensed physician or certified ECG technologist , to interpret , understand and diagnose the recorded ECG , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses of action , including possible referral to further medical specialists . <p> Unlike many other health and physical characteristics , such as blood pressure , simple pulse rate , or blood glucose levels , ECGs do not have just one or a few numbers to work with . Even the heart rate may include irregularities and changes in the rhythm and shape ( morphology ) of the ECG waves . ECGs involve subtle aspects , characteristics that are relatively unique to each individual person ( somewhat like fingerprints ) , complicated combinations of characteristics , and often , on their own , do n't give a complete picture of what the heart is doing . ECGs provide very good measures of the heart ? s condition but an ECG is only one set of measures . Additional tests may be needed for an accurate diagnosis of a person ? s heart . <p> Automated measurements and interpretations of ECG patterns by the ECG machines or computers ( including by the best available ) notoriously make mistakes including both false positives ( identifying conditions that are not actually present ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Examples are shown on this webpage under the MD100E description ( but errors in automated readings are universal , not restricted to just the MD100E ) . <p> ... and things get tricky ! <p> As a result of the difficulties described above , particularly when there may be medical conditions or issues ( and potentially legal issues ) , a real , live physician must be involved at some point . Accordingly , ECG machines are classified as medical devices and , in the US , the government regulating agency , the FDA , requires clearance or approval ( not the same , but I 'm not going into that ) of them before they can be sold in the US . The FDA also requires that the machine and associated materials be properly labeled with appropriate warning and caution statements , and , unless cleared for over the counter ( OTC ) restricts their sale to physicians or on the order of a physician . The regulations have not been strictly enforced at the level of actual sales and purchases , but manufacturers and distributors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new products , and use proper labeling . All of this helps protect the public , physicians , and industry , including the industry from legal liability . At the same time , regulations are having difficulty keeping up with the rapidly changing technology and global marketplace . A number of grey areas , potential risks , and questions are arising such as just what is the role of the physician and related FDA matters ( example , including be sure to scroll down to the subsequent comments section which contains much discussion on numerous issues ) . <p> ... but there is hope ! <p> Although the heart conditions people can have and their associated ECG patterns cover a vast range of possibilities , in any given person , if not normal , there is usually has just one or at most a few conditions present . A physician can teach the person what their ECG pattern(s) look like and what to watch for . Or , once a person 's condition has been properly diagnosed and been ( or is being ) dealt with by a physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional resources such as the internet . Thus , while persons who are not physicians should not try to diagnose their own or others ' ECGs , they can nonetheless learn what to watch for and monitor themselves for changes that are specific to their cardiac health status . This , along with rapid advances in technology and a recent general increase in the public 's interest and participation in management of their own health care , has led to the introduction of low cost , relatively simple and small , handheld , portable ECG devices . There are now many readily available and more on the horizon . This website discusses some of them . <p> Who cares about ECGs , how much , and why ? <p> Just as different ECG machines vary , so do the needs and interests of different persons . Most healthy persons have little interest in ECGs , theirs or anyone else ? s . Most normal heartbeats are the same , beat after beat , for millions of beats . Although they might vary slightly for an individual and from person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen ' em all " . <p> But , with the heart as central and critical to life as it is , if something goes wrong or there is even a hint that something might be wrong , most people begin to take notice and may become interested in what ? s going on ! However , the majority of persons still are n't interested or able to deal with the detailed intricacy of ECG interpretation ; they want their physician to handle all of the details . Thus , they or their physician may want a personal monitor for the patient that the patient can operate but everything is then handled by the physician and they simply communicate ( via modern technology ) with each other . <p> At the other extreme , there are persons who , while still being involved with a physician with their heart conditions via normal , typical health care hospital and clinical routes , also want to monitor their conditions themselves . In addition , there are many persons with normal healthy hearts , including athletes , persons who are active and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instructors , or others interested in cardiovascular topics , and people who travel to remote areas who want to have equipment for educational purposes or monitor their hearts on their own , pretty much independently , like weighing themselves or monitoring their own blood pressure and heart rate . <p> In between the two extremes , there are many people who want to maintain very close association with and supervision by their physicians but who want to do their own recording and then take the results to their doctors . The variety of ECG devices now available covers the whole range ! I have attempted to show where each of the devices that I reviewed fits into the picture . <p> Note : more devices available than just handheld ECG devices ... <p> There are also a number of other ECG-like devices , heart monitors , and pulse oximeters including finger , wrist , and wrist-chest devices , that only show heart rate or pulse rate ( pulse rate is not always the same as heart rate because some irregular heart beats produce electrical signals but do not register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term records , storage , and computer or cloud-based options for viewing and analyzing results . If you know what to look for , they can also identify or help identify such things as irregular heart patterns , such as afib . I have tested several of them ( and associated software and apps , including for heart rate variability HRV/RRV ) extensively but am not including those results here ; perhaps another day . <h> General comments about the devices reviewed <p> Categories or types of devices : prescription versus over the counter , server- or " cloud-based " versus stand-alone <p> Some of the handheld ECG devices and their software or apps are physician- or central-server/analysis- , " cloud " -based ECG systems in which the users interact with their health care providers by using small , portable , ECG recorders designed specifically for working over the internet and/or smart phones , in most cases via various apps . Their data are sent to a physician or central site for analysis , with results reported back to the patient or user . There may be per-use charges for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great choice for both the majority of patients/users and physicians , as alternatives to previous , old-style " event recorders " and even some Holter applications . <p> However , a few users want to view the results on their own computers and under their own control , even if they also pass the results on to their physicians , and who may not like the need to go through the " cloud " . Thus , there are also completely stand-alone , non-cloud choices . <p> Some of the ECG recorders are available for over-the-counter ( OTC ) purchase , and anyone can get one , use it themselves ( including with the associated interpretation services that are also available from some companies when desired or needed ) , and/or communicate the results with their physicians . Although some of the devices are OTC and show basic results of recordings , such as heart rate and a simple statement or icon regarding the outcome , they still require initial contact with a physician , either via a provided interpretation service or the user 's own doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I anticipate that some of these OTC ECG devices will begin appearing in pharmacies and chain stores . <p> The ones ( of all types ) that I have tested are shown below with brief descriptions and links . I plan to eventually provide expanded descriptions , photos , results of my testing , and more details here . In the meantime , most have lots of descriptive information available in their various links . <p> Most of the handheld devices have simple metal contacts that the user can place their thumbs or other fingers on or place against bare skin , such as on the chest . The metal contacts are much more convenient and faster to use than adhesive ( or older , electrode cream style ) skin electrodes . Some of the devices , not all , also can be used with optional adhesive skin electrodes ( usually of the " snap " variety ) and cable/lead-wire connections . Some use three lead wires ( negative , positive , and ground/neutral ) whereas some use just two ( negative , positive ) . ( The negative electrode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body and the positive on the left . They usually are just labeled " L " and " R " . Colors vary among the different devices and their color schemes ) . <p> Examples of the metal skin contacts versus lead wires are shown in the figure below ( from the original three devices reviewed on this website , 2006-2008 ) . All three of these recorders will operate with dry-contact skin contacts , for example , with the subject 's thumbs placed on the metal contacts . <p> Recordings in general ( but not always ! ) are much cleaner , consistent , and more accurate if adhesive electrodes are used rather than the dry skin contacts that are built into the machines . The thumb/skin contacts are definitely more convenient , quicker , and produce good results with practice . But they also usually produce more variability and artifacts than one wants . Here are examples of comparable records with the thumb contacts held in a typical fashion ; thumb contacts held with deliberate care in a gentle , steady , careful , and practiced manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise and artifacts called baseline wander in the typical thumb contact example . ( Original figure from excerpts of RMH results . ) <p> Comparisons of outputs among the various devices and against standard 12-lead outputs ( see " Intro to ECG ... " at the top of this webpage if you need more information on 12-lead ECGs ) <p> I considered attempting to show outputs from the devices in a side-by-side or overlaid manner , next to each other and in comparison with standard 12-lead outputs for similar records . However , there are too many possible comparisons , too many permutations , and it would be unwieldy to make such comparisons here . Thus , I will let you , the reader , decide what you want to compare and then scroll back and forth through the various device descriptions ( and the 12-leads , if you want ) for comparisons . <p> In my description of each device I have included figures of their device-screen displays , computer-screen displays for uploaded records , and views of their hard-copy printouts . <p> Note : Outputs of ECG records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artifacts ) for a few seconds but then typically stabilize . Ignore those initial unstable periods when they show up on the outputs . Most persons recording ECGs and some ECG equipment and devices do n't start recording until after the signal has stabilized . <p> Example of a computer screen view ( top figure ) and printout ( bottom figure ) , for comparison , from a PC-based standard 12-lead system . This recording , incidentally , is from an older ( but still similar to current ) recording from myself ( as the subject also for these handheld devices ) with a normal heart rhythm ( " normal sinus rhythm " or NSR ) . <p> This example is from one of MANY brands and models of PC-based and stand-alone ECG machines . There are many more . They each have their own various ways of displaying the heart pattern waveforms and results ( recording information such as date and subject , automated measurements and interpretations , etc. ) but most of them also use more-or-less standard formats for presenting the different leads , such as 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more rhythm rows at the bottom , or 2 columns x 6 rows , etc ( there are additional standard formats ) . <p> How to use these units in 12-lead and exercise contexts <p> It is possible to obtain additional lead information , in sequential manner , with some of these devices . ( Not all of them work well for additional leads . ) In some cases , one can obtain all 12-leads , which are often very comparable to what would be recorded with standard 12-lead systems . Most of the devices can also be used in exercise or what I refer to as " pseudo-stress test " situations . For further information and suggestions ( along with the appropriate disclaimers ) , click here . <p> Sources for 1-lead handheld ECG recorders : See the listed link(s) at the end of each description or do a browser search for the names of the devices . Many of them are readily available online from the companies themselves , several medical device suppliers , dedicated distributors , sometimes on eBay , and perhaps on other sites such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , also see Favoriteplus.com , the source from which I have gotten some of the units for testing ( see Appendix re disclosures/transparency ) . <p> Many , if not most , current handheld ECG devices and software packages are made in , and often distributed from , China . The English of Chinese ECG device manufacturers and distributors is much better than my Chinese ( which is zero ! ) and I have to give them credit . And some of the manuals and software programs for ECG devices from China have been written by persons in China with good English or originally written or subsequently edited and rewritten by other native English-speaking persons outside of China , so the writing is excellent . In many cases , however , the documents and software were written or translated into English by someone for whom English is a foreign language , or perhaps translated by computer software programs , and things are often lost or mangled in translation , grammatical and spelling errors are common , and phrases or terms ( including medical ) frequently do n't make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other persons who are used to standard English ECG terminology ) . One person referred to the Chinese-accented English writing as " Chinglish " . Most native English readers find it at best distracting , the meanings often difficult to understand , and sometimes just amusing or even wrong . I have n't bothered to point out which devices ' manuals and software programs suffer from these problems , but will issue a general caution that native English language users should not be surprised when such problems are encountered , including difficulties trying to follow installation and operation instructions . ( On the other hand , I find that many of the Chinese software programs install faster and with fewer hassles than American software ! ) You will have to do your best to live with language glitches when encountered , try to appreciate our language differences , and hope that future editions will be corrected by someone with a better command of English . <h> DEVICES TESTED <p> ( in alphabetical order ) <h> AfibAlert <p> Atrial fibrillation , afib , or AF , is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally to frequently . It is one of the conditions that got me deeper into the subject of ECG . <p> The AfibAlert is a handheld ECG device designed specifically for atrial fibrillation . It is not intended for diagnosing afib per se , only a physician can do that . Instead , the AfibAlert is for monitoring the condition on an ongoing basis and identifying any sustained episodes of it . That is , when you have already been diagnosed with afib and know that you are susceptible to it , AfibAlert allows you to check for afib at any time , whether you are just doing routine checks for it or sense that you might be having it when feeling palpitations , a racing heart , or other symptoms such as light-headedness . <p> AfibAlert is very easy to use and works for anyone at any level of knowledge about ECG , whether you know or care nothing about the intricacies of reading ECGs , know a little or a lot about it , or are a cardiologist or other physician who has patients with it or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you merely pick it up , use the built-in thumb contacts or electrode cable/wires ( two wires plus unique wrist bands described further below or adhesive skin electrodes ) , push the start button , wait 45 seconds for the recording to run ( while a little clock icon lights up blue and heart rate is displayed ) , then get instant results : <p> yellow light / repeat icon that it was a poor quality recording and needs to be run again . <p> With the ( patented ) instant feedback feature , you don ? t need to send your ECG anywhere or pay to have your ECG reviewed as the AfibAlert has a built in algorithm that analyzes it for afib with a high degree of accuracy . When tested against 51,000 records , AfibAlert was correct about 95% of the time , which is a very high success rate ( and probably much higher than with many non-cardiologist physicians ! ) . <p> Following one or more recordings , you can use an app on your computer ( Win XP , Win 7 &amp; Win 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your physician . Once uploaded , you or your physician may view your ECG strips via mobile apps for both IOS and Android devices or on your computer at no charge . <p> You can contact your physician when necessary . Your prescribing physician also gets an account and can view your ECG strips as needed . The system is secure and password protected . <p> If you understand ECGs yourself , as a physician or otherwise knowledgeable about the subject , and want more than just the simple lighted icon results , you can view the actual ECG traces in the uploaded records and also print them out via pdf printouts that the system creates . <p> Although the system and its lighted icons are designed for atrial fibrillation , the recordings can also be used for normal rhythms and other arrhythmias as well as running additional leads with the cables/lead-wires and adhesive skin electrodes . It also can be used for looking at the effects of exercise and other aspects that persons who know what they are doing can do . I tested the AfibAlert under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got excellent results . I ? m not including the details for the additional tests on this webpage at this time but may do so if and when I have time in the future ( for AfibAlert as well as for the other devices that are potentially capable of additional uses , that is , those that have the option of using lead wires and adhesive skin electrodes ) . <p> If one does not get good recordings from the thumb contacts ( although this is not likely because the AfibAlert uses silver chloride electrodes in the thumb pad leads that provide excellent conductivity for recording ECGs ) , the AfibAlert system includes a unique set of wrist bands , like metal watch bands , that can be put on the arms and connected to the cable and lead-wires instead of using adhesive skin electrodes . That eliminates the irritation and rash that adhesive electrodes commonly cause to skin and also the need to have a supply of adhesive electrodes on hand . The photos further below show the wrist bands . <p> AfibAlert is an established system ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the other devices , made in the USA . All documentation is written in native English . It also has been FDA Cleared . <p> Depending on your needs and planned uses , the only potential drawbacks of the AfibAlert in its current configuration are lack of a waveform display screen and size . Again , life is full of tradeoffs and what one person desires might be undesirable for another . <p> Not having a waveform display screen simplifies the device , which is highly desirable and less distracting for the most common , general patient user . For persons who want to see the waveforms but don ? t need them in real time , you can see them in the uploaded records . <p> Size of the device is the other tradeoff . The AfibAlert is the largest of the handheld devices and may not be portable enough for some persons to carry at all times . However , it is in the same size range as many of the other devices and still small enough that it does not take up much space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet , nightstand or bedroom dresser , or on a shelf , table , or counter top , carried in a briefcase , backpack , purse , and possibly pants pocket for some , or whatever , or otherwise moved about to different places as needed . <p> The size and shape are good because they facilitate good readings by most people by fitting the hands comfortably and keeping the fingers of the two hands separated . When the fingers of the two hands overlap and touch , as easily happens with many of the other handheld devices , that could potentially " short circuit " the signals and effect the results , although I have never bothered to actually test for such effects . Also by having sufficient spacing between the thumb pads , the AfibAlert can also be pressed directly against your bare skin on your chest for a good reading as well . <p> I myself , and I suspect most users of handheld ECG devices , do not carry the devices at all times on a routine basis . What is usually important is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently , such as for periodic daily checks two or three times a day or for when afib episodes crop up unexpectedly , commonly at night when at home or in bed . <p> For further general information about AfibAlert , I highly recommend their website , http : //www.afibalert.com/ , which is very well written , concise , and informative . <p> My tests and samples of my experiences with the AfibAlert are shown below . <p> I used the AfibAlert on several occasions when I was having afib and it showed all of them as afib . Thus , although it was a small sample size I got no false negatives ( failing to detect afib ) . My afib produces average heart rates over 100 bpm , so I don ? t know what would happen with afib producing heart rates below 100 bpm or even below the lower normal range of 60 bpm ; it should still show up as afib . I deliberately ran my heart rate up over a hundred with exercise , without afib , and got mixed results : some correct results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wasn ? t ) . A lot of artifact also caused some false positives . However , ( 1 ) virtually all ECG machines and devices make some errors , as I ? ve explained elsewhere on this webpage ; ( 2 ) AfibAlert comes with clear and proper warnings to that effect ; ( 3 ) I was testing the system beyond its normal intended use ( and recommendations that patients/users remain still while doing recordings ) ; and ( 4 ) false positives are better than false negatives -- better to be safe than sorry ! <p> I also frequently get premature ventricular contractions/complexes ( PVCs ) . Those are not afib and AfibAlert ignored them . I didn ? t have any cases where runs with PVCs but otherwise normal and in normal resting range were identified as afib . <p> I also tested the device using a commercial , artificial ECG simulator ( Symbio CS1201 ) under a variety of heart conditions including NSR , afib , atrial flutter , VT , and MI . I got mixed results with no false negatives but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the 4 points at the end of the paragraph ) . <p> Printouts of records , rather than showing heart rate ( HR ) , show " Beats Counted " . The heart rates shown on the device display screen during recording seem to be correct , after initially homing in on the average rate . According to the company when I contacted them , the " beats counted " reflects the beats used for analysis once the ECG recording has stabilized and not the total number of beats on printouts . They do this to increase the accuracy for analyzing the ECG . However they acknowledged that this information isn ? t very useful to the user and plan to modify it , likely replacing it with average heart rate in the next software release . <p> Device with lead wires attached . I used a pen to mark the connectors as to which side of body and neg. vs. pos. , for my own convenience . ( The manual gives instructions as to which is which , but I work with a lot of different devices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it ? s easy for me to accidentally get them backwards . Many of the devices come with the connectors already marked , beyond color . ) <p> As above , but connected to the electrode wrist bands . <p> Close-up of device while recording using the thumb contacts . The heart rate is displayed along with the blue-lighted clock icon which indicates that recording is occurring . <p> When recording is completed , the device analyzes the data and , when there is no afib , as in this case , the OK icon lights up green . <p> Recording while using the cable/lead wires , an example of recording during a bout of afib , with HR = 150 bpm . <p> After recording and analysis of a bout of afib , the red phone ( call doctor ) icon lights up . <p> When you click the AfibAlert icon installed on your computer or a smart phone , you get a login page , as shown here . <p> Computer screen view after logging in . For the " Type " , " Green " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = " high probability of afib " . Note I 'd 34086 , which I ? ll use as an example below . <p> Example of the top section of the computer screen view of a record , in this case ( 34086 ) a normal sinus rhythm , not afib , and " Green " . <p> Example above continued , bottom section of computer screen view . In this case , no comments have been entered yet . There is a box for entering and submitting comments . <p> Printout of case 34086 . Printouts are accomplished by a built-in pdf creator in the system . The pdfs can be viewed on-screen , printed out , or archived ( including as an electronic medical record or EMR ) . <p> See the note above regarding the " Beats Counted " at the top right of the page . The full count of beats for the 45 second recording , as counted on the printout , amounts to 68 . For a 45 second record , that = 91 bpm . Using the " big box " ( 5 mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do that ( I won ? t explain it here ) , it is easy to see that the HR is under 100 . <p> Back to the page listing records , and moving through the list a bit , note that these have not been reviewed ( by a physician ) but comments have been added to the records shown here . <p> When the AfibAlert device is connected to the computer , it shows the number of new recordings needing to be uploaded . Uploading is accomplished by pressing the " Synchronize Device " button and getting the pop-up screen shown here . <p> Example of a printout of an afib record , run via the thumb contacts , with comments that I added , showing at top of printout page 2 ( the remainder of the second page is blank , not included here ) . This is a good example of afib , correctly identified by AfibAlert as afib ( red ) , plus three PVCs which AfibAlert ignores . <p> The comments , shown above , are currently called " Public " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except here where I am posting the tests for the whole world to see ) . Rather , they should be considered as " Patient " comments . The company intends to address this issue with the next software release . <p> Another good example of afib , which AfibAlert correctly identified as afib , plus some more of my PVCs . <p> An example of one of my " clean " records , with a normal sinus rhythm , no afib , and no PVCs or other irregularities , and little artifact . It ? s always nice to get this kind of result ! <p> Internal or memory-card storage capacity : 30 records then new ones replace the oldest recordings ; memory can also be erased <p> Ability to add comments to recording files : yes <p> Device menus and ease of use : ( easiest possible , just push button and record ) <p> Software or app menus and ease of use : uploading is easily done through the computer or app ; menus for viewing records are clear/intuitive and very user friendly <p> Printouts : by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Cost : device cost is $349 to $449 depending on which option you choose . A rental program may be available in the near future as well for shorter-term use . <p> Advanced recordings such as sequential 12-lead : yes ( more on this to be posted later , if and when I get around to it ) <p> Other aspects and comments : Device is larger than most other handheld ECG devices , which has both pluses ( for ease of recording ) and minuses ( less portable for carrying on one ? s person ) . The current version of the printout software shows " Beats Counted " ( after stabilizing and for internal analyses ) rather than heart rate , which the company plans to revise with the next software update . The batteries can be inserted in either direction . <p> AliveCor is a smartphone ECG device and accompanying app for iPhones , Adroid , and IOS . It has recently been cleared for OTC purchase . It has 24hr/7day interpretation service available for users in the US . It operates through finger contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms as either a smartphone case in different sizes that fit different phone models or as a small , convenient , handheld wireless device . Even the ones that are actually phone cases operate by wireless , so they also operate when simply near the phone ( any phone of compatible operating system , regardless of size ) and some users may prefer to use them not attached to the phone anyway . <p> Thus , one can carry them separately or have them at hand and still use them with the phone app even if not using them connected to the phone as a phone case . One can use the system themself or communicate with a physician about the results . Or physicians can carry their own units for use on their patients . <p> The system , including the accompanying phone apps and computer web app , has numerous options , menus , and settings that can be easily changed , including settings for recording times that can range from 30 seconds to minutes to continuous . It is very flexible and rich in features including even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heart health . Thus , anyone new to the subject can learn from materials provided directly by AliveCor . <p> It includes an enhanced filter , one of the best I ? ve seen , that produces very nice , smooth , ECG traces . If one wants to view the record without the enhanced filter , however , such as a cardiologist looking for very subtle patterns , you have the option to turn the enhanced filter off . <p> There are various arrangements that can be made to communicate through the system with one ? s physician . And there are also options for getting recordings analyzed through AliveCor ? s in-house cardiologists and ECG technologists 24/7 for modest per-use charges depending on the service chosen . ( Charges beyond the initial purchase price are only for using their in-house analysis service . If not using that service , there are no per-use charges for recording , viewing and printing results , or communicating with one ? s physician . ) <p> Photo of the AliveCor package ( using an iPhone 5 example ) , Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the smartphone case for an iPhone 5 .

If the case were to be attached to the phone as designed , one would be holding the phone in this manner . The finger contacts ( electrodes ) for obtaining the ECG signals are located on the back of the case , not visible in this picture but as seen in the first photo above . <p> Device menus , options , flexibility , and ease of use : user friendly , easy to use as app with numerous features . It has an excellent advanced filter , which can be turned on or off ( for unfiltered trace ) . When on , the filter removes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles , and makes a very smooth ECG tracing .

It can also be used by physicians and other health- related personnel conducting recordings on their patients while with them . It records for periods of time chosen by the user , with the record then available for review or subsequent analysis , printing , saving , and/or sending . <h> Dimetek Micro Ambulatory ECG Recorder , DiCare-m1CC <p> Note ( 9/25/2016 ) -- This is one of my " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay tuned/check back later . The -m1CC ( only name difference is in the last letter ) is a considerably revised and improved device in several aspects compared to the previous -m1CP which is described immediately below ; the -m1CP is still good and usable , but the -m1CC is MUCH better . <p> The DiCare-m1CP is a small , compact ECG device with a unique push/roll navigation button/wheel . It has several functions , including quick recording via finger contacts plus Holter , event , and monitoring modes for longer recordings using lead-wires and adhesive skin electrodes . It is one of the smallest and lightest ECG devices available . It is easily worn with the included pouch and necklace cord for longer , Holter-style recordings , and easily carried in a purse or briefcase/backpack , kept in a desk or bedroom drawer , or easily stored in a small space . <p> It is a stand-alone device with user-managed records on the user ? s own computer ( not on a server or in the cloud elsewhere ) . If the records are to go to a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printouts or send email attachments directly to the physician . <p> This device is very user friendly to operate but requires that the user be guided by his/her physician , be a physician , or otherwise be competent and savvy with ECGs to deal with the records . <p> When worn as a Holter unit ( or event or monitor mode ) in the necklace pouch , its small size and light weight allow it to be used unabtrusively and unnoticeablely under clothing during exercise and daily activities . Activity can introduce movement artifacts to the traces but there are still usually many segments of excellent series of heartbeats , particularly when one is inadvertently or deliberately paused or otherwise not moving vigorously , that can be read as good ECG waveforms . The Holter , event , and monitoring functions of this device are perhaps the most important features , with the ability to do quick recordings with the finger contacts as somewhat of an added bonus . <p> This is one of several products from the company , including at least two portable ECG recorders , available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more information and at least one video available at the websites listed above . There are also several downloadable materials available at : http : **28;335;TOOLONG . <p> The downloadable items include an app for the android smartphone ( see " ECGViewerandroid.rar in the download list ) . I myself have not tested or used that app as I do n't have an android phone , but it is described as providing instant communication , ECG data transfer , reading of ECGs , and early warning . <p> Photo of materials received with purchase : shipping package , User ? s Quick Start Manual , soft cloth pouch and necklace for wearing during long recordings , lead-wire cables , the ECG device , and micro card reader for transferring files to the computer . The micro card that comes with the unit , in addition to storing recordings , also includes the software , a full user manual , and instructional videos . Also included with the original purchase ( but not pictured ) is a supply of adhesive skin electrodes for use with the lead-wire connections . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin recording with a push of the wheel-button which can be seen at the bottom of the device .

Recordings can also be made using the lead-wire cable and adhesive skin electrodes . The unit is easily worn in the soft cloth pouch as a necklace for long , Holter-style recordings . ( As noted in the photo above , screen displays are brighter and better than they appear in these pictures . Because the display surface is so reflective , it has to be photographed under low light or tipped to avoid distracting reflections . ) <p> Two views of a stored ECG record on the device display .

The system saves the recordings under shorter names by time of recording etc . ) <p> Computer screen view of section of a recording . Comments can be added to the record by clicking on the box at the bottom just to right of center , adding up to 30 characters of comments as shown , then clicking the " save " checkmark button to the right of the comments box . There are several options within the software for different views and analysis , and a scroll bar at the bottom for scrolling through long records . <p> Printed example of a recording ( same as in the computer screen view above . <h> Device characteristics <p> Length(s) of recordings : 24 to 48 sec ( settable ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if using the lead-wires for other functions , ? continuous ? , that is , until whenever stopped ( 24 hr default ) <p> Time to auto-shutdown : display turns off after idle for about 15 seconds but the device itself remains on if recording ; if not recording or being used otherwise , the device automatically turns off after 1 minute <p> Internal or memory-card storage capacity : the internal storage can only hold one 24 second quick mode recording , but the included 2GB micro SD memory card holds up to 300 hours of recordings ; thus , since a single recording can go up to 32 hours , the SD card holds up to at least 8 recordings of 32 hours ( or many hundreds to thousands of short-duration recordings ) <p> Ability to add comments to recording files : yes , up to 30 characters per record ( see notes with the figures ) <p> Device menus and ease of use : clear/intuitive and very user friendly ; there are several modes for recording including Quick , Holter , Event , and Monitor ( also see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or app menus and ease of use : clear/intuitive and very user friendly <p> Printouts : can be sent to selected printer ( including pdf if you have separate pdf printer software ) . <p> Cost : varies considerably depending on supplier , whether they are in stock , and if on sale . Average cost is around $300 but I ? ve seen them range all the way from $150 and in the $200 ? s to $359 ! <p> Advanced recordings such as sequential 12-lead : yes ( more on this to be posted later , if and when I get around to it ) <p> Other aspects and comments : The device and software has undergone updates and improvements following problems with such things as printing , computer screen displays on different operating systems , etc. , so that the system now works much better and more reliably . <p> The Monitor mode supports visual and audio indication of heartbeats and real-time alarms when the heart rate is out of the present range ( normally 60-100 beats per minute ) . <p> Finding the software , manuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new user until one understands that it is on the micro memory card , removes the card from the unit when it arrives , and uses the card reader to view things on the computer .

It works great , producing very accurate printed ECG waveforms for all 12 standard leads ( sequentially , not simultaneously ) . <p> This device may also show up under different names and brands ( such as " Rising Med " ) and is available from international sources and some US suppliers ) . It is yellow-colored , rounded at one end , flat at the other , and outputs the results using a built-in , narrow-strip printer . It works good if one wants narrow-strip printed output , such as for insurance examiners or others wanting an ECG device with printing and which is light weight and portable . I think the main source is CONTEC Medical . Note that this is a large company ( see their home page ) which also produces many other ECG devices , including a variety of handheld units as well as various 12-lead and Holter devices . Scroll down in their ECG link to see the yellow printing unit and also browse their many other items ( of which the printing unit is the only handheld one that I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-lead systems , the CONTEC8000 , as well as I tested a borrowed unit of one of their Holter systems from a person who had purchased it and wanted me to test it for him ; both the PC-based and Holter systems work very well and have excellent software ) . <p> I bought the unit that I tested in 2012 , tested it at that time , and subsequently sold it ( it worked great , but I did n't need it for further work at the time and , instead , needed the funds for other equipment and supplies ) . Thus , my results may be somewhat outdated ( but hopefully still useful ) . I recommend looking at the company 's webpages for updates . Since I no longer have the device on hand and because there is now a newer version , this description is in a somewhat different format than my descriptions for other devices , in particular I did not bother to provide the section on characteristics . If interested , you can get those details from the company or perhaps eBay listings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revised version of the device and greatly enhanced software , named ECG90A . I do not have one and have not tested it , but , based on my results with the ECG80A and what I 've read about it , it is worth considering ; see the company 's description of the ECG90A . <p> I tried the ECG80A on both a commercial ECG signal simulator ( Dynatech Nevada model ECG 100 one of several simulators that I use in testing ) and a live subject ( myself ) . I then compared the printed ECG waveforms with those from a standard hospital grade ECG machine from both the simulator and myself . I do comparisons of printouts in general by one or more of four methods : ( 1 ) overlaying them on a light souce such as a light box , overhead projector , or simply by holding them together at a window , ( 2 ) by printing the outputs on transparencies and overlaying those , ( 3 ) by using a computer and PowerPoint , making one of the images with a transparent background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) carefully making a set of measurements with an electronic or manual caliper , preferably from blown-up images to improve resolution . I used the light box in this case . The 80As printouts were completely accurate , that is , exactly the same as well as could be matched by eye as a regular ECG machine 's printouts of the same subject and leads , from both the simulator and myself as subjects . <p> The leadwire color codes and symbols are IEC rather than the AHA that we 're used to here in the US and Canada , which can be a bit confusing to Americans , but the ECG cable includes a great little built-in chart comparing the two so it is easy to refer to and get them correct . ( See photo below of the chart that 's printed on the ECG patient module . ) <p> The battery seems very good . I did several runs using just the battery and it did n't run low . <p> Inside the AC adapter it says " 220 v " and the manual indicates it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns . However , the manual that comes with it also indicates 110-220 v and the style of the AC plug is for standard ( 120 v ) current here in the US . So , hoping that I would n't cause any damage to the unit , I took my chances and plugged it into 120 v to see what happened . It worked just fine , both for running ECGs , printing , and recharging the battery , so no worry regarding that . <p> The ( original version 's , which I tested -- later versions have been changed ) printing paper was a weird size , 56 or 57 mm wide ( the foil wrappers say 57 mm but I measured the width of the roll several times , using different rulers , and always got 56 mm ) . The grid on the paper roll is 50 mm and the manual says it uses 50 mm rolls . The grid printing on the rolls is on the outside of the roll . All of the small rolls of ECG paper that I have previous experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some machines such as Marquette MAC PC ) . Both 50 and 60 mm rolls are readily available from online suppliers . 60 mm is definitely too large for the printer ( I measured the space ) . 50 mm would probably work okay ( I did n't try it ) . What I recommend , if one is going to be doing a lot of ECG printing and you end up with an early version of this device ( measure it to be sure ) , would be to get the paper from the original company , an ECG paper supplier that has the ( actual ) 56 mm size , or else make sure you get a later version made for standard 50 mm paper . <p> The Auto printout , including a preliminary section with printed blanks to fill in the name etc. plus each of the 12 leads in sequence requires 42 inches ( just over a yard or meter ) length of paper and takes 1 minute and 20 seconds to print ( I timed it ) . The ECG80A ( at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation ( at least not in the device itself ; it might in the companion software ) ; you have to do measurements and interpretation yourself ( which is safest and preferred method , by at least some of us anyway ... a lot of what I have been researching with ECG machines recently involves analysing machine measurements and interpretations ; they are much more variable when done with large numbers of repeated runs on the same machine and subject and less reliable , including the measurements , than most people would realize or expect ! ... the printed ECG waveforms , on the other hand , seem to be consistently accurate and reliable , across repeated runs and most machines , so a human doing the measurements and interpretations can be quite consistent pending the difficulty of the interpretation and the reader 's competence ) . My understanding from the company 's webpage is that the newer ECG90A DOES have measurement and interpretation capability ( although I do n't know if it is built into the device itself or via the computer software ) . <p> The Manual printout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stop it ( by pressing the print button again while it 's printing ) or until the paper runs out . Thus , the manual print is an easy way to do a rhythm print , such as standard for lead II . <p> It 's very easy to switch back and forth between Auto and Manual , so that is no hassle . <p> A note regarding how much time to record ECGs : if you need 6 seconds or more of printout , it is easy to do on the manual setting ... but it will use a lot of paper ! The auto setting for the 3-second segments , plus a manual recording for more on one lead , such as lead II for a standard rhythm strip , would seem to be sufficient unless there is an arrhythmia going on or if individual heart beats vary noticeably for some other reason and you need another sample . Anyway , just a thought about the paper use . <p> The version of the user manual that I received was written in " Chinglish " . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammatical errors and/or idiosyncrasies . It 's also not as complete as I would like . But it worked okay and the learning curve for using the machine is not too bad . <p> When I tried running the machine on myself , the first couple times it would n't run but said " error code with different numbers " . I figured it was the adhesive electrodes I was using . So I changed the electrodes on myself and then it worked with no problem . Thus , it 's important to have proper skin contacts ( as with most machines ) . The unit comes with limb clamps and chest suction cups , but I prefer the adhesive skin electrodes . The unit also came with lead-wire clips for either tab or snap ( I tried both ) adhesive electrodes . The clips work fine , so you do n't have to mess with the limb clamps and chest suction cups ( plus electrode paste and all the clean-up , etc ) . <p> The unit I tested did not store any records internally , but just printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There appears to be a connection for uploading to a computer or external monitor , but my unit did not include a cable to go with it , no software CD , and I did n't further pursue that aspect . From current descriptions from the company , there appears to be software . I have another ECG machine from CONTEC ( ECG8000 ) and it works great , with excellent software . So I 'm guessing that the software which accompanies these handheld printing devices also is good . <p> I was able to cut up a printed record and put it on an 8 1/2 x 11 inch piece of paper . I just did it easily and simply with scissors and tape . <p> Note re . the photos : The unit still has the protective thin film of transparent plastic on the monitor/display screen , as can be seen in the photos ( and the views are through that thin film covering the screen ) . <p> What I got in the package that I purchased ( contents may vary with purchase , particularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo , upper layer of packaging -- battery charger/power adapter , the ECG device/recorder , and several rolls of paper ( one of which I loaded into the paper holding section of the unit ) ; bottom photo , lower layer of packaging -- cable/lead wires/patient module , power cord , and electrode clips and clamps ( I prefer the clips to use with single-use adhesive skin electrodes ) . <p> The recorder while real-time monitoring ( with roll of paper in top section , edge of paper visible at bottom of paper holder clear-plastic cover ) . <p> View showing both the screen monitor and printing out as the recording is made . <p> Section of printout from a recording . <p> Closeup of printout . ( It looks like the width of the printout strip varies . However , that is just artifact from the photo and unrolled but still somewhat curved paper . The actual width is the same throughout the strip . ) <p> Start of a section of printout , showing space to write I 'd etc. and a closeup of lead I. ( Three second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous when in manual mode . ) <p> Cut-and-taped , assembled strips on an 8 1/2 x 11 page . The apparent variation of strip widths is simply from my cutting out the sections by hand with scissors , not with a paper cutter . Also , depending partly on the scale you use , the red grid lines might not look very good . On the actual printout , such as can be seen in the views above , however , the grid is standard ( 1 mm little boxes , 5 mm big boxes ) , normal , and high quality . <p> The ECG Check device is a low-cost phone case and accompanying app that works with iPhones 4s and newer . ECG Check is simple-to-use and provides straightforward ECG information . Despite its low cost , it provides highly accurate 1-lead ECG recordings . <p> The ECG Check system is available in several modes : OTC , prescription , and physician . ECG Check ? s OTC mode is designed with general-public users who are not interested in looking at their ECG traces , but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for themselves and/or which they can send simply and directly from their iPhones to their physicians . <p> Users wanting to upgrade to the prescription mode can obtain the prescription from their physician then easily submit an image of their prescription when prompted by the app , using the camera on their iPhone . Physicians wanting to upgrade to physician mode can submit their NPI code through the app . <p> Users with their ECG Check systems upgraded to full functionality , beyond OTC mode , are still very easy to use . Patients record ECGs and can send the records to their physicians the same way in both OTC and prescription modes . However , in prescription mode , the patient ? s can also view the full recordings including the waveforms on the iPhone ( including during recording ) and in the results ( in pdf format ) sent to themselves . The recordings can be downloaded from email , viewed , printed , and filed as electronic medical records ( EMR ) . <p> ECG Check is designed to fit on iPhones . But because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works whether used as an actual iPhone case or when just held within range of the iPhone , not attached ( regardless of whether the 4s/5 case is the same as the iPhone version ) . It is also possible to use ECG Check with iPad 3 or newer . <p> ECG Check reports show beat-to-beat heart rates for each pair of neighboring beats . They can be viewed in the saved records on the iPhone , on a sent pdf file opened on a computer screen , or printed . I found that to be a really nice feature , which is especially useful for evaluating beat irregularities , or arrhythmias , such as afib , PVCs , PACs , etc . <p> Photo of materials received with purchase : plastic packaging , Quick Start Guide , and iPhone case/device ( plus a downloadable app ) . The case is shown from the back , where the shiny metal finger-contact electrodes can be seen . <p> Photo of app startup , ready to begin recording . <p> Recording while holding the device near the phone , not directly attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recordings on the iPhone . <p> View of a stored ECG record on the iPhone .

The beat-to-beat measures of heart rate between neighboring pairs of beats can be seen in this view . <p> Printout from a sent pdf record . <h> Device characteristics <p> Physical : ( Dimensions vary by iPhone model ; weight approx. 1.2 oz ) <p> Display screen : ( iPhone or iPad screen . ) <p> Length(s) of recordings : can be set to different lengths , 30 sec , 40 sec , 1 minute , or 2 minutes <p> Ability to add comments to recording files : only gender and age ; comments can only be added by changing the name of the saved record ? s pdf file name to include key aspects <p> Device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very user friendly <p> Software or app menus and ease of use : ( see above ) <p> Printouts : automatically made into pdf files by the system , which can then be sent by email from the phone app , viewed on the computer , printed , and saved separately for file or emailing to physician or others <p> Other aspects and comments : This is a low-cost , simple , quick and easy , no-frills 1-lead ECG device . It is excellent for anyone wanting that . The automatic beat-to-beat heart rate measurement is a very nice feature . <p> The HeartCheck PEN ECG device is the first FDA cleared and Health OTC handheld ECG recording device . It also has 24 hr 7 day a week full ECG interpretation service by a physician . The name of the cloud-based service is GEMS Home . The HeartCheck PEN manufacturer , CardioComm Solutions , offers the first ECG interpretation free ; subsequent ones cost a modest amount . In addition to the full interpretive service of an in-house physician , they also offer a lower-cost triage service with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OTC and a prescription is not required , anyone can get it , use it themselves ( including with the interpretation service when desired or needed ) , and/or communicate the results with their physicians . Contact with one ? s own physician is not required but always recommended unless one is certain that there are no heart-health concerns or if one is otherwise already connected with a cardiologist and simply wants a handheld device for your own use . <p> The device operates through finger contacts , is small , compact , and easily carried in a pocket , purse , briefcase , or kept readily at hand . It includes a clip on the back for a shirt pocket . <p> Other aspects and comments : One of the smallest devices , for convenience and portability ; useful for quick recordings for own review/monitoring or to send to physician . The display screen is very small , but easily read and the small screen is a consequence of a small device . <h> InstantCheck <p> Additional link and comments as of 7/22/2015 : I have not tested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard directly from another person , whom I thank , who just got one ( July 2015 ) direct from the company and contacted me . <p> CAUTION : InstantCheck now has a continuous mode , suggesting a Holter-type function . However , it is only the measurement and display that run continuously ( up to two hours ) , it does NOT truly record continuously . If a recording is made while in the continuous mode , it only records and stores the last 30 seconds . Thus , buyer/user beware ! <p> Other recent changes : Good : Another added feature is that it now includes a wireless function that will broadcast real-time ECG monitoring to a computer display . ( The default for wireless is " off " to save battery power . ) Good : The latest user manual is greatly improved over previous editions , with only minimal " Chinglish " . Not so good ( particularly in the face of fierce competition from other recent devices that have more and better features at much lower cost ) : the price from many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the first three handheld devices that I tested and reported . It is still available , still the same quality , and still very popular among users . Earlier problems , such as occasional failure of the cable between the main unit and the display screen in the lid , have been corrected ( and the company may offer to replace or repair older units that fail even after the standard warranty period ) . I believe the device has been updated since my original review and I know that the software has gone through several revisions ( see added link immediately above ) . <p> InstantCheck is a more complete and more expensive , slightly smaller but slightly heavier cousin of ReadMyHeart ( see below ) , manufactured by the same company ( DailyCare Biomedical Inc . ) The recorder has several more options than RMH , a complete menu , and displays the actual ECG tracings during recording and review of records . It also has computer software that is further developed and refined ( while still being very user friendly ) compared to RMH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monitor during recording and subsequent review of records permits a reading of the ECG by a cardiologist or anyone who can read ECGs , as well as confirming that a good record is being obtained during the time of recording . IC is good for anyone who is more serious about ECG recording and/or who wants good records . The main tradeoff is that it also costs more than most of the other handheld devices . <p> Display of a recorded ECG . <p> View of computer screen , software , and an uploaded record , with added comments . <p> Example of a printout . <h> Device characteristics : <p> ( Note : these characteristics are based on my much earlier ( 2006-2008 ) personal testing plus a few updates based on what I have heard from other persons with newer versions , see " Other aspects and comments " below . ) <p> Display screen : real-time monitor plus heart rate during recording ; then , after recording it shows record number , date and time , HR , ST , QRS , and a simple interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorder includes a red light that displays on the panel during recording , which makes it useful for knowing when a recording is finished at night in the dark without room lights . UPDATE : Latest version also includes wireless broadcast of real-time monitoring to a computer for display . ( The wireless function has to be turned on by the user . By default it is turned off to save battery . ) <p> Length(s) of recordings : 30 seconds following a brief initialization time . UPDATE : Latest version includes " continuous mode " but that does NOT include continuous recording . When in continuous mode it means " measurement and display " , only the last 30 seconds are recorded . <p> Time to auto-shutdown : 1 minute from last time one of the buttons is pressed ( and after a recording ends , if no further action taken ) <p> Device menus , options , flexibility , and ease of use : starts up with message and ability to either go to the menus or start recording as desired ; easy to use and thorough menus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual records -- with stopping and restarting as desired ; records are retained in the recorder after upload/transfer to computer and may be deleted ( all at a time ) from or kept in the recorder as desired ; audible beep at startup and shutoff so one knows when it comes on and goes off <p> Software or app menus and ease of use : excellent software , including printout of one , full , 30 second record per page , with standard grid and measurements <p> Printouts : can be printed from the uploaded records using the software ; standard grid and measurements <p> Cost : latest , wireless version from under $500 up to $800 , depending on source <p> Advanced recordings such as sequential 12-lead : yes , using the lead wires <p> Other aspects and comments : Compact for easy carrying and storage ; quick start and convenient , with option to go either to the menus or start recording ; display of actual ECG monitoring during recording ( and subsequent review of records ) ; numerous options available through the user-friendly menus ; easy transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I myself have used the device many times over a several-year period and we have used it in university lab courses with students ; the only long-term problem that I encountered in the ( original ) units I used is that batteries go dead when left in it unused after several days or a few weeks , thus , it needs to be stored with the batteries out or have the batteries replaced after storage ( along with resetting the date and time ) . However , I heard from another user who did not have that problem . His unit , apparently a revised version , went for several months between the need to change batteries , so the problem may have been fixed . ( I would appreciate hearing from others who get or already have the InstantCheck as to whether or not they encounter short battery lives . If it is no longer a problem , I 'll drop these comments . ) <p> Note : I tested some of the other , earlier versions of this device but did not like them and did not include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version , however , has gone through several revisions , is much improved , and there are many aspects ( but still not all , particularly with the accompanying software ) that I really like about it . It can produce ( with good electrode placement ) some of the best ECG tracings that I 've seen , including during strenuous activity . <p> Most things involve trade-offs . However , this ECG machine is an example of an item with somewhat extreme trade-offs . The device itself is great and it produces some excellent ECG records and printouts . But the software , at least the English version that I got ( 3.7.3 ) , is full of quirks and , at least initially , very difficult to work with ! <p> First the good points : the recording device is excellent , attractive and easy to use , a good size for portability ( and possible to wear for long , continuous recordings as a Holter device simply by sticking it in a shirt pocket ) , has great settings with many options , the display screen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bright light which many of the handheld ECG device display screens do n't do very well , has both finger contacts and lead-wire cable options , audible heart beeps if you want to turn that feature on , the automatic shut-down can be set for any length of time , large internal memory capacity ( plus microSD card ) for storing large numers or many hours of recordings , has built-in and on-computer-screen ( real-time ) monitoring capabilities , and can be run for long periods ( hours ) like a Holter monitor while one is going about daily living , exercising , or overnight while sleeping ( the time when many cardiac irregularities have a tendancy to occur ) . The printouts are great ( although the automated interpretations are n't always correct , as will be illustrated below ... but such errors happen with virtually all ECG machines , including the best and most expensive hospital-grade systems ) . When the device is running , interpretations ( such as " PVC " or " trigeminy " pop up at the bottom of the display screen in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current ( subject to revision ) problems with the software ... <p> ( Note : The software version I used was 3.7.3 . From searching the internet , I believe there is now a version 6.7 which might or might not have corrected some of these problems or might have only revised the software to work on 64 bit computers and the latest versions of Microsoft Windows . But I have not been successful when trying to download the latest version the download page has problems that I have not been able to solve nor have I been able to contact the company directly . If anyone reading this can provide better information , including perhaps someone from the Choicemmed company or a distributor or someone who owns the latest version of the device and software , I would greatly appreciate hearing from you . ) <p> If you read the software manual that comes on the CD , play around with the menus and options extensively , have patience with such things and hang in there , eventually you get it figured out . Then , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or make notes to yourself for future reference , you 'll be okay and it 's not so bad . Otherwise , the next time you go to use it , you 'll have to figure it out all over again ! Hopefully , it will be ( or perhaps already has been ) revised to take care of these problems . The main software difficulties that I encountered are ( 1 ) confusing menu wording and figuring out how to do what you want it to do ( including getting the records to upload from the device , working with the records in different ways and next point ) , ( 2 ) getting the record you want printed , ( 3 ) not being able to add comments to the records ( so you have to keep separate paper records to keep everything straight and associated information together , or simply write it manually on the printouts ) , and ( 4 ) dealing with long recordings , which the system breaks down into a large number of short records rather than keeping everything together in one long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange things that one has to deal with . For example , when records are exported from the computer files , such as to make backup copies , it ( sometimes but not always ? ) also deletes the files from the computer ! When that happens , you then have " backup " but no " original " files ! The only way to have both is to first make the backup , then re-import the backups back into the computer ! It does , incidentally and however , leave the data on the device itself ( and/or microSD card ) unless you deliberately erase them from there . <p> To upload records that are on the SD card , you have to remove the card from the recorder , insert it into a USB SD card reader , and connect it to the computer . You ca n't upload records from the SD card , only from the internal memory , by connecting the recorder to the computer with the USB cable . <p> While mentioning the microSD cards , I should also caution that the MD100E device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the original style of microSD up to 2gb size , not the newer , larger capacity kinds of microSD ( microSDHC or microSDXC ) , even though the newer versions are the same physical size and shape . I discovered it the hard way , by buying a couple of microSDHC cards then having them cause problems in the MD100E ( it locked up until I pulled the batteries out to stop it ) . So , if you want to buy additional microSD cards , be careful ( and you 'll also find it difficult to find them in stores -- I found them on eBay , where they are plentiful but you still have to be careful to get the correct ones that are not HC ; I also found them at a local Barnes&amp;Noble book store where they are used in the B&amp;N Nook reader . ) <p> I 'll discuss some of the software problems further as we come to them in the photos below . <p> The basic package that comes with a purchase : ECG recorder , instruction manual , software , optional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recorder to a computer for uploading records . <p> Views of the ECG recorder 's left and right ends , respectively , showing the metal finger electrode contacts . <p> Using the recorder with the metal finger contacts . The blue bar graph below the traces shows the time progress of the recording ( in this case , 13 seconds into a 30 second recording ) . The left edge can also be held in the palm of the hand , on the left ankle ( to obtain a lead II ) or at various positions of the chest to obtain chest leads ( V1-6 ) . <p> The recorder can also be used with a cable and lead-wire connection ( shown here connected at the top of the device ) . The display screen in this image shows the startup menu . The displays also indicate date , time , number of internally-saved recordings , battery status , and indication of present function being shown . Note : To turn the recorder on or off , you have to press and hold the power button ( at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image ) for several seconds ( just pressing it briefly is not sufficient ) . <p> Example of a list of saved records in the recorder , which can be opened and reviewed . <p> Example of a record with a PVC ( premature ventricular contraction/complex ) .

To me , the wordings are not intuitive and , in fact , confusing . I 'm wondering if maybe they were n't translated from Chinese to English by a computer ? ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real-time monitor , when the recorder is connected to the computer . " ContinueDataReplay " is for the records that were saved ( by the computer when monitoring or on the SD card when monitoring with " ContinueDataDisplay " ) . " EasyDataReplay " is for uploading , saving , and reviewing recordings saved internally in the recorder or by importing ( including long , Holter type , records ) from the SD card . " ArchiveManager is for entering or editing patient information . " CommonSense " is for information on trouble-shooting a few problems and some basic background information on the subject of ECGs . Each of these entry menus , once opened , then have further menus . <p> If the recorder is connected to the computer by the USB cable , when " EasyDataReplay " is opened , you get this screen . To upload records , press the " Read Data " button at the bottom of the page . <p> Data uploading from the recorder . After uploading , if the " Add in Archives " button is pressed , the records are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> A list of uploaded , saved records . This series includes part of the list of short segments from a longer , Holter-style recording which included a bicycle ride . <p> I 'm going to use number " 211 " as an example . The segment was recorded prior to starting the bike ride . I put " 211 " in quotes because it is only 211 in the current list . If more records are added , the record numbers can change ! Note that 211 has a PVC ( 5th full beat in from left ) which serves as a convenient marker . ( The automated interpretation , " Analyse Result " , missed the PVC . ) The heart rate of " 80 " is correct ( or nearly so , actual is 82 ) . At the bottom of the page " Add " means " import " . This page does not have a button for printing . To print our example , 211 , one has to go to the " Data Replay " page ( next image below ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing ( lower right corner ) . However , it does not list the record numbers ! ! ! ! ! Arg ! ! ! To know what record you are on is a bit of a challenge and requires some added work ! I have the page including ( and showing ) record 211 ( see the PVC marker ) . So how does one figure out how to select a particular record ? ? ? Well notice that this page shows 15 records per page and shows what " DataReplay " page you are on ( 15 out of 28 , currently ) . Okay , so you need to know what record you want ( from the numbers listed on the " RecordManagment " page ) , then do some calculations by dividing the record number by 15 , to determine which page it is on and where on the page , in this case , 211/15 = 14.07 , or 14 pages plus 1/15th . Thus , go to the next page , 1st record , after page 14 , that is , the first record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( next image after this one , below ) . <p> Here is the printed record , an excellent printout , after jumping through the hoops to get it printed . ( The " Analyse Result " is incorrect , as indicated above . ) <p> Here is the " Record Magement " page showing later records from the bike ride , highlighting a record after a rigorous segment of bike riding ( uphill into the wind ) when my heart rate reached a peak ( around 150 , the listed HR is correct ) . Where would this record be found on the " Data Replay " page ? You can do the math , if so inclined . ( I did it , to get at the printout shown further below , but I 'm not going to show all the steps again . ) <p> I want to point out that , despite the hassles of working with the software , the waveforms themselves are excellent ! This segment of recording is nearly clean of muscle artifact despite a very heavy workout . Most recorders , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would probably have a lot of artifact at this point . Part of the solution ( including the MD100E doing its part ) involved electrode placement . Rather than using the recommended ( by the manual ) positions , I put the " RA " on my right clavicle , " LA " on a rib under the arm ( at a normal position for V6 ) , and the " LL " on my lowest rib on the right side . ( I do extensive work with ECGs , including 12-lead systems and Holters , and experiment a lot with different electrode placements on different persons , pending individual wave axes and other considerations . ) <p> One thing nice about the " Data Replay " page is that it shows several records at the same time , which is handy for comparison . This set of 15 , for example , is from right after I stopped bicycling , am resting ( while standing over the bike , then getting off the bike ) and the heart rate is beginning to recover from the workout . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left ) is of a record where the HR is at 140 . See the next image , below , for the end of this set of 15 records . <p> The 15th of this set of recording-segment records , see the green box at the bottom right . The position of the green box ( and displayed segment ) is moved by simply clicking the mouse to different positions on the page . HR has dropped to 102 at this point . <p> Next three printouts are a series from the bike ride , ending up with a resting record from several minutes after the ride was completed ( but HR was still slightly elevated , from what is called EPOC , or excess postexercise oxygen consumption what used to be called , incorrectly , accumulated lactic acid " oxygen debt " ) . I pointed out ( added arrow and white box information ) that the " Analyse Result " information was not correct ; also see next set of images and discussion after these printouts . There are a few extraneous wiggles , not true heart waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T waves ) , thus , some slight artifact appears here and there , but it is not excessive . Some artifact is expected in most ECG recordings ; you learn to note but not count it . <p> Computer screen view while the real-time monitor was running . The arrows and information in white boxes were added by me . This is a frozen snapshot from a dynamic monitor with a moving ECG trace . It moves across the screen from left to right , as with most real-time ECG monitors , then returns to the left and starts over with the continuing tracing . The active , moving point is shown in these examples as the break in the ECG line just past the end of the white arrow . This example had correct automated measurement of heart rate ( HR ) and interpretation . For comparison ( examples of incorrect measurements and/or interpretations ) , see the subsequent illustrations . <h> Although the following examples involve the MD100E , virtually ALL ECG machines/devices with automated measurements and interpretations are potentially vulnerable to these problems . ( Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually less serious and more likely to be caught and corrected than with automated results . ) As most people who routinely work with ECGs know ( or should know ) , NEVER TRUST OR RELY ON AN AUTOMATED INTERPRETATION . My comparative research with standard , hospital-grade 12-lead machines , not yet published , has demonstrated that the same principle applies also to automated measurements -- they can be highly variable ( even with repeated identical inputs ) and not always reliable . Computer/machine algorithms have more difficulties with measuring and interpreting ECG waveforms than do human eyes and brains that are trained and experienced . It is better to trust your cardiologist ( or a professional ECG reading service using live persons ) rather than your machine . <p> Okay , here are some examples I encountered while using the MD100E . <p> To begin with , see the image above . It ( and many , if not most ) of the results I got with the MD100E were correct , including those that usually identified the presence of PCVs ( and called them either " PVC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following illustrate problems with automated measurements and/or interpretations . <p> The following example came from the same series of runs as the one above which was measured and interpreted correctly . This one counted T waves ( plus a few P waves ? ) as separate beats and , as a result , essentially doubled the measured heart rate from what it actually was . I was watching the monitor on my computer ( with the heart icon beating and accompanying audio beeping ) and noticed the double counting as it was happening . Because of the high , incorrect automated measurement , the automated interpretation ( as " tachy " , or tachycardia ) was also wrong . ( The arrows and information in white boxes were added by me . ) <p> In this example , the heart rate was correct , but the automated interpretation missed the presence of a PVC . ( The arrows and information in white boxes were added by me . ) <p> Here is an extreme example of automated mistakes for both measurement and interpretation . The machine 's internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the atrial fibrillation and PVCs ! The correct heart rate is 114 , not 76 . The actual HR was determined manually by simply counting the beats ( starting after the first , incomplete one at the upper left edge , which marks the beginning ) for the 30 second record and multiplying by two , for the heart rate per minute . ( The arrows and information in white boxes were added by me . ) <p> Not all of the records I obtained with the MD100E had **34;398;TOOLONG mistakes . But the examples above and others did , which must caution anyone about trusting or relying on ANY automated results by ANY ECG machine or device . The actual ECG waveform tracings themselves ( by MD100E as well as virtually all brands and models of machines/devices ) , on the other hand , have all been consistent and reliable ( aside from artifact problems , usually from skeletal muscle or other sources including external electrical interference ) . Thus , the tracings themselves ( aside from artifact ) can be trusted . The problems happen when software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best left to a live , trained and experienced human , namely your cardiologist or a professional ECG reading service . <p> One of the first three handheld devices that I tested and reported . It is still available and , from what I understand , still liked by many persons , particularly elderly and those new to such devices who want low cost and only the most basic of systems . <p> The PC-80 may be about to be discontinued and replaced by its newer sibling , PC-80B Color , which is considerably different , has many added features , more flexibility , and , has corrected some of the drawbacks of the original PC-80 . For details on the PC-80B Color , see next device described further below . <p> The PC-80 is small , lightweight , robust , and handy . It is for someone on the go wanting a unit that takes up little space and for fast recordings . It would take up little room in a briefcase or luggage or even fit easily in a purse . <p> In its original version ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining basic arrhythmias rather than full ECG analysis . The software and printouts provide the least useful ECGs for resting ECGs but seems to allow arrhythmias to show through background noise slightly better , that is , it seems less vulnerable to ECG artifacts than some of the other devices . It accentuates or focuses on the R wave , with diminuation of the other waves , including T. It represents an early stage of software developent . Aside from software issues , it is a great stand-alone ECG recorder that records and stores ECGs for later review by oneself or a cardiologist . As with many of today 's devices , one can take or send the printouts to their physician or take in the device itself to show the results on the recorder 's display screen .. <p> PC-80 starts fast , goes right into recording , and has a fast ( 30 second ) auto shutoff if no further action is taken . It has menus with several options and a rocker panel to select among various choices . Because it starts recording at powerup , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for it to go through the routine before accessing the menus . The advantage is that it gets right to recording for someone that wants to record as quickly as possible . The downside is that going into recording first can get in the way of going to the other functions . <p> View of display screen . <p> Computer screen view of software and an uploaded record . The software uses it 's own , basically nonstandard grid and does not provide measurements of ECG waves , just HR and a simple interpretation of whether the ECG is " normal " or not . <p> Example of a printout , very basic , without measurements beyond HR and without the option of including user comments ( also with its own , nonstandard grid , although still at the standard 25mm/sec speed ) . <p> But the PC-80 does have a summary feature for printing out summary ECGs for all records , which is very nice . <h> Device characteristics : <p> Display screen : active real-time monitor while recording ; after recording it displays record number , date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) face , and a simple interpretation of the recording after it 's completed ; at the press of button for screen lighting , the recorder can be used and viewed at night ( when many arrhythmias commonly occur ) without needing to have room lights on <p> Length(s) of recordings : 30 seconds <p> Time to auto-shutdown : after 30 seconds from last time one of the buttons is pressed ( or analyzing and storing a recording , if no further action taken ) -- which is not much time and one has to be quick or else restart the device for using functions beyond recording <p> Additional cable-wires for adhesive skin electrode recording : 3-wire <p> Internal or memory-card storage capacity : 24 records , after which new ones replace the first ones ; records are retained in the recorder after upload/transfer to computer and may be deleted ( one at a time ) from or kept in the recorder as desired <p> Ability to add comments to recording files : no <p> Device menus , options , flexibility , and ease of use : starts up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including scrolling down through the records and review of individual records -- with stopping and restarting as desired <p> Software or app menus and ease of use : The original software has easy transfer/upload of data from the recorder and moderately user friendly menus , but at the same time is also somewhat awkward , does not use the standard grid pattern ( although it is still 25mm/sec ) , and does not allow entering user notes and comments to supplement the records . The software also seems to accentuate the R wave at the expense of other waves , such as the T wave , which makes standard reading of the output difficult ( or impossible in some cases ) . <p> Printouts : can be printed from the uploaded records using the software <p> Cost : less than USD $200 ( varies by source ) <p> Advanced recordings such as sequential 12-lead : yes , via lead wires , but low quality and not really useful for normal 12-lead analyses ( see PC-80B for useful , high quality advanced recordings ) <p> Other aspects and comments : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawbacks as discussed above ( and other drawbacks that I have not bothered to list ) ; these have been more than corrected in subsequent versions of both the device and software , as described for the next device , PC-80B Color , below . The original PC-80 is still useful primarily for persons ( including some elderly ) wanting something quick and easy for heart rate and a rough look at possible arrhythmias . Because the newer PC-80 versions , particularly the PC-80B Color , are so improved in many ways , the original PC-80 is likely to be discontinued in the near future . If you want one , you might need to get it before current stocks are gone . ( Note : there may also be other brands and models , not listed on this website , which are roughly similar to the PC-80 in their simplicity , low cost , and representing early stages of handheld ECG device and software development . ) <h> PC-80B Color ( Cardio B Palm Europe and UK ) <p> ( note added 7/30/2016 : The Cardio B Palm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connector and available primarily in Europe and the UK , from various companies and in different languages , including user manual available online in different languages . For more information and the manual do a browser search for cardio b palm . ) <p> Note ( 9/25/2016 ) -- This is one of my " Tester 's Choice " devices . <p> UPDATES : last updated 1/23/2016 ( note added 7/30/2016 : The PC-80B Color device seems to be most recently marketed mainly under the company name of " Heal Force " , e.g. , click here , although note that the name situation has become even more muddled ! ! ! ... with several different names and versions -- I will try to figure it out and describe the latest naming explanations later , stay tuned . ) <p> This is the latest version of the PC-80 , one of three different handheld ECG devices that I originally reviewed in 2006 . At the time , I commented : " It would be nice if one could somehow combine the best of all three different handheld devices into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its size , lighted display , and rocker panel for selecting among menus , but with longer time before auto-shutoff and all of the better features and superior software of the IC . " This latest version essentially accomplishes just that , plus having a large , well-lighted ( so it works good in the dark ) color display , options for different lengths of recording including continuous ( and can even be used like a Holter monitor ! ) , new and added features in the software , plus options for USB cable , Bluetooth wireless , or ZigBee for uploading records to the computer . <p> The PC-80 and its software have gone through many revisions , updates , and improvements , to the point that it is one of the state-of-the-art handheld ECG devices ( IF you get the latest version and software see note at end of the section and know enough about ECGs to be able to use it ) . <p> The latest software is very functional and user friendly/intuitive ( once you figure out the correct version to use ! , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many features , including an easy built-in caliper for measuring parts of waveforms . The device has both finger contacts and lead-wire cables . <p> The PC-80B Color and its software is stand-alone , user-managed , up to the user to communicate with the physician ( or be a physician ) , and the user needs to be somewhat ECG savvy . <p> Photo of device startup menu , ready to begin recording with a push of the button . <p> Recording using the finger/hand contacts ( recordings can also be made using the lead-wire cable and adhesive skin electrodes ) . Screen displays , incidentally , are brighter and better than they appear in these pictures . The display surfaces are reflective and had to be tipped for photos to avoid distracting reflections . <p> View of a stored ECG record on the device display ( including a scale at the bottom indicating the segment being displayed ) . Display includes background grid markings . <p> View of section of a list of records ( left panel ) , a recording ( normal sinus rhythm , NSR , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer screen while using the software . An onscreen caliper allows one to measure various parts of the waveform of a selected beat , as shown , by moving the red and black markers . By right-clicking the box of the selected beat , one can get a zoomed , pop-up box view of that beat , as shown . There are several options and views available ( see examples of others below ) . The software has much utility , is very flexible , and is very intuitive and easy to use with features normally seen only in much more expensive PC-based 12-lead and Holter systems . <p> Here is a section from a long recording of an episode of atrial fibrillation ( afib ) plus it includes a PVC ( second line , obvious ) . The sliding page bar at the bottom right allows one to scroll through the whole record . Also see the next figures . <p> With the " All ECG Wave " tab clicked , one gets the full disclosure of a recording , in this case , a long recording of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , the afib converted on its own during the course of the recording . By using the " ECG Analysis " tab , which shows heart rate ( HR ) trend , one can easily see the point of conversion toward the end of the recording when the rate which has been fluctuating around 130 drops to around 100 . <p> And the afib with its conversion is also seen when plotted in another way by clicking on the " Irregular Rhythm Trend " tab , as seen here . <p> Printed example of a recording ( NSR plus some PVCs ) . <h> Device characteristics <p> Physical : 5 x 2 3/4 x 3/4 in ( 126 x 68 x 20 mm ) , 4.1 oz ( 118 g ) <p> Display screen : color , 2 1/4 x 1 1/2 in ( 57 x 39 mm ) <p> Length(s) of recordings : 30 sec for ? quick measurement ? with the finger contact electrodes or , if using the lead-wires , ? continuous ? , that is , until whenever stopped <p> Software or app menus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear/intuitive and very user friendly <p> Printouts : can be sent to selected printer . <p> Cost : around $300 <p> Advanced recordings such as sequential 12-lead : yes , but see note in the next section below regarding the color/letter-coded connections on the lead wires ( more on this to be posted later , if and when I get around to it ) <p> Other aspects and comments : State-of-the-art 1-lead ( with the possibility of doing sequential other leads ) , handheld ECG device with very sophisticated but intuitive and easy-to-use software . Both the device and software have gone through numerous revisions and improvements since the original PC-80 . <p> Notes and cautions : This device seems to be available in different versions under a confusing array of similar names related to ? PC-80B ? ( and ? Prince 180B ? , which is similar but not identical ... it is generally sold for less , does not usually include the cable/lead-wires , and does not do continuous recording , only 30 second recordings even if one gets the cable/lead-wires and uses that for electrode input ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that I reviewed here is referred to by the originating company ( Creative Medical , Shenzhen , China ) as both ? PC-80B Color ? and ? PC-80B Color Bluetooth ? although not all of the units called ? Bluetooth ? have the wireless Bluetooth connection ; some may have and connect to a computer by USB or ZigBee options ! There are also earlier ? versions of PC-80B ( and Prince 180B ) that have a SD memory card slot but do not have all of the features ( as well as I can determine from the descriptions ) of the one with the color display and wireless option . This latest one should at least be called PC-80C ( which the company also uses in one of the web links for it and some sellers refer to it as PC-80B-C ) . <p> The device appears to have evolved and divided into more options and versions faster than its name has been able to keep up ! Thus , I urge care and caution that an interested buyer be very careful when purchasing a unit to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific one you want . The one I tested was ? PC-80B Color ? ( with emphasis on ? Color ? in the name ) with USB connection , not wireless or ZigBee . <p> The software disk that comes with the latest version may also have earlier versions of the software included on the disk with little indication as to which one should be used ! I had to use the ? wireless ? version of the software even though my specific unit was USB , not wireless ! And the user manuals seem to be a mixture of versions . The confusion over software version may have led to poor reviews of the device by other persons on other web sites . <p> Hopefully the company will clean up the current mess . ( I understand they are working on it , based on my reports to them , and I ? ll eventually be able to delete these notes and cautions . ) In the meantime , it remains a mess and you need to be careful so you get exactly the version you want when purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when installing . <p> Color/letter coding of the lead-wire connections : When trying to run ( sequential ) 12-lead combinations with the lead wires , I got confusing results using the 3 lead-wire connections following the color/letter codes and company recommendations . I also have gotten several inquiries about this issue from persons who bought the PC-80B Color device . As currently supplied , the lead-wires appear to be incorrectly ( or at least confusingly ) colored/marked . Here 's what worked best for me regarding the lead-wire connections : * red/ " R " : okay as indicated -- right side or negative electrode * green/ " F " : use as the left side or positive electrode * yellow/ " L " : use as the neutral or ground ( right leg or RL ) ( I marked mine with a permanent marker to remind me . ) When used that way , they appear to work in the various positions as with sequential 12-lead electrodes . I plan to do more testing along these lines and hope to eventually post the results here . <p> Sources : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section . The PC-80B color might become available from Favoriteplus.com after their stock of the original PC-80s are sold out . It is also available from numerous other sources including several US suppliers and is often listed on eBay ? do a web or eBay search for it . ( But , again , make sure you request and get the version you want , and install the " wireless " version of the software even if you do n't get an actual wireless unit ... see earlier comments . ) <h> Prince 180B <p> Description under development -- stay tuned/check back later . <p> Note : The Prince 180B is very similar to the PC-80B Color device , including they both use the same manual and software . However , the Prince 180B , at least in the orange-colored version , which is the one I obtained and tested , does NOT do continuous , Holter-like recording and usually does not come with the cable/lead-wires that the PC-80B Color does . Somewhat ( well , VERY ) confusingly , there might be a " Prince 180B " version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is like the PC-80B Color which DOES do continuous recording ! ? ! ? ! ... click here . I 'll try to figure it all out and report here later . <h> ReadMyHeart <p> UPDATES : ( last updated prior to 6/26/2014 ) <p> One of the first three handheld devices that I tested and reported . It is still available and still liked by many persons , particularly elderly and those new to such devices who want only the most basic of systems . <p> ReadMyHeart is a low cost , lightweight recorder designed to be convenient and for use by an average person with minimal knowledge of reading ECGs , that is , for someone who does n't need to read or monitor the tracings as they are being recorded . <p> The ECG tracings that appear on the display are NOT the actual ECGs but only simple icons that blink on and off during recording . For a display of the actual ECGs during and after recording , see the InstantCheck and PC-80 . <p> ReadMyHeart printout . It includes 3 records at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , and III respectively , from using the lead wires in appropriate fashion . That information was included in the records and displays on the computer screen but , because of the glitch in the system 's software , described in the characteristics below and perhaps corrected with recent revisions of software , did not print out on the hard copy such as shown in this figure . ) <p> Ability to add comments to recording files : ( Not sure regarding latest version of software , it may have been revised . The version I tested 2006-2008 , original version allowed comments , " notes " , to be entered into the record and displayed on the computer screen but then did not print on the printout . That glitch may have been corrected by now ; the device is currently available in version 2 , but I have not tested that version . ) <p> Printouts : can be printed from the uploaded records using the software ; printout show 3 records per page , with standard grid and measurements <p> Cost : less than USD $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequential 12-lead : yes , using the lead wires <p> Other aspects and comments : Quick start and convenient to record ECGs . Display not lighted and , thus , requires a room light for operation at night , to know when a recording is finished and to see results . The display shows blinking ECG traces during recording , but they are just icons , not the actual tracings being recorded . The software and uploaded ECG recordings are remarkably good , actually excellent , and very useful for reading by a cardiologist or anyone who is familiar with reading ECGs . Records are automatically deleted after upload/transfer to computer . <p> The E100 is a small , round ECG recording device . It uploads and communicates between a patient and their personal physician from anywhere in the world where there is an internet or cell phone connection . It is designed specifically for medical use , with security including HIPAA , and marketed primarily to medical centers and physicians wanting a standardized system for assignment to and use by their patients , like event recorders in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking into getting it for them . Physicians may also prescribe purchase of the device for a patient , so the patients can own it themselves for long-term use . It is available only by physician order or prescription and involves per-use charges ( with a built-in billing and accounting system ) . <p> The REKA system is designed for use by the vast majority of medical patients who know or care little about the intricacies of ECG or dealing with the ECG learning curve . It is the fastest and simplest device for recording 1-lead ECGs . One simply picks it up , touches the thumb contacts or connects the optional electrode wires to adhesive skin contacts , pushes the button to start recording , waits for approximately 30 seconds , then uploads the recording(s) directly to their own physician for evaluation ... from home , office , or while traveling locally or from anywhere in the world . The person can reach for it , pick it up , and start recording even in complete darkness . Whenever it is subsequently connected to a smart phone or computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record(s) and the patient ? s physician is notified . <p> The E100 operates through either finger contacts or optional lead-wire connections and adhesive skin electrodes . It has no screen display on the recording device , just the starting button which blinks ( and the unit beeps ) once per second until the recording is finished . <p> When the physician first assigns a unit to a patient while in the office , the patient can be instructed how to use it . The patient can be shown and allowed to practice with either or both the thumb contacts and lead-wires plus adhesive skin electrodes . The adhesive skin electrodes are useful when a particular patient is unable to get good recordings through the thumbs or if the physician wants recordings from more than one lead . ( The lead wires can be sequentially attached to different locations . ) Beyond that , the patient needs to know nothing ; just pick up the device , record , and plug into whatever upload system is used . If the patient wants or needs to do more with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view them , and add comments ( symptoms ) to the record . The physician and patient can also communicate results , etc. , by email or smart phone . <p> Unlike the patient , who needs to know little about the system , the medical center and physician(s) have a little learning curve for using the system and learning billing , etc . But that is normal for any medical system . REKA provides good instructions , support , and help , and the cloud-based system is user friendly for whomever logs into it ( as medical center , physician , or an individual patient ) . <p> Photo of materials received with each ECG recording device : User ? s Quick Start Guide , soft leather carrying pouch , charger for internal battery ( also charges when plugged into a computer via USB ) , the ECG recording device , upload cables for various smartphones or computer , lead-wire cables ( as alternative for thumb contacts ) , and a supply of adhesive skin electrodes ( not in photo ) for use with the lead-wire connections . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The power button blinks ( and the unit beeps ) every second for the 30 seconds that the unit is recording , with a long blink at the end to indicate the recording is finished . Recordings can also be done using the optional , alternative lead-wires and adhesive skin electrodes . <p> When one or more recordings are finished , the unit can then be connected to a smartphone or computer , at which point they are automatically uploaded to the cloud , the patient ? s physician is notified , and the records can be viewed by the patient , physician , or medical center . The physician can interpret the results and get back to the patient . <p> View ( using a computer ) of the log-in page ( same initial log-in site for all users : patient , doctor , and medical center ) . <p> Logged-in view for medical center . Physician view is similar but tailored for physician , as shown further below . Patient view is also somewhat similar but simplified . <p> Logged-in patient view of a section of their list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment from a selected recording . Comments can be added in the ? Symptoms ? box . ( Note : the screen views are of better quality , including the lettering , than they appear in these images from segments of the full screen views , which were too large to include on this webpage and still show details . Depending on how the screens are viewed , on smart phones or computers with various sized screens , the material may need to be scrolled or zoomed . ) <p> Logged-in view for physician . <p> The physician has several tools available for viewing and diagnosing the wave forms , including automatic measurements as shown in the lower part of this view . If the physician does not like the automatic measurement , as shown in the example here for QT interval ( bottom two green arrows ) , he or she can either do it manually with a standard ECG caliper or use the system 's built-in tools such as the A-B segment measurement ( both the A and B edges of which can be dragged to a desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top two green arrows ) , or use the built-in onscreen electronic caliper ( next figure below ) . <p> Further example of the view from above but with the caliper checked ( green arrow ) and ready to start using . ( I have n't taken the time to figure out how to properly use the electronic caliper in the REKA system . ) <p> Printed example of the waveform segment from a physician 's finished report . This is only part of the report . The full report is longer , involving more on this page than shown plus additional pages that include patient details and further information . <h> About the Author <p> James W. Grier is at North Dakota State University , where he has been since 1973 . He is currently retired , Emeritus Professor of Biological Sciences . He maintains an office and research lab on campus and stays active in various subjects , including cardiovascular and ECG .. <p> Ph.D.1975 Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with an additional major in Physiology <p> His interests in biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in population ecology , anatomy and physiology ( particularly cardiovascular and the nervous system ) , and cover a broad array of organisms , from different groups of invertebrates to vertebrates , including humans . His long-term special interests in particular groups of organisms have included eagles and other birds of prey , fishes , insects , and fossils ( particularly ammonites ) . His teaching background has been similarly diverse , ranging from introductory through upper division , to advanced graduate-level courses with advising of many undergraduate , MS , and PhD students . <p> As a scientific researcher , he has had long experience doing and teaching about research ( including teaching a graduate-level course on biological research for 33 years ) , across many subjects . Much of that experience and work has involved comparative studies , whether of different animal species and their **35;434;TOOLONG or human-made machines and equipment -- the underlying research principles are the same . <p> Dr. Grier has been involved with the subject of ECGs since 1970 when he took an advanced PhD level physiology course at Cornell University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recording ECGs in lab . He subsequently included the topic of ECGs in his own teaching and when assisting other faculty in human anatomy and physiology , vertebrate and general zoology , and general biology courses since 1973 at North Dakota State University . <p> He also has had his own personal heart conditions , a variety of irregular heartbeats or arrhythmias , and since the 1980s , has had numerous trips to the ER , clinic , most of the heart tests available , and two ablation procedures , all of which got him involved with a number of physicians , cardiologists , and electrophysiologists ( some of whom had been his previous students ) and a much deeper understanding of the subject of ECGs . <p> Between selecting ECG equipment for use in teaching and research labs and wanting his own personal equipment for monitoring and studying his own conditions , he has been using , reviewing , comparing , and studying ECG machines for many years . Because of his accumulated experience and understanding of the subject and ECG machines , he has been requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an expert witness for a court case , and even some research and development efforts for various ECG machines . <p> Outreach service and helping the public is a part of the three-pronged mission at North Dakota State University : **25;471;TOOLONG . Service includes both on- and off-campus , including to the general public , to colleagues and other professional persons and organizations , to **33;498;TOOLONG government agencies and non-government organizations , as well as to industry and business . For most of Dr. Grier 's life and entire career , he has been and continues to be a **34;533;TOOLONG at public universities . His nature is to be open and willing to help anyone . <p> Dr. Grier is not a physician himself ( " not that kind of a doctor " ) , but he has taught large numbers of physicians and other health care professionals -- including introducing them to cardiovascular topics including ECG . He and several of his relatives and friends have had their own heart conditions , which has made the subject personal and gotten him much deeper into the subject than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert witness doing ECG research for a legal case . <p> In the process of using and eventually studying ECG machines , he has gotten experience ( since 1970 ) and obtained ECG machines themselves by a variety of ways . Some equipment was obtained through the years by the university for courses in biology and human anatomy/physiology . Many units he purchased personally , for personal use and research , either directly from ECG equipment companies and distributors or on eBay . Several ( full 12-lead ) ECG machines and supplies used in the legal case were purchased for his comparative research by the plaintiffs-law firm . Some were donated to him by ECG companies/distributors for the purpose of testing their equipment . And in some cases he has been involved in the development of the equipment and systems , either voluntarily or with reimbursement for time and expertise . <p> For handheld ECG systems covered in this website , his involvement and obtaining of machines has been as shown below . <p> Most of the devices were sent to the author after learning of his background and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ECG-related websites . The original three and some of the subsequent ones were sent by Favoriteplus.com to help evaluate the devices for them . Most were sent to Dr. Grier at no cost or reduced cost in exchange for his testing and evaluation . Unless indicated otherwise and when significant amounts of time became involved , he has provided the testing and reporting at no charge to the companies , simply in exchange for being able to try out the devices and new technologies . <p> Several of the systems have involved feedback and reporting of encountered problems to the companies involved , leading to revisions and their current versions/models and ongoing improvements before the device was reported publicly on this webpage . ( Note : Dr. Grier usually find problems with systems ! Depending on a company 's viewpoint , that might be " dangerous " because he often finds unexpected things they did n't know were lurking in the system ... or it might be good and valuable because he has found several problems before they cropped up to bite the company in the marketplace ! Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually opportunities for improvement of a product . ) <p> In return , Dr. Grier wants to express appreciation to ALL of the companies involved for giving him the opportunity to try out and learn about the new products and technologies .

@@13708069 @2308069/ <h> Duplications and Deletions <p> A mechanisms that could generate a duplication is multiple replication of a looped region of DNA by DNA polymerase . That individual would have one chromosome with an extra copy of the sequence whereas the homologous chromosome would still retain a single copy of the sequence . <p> A second proposed molecular mechanism that can generate a duplication of a chromosome by its very nature will also generate a deletion . This mechanism is unequal crossing-over . This occurs when pairing occurs between homologous chromosomes in regions that are out of register . This pairing can be mediated by sequences that are repeated on the same chromosome . Following recombination ( or crossing over ) one chromosome will lose DNA sequence whereas the homologous chromosome will gain the sequences lost by the first . <p> The presence , and extent of a deletion , can be detected quite readily with polytene chromosomes . A loop will appear on one paired chromosome , and those sequences found in the looped region mark the length of the deletion . These loops are also detectable in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal a loop structure , but without the band markers that are available with polytene chromosomes , it is difficult to define the region . Obviously , it will be to be easier to detect the larger deletions , but with good preparation and patience , the deletion of a single band can be detected , and thus the chromosomal location of a specific phenotype can be made . <h> Evolution and Unequal Crossing Over <p> One possible result of unequal crossing-over is the creation of a multigene family . These are defined as a tandem array of genes that have similar function . The best studied family is that which encodes the *-chain of human hemoglobin . Six * -globin genes are found within 50 kb on chromosome 11 . The * gene is expressed during early embryo development , the two * genes during fetal development , the * gene early after birth , and the * gene throughout the remainder of the life cycle . The **1 gene is a pseudogene that has a mutation which prevents its expression . The sequences of these six genes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral *-globin gene . <p> Once a gene duplication event has occurred evolutionary constraints working upon these gene presumably lessen . First , another unequal crossing-over event could generate a third copy of the gene , further expanding the family . Other similar events will further spread the family . As the family expands , previous harmful mutations can now be tolerated because functional copies will still exist . Duplicate genes could now diversify and take on new or more specialized functions . Thus , over evolutionary time the sequences of the family members can diverge , and their role in phenotypic expression of the individual could change . <p> Deletions and duplications involve an actual gain or loss of genetic material by the genome of the specific individual . If these changes are maintained and prove to beneficial then eventually these changes might become stabilized in the species . <h> Duplications of the Bar locus of Drosophila <p> One phenotype that has been analyzed in Drosophila with respect to duplications is bar eye . The eye of the fly is normally an elongated oval shape whereas the bar eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bar eye are analyzed , a duplication in region 16A of the chromosome is detected . Another mutant of the eye shape is the double bar eye . These individuals have a second duplication of the same 16A region . <p> This example shows how Drosophila polytene chromosomes can be used . First , a new phenotype is detected and after further analysis of these endoreplicated chromosomes the actual location of the sequences encoding the phenotype can be detected . Likewise , if a deletion is noted in an individual with a specific phenotype , it could be assumed that the deleted region is the gene involved with phenotype . <p> Chromosome Structure <p> Phenotype <p> X-16AX-16A <p> Normal Eye Female <p> X-16A-16AX-16A <p> Bar Eye Female <p> X-16A-16AX-16A-16A <p> Bar eye female ( more restricted , 68 facets ) <p> X-16A-16A-16AX-16A <p> Double bar eye female ( 45 facets ) <p> **26;569;TOOLONG <p> Double bar eye female ( further reduced ) <p> The results of the analysis of the Bar locus demonstrates that the chromosomal environment can have an effect on the expression of a specific gene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Position effect - the phenotype of a gene is alteredd by changes in the position or chromosomal environment of the gene

With one gene controlling a trait we have three possible genotypes , AA , Aa and aa and depending on the allelic interactions ( dominance or incomplete dominance ) we can have two or three phenotypes . As more and more genes control a trait , a greater number of genotypes are possible . The formula that predicts the number of genotypes from the number of genes is 3 to the power n.

Therefore , the number of phenotypes is less than for additive gene action . Furthermore , the number of phenotypes that result from a specific genotype will be reduced further if epistatic interactions between several loci affects the phenotype . Additive , dominance , and epistatic effects can all contribute to the phenotype of a quantitative trait , but generally additive interactions are the most important . <p> All of the above factors are genetic in nature , but the environment also affects quantitative traits .

@@13708075 @2308075/ <p> The embryo is formed when a female gamete unites with a male gamete . In the vast majority of species , the female gamete is physically larger than the male gamete and provides the cytoplasm for the developing embryo . Within this cytoplasm are factors that were released by the nuclear genes of the female . Those factors may have specific effects upon the developing embryo . The female cytoplasm also contributes the mitochondria for all species as well as the chloroplast for plant species . These two organelles contain DNA and control certain traits in the offspring . Those phenotypes that are controlled by nuclear factors found in the cytoplasm of the female are said to express a maternal effect . Those phenotypes controlled by organelle genes exhibit maternal inheritance . <p> The classic phenotype which exhibits maternal effects is coiling direction of snail shells .

With other experiments , the results of reciprocal crosses ( complementary crosses were the phenotypes of female and male are reversed in the initial parental cross ) were equivalent , but with this experiment it appears that the female controls the phenotype . Yet , the F2 appears to contradict this hypothesis because the left- and right-coiled F1 individuals produced all right progeny . Furthermore , the 3:1 Mendelian ratio is not seen in the F2 , but rather appears in the F3 generation . <p> How can this result be explained ? First , let 's look for results that are familar . The F3 ratio of 3 right:1 left for both crosses suggests that right-coiled shells are dominant to left-coiled shells .

If the genotypes we assigned to the parents are correct , then the genotype of F1 individuals from each cross are s+s ( from s+s+ x ss and ss x s+s+ ) . If the female genotype does control the phenotype of its offspring , then we would predict that all the F2 snails would have right coils . This is the exact result that is seen . But what would the genotypes of the F2 snails be ? If we intermate snails with the genotype s+s the genotypic ratio should be 3 s+ to 1 ss . These genotypes would not be expressed as a phenotype until the F3 generation . These are the results that were obtained . A general conclusion from all traits that express a maternal effect is that the normal Mendelian ratios are expressed one generation than expected .

@@13708081 @2308081/ <h> Principles of Map-based or Positional Cloning <p> The first step of map-based or positional cloning is to identify a molecular marker that lies close to you gene of interest . This procedure typically is done my first finding a marker in the vicinity of the gene ( several cM away ) . For the initial screening smaller population sizes are used ( 60-150 individuals ) The next step is to saturate the region around that original molecular marker with other markers . At this point you are looking for a one that rarely shows recombination with your gene . At this stage , the population size could increase to 300-600 individuals . <p> The next step is to screen a large insert genomic library ( BAC or YAC ) with your marker to isolate clones that hybridize to your molecular marker . Once you identify the initial markers that map are near ( or better yet ) flank your gene and fournd a a clone to which the markers hybridize , you are on your way to determining where that gene resides . The steps that follow are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markers ( usually sequences at the end of the clone ) and screening your segregating population with these new markers . Often this population is large ( 1000-3000 individuals ) . The goal is to find a set of markers that co-segegate ( no recombination ) with your gene of interest . Co-segregation means that whenever one allele of your gene is expressed , the markers associated with that allele are also present . In other words , recombination is not seen between your gene and the markers . If these markers do not cosegregate , you select new large insert clones and repeat the process until you have a clone whose markers co-segregates with your gene . To speed the cloning process , it is best to begin with a marker that is tightly linked to the gene with which your are working . Therefore you will not have to do a lot of additional screening . <p> Because you have your gene flanked on a single clone between two markers , you now know that the gene must be between those two markers . DNA fragments between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your gene by a genetic engineering technique called plant transformation . If transgenic plant expresses the wild type phenotype , you then know the gene of interest is on that fragment . At this point you must sequence the fragment to find a potential open reading frame ( ORF ) , sequences that most likely will encode a gene product . In the best situation , only a single ORF is found , but this often is not the case . Usually several possible ORFs are found and new transgenic plants are created by transforming with a single ORF . Once this ORF is shown to rescue the mutant phenotype , you then perform an in-depth molecular and biochemical analysis of newly cloned gene . <p> These steps can be summarized as follows : <p> Identify a marker tightly linked to your gene in a " large " mapping population <p> Find a YAC or BAC clone to which the marker probe hybridizes <p> Create new markers from the large-insert clone and determine if they co-segregate with your gene <p> If necessary , re-screen the large-insert genomic library for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate gene from large-inset clone whose markers co-segregate with the gene <p> If you do not have a transformation system for your species of interest , the confirmation is much more difficult . The most powerful approach in this case is recombinational or mutant analysis . Let 's say you have two mutants in your gene . You could cross these two mutants and search a large segregating population for an individual with a restored normal phenotype . Next you would clone from each of these three individuals ( the two mutants and the restored line ) homologouse sequences that you feel contains the correct gene . If you can show that the restored line contains the same sequence as your predicted gene , and that the two mutants have unique changes in the gene sequence not found in the normal gene , you have obtained compelling evidence that the putative sequence is indeed your gene of interest .

@@13708089 @2308089/ <h> Description of Quantitative Traits <p> All of the traits that we have studied to date fall into a few distinct classes . These classes can be used to predict the genotypes of the individuals . For example , if we cross a tall and short pea plant and look at F2 plants , we know the genotype of s hort plants , and we can give a generalized genotype for the tall plant phenotype . Furthermore , if we know the genotype we could predict the phenotype of the plant . These type of phenotypes are called discontinuous traits . <p> Other traits do not fall into discrete classes . Rather , when a segregating population is analyzed , a continuous distribution of phenotypes is found . An example , is ear length in corn . Black Mexican Sweet corn has short ears , whereas Tom Thumb popcorn has long ears . When these two inbred lines are crossed , the length of the F1 ears are intermediate to the two parents . Furthermore , when the F1 plants are intermated , the distribution of ear length in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size to the Tom Thumb popcorn size . The distribution resembles the bell-shaped curve for a normal distribution . <p> These types of traits are called continuous traits and can not be analyzed in the same manner as discontinuous traits .

" Henry Ward Beecher ( 1813 1887 ) <p> History &amp; Background of Hibiscus <p> It is thought that the hibiscus originated in Asia and the Pacific Islands . They were introduced to the United States by way of the South Pacific . Hibiscus is the state flower of Hawaii and the national flower of Malaysia . Hibiscus belong to the Malvaceae or Mallow family . They are now one of the most popular and widely planted shrubs in the tropics . <p> The hibiscus is known best for its large gorgeous blooms . These blooms only last for one day on most varieties , opening in the morning and wilting late that afternoon . However , some varieties have been known to bloom form more than one day . Most hibiscus are odorless , but some varieties are slightly fragrant . They come in thousands of color combinations ranging in all colors of the spectrum , except no true blue or black . They are used mostly for their aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyes and in food . The blooms can either be single or double depending on the variety . <p> There are some things you need to take into consideration when deciding when you want to take cuttings from your hibiscus . The three most common types of cuttings to hibiscus are Softwood , Semi-Hardwood and Hardwood . <p> Softwood Cuttings : <p> Softwood cuttings are taken form the new soft succulent growth on the plant . They are taken in the spring to early summer and should be about 7.5 to 12.5cm ( 3-5in. ) in length . Before planting they should be treated with IBA or NAA . <p> Semi-Hardwood Cuttings : <p> Semi-Hardwood cuttings are taken from the partially mature wood on the current seasons growth . They are taken in the late spring to late summer and should be about 7.5 to 15cm ( 3-6in. ) in length . Before planting they should be treated with IBA or NAA . <p> Hardwood Cuttings:Hardwood cuttings are taken from the mature , dormant hardwood stems of the plant . They are taken during the late fall to early spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in length . Before planting they should be treated with IBA or NAA . <p> All cuttings should be placed in a well draining medium , such as peat . Cuttings will usually begin rooting in about six weeks , and flower in about nine months . Maintaining a high humidity level is best for the cuttings . <p> Grafting or Budding : <p> This method results in plants which combing two different varieties . The entire top portion of the plant , the scion , is one variety and the bottom , the stock , is another . The rootstock is usually a variety that has proven to be less susceptible to pests and diseases . This method is used to propagate hibiscus varieties that are susceptible to disease or difficult to root . <p> Grafting <p> The main thing to remember when grafting is that in order to have a successful graft you must make sure to line up cambium layers of the stock and scion . Some of the most popular types of grafts that can be used on hibiscus are the cleft graft , bark graft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap the grafted area firmly and evenly with grafting tape after successfully lining up the cambium layers . <p> Budding <p> This method requires a little more patience and skill than grafting . Budding utilizes only one bud at a time and a small section of the rootstock . Budding may result in a stronger union than grafting and is used commercially in many nurseries . Some of the more popular types of budding are the t-bud and chip bud . With budding also make sure to wrap the graft when you are finished . <p> Air Layering <p> Air Layering is an excellent method of propagation for hibiscus varieties that are harder to root . By placing the scion directly onto the ringed stock you are able to induce root formation quickly and easily . After taping the union you should make sure to wrap it in moist sphagnum moss and seal it with a plastic wrapper . The wrapper should preferably be black to block out direct sunlight and prevent scalding of the new roots . <p> Grown from Seed <p> Growing hibiscus from seed is how new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female parts a pod develops and ripens within a few months .

@@13708107 @2308107/ <p> If a DNA molecule is melted and allowed to reassociate , the complexity of the genome dictates the rate in which duplex DNA will form . If we consider a simple molecule that consists of alternating GCs , this molecule will be able to form a duplex quicker than a molecule that consists of repeating blocks of AGCT . As the number of different combinations of bases increases , the time required for complete duplex formation to occur will increase . Renaturation , or duplex formation requires random collisions between two single-stranded molecules . This process follows second-order kinetics and is concentration dependent . We will not go through the derivation of the formula but the important parameter used to define a certain DNA is:Cot+ . <p> This value is defined as the amount of time required for one-half of the DNA to reanneal or form duplex DNA . The units for this parameter is moles of nucleotides per liter per second . The more complex the genome of interest , the longer it will take for like sequences to reanneal . Consequently , the Cot+ will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific definition . <p> Complexity - the total length of different sequences <p> For example , E. coli is considered to have a complexity of 4.2 x 106 base pairs . What is the experimental procedure used to derive these values ? In general the procedure is : <p> Take aliquots at different time points . Separate single-stranded DNA from double-stranded DNA by hydroxyapatite . Measure the amount of DNA that is double-stranded by absorbance at 260 nm . <p> Plot the amount that is single-stranded versus the Cot value . The Cot value is expressed in log equivalent . This plot depicts the Cot curve . <p> When this type of experiment is performed with eukaryotic DNA three components are usually seen . These components each reanneal with their own unique Cot+ value . The three components are termed the fast , intermediate , and slow components . Why do we see these three components ? Eukaryotic genomes are characterized by sequences that are represented by different copy numbers . If a sequence is found many times in the genome , it will reanneal much quicker than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the equivalent Cot curve for a eukaryotic genome will be different than a genome , such as E. coli , which only contains single copy sequences . <p> A comparison of the Cot value of each of these components with an E. coli standard allows us to derive the complexity of each component . The complexity of the slow component of the genome is greater than that for the other two components and is considered to represent the single copy portion of the genome . The complexity of the slow component can be used as a good estimate of the genome size . The genome size will be the sum of the lengths of all the unique sequences . Using the example from Genes V - Lewin , p.664 , the complexity of the slow component is 3 x 108 bp and the complexity of the intermediate component is 6 x 105 . If we divide the complexity of the slow component into the intermediate component we get 2 x 10-3 . This demonstrates that the intermediate component contributes very little to the complexity of the genome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the genome can be considered equal to the genome size . <p> To derive the complexity of each component , it is necessary to run a standard , such as E. coli DNA , with each experiment . As stated above , E. coli is considered to consist of only single- copy sequences . Let 's say that in the experiment from which the Cot for each component was derived , the Cot+ value for E. coli was 4 . Experimentally it was determined that the slow component comprised 45% of the total DNA . Therefore , if only that component was annealed , the Cot+ value would be 283 ( 630 x 0.45 ) . That value is 71 ( 283/4 ) times slower than for E. coli . Therefore the complexity of the slow component is 71 times that of E. coli or 3.0 x 108 ( 71 x 4.2 x 106 ) . The complexity of the other components is derived similarly . <p> Genome size is quite variable throughout the biological world and the genome size in plants shows the greatest variation of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Size among Plants <p> Species <p> kb/haploid <p> pg/haploid1 <p> Arabidopsis <p> 7 X 104 <p> 0.15 <p> Lily <p> 1 X 108 <p> 100.00 <p> 1Conversion factor : 1 pg = 0.965 X 109 bp = 6.1 X 1011 daltons <p> One manner in which a genome can be described is by determining the distribution of fast , intermediate and slow components in the genome .

@@13708110 @2308110/ <h> Variations to Mendel 's First Law of Genetics <p> The true test of any theory of science is its ability to explain results that at first glance appear to be a clear exception to the theory . But , if the exception can be explained by the theory , then the theory is further validated . One such genetic example that challenged Mendel 's first law was the relationship between two alleles that do not express a typical dominance/recessive relationship . That is , the F1 does not exhibit the genotype of one of the two pure line parents . This type of allelic relationship was termed codominance . <p> Codominance - a relationship among alleles where both alleles contribute to the phenotype of the heterozygote <p> Example : Codominance <p> Species : Four o'clock plants <p> Trait : Flower color <p> Pure line phenotypes : red or white flower <p> Parental cross : Red x White <p> F1 : We would expect red or white flowers in this generation , depending upon which allele is dominant . But , the F1 plants produced pink flowers . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are selfed . The results that were obtained were : <p> F2 phenotypic ratio : 1/4 Red : 1/2 Pink : 1/4 White <p> Snapdragon Flower Colors <p> It appears as if the red and white alleles are interacting in the heterozygote to generate the pink flowers . Another example of codominance can be seen by looking at a biochemical phenotype . <p> As an example , let assume that a gene of interest resides on a DNA fragment that is 3.0 kb in size in parent one and 2.0 kb in size in a second parent . ( See figure below . ) When we cross the two parents , one chromosome carrying the gene comes from each parent . Since our technique recognizes both copies in the parents , the parental signal will be twice as strong as the F1 signal that contains one chromosome , and thus one copy of the particular DNA size , from each parent . The F2 generation will segregate for the three different genotypes in a 1:2:1 ratio . <p> Genotypic designations could be given for each of the alleles . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allele A1 , the genotype of parent 1 will be A1A1 . Allele designation A2 will be used for the 2.0 kb fragment and the genotype of parent 2 will be A2A2 . Because the F1 is heterozygous , its genotype will be A1A2 . Finally , the genotypes of the F2 generation will segregate 1A1A1:2A1A2:1A2A2 . <p> Often expression levels in an individual can only reach a certain intensity regardless of whether the individual is a homozygote or heterozygote . For example , pea plants heterozygote for the tall/dwarf allelic pair are the same size as the homozygous tall parent . But expression is not considered with DNA markers because we are monitoring the presence or absence of a specific DNA fragment . Therefore , DNA fragments are a true example of codominance where each allele is equally expressed in the F1 individual . <p> Incomplete dominance - the F1 produces a phenotype quantitatively intermediate between the two homozygous parents ; if the product is exactly intermediate between the two homozygous parents the relationship is termed no dominance ( although some have tried to substitute the term no dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@13708118 @2308118/ <p> As we discussed earlier , the metric value ( or phenotypic value ) for a specific individual , is the result of genetic factors , environmental factors , and the environmental factors that interact with the genetic factors . The sum of these factors in a popul ation of individuals segregating fora quantitative trait contributes to the variance of that population . Thus the total variance can be partitioned in the following manner . <p> VP = VG + VE + VGE <p> VP = total phenotypic variation of the segregating population VG = genetic variation that contributes to the total phenotypic variation VE = environmental contribution to the total phenotypic variation VGE = variation associated with the genetic and environmental factor interactions <p> The genetic variation can be further subdivided into three components . The first component is called the additive genetic variation . Some alleles may contribute a fixed value to the metric value of quantitative value . For example , if genes A and B control corn yield ( it is actually controlled by many genes ) , and each allele c ontributes differently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bu/aca = 2 bu/acB = 6 bu/acb = 3 bu/ac <p> Then the AABB genotype will have a yield of 20 ( 4+4+6+6 ) bu/ac and the AaBb genotype will yield 15 ( 4+2+6+3 ) bu/ac . Genes that act in this manner are additive , and they contribute to the additive genetic variance ( VA ) . <p> In addition to genes which have an additive effect on the quantitative trait , other genes may exhibit a dominant gene action which will mask the contribution of the recessive alleles at the locus . For example , if the two genes just mentioned exhibited dominance the metric value of the AaBb heterozygote would be 20 bu/ac . This value equals the homozygous dominant genotype in the example where the alleles were acting additively . This source of variability is attributed to the dominance genetic variance ( VD ) . <p> The final type of genetic variance is associated with the interactions between genes . The genetic basis of this variance is epistasis , and it is called the interaction genetic variance ( VI ) . <p> The total genetic variance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VG = VA + VD + VI <p> and the total phenotypic variance can be rewritten as <p> VP = VA + VD + VI + VE + VGE <p> By performing specific experiments quantitative geneticists can estimate the proportion of the total variance that is attributable to the total genetic variance and the environmental genetic variance . If geneticists are trying to improve a specific quantitative trait ( such as crop yield or weight gain of an animal ) , estimates of the proportion of these variances to the total variance provide direction to their research . If a large portion of the variance is genetic , then gains can be made from selecting individuals with the metric value you wish to obtain . On the other hand if the genetic variance is low , which implies that the envi ronmental variance is high , more success would be obtained if the environmental conditions under which the individual will be grown are optimized . 
@@13708119 @2308119/ <p> One common feature among eukaryotic organisms is the presence of methyl ( -CH3 ) groups attached to DNA . Although they are not defined sequences , it has been suggested by correlation that they are involved in controlling gene expression . Specifically , the methyl group appears to be preferentially associated with cytosine bases , and the modified base is called 5 ' -methylcytosine ( 5 ' -mC ) .

First , the methylation pattern is heritable from generation to generation . This obviously would be required if methylation is important for regulation because the pattern would be correlated with the specific features of that species . Next , the methylation pattern appears to be tissue specific . This would be expected if only a subset of all the genes in the genome are to be expressed in a single tissue type . It is thought that this is accomplished by the action of tissue specific demethylases . <p> 5 ' -mC does not appear at random cytosine residues , but is mostly sequence specific . The methylation of cytosine primarily occurs at the sequence 5 ' -CpG-3 ' . The vast majority of methylation appears to be related to this sequence . An associated observation is that CpG islands exist that are often associated with genes . In mammals , about 30,000 CpG islands about 1-2 kb in size have been detected . Therefore , demethylation would occur in or near one of these islands , and those genes associated with that demethylated island would be expressed .

Adding an assortment of plants , flowers , and decorations all add to the beauty of your yard and home . Most types of gardens can function in aesthetic ways , but often times there are additional functions related to each type . Gardens are categorized according to the types of plants present , as well as , the style and function of the garden . <p> In this article , you will find different garden designs , suitable plants for each type , and a few steps to get you started . I will be discussing three different styles of gardens , including decorative shade gardens , rock gardens , and water gardens . Rock gardens and water gardens are classified as specialty gardens , so if you are a beginning gardener , you may want to start with the more simple shade garden . Each of these garden types is characterized by specific plants and follows a specific style . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , a few general steps to help you get started on any type of garden design . <p> There are a few conditions that must be considered before planting your shade garden . First , you will want to find a location that is partially shady ; only receiving a small amount of sunlight each day . The soil in your shade garden should be free of large rocks and other debris , and should contain an abundance of organic matter . A good drainage system is also needed for your shade garden . <p> There is a large variety of plant types that can be planted in your shade garden . They vary greatly and include both annuals and perennials . The plants you will be picking from are categorized as being either full shade or partial shade . Either category will be sufficient depending on where in your shade garden they are planted . Below is a list of examples of shade garden plants . <p> In addition to plants , garden furniture and other decorations can be added to your garden . Finding a decoration theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can simply find decorations that follow your theme . Benches , tables , and ceramic statues , for example , can add a great deal to your shade garden . The goal of adding decorations to the garden is to make it a more relaxing and welcoming area . <p> Rock Gardens : <p> Also known as Alpine gardens , rock gardens are designed to utilize a small amount of space and follow the rugged mountainous style . Rock gardens can simply add character to a small space , but also function to take the place of the lawn on a steep hillside . This type of garden is ideal if you are limited on space , or if you have a hillside that is difficult to care for . The plants in this garden type are similar to those found in rocky regions and require special conditions . Theses plants are very hardy and are able to survive conditions similar to those in mountainous regions . The main thing to remember about this type of garden is that the best rock garden is the most natural one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better your garden will look . <p> Again , there are some conditions that should be considered before beginning your rock garden . First , you must find a location for your garden . Rock gardens are usually located in a sunny area on a natural slope or terrace . The soil medium should consist of a mixture of sand , gravel , and organic matter . A good drainage system , with low to moderate watering , is also needed . When finding rocks to add to your garden , only chose one rock type , but with varying sizes . These rocks should be placed in a way such that they look as natural as possible . <p> When choosing plants for your rock garden , choose ones that are generally low growing and have a clumping habit . The plant species you choose should be repeated several times throughout the garden to give it a more natural appearance . Below is a brief list of plants that work well for rock gardens . <p> Water gardens are the dream of many , and with proper planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any location , but the location may become limited depending on what types of plants are in the garden . The first step in building a water garden is to find a place large enough to build a pool of desired size . The shape and size of the pool depends on what style you would like to follow , and how it will fit in with the rest of your yard . Once the pool is designed , plants can be added . There are several different types of water plants , each having its own function in the pool . Adding plants to the water garden has many benefits . They filter and purify the water , as well as , keep the water cool by sheltering it from sunlight . Keeping the water cool is necessary if you plan to add animal life to your water garden . <p> There are five major types of water garden plants . The first type is the floating plants . Floating plants float on surface of the water garden . They help cut out sunlight , filter the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common examples of floating plants include duckweed and floating ferns . Submerged plants are another type of aquatic plants . They are completely submerged under the water , but are essential to the pool because they oxygenate and filter the water . It works best to plant these plants in containers and then place them under water . Emerged plants are the next type of water plant . They have roots that are anchored in soil but have leaves that rise above the water level . Emerged plants help to cut out sunlight , as well as , filter and oxygenate the water . Common examples of emerged plants include water lilies and lotus . Bog plants are similar to emerged plants except their roots are not entirely emerged in the soil . Examples of bog plants include cattails and pickerel rush . The final type of aquatic plants is basic garden plants that are able to grow in marshy conditions . Common examples of these include forget-me-nots , bee balms , moneywarts , and the chameleon plant . <p> Having animal life in your water garden is a fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldfish are the main type of animal added to water gardens . They are relatively easy to care for and add a great deal of beauty and excitement to the garden . Japanese carp , or Koi , as well as , some scavengers can also be added to your garden as well . Scavengers help to keep the water clean and include species such as snails , tadpoles , and freshwater clams . <p> An important thing to remember about gardening is that it is your hobby so you can do it in any way you would like . Gardens can follow certain guidelines , but still fit in with your likes . Decorations and other added features can be added to any type of garden . The main thing to remember is to make your garden look neat , friendly , inviting , and unique . The information provided above about garden types can help you decide which type of garden is right for you and your yard . The tips that follow can help you get started on the garden design you pick . <p> Tips for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any garden is to make a plan . Assess your garden conditions and determine the best location . Decide what type of garden you would like to plant . The second step to beginning your garden is to prepare the garden soil . Remove rocks and stones from the planting area , as well as , any unwanted debris . Fertilize the soil , and assure that there is a good mixture of clay , silt , and sand . Next you can decide which plants will do well in your garden , and then buy the plants . Buy healthy looking plants that will thrive in your particular garden setting . The final step to obtaining your desired garden is to care for it . Water the plants as needed and control pests and growth of unwanted plants . If you follow these general steps , you should be able to obtain a beautiful healthy garden just as you wanted . Do n't be afraid to alter unwanted areas of the garden , or add plants and decorations to it . Remember , it is your garden ; enjoy it !

@@13708127 @2308127/ <h> Monoploidy <p> An individual that contains one half the normal number of chromosomes is a monoploid and exhibits monoploidy . Monoploids are very rare in nature because recessive lethal mutations become unmasked , and thus they die before they are detected . These alleles normally are not a problem in diploids because their effects are masked by dominant alleles in the genome . Some species such as bees , ants and male bees are normally monoploid because they develop from unfertilized eggs . Consequently , these individuals will be sterile . A stage in the life cycle of some fungal species can also be monoploid . <p> Monoploidy has been applied in plant biotechnology to rapidly develop plants from anthers that have a fixed genotype . F1 plants derived from a cross of two parents are grown and anther tissue is used to regenerate new plants using tissue culture techniques .

Plant breeders make crosses and begin selecting in the F2 generation for individuals that show desirable traits .

Several more generations of testing are normally required before the desired trait is fixed in a line . <p> Using anther culture , though , these recombinants in the F1 gametes are fixed immediately after the chromosomes are doubled ( with a drug such as colchicine ) . They are fixed because after doubling the individual will be homozygous for every gene in the genome . Thus , selection for lines with desirable traits can be accelerated significantly . To date , the limiting factor has been the development of anther culture techniques for different crops . Wheat has been the best success story to date with this technique .

@@13708132 @2308132/ <h> On this page <h> What is an ice dam ? <p> An ice dam is a ridge of ice that forms at the edge of a roof and prevents melting snow ( water ) from draining off the roof . The water that backs up behind the dam can leak into a home and cause damage to walls , ceilings , insulation , and other areas . Figure 1 shows a cross section of a home with an ice dam . <p> Figure 1 . Cross section of a one-and-a-half story house with an ice dam . <h> What causes ice dams ? <p> There is a complex interaction among the amount of heat loss from a house , snow cover , and outside temperatures that leads to ice dam formation . For ice dams to form there must be snow on the roof , and , at the same time , higher portions of the roof 's outside surface must be above 32F while lower surfaces are below 32F . For a portion of the roof to be below 32F , outside temperatures must also be below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are talking about average temperature over sustained periods of time . <p> The snow on a roof surface that is above 32F will melt . As water flows down the roof it reaches the portion of the roof that is below 32F and freezes . Voila ! - an ice dam . <p> The dam grows as it is fed by the melting snow above it , but it will limit itself to the portions of the roof that are on the average below 32F . So the water above backs up behind the ice dam and remains a liquid . This water finds cracks and openings in the exterior roof covering and flows into the attic space . From the attic it could flow into exterior walls or through the ceiling insulation and stain the ceiling finish . <p> Nonuniform roof surface temperatures lead to ice dams . <h> What causes different roof surface temperatures ? <p> Since most ice dams form at the edge of the roof , there is obviously a heat source warming the roof elsewhere . This heat is primarily coming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these temperature differences . <p> Heat from the house travels to the roof surface in three ways : conduction , convection , and radiation . Conduction is heat energy traveling through a solid . A good example of this is the heating of a cast iron frying pan . The heat moves from the bottom of the pan to the handle by conduction . <p> If you put your hand above the frying pan , heat will reach it by the other two methods . The air right above the frying pan is heated and rises . The rising air carries heat/energy to your hand . This is heat transfer by convection . In addition , heat is transferred from the hot pan to your hand by electromagnetic waves and this is called radiation . Another example of radiation is to stand outside on a bright sunny day and feel the heat from the sun . This heat is transferred from the sun to you by radiation . <p> In a house , heat moves through the ceiling and insulation by conduction through the slanted portion of the ceiling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little space in regions like this for insulation , so it is important to use insulations with high R-value per inch to reduce heat loss by conduction . <p> The top surface of the insulation is warmer than the other surroundings in the attic . Therefore , the air just above the insulation is heated and rises , carrying heat by convection to the roof . The higher temperatures in the insulation 's top surface compared to the roof sheathing transfers heat outward by radiation . These two modes of heat transfer can be reduced by adding insulation . This will make the top surface temperature of the insulation closer to surrounding attic temperatures directly affecting convection and radiation from this surface . <p> There is another type of convection that transfers heat to the attic space and warms the roof . In Figure 1 , the winding arrow beginning inside the house and going through the penetration in the ceiling , from the light to the attic space , illustrates heat loss by air leakage . In many homes this is the major mode of heat transfer that leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those in the kitchen or bathroom that terminate just above the roof may also contribute to snow melting . These exhaust systems may have to be moved or extended in areas of high snow fall . <p> Other sources of heat in the attic space include chimneys . Frequent use of wood stoves and fireplaces allow heat to be transferred from the chimney into the attic space . Inadequately insulated or leaky duct work in the attic space will also be a source of heat . The same can be said about knee wall spaces . <p> The photograph below left shows a single story house with an ice dam . The points of heat loss can be clearly seen as those areas with no snow . The ceiling below this area needs to be examined for air leakage , missing or inadequate insulation , leaky or poorly insulated ductwork , and the termination of a kitchen <p> The photograph below right illustrates unusually high heat loss from the roof . There is very little snow left on the roof and at its edge is both an ice dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A single-story house with an ice dam . The areas without snow are the points of heat loss . <p> The unusually high heat loss on this roof has caused both an ice dam and icicles . <p> So it is primarily heat flowing from the house that is causing the nonuniform temperatures of the roof surface leading to ice dams . <h> Preventing and dealing with ice dams <p> In all Minnesota communities it is possible to find homes that do not have ice dams . Ice dams can be prevented by controlling the heat loss from the home . <h> Immediate action : <p> Remove snow from the roof . This eliminates one of the ingredients necessary for the formation of an ice dam . A " roof rake " and push broom can be used to remove snow , but may damage the roofing materials . <p> In an emergency situation where water is flowing into the house structure , making channels through the ice dam allows the water behind the dam to drain off the roof . Hosing with tap water on a warm day will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dam . The channel will become ineffective within days and is only a temporary solution to ice dam damage . <h> Long-term action : <p> First , make the ceiling air tight so no warm , moist air can flow from the house into the attic space . <p> After sealing air leakage paths between the house and attic space , consider increasing the ceiling/roof insulation to cut down on heat loss by conduction . <p> Both of these actions will increase the snow load that your roof has to carry because it will no longer melt . Can your roof carry the additional load ? If it is built to current codes , there should not be a structural problem . Roofs , like the rest of the home , should have been designed to withstand expected snow loads . In Minnesota , plans showing design details to meet expected snow loads are usually required to receive a building permit . The plans for your home may be on file at your local building inspection office . To help you understand the plans , or if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to contact an architectural engineering firm . A professional engineer should be able to evaluate the structure of your home and answer your questions about the strength of your roof . <p> Natural roof ventilation can help maintain uniform roof temperatures , but if the long-term actions described here are done effectively , then only small amounts of roof ventilation are needed to maintain uniform roof surface temperatures . If heat transfer has been reduced substantially , then snow will build up on the roof and cover natural roof ventilation systems , reducing attic ventilation rates . Natural attic ventilation systems are needed to dry the attic space and remove heat buildup during the summer . <p> Mechanical attic ventilation IS NOT a recommended solution to ice dams in Minnesota . It can create other attic moisture problems and may cause undesirable negative pressure in the home . <p> WARNING ! <p> Any person on the roof during the winter or performing work on the roof from below is risking injury and risking damage to the roof and house . It is important to contact professionals to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ventilation systems , exhausting devices , and combustion devices must have enough air to operate safely and effectively ! <p> Weatherization contractors , who may be listed under Energy Management and Conservation Consultants or Insulation Contractors in the Yellow Pages , are professionals who can deal with the heat transfer problem that creates ice dams . A blower door test should be used by the contractor you hire to evaluate the airtightness of your ceiling . In addition , they may have an infrared camera that can be used to find places in the ceiling where there is excessive heat loss . <p> Interior damage should not be repaired until ceilings and walls are dry . In addition , interior repair should be done together with correcting the heat loss problem that created the ice dam(s) or the damage will occur again . <h> Preventing ice dams in new homes <p> The proper new construction practices to prevent ice dams begin with following or exceeding the state code requirements for ceiling/roof insulation levels . <p> The second absolutely necessary practice is to construct a continuous , 100% effective air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air leakage from the house into the attic space ! <p> Recessed lights , skylights , complicated roof designs , and heating ducts in the attic will all increase the risk of ice dam formation . <h> Mold , mildew , and air quality <p> Moisture entering the home from ice dams can lead to the growth of mold and mildew .

And indeed this is what was seen when the APETALA2/AGAMOUS double mutant was developed . The first whorl develops as a leaf and the second whorl has stamen-like petals .

Specifically , <p> then the gene frequencies will not change over time and the frequencies in the next generation will be p2 for the AA genotype , 2pq for the Aa genotype and q2 for the aa genotype . <p> Let 's examine the assumptions and conclusions in more detail starting first with the assumptions . <p> Infinitely large population - No such population actually exists , but does this necessarily negate the Hardy-Weinberg Law ? NO ! ! The effect that is of concern is genetic drift . Genetic drift is a change in gene frequency that is the result of chance deviation from expected genotypic frequencies .

If a significant deviation from this expected value occurred , then random mating did not happen in this population . If significant deviations occurred in the other matings ( for example MM x MN or MN x NN ) , again the assumption of random mating will have been violated . <p> In humans , at least , for many traits such as blood type , random mating will occur .

@@13708146 @2308146/ <p> Auxin is the first and most studied plant growth hormone in horticultural study . For the professor or student of a plant science , auxin is a readily accepted term that can be placed to many biological plant functions . What about the home gardener ? Does the hobbyist at home know what auxin is ? By understanding the science behind the art , home gardeners can generate a positive impact on their home landscapes . This article is designed to simplify the science so the hobbyist can apply it to his/her well being . <p> There are 4 basic questions that must be asked about auxin . They are : <p> 1 . What is auxin ? 2 . What are the major functions of auxin ? 3 . What are the effects of auxin on plants ? 4 . What is its applications ? <p> The following sections break down these questions so that this valuable plant growth hormone can be better understood . <p> 1 . What is auxin ? <p> Answer : Auxin is a plant growth hormone that can be created chemically or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural hormone is represented by the symbol IAA , standing for indoleacetic acid . Chemically generated versions of this hormone are NAA ( naphthalene acetic acid ) and IBA ( indolebutynic acid ) . The NAA and IBA synthetic hormones can be purchased at any local greenhouse in your area . <p> 2 . What are the major functions ? <p> Answer : Auxin promotes cell growth and elongation of the plant . In the elongation process , auxin alters the plant wall plasticity making it easier for the plant to grow upwards . Auxin also influences rooting formations . By applying NAA or IBA to a plant cutting from a parent plant , rooting takes less time for the new plant greatly increasing its chance of survival . <p> 3 . What are the effects ? Answer : Auxin is responsible for apical dominance and phototropism . Apical dominance means that a plant has the tendency to grow quickly up the central shaft without properly filling in the plant with smaller limbs and leaves . Phototropism is a process by which auxin on the exterior of a plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Have you ever seen a sunflower follow the sun across the sky ? That movement is caused by phototropism . This process does not have detrimental effects to a plant . <p> 4 . What are the applications ? <p> Answer : Applications can include pruning and root formations of new plants . If you want a " full " appearance to your plant , pruning greatly enhances your chances . Pruning is the process of cutting the central shaft at its top causing a plant reaction to grow more branches , hence filling in the look of your plant---more branches mean more leaves and so on . If you would like an exact replica of a current plant in your garden , cutting a piece of the original plant for growth is made much easier when treating with the synthetic version of auxin , IBA . Dip the " ground " end of your cutting in IBA powder and then place the plant in a rich nutrient soil . You 'll see noticeable rooting formations within two weeks .

@@13708151 @2308151/ <p> The cloning that has been described here will work for any random piece of DNA . But since the goal of many cloning experiments is to obtain a sequence of DNA that directs the production of a specific protein , any procedure that optimizes cloning will be beneficial . One such technique is cDNA cloning . The principle behind this technique is that an mRNA population isolated from a specific developmental stage should contain mRNAs specific for any protein expressed during that stage . Thus , if the mRNA can be isolated , the gene can be studied . mRNA can not be cloned directly , but a DNA a copy of the mRNA can be cloned . ( In this regard , the term cDNA is short for " copy DNA " . ) This conversion is accomplished by the action of reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase . The reverse transcriptase makes a single-stranded DNA copy of the mRNA . The second DNA strand is generated by DNA polymerase and the double- stranded product is introduced into an appropriate plasmid or lambda vector .

@@13708154 @2308154/ <p> There are many popular methods used to propagate turfgrass varieties such methods as : seeding , sodding , hydromulching , sprigging , stolonizing , and plugging . <p> Seed propagation <p> Seed propagation is the most common method of growing turf for many reasons . The primary reason establishing turf by seed is popular is because of its low cost , it is considerably cheaper than any other method of establishment . Seed is also available in endless species , varieties , and cultivars , and can be suited to fit any site . <p> The biggest drawback of seed establishment is the time , and labor involved with the initial establishment . A considerable amount of time is spent preparing a site to be seeded , grading , drainage , etc . A lot of time is also spent establishing the seed , things like constant watering , fertilizer , and filling in bare spots are just a few . <p> Sod Establishment <p> Laying sod is the quickest and easiest method of establishing a lawn . The biggest advantage to sod is the instant gratification associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Site preparation still has to be done , to ensure a smooth , even lawn . Regular watering must also be done , just like in seeding , but the labor time is substantially reduced . <p> The biggest drawback to sod is the high price . Buying and installation of sod can cost five to seven times as much as seeding would . So the advantage and disadvantage must be weighed to decide if the extra cost is worth it . <p> Hydromuclching <p> Hydromulching or hydroseeding , as it is also commonly know , is a relatively new way to establish a lawn . It is very similar to seeding , except the seed is sprayed on with water and a paper mulch material , which will help reduce erosion , and protect the seed until germination . The cost of this process will fall somewhere in between the cost of sod and the cost of seeding . <p> Sprigging <p> Sprigging is a form of vegetative propagation that is commonly used in place of seeding , for those grass varieties that produce poor quality seed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with warm season grasses like zoysiagrass and hybrid bermudagrasses , which are stoloniferous . Sprigging is actually pieces of rhizomes or stolons , cut into small pieces that have at least two nodes on them .

@@13708156 @2308156/ <h> Human-Rodent Somatic Cell Hybrids - Mapping Human Chromosomes <p> Somatic cell hybrids are culture lines that contain the entire complement of the mouse genome and a few human chromosomes . These culture lines are developed by mixing human and mouse cells in the presence of the Sendai virus . The virus facilitates the fusing of the two cell types to form a hybrid cell . For a reason that is not entirely known , most , but not all , human chromosomes are lost from the hybrid cell lines . Usually a few human chromosomes are retained . Because the human and mouse chromosomes can be distinguished by chromosome staining techniques , it can be determined which human cells are retained with a specific cell line . Typically , the mouse cell line is mutant for a specific function . Because the hybrids are selected on cells in which the mutant cells could not grow , any surviving hybrid lines would contain the human chromosome that complements ( or rescues ) the mouse mutation and several other human chromosomes . <p> Once a complement of hybrid cell lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific chromosome .

This includes enzymes as well as human cell surface proteins that can be screened in some biochemical manner . <p> Two extensions of the technique allow for finer analysis of the linkage between genes . Individual human chromosomes can be selected by a technique called flourescence-activated chromosome sorting . The single chromosome can then be added to a mouse cell line , and either the whole chromosome is taken up intact or fragments of the chromosome become integrated into the mouse chromosome . Alternatively , a human cell line can be irradiated with X-rays before fusion . Most often the fragments become incorporated into the mouse chromosome , although a fragment may be maintained as its own partial chromosome . These lines are called radiation hybrids . <p> As with the cell lines described above which contained a series of chromosomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only chromosomal locations , but linkages as well . If two markers are continually found on the same fragment of chromosome , then it can be determined that the markers themselves are linked . To determine order , though , a large number of different cell lines must be developed . Each of the cell lines would contain either a different complement of human chromosomes , or different fragments of the same chromosome . By analyzing a large number of these lines , marker orders can be determined for all the chromosomes . For radiation hybrids , though , DNA markers are almost exclusively used for developing maps .

This fate that Watson is talking about is contained in our genes , and deals with a new technique , gene therapy . Gene therapy is revolutionizing the world of medicine . Many physicians are predicting that in twenty years gene therapy may change the practice of medicine from a treatment-based to a prevention-based practice . Our future is l ocked away inside of our genes . Gene therapy is unlocking these doors . Researchers are starting to move away from developing new drugs , and towards finding an ultimate solution . That solution is to use gene therapy as a treatment for many genetic diseas es . Researchers hope that in the coming years , every genetic disease will have gene therapy as its treatment . Gene therapy could be the last therapy that the human race will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what is this mystical new wonder called gene therapy ? Gene therapy is the introduction of genes into existing cells to prevent or cure a wide range of diseases . For example , suppose a brain tumor is forming by rapidly dividing cancer cells . The reason this tumor is forming is due to some defective or mutated gene . The therapy chosen for this case would be to use a herpes virus that has had its virulence removed , rendering it harmless . The virus is still abl e to insert its genetic material into the target cells . The virus is then taken and injected into mouse cells , where it makes additional copies of itself . These mouse cells , now containing the virus , are then injected into the brain containing the tumor . Once inside the brain , the virus seeks out the target tumor cells and invades them . The tumor will now start to produce herpes enzymes because the virus has inserted its genetic material into the tumor cells . Now a physician can treat the patient wit h a herpes curing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse cells that are producing the herpes enzyme . The other target of some of the various retroviruses used include : bone marrow , skin , and liver cells . Genetic alteration of bone marrow cells aims to correct the mutated part of the cell or its progeny . Skin cells work in a different manner . Geneticists found that these cells synthesize and secrete proteins , but these are then transported through the blood to be utilized by other cells . Researchers are trying to use skin cells to synthesize an enzyme that it does not normally make . They then hope that it will take that enzyme to some other cell . That cell may not be able to make that enzyme , but the skin cell transports an ess ential enzyme that will help that new cell function properly . Research with liver cells is still in the beginning stages . <h> Examples of Gene therapy <p> This new therapy appears to work quite well in the lab setting , or theoretically in some scientist 's mind , but it still had not been proven in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment wa s a 4 year old girl with severe immune-deficiency disease . This disease is caused by a faulty gene that fails to produce a vital enzyme . In the therapy procedure , they extracted some of the girl 's white blood cells . Then , they exposed them to a geneti cally engineered virus that had lost its virulence but still carried normal versions of the gene that was not functioning correctly in the girl . The virus invaded the white blood cells , and then these cells were transfused back into the girl . Once back i nside the girl 's bloodstream , the cells began producing the proper enzyme . Although the girl still needs follow-up treatments , she now leads a relatively normal life following the gene therapy . This is one of the success stories of gene therapy . <h> Some Technological Problems <p> With the success of this first gene therapy treatment , the public 's expectations began to rise . They assumed that permanent cures would be achieved for many diseases . The problem with this over assumption is t hat along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main problem that geneticists are encountering is the viruses may target the wrong cells . These viruses often do not seek out the target cells , and sometimes they insert t hemselves into the wrong place in the DNA . The area that the virus targets may trigger uncontrollable growth . This may lead to the development of a tumor , or a preexisting tumor may become larger due to either a mutated virus or insertion in the wrong p lace . This would be a huge disadvantage if the virus was inserted into a cancer cell , and instead of inserting its DNA into the cell , it causes uncontrollable growth of the tumor . They have also found that even if the virus invades the target cell and i nserts the new gene , sometimes that new gene fails to express itself . For example , a virus used in cystic fibrosis produced an inflammatory response . These is an example of the virus not producing the desired response . The trials with that virus had to than be halted , and other virus vectors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is delivering the viruses into bone-marrow stem cells . These cells divide infrequently , and the viruses used in gene therapy only insert genes in to cells that are dividing . Despite some of these technological obstacles , researchers are still very optimistic for the future of gene therapy . In order for gene therapy treatment to succeed , scientists must be willing and able to overcome the many tec hnological obstacles and hurdles that they are encountering in their research . <h> Encountering Problems in Research <p> The other problem that researchers are encountering is in the research itself . Many skeptics say that not enough is known about this procedure , and so it should be confined to lab animals until more is k nown . The researchers do not believe in this because human patients are vital to their research . The researchers need the public to understand that this technique is a new idea , and it will take time to work out all the details . The potential of the th erapy appears to be limitless if the researchers are allowed to perform their lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gene therapy is find a gene that is not functioning right and to insert a healthy portion into that gene . To find these genes , scientists must perform genetic tests or genetic screening to see i f the gene that causes for example , cystic fibrosis , is present . This genetic testing is producing much controversy and raising many ethical and legal problems . Many believe that this is an invasion of privacy . They believe that if prenatal tests are performed that these could lead to an increase in the number of abortions . Many people that hear a positive test for a disease are now are faced with a dilemma . That dilemma is in finding adequate insurance to cover the treatments , which could be gene t herapy , or living out their lives knowing that they carry a gene for a disease . This positive test has placed them in a high risk group that they may have not been in if they had not been tested . This high risk tag makes insurance coverage almost imposs ible to find .

Many young couples may find out that they are carriers of a disease , and now must decide if they want to have a child that could be born with a genetic disease . Still another problem is regulation of the uses of gene therapy . Our society is obsessed with the idea of youth and beauty . If scientists could ide ntify the gene that contributes to youth or beauty , then the technique of gene therapy could be monopolized by the cosmetic industry to enhance beauty or to " turn back the clock . " The problem with this is whether baldness , height , or beauty should be eno ugh of a reason to require gene therapy .

I bel ieve the reason that these people are opposed to gene therapy is because they see it as something foreign and scary . The reason people are scared is because they do not understand the technique . I think if scientists educate our society , many people wou ld change their minds . I believe that if the people that oppose this technique were ever faced with cancer or a child born with a genetic disease , they would change their views .

She is one of the success stories of this disease that has a very short life expectancy . She will be celebrating her 26th birthday in the coming months ! She has had a very tough life . She is continually trying new drugs and treatments . Now , scientists have discovered the gene that causes cystic fibrosis .

@@13708175 @2308175/ <p> The Red River Valley is the youngest major landscape in the contiguous United States . <p> While most geologic landscapes have their histories measured in millions or tens of millions of years , that of Fargo is measured in only a few thousands of years . <p> Yellow arrows point to scratches formed by icebergs which grounded on the lake bed of Lake Agassiz . Such features are especially common in the northern Red River Valley . The photo was taken during a U2 spy plane flight over the Fargo-Moorhead region . ( Undated photo ) . <p> ( Click on image for enlargement ) . <p> The Red River Valley represents the bottom or floor of what was a massive , ice-dammed lake : Glacial Lake Agassiz . The lake began to develop as ice from the last ice age melted back northward from our region , about 12,000 years ago . Lake waters finally drained completely away from the Fargo area about 9,300 years ago . Thus , the Red River of the North ( as we know of it today ) could not begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and land was finally exposed . <p> " The Red River Valley " therefore is an unfortunate misnomer for this landscape . It is not a valley in the sense that it was formed by a river . Instead , the origins of this flat plain lie as the floor of what was an enormous glacial lake . <p> The actual " valley " of the Red River is only a few hundred feet wide at Fargo . Because of the low gradient of the Red and the young age of the river , the " valley " is not fully mature . During times of major flood , the " valley " quickly fills , and floodwaters spill out onto the lake plain . Hence , major floods in the Red River Valley tend to be wide but shallow . <p> Construction of " heavy " structures , such as the Fargo Water Treatment Plant , require special engineering to support the structures on top of the weak clays that underlie Fargo . Here , caissons are being emplaced to depths &gt;100 feet , so as to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for this facility . ( 1994 photo ) . <p> ( Click on image for enlargement ) . <p> Underlying Fargo are about 30 m of sediments whose engineering characteristics are extremely weak . They are dominantly clays , derived as meltwater rivers dispersed fine-grained sediments into Lake Agassiz . Most of these clays have their origins as churned-up shales , originally of Cretaceous age . The clays have expansive properties : they can absorb vast amounts of water and then give up that water during drought . As the clays absorb water , they expand and become weak and plastic . As they release water , they contract and become hard and brittle . <p> These expansive properties make it difficult to engineer and protect permanent structures in the Valley . Street surfaces , sidewalks , water lines , etc. , rise and fall with the water content of the clays . Because the strength of these clays is generally low , heavier structures in Fargo must first have considerable foundation support , requiring piers ( caissons ) or pilings that pass entirely through the package of Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath . <p> Rivers that flow northward are actually not particularly rare ( there are many in the United States ) . But the Red River of the North is one of the few drainages in the contiguous 48-states whose waters ultimately drain into the Arctic Watershed . Waters of the Red flow northward into Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba . There , they mix with waters of the Saskatchewan River , whose headwaters lie in the Canadian Rockies . Lake Winnipeg , itself , is drained by the Nelson River , which flows northeastward into Hudson Bay at York Factory , Manitoba . <p> In perhaps a more romantic view of the Red River , its waters therefore mix with those draining glacial ice fields of such places as Banff National Park and Jasper National Park . These waters together drain northeastward , ultimately to be lapped by the tongues of polar bears or to serve as an area for beluga whales to dive and play . <p> Prior to the Pleistocene ice ages , a pre-glacial version of the Red River likewise flowed northward . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of eastern North Dakota , northeastern and north-central South Dakota , and northwestern Minnesota . The landscape over which this river flowed would have been fantastic to see : the river itself flowing across granitic basement rock of the Canadian Shield . To the west would have been buttes and mesas of Cretaceous-aged shales and sandstones . Springs leaking from some of these sandstones would have been highly salty . <p> Much of that pre-glacial topography is still " there , " but buried underneath several hundred feet of glacial drift and glacial lake sediments . The landscape therefore that we see around Fargo today is one whose origins are tied to the last events of the last ice age . 
@@13708176 @2308176/ <p> A classic example of alternate splicing is the rat muscle protein , troponin T. The gene consists of five exons , each representing a domain of a final protein . These exons are each separated by an intron . The five exons are W , X , Alpha , Beta , and Z. Two types of protein are found . The alpha form consists of exons W , X , alpha and Z. The beta form consists of the W , X , Beta and Z exons . The two different types of the protein are produced by alternative splicing of the same gene . The two different gene products are produced by selective splicing such that introns three and four and the fourth exon are spliced as one unit . In some manner the 5 ' GT sequence of intron 3 and the 3 ' AG sequence of the fourth intron are used during the splcing event . <p> The plant example of alternate is for the gene encoding the enzyme RUBISCO activate . RUBISCO activase is a soluble , nuclear-encoded chloroplast enzyme . This abundant protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinach . Two molecular forms of the protein are recognized . In spinach , the proteins are 41 kd and 45 kd polypedtides , and the proteins are 44 kd and 47 kd polypeptides in Arabidopsis . The monocot corn is different and has only one protein . This enzyme is required to activate the enzymatic activity of RUBISCO , the first step in the conversion of the electromagnetic energy collected during the light reaction of photosynthesis in chemical energy in the forms of sugars . <p> The RUBISCO activase gene has been cloned. cDNA clones had been isolated previously and revealed two nucleotide binding sites . When the cDNA was expressed in E. coli only one polypeptide was detected . Antibodies from each of the 41 and 45 kd strongly crossed reacted with each other suggesting a high degree of homology between the proteins . Furthermore genomic southerns with the cDNAs showed that both spinach and Arabidopis had a single gene . How can this be explained ? <p> Additional cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced for both spinach and Arabadopsis . The following table describes the differences between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sequence Comparison <p> Internal Sequences <p> Spinach <p> Identical <p> 22-bp insertion ; introduced a new stop codon <p> Arabadopsis <p> Identical <p> 11-bp insertion at same location ; introduced a new stop <p> Genomic clones were then isolated for each of the two species and sequenced . The sequence data revealed that each of the genes contained seven exons and six introns . Comparison of the sequences of the genomic and cDNA clones of spinach revealed the following manner in which the two different types of cDNAs could be generated . The full length mRNA that gave rise to the larger protein was generated by splicing at the terminal-most 5 ' and 3 ' splicing sites . 22-bp into intron 6 is another 5 ' splice junction sequence . Alternate splicing occurs at this site to generate the mRNAs that are translated into the shorter proteins . This 22-bp sequence can be considered an extension of exon 6 and is called an auxon for alternative exon . Alternative splicing events can form different mRNAs from a single primary transcript . Thus an exon can actually be represented as an intron in another transcript . 
@@13708183 @2308183/ <p> In Handbook to Literature , Eighth Edition , ed . William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman , the stream of consciousness novel is defined as a novel that takes as its subject " the flow of the stream of consciousness of one or more of its characters . " It uses various techniques and is related to developments of the psychological novel prior to Woolf and Joyce 's time . I will provide my own " take " on the stream-of-consciousness technique here . <p> Its forerunner was the psychological novel as exemplified by Marcel Proust 's Remembrance of Things Past , which had an enormous influence on many such novelists . Another forerunner was Henry James , who created what he called a " central consciousness " or a governing intelligence , a character that he would stay with throughout a story or novel and whose mind we would thus be limited to in our perception of the action of the novel . The subject of these novels often was precisely the inner thoughts and emotions of the character rather than any external events . Long passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind , such as in the famous fireside scene in James 's Portrait of A Lady wherein Isabel must consider her choices . The term " stream of consciousness " was first used by William James , Henry 's brother , the founder of pragmatism . He did not use it to describe novels but the workings of the mind . <p> This shift in emphasis to the inner lives of characters during the late Victorian period and in the modern period has often been said to be related to a growing shift away from a belief in an independent , absolutely verifiable external reality . The breakdown of religious faith after Darwin and in certain forms of scientific certainty after Heisenberg , Einstein , et al . also paralleled these gradual shifts of emphasis in the arts . A loss of confidence in absolutes , in political authority , scientific authority , religious authority , or indeed even the authority of a unified subject or identity ( with the rise of psychology during the 1920s ) all can be related to some extent to the shifting practices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few novels used interior monologue or the free indirect style in their rendition of a central character 's perceptions of the world and inner thoughts in response . <p> The difference in stream-of-consciousness is that the attempt here is to render the thoughts " as they fall " upon the mind ( see Woolf 's " Modern Fiction " ) . These thoughts as they fall , in random , free , unstructured , chaotic , and even inchoate or nonverbal form--these are the purest fragments or moments of sensation and being . The novelist using stream-of-consciousness seeks to create the illusion that we are overhearing the flood of sensations and uncensored , pre-rational thoughts within a character 's mind before the character has ordered them into any coherent form or shape . Thus the novelist will dispense with grammar , with logic , with neat , orderly sentences and predictable pauses . Joyce let 's Molly Bloom run on for one extended sentence of 64 pages in Ulysses . Woolf refers to this aspect of stream of consciousness when she talks to the reader in " Character and Fiction " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life this past week you have had far stranger and more interesting experiences than the one I have tried to describe . You have overheard scraps of talk that filled you with amazement . You have gone to bed at night bewildered by the complexity of your feelings . In one day thousands of ideas have coursed through your brains ; thousands of emotions have met , collided , and disappeared in astonishing disorder . " I say " illusion " because the novelist of course does shape this collection of thoughts into the appearance of shapelessness . Woolf in her novels tries to suggest this flood of the daily internal experiences of any ordinary person , an experience wherein " thousands of ideas have coursed through your brains ; thousands of emotions have met , collided , and disappeared in astonishing disorder . " Stream of consciousness is the rendition of the astonishing disorder of our minds . I would argue that perception itself becomes the focus of these novels . See also Woolf 's essay " Modern Fiction " which we discussed in class . <p> Other novelists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early innovators in the development of stream-of-consciousness narrative : Dorothy Richardson , William Faulkner ; Thomas Wolfe .

So if you start out with a 4-inch photo at 72 ppi in InDesign and scale it up to an 8-inch photo , what are you going to get ? A " grainy " picture , that is , jagged edges of the pixels showing . Sort of like a jar of beans : you can pour them into a bigger jar , but you only have so many beans . <p> This means that you are constrained by the original scan or original digital photo . If the original scan was big , say 8 by 10 inches at 1,000 ppi , well , you have oodles of pixels to work with--but also a huge , multi-megabite file . If you scan a 35 mm slide at 72 ppi , you have much fewer pixels to work with .

The limitation of this vector is the size of DNA that can be introduced into the cell by transformation .

A genomic library contains all of the DNA found in the cell of the plant ( or any organism ) . If you digest plant DNA to completion with a restriction enzyme , ligate those fragments into a plasmid vector and transform bacterial cells , only a portion of those fragments will be represented in the final transformation products . If a gene of interest is located on a large fragment then you will not be able to isolate that gene from a plasmid library .

@@13708196 @2308196/ <p> The amount of orchid hybrids has grown tremendously.There are thousands of orchids found in all parts of the world.It can be very intimidating for a person to take on the challenge of trying to grow an orchid in there home.Phalaenopsis , Cymabidiums , Dendrobium and Cattleya are just a few types of orchids that work well in a home environment.With the right environment and the small amount of care they need , orchids really are not that hard to grow.Hopefully after reading this paper you will be able to share your admired orchid with a friend or two . <p> Orchids have two growth patterns , monopodial and sympodial.Knowing whether your orchid is a monopodial or a sympodial is important because it will help you pot and grow is successfully.It also helps tremendously when it is time to propagate your orchid.Monopodial orchids grow vertically and sympodial orchids grow horizontally.Orchids can be propagated sexually and asexually.I am going to explain to you the easiest and most popular way to propagate an orchid.Division is an asexual method ; therefore you are basically multiplying the mother plant and know exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more actively growing pieces of an orchid.This is usually done at repotting time , when your plant has completely outgrown its pot.Some other signs that you need to divide your plant are ; the center of the plant may have died out or your sympodial orchid has grown in a too long of a line.Your goals when you are propagating orchids are:to get as many new plants possible , improve its appearance and stimulate more promising growth . <p> DIVISION OF SYMPODIALS : When dividing a sympodialorchid , you need to cut it into sections by slicing through the rhizome using a sterile knife.You must be sure to leave at least three leafy growths on each section.If you can leave more , maybe four or five that would be better.Most likely you will be dividing your orchid at the same time as you are repotting it , either to develop new plants or improve its appearance.If you are repotting your orchid to improve its appearance , you can remove and discard any shriveled or dormant pseudobulbs , dead or damaged roots and preserve only the healthy ones.But if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should not throw away the dormant pseudobulbs.They can be made into new plants.Just pull way any dead leaves and skin and plant them in moist sphagmoss with the dormant buds facing up and stored in a warm area.When it starts to sprout , you can slowly bring the plant to its natural climate.It is a slower process , taking anywhere from 3 to 5 years , but well worth it.Once you have your orchid in sections you may repot them.There are many types of medium that work well with orchids , such as bark , mosses , perlite cork and so on.You just need to tailor a mixture to you orchids needs.Since sympodial orchids grow in a line fashion , you need to repot them so that the active end is a bit farther away from the pot . <p> DIVIDION OF MONOPODIALS:Monopodials can be propagated in a few different ways compared to the sympodials and you decide which method to use depending on the plants growth situation and your reason for propagating.As a monopodial orchid gets older is will tend to get too tall and leggy.The bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve this problem is to cut off the top portion , directly below a node with well-developed roots.Next plant the upper part of the plant in new medium.Then take the lower portion of the plant and return it to its original home.This may seem odd since there are no leaves , but eventually there will be new growth above the cut and can then be removed and planted.It may even sprout new growth at the base , and if that is the case you can just cut off the old growth.One other way of propagating monopodials is when the aerial roots of the orchid are no longer healthy or have rotted off.First you must get your roots back.To do this you must cover the bare stem with moist sphagnum moss and enclose the moss portion in plastic.After some time , roots will begin to form.The next step is to cut the stem directly beneath the air layer and repot as necessary . <p> As you can see propagating by division is very simple and effective.But there are a few guidelines to follow regardless if you are working with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave you with a list of dos and donts , and with you the best of luck in sharing a beautifully grown orchid . <p> DO NT : <p> 1 ) Do n't  divide or repot an actively growing orchid . <p> 2 ) Do n't  use tools until they have been sterilized . <p> 3 ) Do n't  overcrowd your orchids . <p> 4 ) Do n't  bring home an orchid unless you have an ideal home for it . <p> DO : <p> 1 ) Do keep record of your orchids repotting and propagation history . <p> 2 ) Do repot your orchid in a pot size bigger than its original home . <p> 3 ) Do divide your orchid just before a new growing season . <p> 4 ) Do enjoy your beautiful orchid and take pride in the fact that you grew it .

@@13708199 @2308199/ <p> Plant breeders have recognized for many years that the progeny from a specific cross can out yield either of the two parents used in the cross . This is called heterosis , the phenomenon were the phenotypic value of the heterozygote is greater than either of the two parents . For plant breeding , the observation of heterosis for yield has lead to the development of inbred lines that exhibit a heterotic yield advantage . <p> Corn was the first crop species in which heterosis was exploited . The original approach to develop hybrid corn seed required the manual detasseling of the female parent to prevent self-pollination . The field would be planted with the two lines and high school students would walk the field and detassel the female parent . As you can imagine this was a labor intensive proposition . <p> Because it was realized that manual detasseling of corn plants would not be required if male sterile system could be developed , attempts were made to apply the two types of male sterility systems , genic and cyotplasmic male sterility . Genic male sterility is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genetic systems , though , was that a portion of the F2 were male fertile , and thus a portion of the seed that was developed was not hybrid . <p> The ultimate solution to this problem was the use of cytoplasmic male sterility ( cms ) . As the name suggests , this type of cytoplasmic male sterility is controlled by a cytoplasmic factor and is maternally inherited . ( Current molecular research suggests , but has not conclusively proven , that the sterility is a mitochondrial encoded function . ) Thus all the males that contain the appropriate cytoplasm would be sterile . <p> But this is only part of the solution for hybrid seed production . The seed company sells hybrid seed to the farmer , and the farmer expects this seed to be fertile . If the hybrid seed sold to the farmer was sterile , the seed company would have to provide a pollinator source to be planted along with with the hybrid seed to obtain the seed . The need for this step though is alleviated by the use of restorer of fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ override the cytoplasmic male sterility factors . Thus plants that have the cms cytoplasm contain a dominant Rf allele will be male fertile . <p> Taking the above discussion into consideration , the following is a procedure to produce hybrid corn seed without manual detasseling . A line that contains that contains a male sterile cytoplasm and is recessive for the restorer of fertility alleles ( rfrf ) is the female parent in a cross with a male that has male sterile cytoplasm and is heterozygous for the restorer of fertility alleles ( Rfrf ) . The F1 progeny from this cross will exhibit the heterotic effects for yield . Furthermore , all the plants will be cytoplasmically male sterile because they contain the cms cytoplasm . <p> The plants will also segregate 1 Rfrf : 1 rfrf . Those that are recessive for the restorer factor will still produce seed because the other heterozygous Rfrf plants will produce ample pollen to pollinate those plant Thus , the farmer will realize the advantages of hybrid seed , and the seed company will not have to use resoruces for manual detasseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system is functional , some difficulties have arisen with it practical application . In corn breeding , the cytoplasm that was used initially to provide the male sterility was the Texas or T cytoplasm . Nearly all of the hybrid corn grown until 1970 contained this cytoplasm . During that year a fungal disease ( Southern corn leaf blight ) appeared that preferentially attacked plants with the T cytoplasm . <p> This is an example of genetic vulnerability . This term refers to the genetic condition were all of the individuals in a region have the same genotype that makes them all vulnerable to a single disease or pathogen that could destroy the whole population . Thus , all of the hybrid corn was at great risk the following year . <p> Fortunately , USDA scientists recognized the upcoming problem , and seed stocks were developed that contained other cytoplasms . These seed stocks had to be manually detasseled , and its hybrid performance was not as good as the previous material , but it did provide a source of seed that was resistant to the disease and saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year .

@@13708214 @2308214/ <p> A lot of people are talking about convergence media nowadays . Instructors say they have to teach convergence media to the next generation . Critics say convergence media will mean the end of traditional newspapers , for sure , and probably television news as we know it . <p> We are expecting a lot to come from convergence media . <h> But what is convergence media , exactly ? <p> If you write a blog and throw it up on the web , is that convergence media ? <p> What about putting your newspaper 's content , that is , its articles and photographs on a web site ? <h> Is that convergence ? <p> Well , maybe , but not exactly . First , we have to recognize that convergence in the media business can happen in a lot of ways . For example : <h> Ownership convergence . <p> This means one company owns television , print , and on-line platforms . People who prepare content for these share their stuff , so that you can have fewer people working , costing the company less money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of sharing what you 've collected for news does not necessarily have to occur within companies owned by one corporation . <h> Tactical convergence . <p> In this case , media operations such as , say , a newspaper and a television station set up a partnership to cover news , even though they still are owned by different companies . <p> But within one company convergence might also exist , called <h> Structural convergence . <p> You set up a newsroom that is not focused on a particular product , such as a newspaper . Instead you have teams of content preparers repackage the product for different platforms . For example , material might be packaged for the web , but then rewritten for television , either as a partner , or video on the web . Television material might be remade for a newspaper . Newspaper reporters might have conversations with television anchors from the site of a news event . This means that a journalist does not work for a particular platform , per se--such as television or newspaper . <p> But if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expectation that they can prepare media content in several formats , called <h> Information gathering convergence . <p> In this case , reporters are expected to have several kinds of skills . They can write , take pictures , record audio or video , prepare material for broadcast , print or web . <p> Reporters who can successfully report for all forms of media are sometimes housed under the umbrella of " backpack journalism . " Is this possible ? Can good writers also be good photographers ? Many media operations have found that this kind of skilled person is not very common . Journalism operations that have tried to use an individual to do several things often find the quality level is not very high . <h> Storytelling convergence . <p> Journalists are trained to tell stories . How they tell that story , that is , how news is manufactured from the millions of events going on in the world , is fairly well established based on news values . But convergence journalism opportunities have led some journalists to look at new ways to tell stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a story put up on the web . Because one of the great strengths of the web is that it offers a way to present information in a non-linear manner . <p> In the real world , we learn in a non-linear way . Walk along the street and you pull sights , sounds , smells , and feelings everywhere from your environment . <p> But in the abstract world of mediated communication , we traditionally have gained knowledge in a linear way . That is , from beginning to end , like a book . Newscasts also present information in a linear way . We do n't have the opportunity to learn more about topics we are particularly curious about , by choosing our own route . The writer sets the route for us . <h> The web frees us from this route . We can learn in a non-linear way through links . We choose links in text as we wish to take our knowledge acquisition in the way we want it to go , not necessarily in a straight line . <p> Part of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation . Part of the power lies in its ability to converge all the newsgathering formats into one--video , audio , words , pictures , links . Part of the power is its instant access--as long as you have a computer , of course . And part of its power is that , at least for now , access is generally free . <h> What is the future of journalism , given these trends ? <p> I suspect a newsroom of the future will not be geared to any particular platform . That is , you wo n't have a newspaper office , or television newsroom as such , or even a web newsroom . Content preparation will be repackaged for a variety of media . <p> I also suspect that you 'll never see many super-reporters , backpack journalists who can do it all , in any medium . Probably reporters will be asked to take some quick photos or videotape for breaking news stories , but more substantial news stories will be prepared by teams . <p> I think we 'll see some disintegration of traditional news values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interpretation in news than we did a few decades ago--the straight objective news story without interpretation is n't really very often seen anymore . And we 'll see a lot more opinions in the news media . It seems to me people are much more interested in blogs , that is , people 's opinions , than they used to be , and so that will become a big part of news media . And we 'll see contributions made by all kinds of people , not only those trained as professional journalists . To assess the credibility of these contributors , of course , will be up to readers and viewers . <p> There 's nothing new in this . Opinions were not only a big part of news media in the old days , they were the news media . The idea of objective news is a phenomenon of the last century . And sometimes what we consider progress actually moves in big loops , as we reinvent ideas of previous generations . <p> Those who believe news should be facts and only facts will disdain these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more austere version of news will still be there--in newspapers . <h> Will newspapers die out ? <p> Right now circulations are falling at about 5 percent a year , so it 's looking that way . But I think they will stabilize . Newspapers will return to what they were a hundred and fifty years ago--serious , word-oriented presentations for an elite of educated people willing to pay for news packaged in this way . Frankly , if newspapers were going to become extinct , they would already have done so . Technology can be ruthless . Film-based photography was around nearly 175 years . Today it 's becoming extinct , and that happened in half the time the web has been around . Newspapers are still ubiquitous . <p> The web is now a good 13 years old .

@@13708215 @2308215/ <p> Barbara McClintock was the first scientist to predict that transposable elements , mobile pieces of the genetic material ( DNA ) , were present in eukaryotic genomes . She performed her work on corn and specifically followed seed color phenotypes . Before we discuss her experiments , it is necessary to describe the morphology of the corn seed and the parental source of the genes which control its phenotype <p> . McClintock discovered transposable elements by analyzing genetic stocks of corn that were phenotypically unstable . In particular , she was analyzing genes that control the color of the aleurone layer of the endosperm . Remember that this tissue is triploid ( 3n ) . The genes that she was following were located on the short arm of chromosome 9 of corn and were involved in the development of the color of the seed . The genetic map of this region and the allelic designations follow . <p> C Bz Ds <p> CI = dominant allele that prevents color from being expressed in the aleurone layerC = recessive allele that leads to color development in the aleurone layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( without ds , denoted by the dash ) were mated with CICI BzBz dsds males . The aleurone layer of the endosperm would thus have the genotype CICC Bzbzbz --ds . Because of the presence of the inhibitor allele , the aleurone layer was expected to be colorless . For many of the kernels this was the case but a few kernels had dark brown colored sectors on an otherwise colorless background . <p> How could this have occurred ? McClintock concluded that in some manner the CI and Bz alleles were lost because chromosome breakage had occurred at the Ds locus . But why the sectoring ? This breakage apparently did not occur during gamete formation , but had occurred after fertilization and during the development of the seed . This breakage and loss of genes occurred in a single cell , but all cells that developed from mitotic division of that cell did not contain the inhibitor gene , so the color expression was controlled by the bz allele in those cells . <p> Female gametes : <p> // C bz <p> Male gametes : <p> CI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of triploid endosperm . Because of the dominant CI allele the endosperm should be colorless without breakage <p> Breakage at ds had been established by McClintock prior to performing these experiments . The designation ds was short for dissociation or a locus were breakage of chromosomes occurred . But after crossing with a number of different genetic stocks , she realized that Ds alone could not induce the breakage . A second factor , Ac , short for activator , was also necessary . ( Thus , some genetic stocks contained Ac whereas other stocks did not contain that locus . ) This system is called a two-element system and historically has been called the Ac/Ds system . <p> Additional genetic stocks were analyzed by McClintock and she determined that in the presence of Ac , Ds could move locations as well as cause breakages . She was able to isolate a corn line where Ds had moved into the normal Bz allele and caused a mutation in that gene . But as was mentioned this only occurred when Ac was present . Furthermore , when this new line was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown to move out of the Bz locus and reversion to the original phenotype was detected . This mutated allele was designated bzm1 . But in the absence of Ac , bzm1 was a stable allele . Another unstable Bz allele was found that contained an Ac insertion and was designated bzm2 . One difference between this allele and bzm1 was its higher rate of transposition and reversion back to the original phenotype <p> . So what conclusions can be drawn from these experiments and observations : <p> Ds requires some factor provided by Ac to move , whereas Ac is independent <p> Because of their relationship , Ac is termed an autonomous element and Ds a non- autonomous element . <p> Because both Ac and Ds can move , they are called transposable genetic elements .

Typically parents with the phenotypic value of interest are selected from a base population . These parents are crossed , and a new population is developed . The following distributions illustrate this point . <p> The selection differential is the difference of the base population mean and the mean of the selected parents .

The following example illustrates how we can predict the response to selection . <p> The base sunflower population has a mean of 100 days to flowering .

Therefore in depth studies have revealed much about what is needed for transcription to begin . <p> The control of transcription is an integrated mechanism involving cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors . Cis-acting sequence usually lies 5 ' of the transcriptional start site . These sequences are the substrate for trans-acting factors .

@@13708233 @2308233/ <h> Yeast Artificial Chromosomes ( YACs ) <p> One goal of molecular genetics is to obtain physical data about the genomic organization of long stretches of DNA . Traditionally , this data has been obtained by a technique called chromosome walking . Walking is performed by subcloning the end of a lamda or cosmid clone and screening a library for other clones that contain similar sequence information . If this new clone overlaps a portion of the original clone , then the length of the DNA of interest is extended by the length of DNA in the second clone that is not found in the original clone . By performing these steps successive times , a long distance map can be obtained . This technique though has difficulties . First , each step is technically slow . Second , if you use lambda or cosmid clones , you might only extend the region of interest by 5-10 kb in each step of the walk . Finally , if any of the clones that are obtained contain repeated sequences , the subclone could lead you to another region of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yeast artificial chromosomes can alleviate some of these problems because of the large ( 100-1000kb ) amount of DNA that can be cloned . First of all , YACs can not speed up each step of the walk because the subcloning and screening steps can only be performed so quickly . But they can solve the other two problems . Because they carry large amounts of DNA , each step can easily extend the region of interest by 50-100 kb and up to as much as 500 kb . Thus a long distance map of the region can be obtained in several steps . Secondly , although repetitive regions may be 10-20 kb in length they are rarely , longer than 50 kb . Thus a YAC with 100kb will contain some region that is single copy which can be used for further steps in the walk . <p> Features of YACs <p> Large DNA ( &gt;100 kb ) is ligated between two arms . Each arm ends with a yeasttelomere so that the product can be stabilized in the yeast cell . Interestingly , larger YACs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large stretches of DNA . <p> One arm contains an autonomous replication sequence ( ARS ) , a centromere ( CEN ) and aselectable marker ( trp1 ) .

This ensures that the cell has received an artificial chromosome with both telomeres ( because of complementation of the two mutants ) and the artificial chromosome contains insert DNA ( because the cell is red ) . 
@@13708234 @2308234/ <p> The rate of corn growth between plant emergence and tassel emergence most significantly affects the total time required for maturity and establishes the date it will be ready for harvest . These stages of growth can range from 45 days to 75 days . This period is shorter for 80-day hybrid corn than 120-day hybrids . The period from silking to physiological maturity is more uniform and averages 50 to 55 days for most hybrid varieties . The silks emerge from the husks about four to eight days after tasseling . Most pollination occurs one to three days after silking . Pollen may be shed for as long as two weeks . Proper soil moisture levels and temperatures are critical at this time for pollination . Cob growth accelerates shortly after pollination . <p> About 10 to 15 days after silking , leaf and stalk growth stops and sugars produced by photosynthesis in the leaves move into the grain where they are converted to starches , proteins , oils , etc . Grain development is very rapid during the next 30 to 35 days . The rate declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days for most common hybrids to reach physiological maturity after they silk .

The grain content increases and the percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cell wall digestibility and the starch content of the grain increases . This stage of maturity is just prior to physiological maturity . The rule then should be to harvest corn silage as close to physiological maturity as possible without allowing the stalk and leaves to lignify therefore reduce the digestibility of the plant material . The whole plant dry matter levels should be greater than 30 percent at this time . <p> HARVESTING CORN SILAGE : <p> The ideal harvesting time is when the corn plant has reached physiological maturity and is in the full dent . The maximum yield of dry matter per acre is achieved at this time . Dry matter yields are reduced about 1 percent for each day harvested prior to physiological maturity . At physiological maturity the whole corn plant will have a dry matter of 32 to 38 percent . The corn kernel contains about 62 to 65 percent dry matter ; ear corn contains about 55 to 60 percent dry matter . At this time the black layer ( Figure 1 ) will be forming at the tip of the kernel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fermentation in the silo and seepage losses will be low . Much of the corn silage is harvested prior to black layer formation due to concerns of frost and traditional needs for silage . To maximize feeding values corn silage should be harvested after early dent . At this time the milk line ( Figure 2 ) should be 1/3 down the kernel . <p> Figure 1 . <p> Milk line formation proceeds down the kernel at the same time as the kernel proceeds through full dent . This line advance down the kernel towards the cob with maturity and dry down . When the hard starch line approaches the cob , the black layer will form . Ideally most corn silage will be harvested from 1/3 milk line to black layer maturity . <p> Figure 2 <p> Milk Line <p> After kernels are dented , a milk line appears across the kernel opposite the embryo side . This line advances down toward the cop with maturity and dry down . When the hard starch line approaches the cob , the black layer will form . <p> Checking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and view kernels on the broken end of the top half ( side opposite to embryo ) . The accumulated starch above the line will be hard with the area below the line soft . Splitting the kernel may help to locate the line . Running a knife toward the dented end will also help locate the line . With experience , the line can be determined with accuracy . <p> Measuring the Progress of the Milk Line <p> To chart the movement of the starch line , you will need a metric ruler . Measure the distance from the dent end of the kernel to the milk line . Also measure the total kernel length . Use these two values to express the position of the milk line ( percent down the kernel ) . Calculate an average of 10 ears ( 1 kernel from each ) . <p> When weather and growing conditions alter the rate of physiological maturity and require the harvesting of immature corn silage , the yield of dry matter per acre decreases and the energy levels of the resulting silage are lowered . Less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher in moisture . Both of these factors alter the fermentation patterns in the silage . The fermentation is slower and seepage losses are generally higher . If corn silage is frosted the nutrient flow to the kernels is slowed ; then is increase after 5 to 7 days . Freeze damaged corn should be harvested and ensiled seven to ten days after the freeze . This will improve the quality of the harvested forage and minimize the field losses from dried leaves and stalk breakage . The quality of silage harvested in this manner will be equal to silage from non-frozen corn harvested at the same physiological maturity . <p> At times silage is harvested at earlier stages to prevent freeze damage or when maturity is late because of cool weather . To prevent excessive seepage losses from corn silage harvested in this manner other feeds may be ensiled with the silage to reduce seepage and improve the fermentation of the silage . Ground alfalfa hay , rolled grain or other feeds are used to reduce the overall moisture levels of the silage . The choice of dry feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producer 's livestock . Use feeds you would normally add to the silage at the time of ration formulation . <p> ANIMAL PERFORMANCE : <p> The overall feeding values , dry matter digestibility and protein digestibility are not greatly affected by corn silage maturity after the plant reaches a maturity equal to a 1/3 milk line in the kernels . This is because as the plant matures the grain content increases and therefore the energy value of the grain and ear are increased , at the same time the digestibility of the stalk and leaves is decreased due to the lignification of these plant parts . <p> The biggest concern to animal performance is the impact of immature high moisture silage on palatability and the resulting feed intake reduction from these silages . Wet silage does not ferment in the silo as well as optimum dry mater silage ( 30 - 35 percent dry matter ) . Wet silage may have a sour smell and taste , therefore reducing palatability . With the exception of poorly fermented corn silage animal performance as measured by daily gain of beef cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much from silages made from corn of differing maturity past the 1/3 milk line . <p> SUMMARY : <p> While corn silage maturity may influence animal performance by affecting feed intake because of palatability , the digestibility of the resulting corn silage is not changed drastically until the corn plant becomes mature past the full dent stage . The greatest concern is the ability of the silage to ferment properly , thus providing highly palatable forage without an abnormal fermentation and a sour tasting and smelling silage . If the dry matter of corn silage is in the optimum range ( 30 - 35 percent dry matter ) the resulting corn silage will be palatable and animal performance will not be influenced . <p> When weather conditions reduce the rate of physiological maturity of corn silage , producers should be aware of the implications of harvesting immature corn and take precautions to ensile the corn at the proper dry matter levels . This can be accomplished by mixing the immature high moisture silage with dry feeds or by letting the silage field dry to the proper moisture levels .

Thus the traveler , arriving , sees two cities : one erect above the lake , and the other reflected , upside down . Nothing exists or happens in the one Valdrada that the other Valdrada does not repeat , because the city was so constructed that its every point would be reflected in its mirror , and the Valdrada down in the water contains not only all the flutings and juttings of the facades that rise above the lake , but also the rooms ' interiors with ceilings and floors , the perspective of the halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants know that each of their actions is , at once , that action and its mirror-image , which possesses the special dignity of images , and this awareness prevents them from succumbing for a single moment to chance and forgetfulness .

The others stay in the kitchen , hiding by preference under pots or in the chimney flue or broom closet : they belong to the house , and when the family that has lived there goes away , they remain with the new tenants ; perhaps they were already there before the house existed , among the weeds of the vacant lot , concealed in a rusty can ; if the house is torn down and a huge block of fifty families is built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the kitchens of that many apartments .

The Lares have seen Penates of the most varied origins and customs pass through their walls ; the Penates have to make a place for themselves , rubbing elbows with Lares of illustrious , but decaying palaces , full of hauteur , or with Lares from tin shacks , susceptible and distrustful . <p> The true essence of Leandra is the subject of endless debate .

The Penates bring out the old people , the great-grandparents , the great-aunts , the family of the past ; the Lares talk about the environment before it was ruined . But this does not mean they live only on memories : they daydream of the careers the children will follow when they grow up ( the Penates ) , or what this house in this neighborhood might become ( the Lares ) if it were in good hands .

It is cold ; all wear shawls over their heads . A shout from the boatman puts a stop to the delays ; the traveler huddles at the prow , moves off looking toward the group of those remaining behind ; from the shore his features can no longer be discerned ; the boat draws up beside a vessel riding at anchor ; on the ladder a diminished form climbs up , vanishes ; the rusted chain is heard being raised , scraping against the hawse pipe . The people remaining behind look over the ramparts above the rocks of the pier , their eyes following the ship until it rounds the cape ; for the last time they wave a white rag .

@@13708238 @2308238/ <p> Everyone knows tea originally came from China . And that was literally millennia ago--Chinese tea cultivation goes back thousands of years . Tea drinking later reached Japan , and in the West from the 1600s on . <p> People in England particularly liked tea . So much that by the early 1800s it was the principal export of the British East India Company . That company enjoyed a monopoly on tea importation to the West , based on a production monopoly , that of China . <p> All tea at that time came from China . Its production was quite a bit more than its consumption . It had used tea as currency for some time . Tea was used in trade for war horses from Tibet as early as the 1100s . <p> China 's currency of tea was part of its state security , things considered central to the power of the Chinese government . This meant tea cultivation was a closely held secret . It was forbidden to take seed or slips from a tea plant , or for a tea worker to show anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem of Britain was that while folks loved tea , the country really did n't have anything the Chinese wanted to trade for it . Apparently British war horses did n't measure up . Silver was good , but Britain was running short of silver to trade for tea . <p> The British government did allow a growing opium market from India to replace silver as something the Chinese might like instead of silver , as trade for tea .

" They had brought the boss to meet the tourist from half way around the world . <p> Sharma was clearly in a hurry , but still gracious enough to answer a few of my questions--after I had passed his lie detector test . How , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I order it from Upton Tea Company , in the United States , " I responded . <p> He was familiar with that company . " Well , any fan of Glenburn is welcome here , " he said . <p> Sharma explained the tea operation . Tea in Darjeeling is harvested four times a year : around March , around June , in late summer , and in the fall . Winter is dormant season in Darjeeling , and begins in November . Alas , I was there on Nov. 14 , two weeks after the fall plucking season had ended . <p> The first harvest is called first flush . Second is called second flush . Third is during the rainy season , so called monsoon flush . Fourth is autumnal flush . <p> Harvest means that only the first two leaves and a bud are plucked--the word for picking the tea leaves . " We are a quality tea operation , so our pluckers must be careful to pick only those leaves , no other , " said Sharma . " This means one plucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little over a pound . <p> " First flush " does not necessarily mean finest quality . It simply means a tea harvested in the spring . " It is a delicate tea color , but with a strong bite , " said Sharma . " But many of our clients , particularly in Japan , prefer second flush . That 's a darker , stronger tea . " Also generally the most expensive . <p> In fact , it is also true in the United States that most quality Darjeeling sold is second flush . First flush is certainly easily available--but not locally . Catalog or online is the way to get quality single-estate Darjeeling . I do order from Upton Tea--so I was n't lying to the Glenburn people ! <p> The monsoon flush is darker and more earthy , and autumnal is darkest and most full bodied . They are stronger in flavor and so considered of lower quality , and less popular than first and second flush . Monsoon tea usually stays in India and is sold for the sweet spicy drink called masali chai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for haggling at a carpet or jewelry dealer in Mumbai . " Chai " is just the word for " tea " in Hindi and many other languages . <p> Most Darjeeling tea is black tea . This means it 's " fermented . " Not exactly--more like it 's oxidized . The tea leaves are first dried on long wire racks overnight , with blowers , cool in the daytime , warm at night . They are then scooped up and curled--usually by machine . This bruises the leaves . The curling machine in the Happy Valley plantation dated from the 1850s , from London . The fermentation is actually a second drying process . The curled leaf produces moisture that oxidizes . How long to ferment is dependent on the nose and judgment of the tea planter . Black tea is 90 percent oxidized , after which it is dried to stop the process and preserve the tea leaves from spoilage . <p> Green tea , on the other hand , is not oxidized at all . Oolong tea is oxidized a bit , about 10 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it commands higher prices at auction . <p> After fermentation and drying , the now black tea is worked through a machine to grade . Tea is graded by size . Large leaf is generally higher quality . The dust , or fannings , are sold for teabags . As I was walking around in stocking feet--no one wears shows in the plants--the fannings collected in a five-foot high pile in the corner . No one had much respect for fannings . <p> Graded tea is poured into sacks , and shipped to the tea auction in Kolkata--Calcutta , south of Darjeeling . There the price is set , and it is shipped around the world . <p> No tea outside of this geographical area can sell as Darjeeling--just as no wine outside of Burgundy in France can sell as Burgundy . Of course , it 's hard to police such a guarantee outside India , and tea sold as " Darjeeling " often is n't . <p> Grading of tea as indicated on a package seems complex , with a string of letters stamped on a tea chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means nothing but a leaf size , based on the grading process . <p> BOP , " Broken Orange Pekoe , " is the smaller size of broken tea leaves based on the screening and grading process . Smaller leaves steep faster , and generally are considered of lower quality . <p> Clonal means teas produced from cuttings of superior tea plants . <p> Sometimes you 'll see many letters applied to tea indicating quality , such as SFTGFOP--Super Fine Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe or FTGBOP--Fine Tippy Golden Broken Orange Pekoe . These generally do n't really give you an idea of tea taste . Golden Flowery suggests more gold-colored young tips produced earlier in the growing season . These tea leaves have a variegated appearance . More Golden Tips suggest a higher quality tea , with " Tippy " being higher yet . But you can find excellent bargains in a Darjeeling lacking such arcane designations . <p> The process of harvesting by machine produces a broken CTC leaf , that is , " Crush-Tear-Curl . " Machine harvest is rare in Darjeeling , Sharma said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Assam harvester also will often pluck more than just two leaves and the bud . These processes produce more tea , but a stronger , more bitter product considered of lower quality . Assam teas are consequently cheaper than Darjeeling teas , and look like small pellets often used in teabags . The fannings and CTC tea certainly represent what most people expect when they think of " tea , " and so it 's not surprising in Britain that the usual method of preparation is to add milk to tame the strong bitter flavor . Good Darjeeling properly steeped is slightly astringent , but not bitter , and offers a slightly floral taste . <p> Most tea grown outside of Darjeeling is sold in the West as blends , and the cheaper Darjeeling also often is a blend . This does n't necessarily mean low quality , although in my experience the Darjeeling blends I 've tried just have n't measured up to the single-estate teas . <p> Teabag tea infuses fast--one minute may be too long . Whole leaf Darjeeling , on the other hand , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boil should cover about one rounded teaspoon of tea per cup . Just place the leaves in the teapot . Strain with a tea filter to drink . Black tea keeps a long time--two years is not unreasonable , except for first flush , which should be used more quickly . <p> Tea is supposedly healthy , based on its polyphenols in the tannins . But the research on health benefits of tea , green or black , is still inconclusive . Tea does contain more caffeine by weight than coffee , but because it 's so light , you use less in a cup . <p> I asked the Glenburn tea garden staff about that--why not plant coffee ? It 's pretty much the same growing conditions , after all . " We do grow , in the south , " the innkeeper answered . " Actually , we could grow coffee right here , instead of tea ! But why have one harvest per year when you can have four ? " <p> The manager returned to usher me to the waiting Tata 4X4 . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have a web site . You can buy directly from us . Our prices are not set here . They are set by the tea auction in Calcutta . We have your card . We 'll send you an email with the address . " <p> The Glenburn visit took about two hours . I had the distinct impression Glenburn Tea Estate had never before seen a lone tourist intrepid enough to hire a vehicle , hire a guide , and find the operation on his own , and so did not know quite what to do with me . On the way back up the road , Dawi the guide mused , " I 've never had a tourist so interested in tea . " But he did n't realize that , for someone from Fargo , this really was a once-in-a-lifetime trip .

@@13708244 @2308244/ <p> In the summer of 1971 , experiments were planned to introduce SV40 DNA into an E. coli cell . This was of concern because SV40 is a monkey virus that can transform monkey as well as human cell lines into a cancerous state . These experiments were postponed . <p> In June 1973 , a Gordon Conference discussion related to safety issues of rDNA lab workers was held . National Institute of Health ( NIH ) and National Insitute of Medicine ( NIM ) was asked to appoint a committee to study the matter . At the same time , letters were sent by notable scientists to the journals Science and Nature calling for a temporary halt to rDNA experiments . This request was unheard of before in the history of science . A Recombinant DNA advisory committee ( RAC ) set up at the behest of the scientific committee by the NIH . <p> In February 1975 , the Asilomar Conference was held to discuss the relevant issues . The conclusion of this scientific conference was that most rDNA work should continue , but appropriate safeguards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in place . <p> Because in retrospect the Asilomar conference has appeared to be a pivotal event , it is important to assess the role of the Conference . Specifically , <p> Was it a model of scientific initiative and social responsibility ? <p> Was it a disaster because of poor planning ? <p> Were the results constructive or destructive ? <p> The conference was clearly was the first step in a public policy process . It was organized as a scientific conferences , but the legal and journalistic representation suggested organizers knew important public policy issues were being discussed . The conference was convened as a scientific conference under the auspices of the NIH because : <p> NIH was a major financial supporter of the research <p> The government was a potential major controlling factor of the research <p> Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee had already been created <p> The motivation for the conference was address the issue of the potential of the research as a biohazard . Such question considered were : <p> Was a dangerous escape possible ? <p> Wanted to classify the danger of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What needs to be considered was the conference a good starting point for policy decisions regarding biohazards ? In retrospect , the conference was actually too narrow because the debate was among molecular biologists who were not trained in microbiology infectious diseases , epidemiology and public health . Consequently , this poor training probably lead to an overstating at the conference of the biohazards of recombinanat DNA research . Because a single group dominated the conference , full access to the decision making process was not available to all . For effective public policy , full access to all possible affected individuals is important . Therefore , broadening the groups involved would have improved the overall process . <p> What successes came from the conference ? First , little real restrictions have been placed on the research . And in the long term more importantly , scientists showed to the public that they were concerned about the issues . <p> What were the long-term ramifications ? First , the government became involved in regulating the research . Secondly , because the conference agenda focused the debate on the potential biohazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst case scenarios " of recombinant DNA research . This is still seen today . When any issue related to the technology is discussed many " disasters " are proposed as reasons to prevent the research from occurring . Finally , the conference helped to humanize science and scientists because this was the first time that research was halted by scientists themselves until the potential hazards could be assessed . <p> This conference highlighted the fact that policy arises from both private and public debate . Although the conference was controlled by a single group ( molecular biologists ) , the outcome was that other scientists and non-scientists are now on national and local review boards . This non-scientist representation is a direct result of public debate . If the discussion was held in private , the experts involved in the decision-making processes would probably not beconsidered credible. <h> rDNA and the Press <p> Because at the time rDNA research was not known widely by the public , no physical manifestation was igniting fear in the public . If a lab accident had occurred , widespread hysteria could have halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientific press , apathy could lead to sloppy research that might have caused hysteria among the public . <p> So how was the press involved ? The scientific press did cover the publishing of the article by Singer and Sll ( Science 9/21/73 ) and Berg ( Science 7/19/74 ) that called for the moratorium on the research . <p> But the general press was not covering the story until it became a competitive story from a journalistic perspective . What the press knew was that scientists wanted a moratorium on experiments because of the uncertainty about safety . This issue was be debated at a time when the Ecology/Environment movement was beginning . This immediately gave it a flavor of relevancy . <p> So when the press actually became fully involved , the issue had evolved to the point where it appeared to be a panicky situation . The press was required to report the seemingly outrageous statements of some even if they were scientifically incorrect . Again this has had the long term effect of having the research immediately being discussed from a negative , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1976 - through development of NIH guidelines ; 1st time the public was involved ) <p> During this time frame , broad social and ethical issues are begun to be addressed . This included : <p> what is the relationship between scientific freedom of inquiry and protection of societies interest <p> who makes the decisions and what is the public 's role in this decision making proces <p> Also , during this period the public debate and the Federal response to that debate was defined . This was the first time that debate went beyond the scientific community . This broadening of the discussion also had an effect on the RAC committee membership . <p> It also was in this time frame that the rDNA decision making mechanism was developed . First , RAC membership was a concern . Originally the committee had 12 members from molecular biology , genetics , virology and microbiology . It was expanded to 16 members with the fields of epidemiology , infectious diseases and the biology of enteric organisms represented . Because of the broadening of the debate into include lay individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricter than those set out at Asilomar . But , critics still contended that they did not go far enough . One question that arose regarded the ethics of a group of individuals regulating themselves . Furthermore , who gave this group the authority to regulate other federal agencies as well as private industry . Phase II ended when the Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules were published on June 23 , 1976 . As written , these guidelines only applied to federally funded research . <h> Phase III ( mid 1976 - mid 1978 - congressional consideration of legislation ; initially thought that passage of public law was imminent , but finally no law was passed ) <p> Immediately legislative activity began to broaden the scope of the regulations to include all of the US research community . Legislation was introduced that would cover these loop holes . Three developments minimized the impetus for the legislation . <p> First , RAC role was expanded . Its membership was further broadened to include botany , plant pathology and tissue culture . Membership rose from 16 to 20 to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the RAC were given in more detail and broadened to include the review of large-scale experiments . <p> Secondly , scientists were coming to the conclusion that the research was less dangerous than originally thought . Specific strains of E. coli were shown to be effective control agents for the spread of engineered molecules . And it was demonstrated that exchanges of genetic information had indeed occurred naturally between lower and higher life forms . This suggested that rDNA was not as novel in nature as first thought . <p> Thirdly , a large lobbying effort by scientists , based on the belief that the technology was not dangerous was successful in stalling the legislation . The legislators proposing the legislation , sensing defeat , called on the federal regulatory agencies to close any loopholes in the guidelines . <h> Phase IV ( post 1978 - post legislative period ) <p> In response to the conclusions regarding safety , RAC lowered the containment level for many experiments . At this point , the Secretary of HEW ( now HHS ) became actively involved . He took over appointments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAC and the IBC ( local Institutional Biosafety Committee which approve projects at the individual institution level ) . <p> A large public hearing was held on September 15 , 1978 , and the 170 letters specifically addressing the issue lead to a major change in the guidelines . The changes increased the public participation in the IBC to 20% , ensured that most of the records were made public , and required major decisions to be forwarded to the RAC for approval . <p> To ensure industrial compliance with the guidelines , FDA gave notice that any product developed using rDNA procedures must have been developed with compliance to the guidelines . The EPA also adapted this approach , so effectively all research was complying with the guidelines . 
@@13708245 @2308245/ <p> The first control system for enzyme production worked out at the molecular level described the control of enzymes that are produced in response to the presence of the sugar lactose in E. coli cell . The work was performed by Jacob and Monod for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize . The following is the pathway that leads to the production of glucose and galactose . <p> Several proteins involved in lactose metabolism in the E. coli cell . They are : <p> -galactosidase - converts lactose into glucose and galactose <p> -galactoside permease - transports lactose into the cell <p> -galactoside transacetylase - function unknown <p> Research with this system was greatly added by the availability of constitutive mutants . A constitutive mutant is one in which the gene product is produced continually , that is there is no control over its expression .

The following is the genetic structure of the operon . <p> Operon - a cluster of structural genes that are expressed as a group and their associated promoter and operator <p> How does the system work ? Without lactose in the cell , the repressor protein binds to the operator and prevents the read through of RNA polymerase into the three structural genes .

@@13708250 @2308250/ <h> Meiotic Recombination Mapping <p> As discussed earlier in the course , the linkage relationship between two or three genes or markers can be determined by anlayzing the number of recombination events that occur in a specific mating of individuals polymorphic for the genes in question . In general , the term for this procedure is called meitotic recombination mapping . The same scientific principles apply when developing a detailed map of any chromosome . The only difference is that the segregating population is not scored for just two or three genes but for a large number of genes . <p> To develop a species map from a given population , the parents used to develop the population must be polymorphic at many genes or loci . It is often difficult to get two parents that differ from each other by all of the important genes . The primary reason is that as you accumulate more and more mutants alleles in an individual , the fitness of the individual declines to the point that the individual becomes non-fertile . The advent of molecular markers has alleviated this problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethal . Therefore all that is necessary to develop the map is to identify two parents that are polymorphic for many molecular markers . Molecular markers can be considered to be sign posts along the chromosome of the species . So mapping molecular marker loci will give you a molecular map of the species similar to a genetic map . <p> Several types of molecular markers can be used for these analyses . Restriction fragment length polymorphisms or RFLP were the first type applied to mapping and for many species , these are still the most often used molecular . Although the advent of RFLP launched the molecular mapping revolution , for species such as human their utility has about run its course . Mapping requires polymorphisms between the individuals being mapped . In humans , an informative RFLP , that is one that maps near a gene of interest , may exist for one population but not be useful for a second population . Therefore the molecular marker was only good in that one population . What was needed was a marker system that was highly polymorphic and recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness of any one specific marker linked to a gene to many human populations . <p> One such marker system is variable number tandem repeats ( VNTR ) or minisattelites . The core of the VNTR is a sequences usually 15-100 base pairs long . What makes these sequences particularly useful is that during evolution the core sequence under went tandem duplication and dispersal throughout the genome . The result is that a core sequence at one chromosomal location may have been repeated ten times , but at another location repeated 20 times . Therefore using a probe recognizing the core sequence allows the researchers to score both locations . In practise , the human genome may have 10 locations to which the core sequence was dispersed , and at each location the number of repeats varies . Thus the term variable number tandem repeat represents the variation in length . The human geneticists then uses pedigree analysis to find associations between a VNTR of a given length and the specific gene they are trying to map . <p> Microsatellites are another marker system developed for humans and now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dinucleotide repeats . Scatterred among the chromosomes of all species are repeats such as 5 ' -CA-3 ' which are repeated a variable number of times at different locations . As with VNTR , a specific size of microsatellite may be linked to a gene of interest . Once this linkage is established , the gene can be followed using the microsatellite . <p> The primary technical difference when applying these two marker systems is that VNTR are scored used Southern hybridization techniques and microsatellite are analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction . For VNTR a probe to the core sequence must be found . That probe will usually generate a stair step pattern of hybridization , in which the bands differ from the previous band by the length of the core sequence . For micorosatellites , the sequences that border the dinucleotide repeat are conserved . Once the bordering sequence is determined , primers can be designed to initiate the PCR . Because the length of the dinucleotide repeat length varies , products of different length will be obtained . For both systems , geneticists must determine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene of interest . <p> Whether RFLP , VNTR or microsatellites are used , a segregating population must be scored . Each of the individuals is analyzed for all of the markers , and two and three point analyses are performed among all two and three combinations of markers . This analysis is exactly analagous to that described for phenotypic genes . In reality , though , analyzing hundreds of markers simulataneously is not feasible by hand . Rather computer programs are used to determine linkages and develop the map . The development of programs such as MAPMAKER , LINKAGE and FASTMAP have greatly facilitated mapping efforts in many species . Today , molecular maps of all major species of interest are available for medical or agricultural scientists . And these scientists are using these maps to isolate genes of interest . 
@@13708252 @2308252/ <p> The molecular analysis of genes began in full force in the late 1970s . One of the most startling discoveries from these early analyzes was the occurrence of sequences in the gene that did not appear in the final mRNA product . Two terms were coined to explain this result . <p> Exon - sequences found in the gene that are also represented in the mRNA product <p> Introns - sequences present in the gene that are not represented in the mRNA product <p> The discovery of introns was made using a technique called R-loop analysis . This analysis involves the hybridization of an RNA molecule to a DNA molecule and an analysis of the result with electron microscope . In those experiments which discovered introns , mRNA was hybridized to a genomic clone of the mouse beta-globin gene . These experiments are performed by melting the DNA and mixing it with the mRNA . Because the mRNA-DNA complex is more stable , the complementary strand of the gene is displaced and a R-loop forms . In earlier experiments with microbial systems , one displacement loop of single-stranded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eukaryotic gene was analyzed extra loops were detected . It was later shown by sequence analysis that this extra DNA was not represented in the mRNA . <p> Introns have now been located in many eukaryotic genes and the number can range from a low of one up to more than 50 . The only consensus information among introns are the sequences 5 ' -GT-3 ' at the 5 ' border and 5 ' -AG-3 ' at the 3 ' border . No other sequences are common among introns which suggests that these sequences are in some manner important to the process that removes introns from heteronuclear RNA ( hnRNA ) , the initial product of transcription .

Actual Scandinavian-Americans ( my uncle and aunt ) demonstrate making lefse in a home kitchen . <h> Ross 's ultimate lefse recipe and instructions . <p> My lefse street cred . While I 'm ( sadly ? ) only one-fourth Norwegian , that side of the family dominated my childhood , and so I grew up helping my 100 percent Norwegian grandmother make lefse . I have now made it with my aunt Gwen Erickson for 20 years using my grandmother 's recipe , which she wrote down at age 90 from memory after a lifetime of making it . <p> What is lefse ? ( Sometimes misspelled lefsa . ) A Scandinavian soft potato-based tortilla-like bread , but bigger and thinner . Traditionally rolled and eaten with butter and sugar , or even plain , although my grandmother liked to roll up meatballs . It sounds calorie-heavy , but I read it actually only has about 75 calories per lefse ( not including butter and sugar , of course ) . <p> Here it the recipe with the critical extra information most leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not common kitchen fare , and not cheap . But I 'll warn you right now , if you do n't have the right equipment , you are doomed , and your holiday spirit will turn to holiday spirits . <p> Method : 1 . Peel potatoes . Try to remove all black spots with a paring knife , as they look unsightly in the finished lefse . Boil the potatoes GENTLY until just done . Check frequently . Do not let them get mushy . <p> Note : getting dry potatoes and keeping them dry is the key to making decent lefse without pulling your hair out ( why do you think I 'm bald ? ) . Any moisture translates into sticky dough that will snag and tear no matter how carefully you try to roll it out . Keep ' yer taters dry ! <p> 2 . Put potatoes through ricer and mash until perfectly smooth . <p> 3 . Stir in 1/2 cup softened butter or margarine . Add salt . <p> 4 . Add 1/2 cup Half ' n Half . Mix . Refrigerate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you wo n't be able to roll it out . My grandmother made it the night before , put it in the fridge . But my aunt makes it the same morning . <p> 5 . Remove when cool . Just before rolling , stir in about 1 cup of flour to each 4 cups of potatoes , packed . Do about half the batch at a time , returning the rest of the fridge . Five pounds of potatoes need about 2 1/4 cups flour . <p> Rolling : You 'll quickly discover this is n't like rolling pastry dough or dumplings . You need a feather-light touch to avoid sticking . Try to push a bit harder in the center , lighter toward the edges . If your pin starts sticking , sprinkle a little flour on the dough disk . Try to roll as neatly round as you can--nice round lefse is a matter of pride to old time lefse bakers such as my grandmother and aunt . Mine , on the other hand , tend to look like , oh , Australia ? Heck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop rolling : never ! Well , that is , not as soon as you think . The key is to roll until the lefse is as thin as possible , but not so far that it starts tearing . I usually roll until I can see the pastry cloth through the translucent dough , about eight ( small ball ) to 12 ( large ball ) inches in diameter . <p> If it tears : avoid rolling in that spot . Work on the edges . If it 's pretty large and starts tearing , that 's a sign that you 're done rolling and ready to bake . <p> 10 . Now for the really tricky part : Transfer the lefse from the board to the grill . To do this , flour your lefse stick . Work it from the side underneath the lefse to loosen from the pastry cloth , moving it like a knife . Do not let tip of the stick get under lefse ; it will tear . <p> After loosening the underside , work floured stick back to the center . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area--it will rip at that tear . Gently but quickly lift the lefse to the grill . Flop it half way , then twist the stick to roll the rest of the lefse on the grill . <p> If you blow it and the lefse falls apart , make another ball , refrigerate , and reroll . May be a bit tough , but still edible . <p> 11 . Baking : This is easy . Wait till it bubbles and looks a little dry on the edges , then flip . It will now be easy to turn , no longer sticky . Wait until the lefse has medium brown spots all around . Will take only a few minutes . Pull lefse off with stick and fold onto dish towel on counter to cool . Cover with dampened dish towel . <p> Note : If you cool lefse on a counter or wire mesh rack , it will get hard . <p> 12 . With a table knife , scrape off any dough that has stuck to pastry cloth . Apply more flour , rub in . Scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this sounds kind of tedious , but I 've kept all the details so that if something does n't work , you probably can figure out what went wrong . With two people rolling , it takes a couple hours to turn out two dozen lefse , once they get the hang of it . <p> Keeping lefse : Lefse gets moldy within three or four days , so enjoy immediately , or freeze . Freezes well for a few weeks . Frozen or cool lefse tastes great after a few seconds in the microwave . My grandmother would have loved one of these gadgets , I 'm certain .

@@13708264 @2308264/ <h> Germinal and Somatic Mutations <p> Eukaryotic organisms have two primary cell types --- germ and somatic . Mutations can occur in either cell type . If a gene is altered in a germ cell , the mutation is termed a germinal mutation . Because germ cells give rise to gametes , some gamete s will carry the mutation and it will be passed on to the next generation when the individual successfully mates . Typically germinal mutations are not expressed in the individual containing the mutation . The only instance in which it would be expressed is if it negatively ( or positively ) affected gamete production . <p> Somatic cells give rise to all non-germline tissues . Mutations in somatic cells are called somatic mutations . Because they do not occur in cells that give rise to gametes , the mutation is not passed along to the next generation by sexual means .

For this reason , somatic mutations generally appear as a sector on the mutated individual . <p> Cancer tumors are a unique class of somatic mutations . The tumor arises when a gene involved in cell division , a protooncogene , is mutated . All of the daughter cells contain this mutation . The phenotype of all cells containing the mutation is un controlled cell division . This results in a tumor that is a collection of undifferentiated cells called tumor cells .

@@13708273 @2308273/ <h> Myth Theory and Criticism <p> Myth criticism designates not so much a critical approach in literary studies as the convergence of several methods and forms of inquiry about the complex relations between literature and myth . So heterogeneous are these inquiries , connecting with so many disciplines and interdisciplinary issues , that it is perhaps best to think of myth criticism as the locus for a series of complex , if powerfully suggestive , questions . Is myth embedded in literature , or are myth and literature somehow coextensive ? Is myth ( from Greek mythos , " tale , story " ) inescapably narrative in form ? Is all literature susceptible of myth criticism ? How self-conscious are literary artists in the use or incorporation of myth ? How does myth in , or as , literature evolve historically ? Does a single governing myth , a " monomyth , " organize disparate mythic narratives and dominate literary form ? What tasks , besides a simple cataloging of putative mythic components , fall to the myth critic ? And most fundamentally , what does " myth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in answers to this last question has been so great , recourse to different disciplines ( philosophy , anthropology , psychology , folklore ) so various , that the question becomes an inevitable terminus a quo for a survey of myth criticism.A characteristic Romantic and post-Romantic tendency in defining myth is the denial of euhemerism , the theory that myths can be explained historically or by identifying their special objects or motives . The resistance to such reductionism is perhaps strongest in the work of the philosopher Ernst Cassirer , whose monumental Philosophy of Symbolic Forms is given over in its second volume ( 1925 ) to the proposition that " myth is a form of thought . " By this Cassirer means to insist that myth is a fundamental " symbolic form " that , like language , is a means of responding to , and hence creating , our world . But unlike language , or at least the language of philosophy , myth is nonintellectual , nondiscursive , typically imagistic . It is the primal , emotion-laden , unmediated " language " of experience . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the real and the ideal ; the mythic " ' image ' does not represent the ' thing ' ; it is the thing " ( 2:38 ) . This literal , as opposed to representational , quality of myth suggests that literature that taps into the recesses of mythic consciousness will reveal in powerful fashion the " dynamic of the life feeling " ( 2:38 ) , which gives meaning and intelligibility to our world.Myth , understood in this honorific rather than pejorative sense , has profoundly influenced numerous literary critics and theorists . Isabel MacCaffrey , for example , insists in her study of Paradise Lost that the Christian myth at the center of the epic is not for Milton an oblique representation but rather the " direct rendering of certain stupendous realities now known only indirectly in the symbolic signatures of earthly life " ( 30 ) . It was for this reason , she feels , that Milton was obliged to give up earlier allegorical plans for the poem : mythic material is simply inaccessible to allegory or metaphor , because it is itself their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of " idea " and " image " runs exactly counter to a mythic conception , which insists on their identity.Two other highly influential , nonreductionist theories of myth come from the fields of anthropology and psychology ( see Anthropological Theory and Criticism ) . The French anthropologist Claude LTvi-Strauss , whose extensive work with South American tribal societies has yielded extraordinary analyses , argues that the meaning of myths lies not in their manifest content but rather in their underlying structure of relations , which typically works to mediate between polar extremes ( raw and cooked , agriculture and warfare , life and death ) . In other words , the purpose of myth is to provide a logical model capable of overcoming a contradiction . Ultimately this leads LTvi-Strauss to the notion that the structure of myths is identical with that of the human mind . Thus the mythopoeic ( mythmaking ) imagination , its structure and operations , is reflected in the structure and symbols of actual myths.The very power of LTvi-Strauss 's argument about the nature and function of myth has made it difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sustained fashion . His abstract notion of " structure " ( derived by analogy from Ferdinand de Saussure 's enormously suggestive conception of linguistic structure ) , while appealing to the more systematic semioticians and structuralists , is difficult to accommodate to what are typically more labile definitions of literary form and structure in " mature " or sophisticated literary traditions . ( See Semiotics and Structuralism . ) Eric Gould presents in Mythical Intentions in Modern Literature an intelligent and sympathetic account of LTvi-Strauss 's thought about myth and its relation to literature but finally can do little more than point to the anthropologist 's rather dispiriting conclusion that myth survives only tenuously in modern fictional forms and that the novel is a literary genre that " tells a story that ends badly , and ... now , as a genre is itself coming to a bad end " ( 95 ) . Gould 's more optimistic conclusion--that literary studies can have in common with LTvi-Strauss 's mythography a self-conscious interpretive posture--seems only vaguely useful.For literary criticism perhaps the most productive anti-euhemerist has been the psychologist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he is usually associated with archetypes ( see Archetypal Theory and Criticism ) , the distinction between archetype and myth has often been blurred , and Jung 's theories have been appropriated , mutatis mutandis , by myth critics and archetypal critics alike . Jung 's most influential idea is that of a " collective unconscious , " a racial memory , consisting of " primordial images " or archetypes . These find expression in characteristic forms--the Earth Mother , the divine child , the wise old man , the sacrificial death--of the god , the mandala , the satyr or man-animal monster , the cross , the number 4--which provide the primordial elements in the myths and narrative constructions of widely different cultures . Although Jean Piaget and others have expressed skepticism about the universality or " racial " quality of Jung 's archetypes , the archetypal vocabulary is now widespread in the discourse of those who might be called myth critics , including the most influential member of that group , Northrop Frye.Frye and others are attracted to Jung 's theories not only because of the richness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborator Carl KerTnyi came to call " mythologems " ) but because these theories , like those of Cassirer and LTvi-Strauss , command for myth a central cultural position , unassailable by reductive intellectual methods or procedures . By entitling the third essay of Anatomy of Criticism " Archetypal Criticism : Theory of Myths , " Frye suggests a conceptual means of drawing individual and apparently unrelated archetypal images--the fundaments of psyche and culture--into a coherent and ultimately hierarchical framework of " mythoi , " one organizing not only individual literary works but the entire system of literary works , that is , literature . Thus , for example , works in the " realistic , " or representational , mode ( the ill-fated " modern " novel LTvi-Strauss speaks of ) stand ( nonpejoratively ) at the opposite end of the spectrum from those in the " mythical mode , " which , because they are about characters having the greatest possible powers and who act " near or at the conceivable limits of desire " ( 136 ) , are the " most abstract and conventionalized " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mythic mode in literature are ultimately reflective of the irreducible and inescapable place of myth itself ; so conceived , Western literature , massively funded by the powerful myths of the Bible and classical culture , might be thought of as having a " grammar " or coherent structural principles basic to any critical organization or account of historical development . That Frye ultimately identifies the " quest-myth " in its various forms as the central myth ( mono-myth ) of literature and the source of literary genres is at once the logical conclusion of his approach to myth criticism and the source of ongoing debate.No brief account can begin to do justice to the massive conceptual power and richly varied suggestiveness of Frye 's theory of myths . If occasionally the schematization seems excessive or arbitrary , Frye 's efforts nonetheless suggest how powerfully myth can organize our thinking about literature and about culture . His four " mythoi , " or " generic narratives " ( spring : comedy ; summer : romance ; autumn:tragedy ; winter : irony and satire ) , have proved central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conviction that the " total mythopoeic structure of concern " extends beyond literature to religion , philosophy , political theory , and history suggests how myth criticism may ultimately connect with a larger theory of culture.Frye 's particular critical and theoretical project has stimulated enormous scholarly activity , but he has had considerable company in defining the possibilities for literary myth criticism . Leslie Fiedler argues that contemporary criticism has lost its way by failing to see how Plato 's " ancient quarrel between logos and mythos " as to which was the primal word " ( " No ! In Thunder " 1:518 ) . Answering predictably and claiming that " mythos created poetry , " Fiedler appropriates Jung 's archetypes and Crocean intuitionism to define myth and thereby free poetry from the enervating embrace of logos ( science , rationalism , logic ) ( see Benedetto Croce ) . Having succeeded so well in opposing mythos to logos , however , Fiedler comes perilously close to paralyzing criticism . His own critical project survives chiefly with his notion that literature comes into being only with the imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Signature " being the " sum total of individuating factors in a work " ( 1:537 ) , the sign of the Persona . The insistence on both signature and myth , or archetype , with the pre-dominance of each varying in individual literary works , creates a useful critical spectrum.Many other modern myth critics and theorists , from the Cambridge Ritualists down to the present , have suggested productive ways of speaking about myth in literature and the connections between literary mythopoeia and the materials explored by other disciplines in our intellectual culture . C. L. Barber , for example , has explored the ways Shakespearean comedy achieves a characteristic " release " leading to social clarification ; this " release " is related in turn to a ceremonial , ritualistic , finally mythic conception of human life that was evolving rapidly into a historical , psychological conception among the educated classes of Shakespeare 's society . More recently , RenT Girard has taken up a wide-ranging investigation of the central cultural role of ritual sacrifice and its relation to myths , especially those prominent in Greek tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflect upon a relatively indifferent or " sacrificeable " victim the violence that would otherwise be vented on its own members , Girard offers deeply suggestive commentary on such plays as Ajax , Medea , and , most impressively , Oedipus Tyrannos . Even in so effectively establishing connections between ritual and myth on the one hand and tragic drama on the other , however , Girard is at pains to acknowledge the distinctively literary qualities of the plays , what he calls the " essentially antimythical and antiritualistic inspiration of the drama " ( 95 ) . Girard 's most important critical claim is that the depiction of the ritual victim , or " scapegoat , " must be seen in drama not as simple superstition , a crude mythic holdover , but as the metamorphosis of earlier " reciprocal violence , " a communal violence " more deeply rooted in the human condition than we are willing to admit " ( 96 ) . Although " myth criticism " no longer enjoys its earlier vogue , its legacy is powerful . Frye 's work remains deeply influential ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms with the arguments of Barber 's and MacCaffrey 's studies ; Girard continues to be a striking presence on the contemporary critical scene ; and many individual critical studies concentrating on mythic themes , as well as on the formal or generic consequences of those themes , form an important part of the exegetical tradition . This seems to be particularly true for studies of modernist and American literature . It is likely that the future of literary myth criticism will be determined by the vitality of mythography as a concern in other related or allied fields , as well as by the heuristic power of the questions such criticism can generate . One of the most important of these questions asks about the degree of mythic " self-consciousness " in literary texts . Is literature mythopoeia or mythology ? the creation or reflective use of mythic materials ? The nineteenth-century philologist and student of myth F. Max Mnller proposed a distinction between the " mythic " and the " mythical " that gave early form to precisely this issue . And subsequently many critics have insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriated by Homer and Sophocles ; Virgil and Milton ; T. S. Eliot , Ezra Pound , James Joyce , Thomas Mann , and Gabriel Garcfa Mrquez . ( The peculiarly self-conscious and individual myth systems of poets such as William Blake and W. B. Yeats also point up the critical question sharply . ) In turn , other critics have asked how the Western myth tradition has underwritten canon formation and how , for example , black and feminist literatures are to be understood in relation to , and in conscious rebellion against , this tradition . If one accepts that the proposition " myth is literature " is itself an aesthetic creation and hence defines further creative possibilities ( as does , for example , the Americanist and myth critic Richard Chase ) , then the question of mythic self-consciousness becomes particularly exigent.In short , complex critical and theoretical questions about myth and literature continue to be asked . The susceptibility of literature to forms of myth criticism depends upon the persuasiveness of answers to such questions , as well as upon the success of literary theorists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplines .

The word " bon " is the tray , pot , or container . " Sai " refers to the tree , shrub , or plant . A literal translation may be " tray tree " or " potted planting . " Bonsai can be applied to include both indoor and outdoor plants . The purpose of bonsai is to evoke an image of an ideal tree in nature or imagination . The practices of bonsai began in China . However , it was the Japanese who refined the practices for nearly 600 years before this horticultural practice became popular worldwide in the mid-twentieth century . The art of bonsai has become an international phenomenon with enthusiasts found in many countries around the world . <h> This is a photo of a Black Pine fromthe Yasukunai Bonsai Garden website . <h> Care of Bonsai <h> The four main things you need to consider when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Water3 . ) Humidity4 . ) Fertilizer <h> By providing adequate amounts of these four essential items , your tree will remain healthy while providing you years of visual enjoyment . In addition , you need to take into consideration any special requirements that your tree may require for proper care and growth . <h> This is a Bougainvillea Bonsaiphoto from the Bonsai Brothers website . <h> Location/Light <h> When caring for your bonsai , you must remember that you are in fact cultivating a tree , not a houseplant . Most bonsai need about six to eight hours of light each day . All bonsai can benefit from living outdoors during the late spring months through summer and early fall , depending on where you live . As a result of raising your tree outdoors , you will be able to see increased health that will be shown through growth , color , and blossoms in species having flowers . If you do not have an outside area in which to grow your plants , you should place them in a south-facing window on a humidity tray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 14-16 hours daily . <h> Water <h> Adequately watering your bonsai can be one of the most difficult skills you will obtain through your experience with bonsai . Daily morning watering is recommended during the warmer months . Do not water twice daily unless the weather conditions are very hot or windy . Remember to water less as the temperature declines and trees begin dormancy . You should test soil daily to be sure dry-out does not occur . Watering should be done with either a hose or a watering can that will distribute the flow in a gentle shower over your plant . Some tips for watering that the Yasukunai Bonsai Garden website suggested include dipping the trees to the depth of its pot in a tub of water every other day and let it drain before returning it to it 's normal growing place . They also suggest spraying the soil surface vigorously to break dry surface tension before watering with your watering can . <h> This Casuarina Equisetifolia Bonsai is 80 years old.The photo is from The World of Bonsai website . <h> Fertilizer <h> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited amount of soil and space . The fertilizers help provide necessary nutrients and trace elements . A combination of time-released fertilizer and half-strength water-soluble solutions is suggested . The amount of nitrogen you apply should be decreased in late fall in order to encourage dormancy . Nitrogen level should be raised around April to prep the plant for the growing season . <h> Maintenance <h> Pruning , trimming , repotting , and wiring are all things to consider when caring for your bonsai . Pruning and trimming techniques are used to cut away unwanted branches and to help shape the tree into a more desirable shape . Not only are the plant parts above the soil susceptible to pruning , but also the roots . It is necessary to prune roots because they become pot bound and the soils in which they grow need to be refreshed . It is suggested that you repot your bonsai every two years . When repotting , it is widely accepted to remove about 30% of the old root mass before repotting in the new soil . <h> There are five basic bonsai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanting , semi-cascade and cascade . Each style has its own unique characteristics . To achieve the desired shape of your bonsai , you will not only need to prune and trim , but also wire the branches . When using wire , check regularly to make sure the bark is not swelling around it and producing scars . Also , remember to let the branch get a little drier than usual before attempting to bend the branch and wire to place it in the desired spot . A drier condition is desired as plant cells that are full of water break easily . <h> Conclusion <h> Whether you are just getting interested in starting a bonsai of your own or have been practicing the art for many years , you will find enjoyment in this area of horticulture .

In an improvised response to the Red Armys steady , westward advance , the SS began to integrate ethnic Germans into " Greater " Germany upon completion of racial screening at its Immigration Main Office in Lodz , which served as the Nazi equivalent of " Ellis Island " for all of Europes ethnic Germans ( the so-called Volksdeutsche ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon and train represented one part of a broader humanitarian crisis that afflicted Central and Eastern Europe under both the Nazis and Soviet Communists , including above all Hitlers Holocaust ( 1941-1945 ) and Stalins mass deportation of thirteen nationality groups ( including ethnic Germans ) to remote special settlements in the east ( 1938-1951 ) . One distinguishing feature of the ethnic German experience in Ukraine was that this minority group found itself caught between two powerful rival ideologies and thus twice endured forced mass-population transfers . The fate of ethnic Germans in Nazi-held Poland also highlighted the stark racial dichotomy of Hitlers New Order . The SS in Lodz processed ethnic Germans into the Third Reich just as that citys Jewish population , Europes last major Ghetto , faced liquidation . About 20,000-25,000 of Ukraines ethnic Germans died on the trek west . After the war , more than 200,000 Soviet citizens of German nationality under Allied agreements suffered repatriation from occupied Germany to Soviet Siberia and Central Asia . Roughly 30,000 out of the 75,000 permitted to remain in postwar West Germany chose to leave Europe after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western Hemisphere and Australia . Jews , Poles , and ethnic German minorities comprised the three primary DP groups during this time . Consequently , the years of upheaval , repression and even mass murder diminished Eastern Europes ethnic diversity and longstanding historical communities . <p> The " Long Trek " in an Era of Demographic Disasters for Central and Eastern Europe A dramatic chain of events in 1943 and 1944 better known today as the " Long Trek " ( Grosser Treck ) signaled the closing chapter of a more than 150-year history of ethnic Germans living in Ukraineand the beginning of a new odyssey for the wide German dispersal that resulted from it.1 The ancestors of most of these ethnic Germans came to imperial Russia starting in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , under invitation of the tsars , most notably Catherine the Great ( 1762-1796 ) and her grandson Alexander I ( 1801-1825 ) . <p> As the tide of World War II turned against the Third Reich , Adolf Hitlers SS responded to the Soviet Red Armys rapid westward advance by evacuating nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between August 1943 and July 1944 , SS agencies in Lodz , Poland , received and processed these refugees into " Greater " Germany ( Grossdeutschland ) . On the border of the Reich , Lodz served as the official gateway to the Warthe District ( Warthegau ) , a territory in northwestern Poland which Nazi Germany incorporated in late 1939 and now used for ethnic German resettlement . Shortly following the war , however , Joseph Stalins victorious USSR was able to reclaim a large majority of these refugees ( more than 200,000 ) as Soviet citizens , deporting them to live in exile for many years in the distant expanses of Soviet Siberia and Central Asia . <p> The " Long Trek , " as tremendous an event as it was , did not occur in isolation , however , but rather fit into a much broader and more turbulent historical pattern of ethnic cleansing , political persecution , and even genocide that plagued Central and Eastern Europe from the early 1920s to the early 1950s . In Europe , this was the age of political giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway of totalitarian regimes that ultimately held little regard for the welfare , liberty and dignity of individuals and certain categories of people . Consequently , this relatively brief era of political upheaval , social dislocation and even mass murder diminished much of Central and Eastern Europes ethnic and cultural diversity , including significant historical communities , such as the Germans in Poland , Czechoslovakia , Ukraine , and former eastern parts of historic Germany , and other longstanding cultural enclaves , such as the East European Jews . <p> Many historians regard the titanic Nazi-Soviet Communist rivalry as one of the driving forces behind a European-wide " civil war " during the mid-twentieth centurynot as a conflict mostly confined to a single political state as such , but as part of a wider one between the competing ideological visions of nationalism , capitalism , fascism and socialism that ruptured the basic moral , intellectual and political fabric of Western civilization . These national , political , and ideological tensions across Europe had been mounting for many years , only to explode in the three decades following World War I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these escalating ideological and political battles and clashes of national wills for regional and continental hegemony.2 <p> Aside from the " Long Trek " episode of 1943-1944 , a long list of drastic population policies reflected these growing tensions and conflicts , most of them taking place under the auspices of the Nazis and Soviets . Some of the major episodes included the following : ( 1 ) along with many fellow Soviet citizens , a disproportionately significant number of ethnic Germans in the USSR faced deportation as " kulaks " ( so-called wealthy peasants ) to " special settlements " in the far north and Siberia ( 1930-1931 ) ; ( 2 ) a disproportionate number of ethnic Germans under Stalin perished in the Ukrainian terror-famine ( Holodomor ) , which obliterated a total of about 4-7 million men , women and children of various nationalities ( 1932-1933 ) ; ( 3 ) the Soviet regime out of security concerns forcibly deported many thousands of ethnic Germans in Ukraine away from the Polish border on the basis of their nationality ( 1935-1936 ) 3 ; ( 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greater " Germany from the Soviet-controlled Baltic states , Bessarabia ( formerly the eastern part of Romania ) , and eastern regions of conquered Poland under Nazi-Soviet arrangements ( 1939-1940 ) 4 ; ( 5 ) Hitlers Holocaust and the murder of almost 12 million , about half of them Jews , with a large majority of all victims coming from Eastern Europe ( 1941-1945 ) 5 ; ( 6 ) the transfer of 6-7 million foreign laborers , many of them from Nazi-administered Ukraine , to the Third Reich during wartime6 ; ( 7 ) the removal of approximately 12-16 million German nationals from East European countries to postwar occupied Germany with Allied approval as a sweeping punishment for Nazi crimes , resulting in 1-2 million deaths ( 1945-1946 ) 7 ; ( 8 ) the formal Soviet annexation of eastern parts of Poland after the Nazi defeat leading to a mass-population exchange of about 630,000 ethnic Ukrainians in Poland who either volunteered or were forced across the border to Soviet Ukraine as well as around 810,000 ethnic Poles who were forcibly moved from Soviet Ukraine to Poland ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deportations of nearly 3 million souls from thirteen Soviet nationality groups , including about 1.2 million Volga and Black Sea Germans , to forced labor camps ( the Gulag ) and " special settlements " ( spetsposelenie ) in the east as internal enemies or fifth columns ( 1937-1951 ) .9 <p> In his recent work , What Is Genocide ? , scholar Martin Shaw emphasizes the historical continuities that pervaded these extreme oscillations in Nazi-Soviet relations . In particular , the sequence of events leading to the massive population removals and persecutions sealed the fate of various German minority groups in Central and Eastern Europe . He observes that <p> Indeed , pre-exterminatory phases of the Nazi genocide also saw vast expulsions . Hitlers invasion of Poland , with its grandiose plan to annex its western part to the Reich Warthegau and expel those Poles not suitable to be " Germanized " to easterly regions , where the Jews were concentrated in ghettoes , was an immediate precedent for Soviet and Polish campaigns against Germans in 1945-1946 . Moreover the Soviet annexation of eastern Poland in 1939 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions annexed by Poland in 1945 , consolidated gains originally made by the USSR in alliance his emphasis with Nazi Germany in 1939-1940 . So instead of a categorical divide between different phases of expulsion , there were historical continuities that survived violent fluctuations in Nazi-Soviet relations his emphasis . The main difference was that the wars outcome made larger German populationsnot only minorities within Poland and Czechoslovakia but also people in the eastern regions of historic Germanythe targets of the new campaign of forced removals in 1945-1946 . The other difference was that Great Britain and the USA , which in 1939 protested against Polands division , now legitimated it together with the accompanying expulsions , even if they deplored excesses.10 <p> In the context of this horrific European drama , Ukraines significance as a geographical concept at the East-West and Nazi-Soviet crossroads also deserves serious scholarly consideration . The matter of Ukraine raises questions for historians because it had long represented a multi-ethnic borderland until the end of World War II . Historian Kate Brown in her thoughtful book , A Biography of No Place , argues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1923 and 1953 , this troubled region underwent a form of " ethnic purification " to evolve into " a largely homogenous Ukrainian heartland . " She notes a peculiar aspect of this demographic transformation : " It is a puzzling case because the ethnic purification of the borderland was not carried out by one state , nor was it the fruit of one political ideology . Rather , imperial Russia , socialist Soviet Union , fascist Nazi Germany , parliamentary Poland , and nationalist Ukrainian parties all took part in dismantling the confusing mosaic of cultures in the contested borderland . " 11 She further emphasizes that it was partly the " quixotic , hard-to-pin-down quality of the borderland which inspired state officials to try to alter it radically by making it comprehensible as ethnically pure nation-space. " 12 <p> For much of this time , Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union both acted as Central and Eastern Europes dominant power-brokers , though by no means were they the only culprits in the region . They played quite decisive roles in pursuing an escalation of such catastrophic population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly distinguishing feature of the Ukrainian German experience at the time was that two powerful rival ideologies , the Black Swastika and the Red Star , claimed this ethnic group as their own . Thus , most of the " Long Trek " survivors , including a high percentage of women and children , twice suffered forced mass-population transfers , first in 1943-1944 and again in 1945-1946.13 <p> Accordingly , this study seeks to incorporate various eyewitness accounts and documents with the current body of academic literature on the " Long Trek " episode . It reflects on the refugees divergent fates across five continents , shedding more light on the continuing legacy of the Hitler and Stalin eras . <p> The Prelude to Mass Removal of Germans from Ukraine , 1939-1943 The removal of Ukrainian Germans represented one in a series of great population transfers of ethnic German minorities under the Nazis and Soviets during World War II . Germans from parts of Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe , including those in Romania , Hungary , Yugoslavia and elsewhere also encountered similar fates as the war turned against Hitler . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slavic East , these German minority groups now needed greater protection within an ever-shrinking Nazi empire . <p> Even before the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , when an expanding Germanys position seemed more than secure , tens of thousands of Baltic , Bessarabian , Volhynian , and Galician Germans had already undergone their own relatively peaceful mass relocations to " Greater " Germany . In 1939 and 1940 , Hitler and Stalin , eager for a time to share in the mastery of the continent , agreed to carve up parts of Eastern Europe between them shortly after World War II broke out . <p> More population transfers of East European Germans soon took place , but under far worse conditions . In August 1941 , shortly following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union , Stalins government ordered the forcible removal of nearly 400,000 Volga Germans and about 400,000-450,000 other ethnic Germans from eastern Ukraine , the Crimea , and the Caucasus by cattle car to distant settlements and slave labor camps in Soviet Siberia and Central Asia.14 The primary motivation for such immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " fascist " collaboration . The Ukrainian Germans , however , remained mostly untouched because the Soviet secret police forces ( the NKVD ) were unable to deport them in any significant numbers to the east in time ; the Nazi advance was simply too rapid for that to happen . <p> Ukraine fell under both Nazi and Romanian occupational control after the June 1941 invasion of the USSR . From 1940 to August 1944 , fascist Romania was a Nazi ally , and it desired to regain Bessarabia and acquire other territories from the Soviet Union , including western Ukraine . Nazi Germany only permitted its smaller partner to administer western Ukraine , but not to annex it as such . Ukraine comprised the heart of Nazi imperial dreams in the east , as it would provide the " master race " with both " living space " and what many considered to be the " bread basket of Europe . " Scholar Wendy Lower appropriately refers to Ukraine as Hitlers mythical " Garden of Eden . " 15 <p> The Romanian administrative zone was called Transnistria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was authorized to supervise the welfare of about 135,000 ethnic Germans living there . The zone was located just southwest of the Nazi-run civilian administration of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories ( RMO ) under Alfred Rosenberg , a former Baltic German . His subordinate in Ukraine was the brutal Erich Koch , whose Reichskommissariat Ukraine held about 200,000 ethnic Germans . By late 1942 , Nazi and SS officials had compiled the initial racial classifications of all Ukrainian Germans on the now infamous German National List ( Deutsche Volksliste orDVL ) .16 <p> In both Romanian-administered Transnistria and Nazi-occupied Ukraine , ethnic Germans who supported their new Nazi and SS overlords reaped the political and material benefits , now that the Soviet threat had been apparently eliminated from the region . They were to become members of the Nazi New Order and thus occupy a privileged position in the regions racial hierarchy.17 For all that , the old Soviet system of collectivized agriculture continued to function in all the German villages during the rather brief Nazi occupation , however ; desired agricultural reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , enjoyed overall more religious freedom and educational opportunities than their ethnic compatriots farther east under Reichskommissar Koch , who generally did not hold the Volksdeutsche in high regard.18 <p> For the Ukrainian Germans squeezed between two fierce ideological rivals , the fortunes of war changed hands all too quickly . By mid- to late 1943 , following the vicious battles of Stalingrad and Kursk , the surging Red Army went on the offensive . At the beginning of 1944 , the Nazi armies were in retreat along the entire eastern front . Then the Soviets conducted " Operation Bagration " between June and August 1944 , a massive assault that can be regarded as the Soviet Unions " D-Day . " Launched on June 22 of that year on the third anniversary of the Nazi attack on the USSR , the Red Army offensive was coordinated with the Western Allies Normandy landings and resulted in the decimation of Hitlers army groups in central Russia and the liberation of the USSR.19 <p> SS Oversight of the Evacuation of Volksdeutsche in Ukraine As the eastern fronts collapse appeared more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the systematic evacuation of sizeable ethnic German groups from occupied territories now threatened by the Sovietsthose who were considered part of the German race and thus deserving of protection . The first ethnic Germans in need of relocation included those in eastern Ukraine and the Crimea . By mid-March 1944 , as military prospects deteriorated further , SS-Leader Heinrich Himmler , Hitlers trusted right-hand man , decided to evacuate all remaining ethnic Germans from occupied Ukraine and Transnistria to German-annexed Polish territory called Warthegau . Many other remaining German minorities from the rest of Eastern Europe , including those from the Siebenbnrgen settlements in northwest Romania , followed in short order . <p> It is important to consider the critical role played by the Schutzstaffel or SS ( Security Staff ) toward ethnic Germans ( then called the Volksdeutsche ) during this period . Formed in 1925 , the SS had rather modest beginnings in serving as Hitlers personal bodyguardthe elite and loyal vanguard of Nazism . In 1929 , Hitler selected Himmler to be the new SS-Leader .

As head of state security , the ultimate bureaucrat Himmler soon proved instrumental in transforming the SS into the prime weapon of Hitlers ideological arsenal , accumulating more and more power on its behalf . By the middle of World War II , after Hitler marched into Eastern Europe , the now all-powerful SS had evolved into a sprawling empire of security services , military units , concentration and death camps , slave-labor industries , and welfare and research institutions . By 1944 , it had become a virtual state within the state . The ruthless SS had permeated all corners of the vast Nazi empire , which was notorious for overlapping and competing agencies , a rather chaotic form of government when compared with the highly centralized , top-down Stalinist system.20 <p> For the SS , this immense power and prestige in the Third Reich was not least of all intended to serve a higher purpose , namely the establishment of a New Order based on race or blood . The outbreak of war in 1939 afforded this elite organization an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939 , for example , Hitler assigned Himmler with the task of resettling ethnic Germans from parts of Eastern Europe now allotted to the Soviet Union . To meet these demands , a new SS agency under Himmler was required . The new SS-resettlement office responsible for these efforts was the Reichskommissariat fnr die Festigung deutschen Volkstums ( RKFDV ) or Reich Commission for the Strengthening of Germandom . Though Hitler regarded resettlement more as a diplomatic necessity , Himmler saw it as the beginning of a grand new racial project in the east.21 <p> The SS-Leader at this time began to coordinate and even assume control over other groups and organizations devoted to the Volksdeutsche . In addition , he began to establish contacts with ethnic associations abroad , what scholar Valdis O. Lumans refers to as Himmlers " auxiliaries . " One such " auxiliary " organization included the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle ( VoMi ) or Ethnic German Liaison Office . In 1935 , the Nazi Party organized VoMi to centralize and oversee all groups and activities inside of Germany concerned with ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership , Himmler managed to draw VoMi into his expanding sphere of influence , practically making it an SS department in all but name only.22 <p> Upon Nazi expansion into the Soviet Union , Himmler followed in a scramble for power and influence in order to realize his racial dreams for the region . The SS and its various " auxiliaries " sought to promote the welfare of Volksdeutsche , but the SS-Leader was equally preoccupied with addressing the ethnic groups needs as soon as possible in order to secure his position in the east . The SS , though already receiving police and security duties behind the frontlines , continued to compete with other Nazi occupation authorities in the area , including the Wehrmacht ( combined German armed forces ) , Hermann Grings exploitative economic agencies ( Four-Year Plan and " Brown Portfolio " ) , and not least of all Rosenbergs RMO.23 By the latter part of 1943 , the SS held a firm grip over the RMO following a protracted power struggle , just as the tide of war had shifted to the Soviets favor.24 <p> Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration in the occupied east under Rosenberg promised evacuating Ukrainian Germans that they would return home to their native villages after lost territories were recovered or at least once final victory was achieved . SS internal reports from mid-March 1944 indicate that such assurances were already creating unrest among numerous ethnic Germans , and thereby making them more reluctant to leave their homes and villages . For a long time , some Volksdeutsche clung to these rather hollow promises . Many high-ranking SS officials , including Himmler , however , acknowledged the hard reality of the fast eroding eastern front . In the SS-leaders estimation , the Ukrainian Germans now had to be treated and resettled as permanent ethnic refugees in Warthegau and not to be left susceptible to additional Soviet incursions.25 <p> In particular , the SS Resettlement Office had long opposed the Rosenberg Ministrys dream of converting local ethnic Germans into " indigenous " leaders of a future Nazi empire in the east . It had expressed little such confidence in the RMOs strategic plan , even if Germanys war status would have improved in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had favored the segregation of ethnic Germans in the USSR from " genuine Easterners , " because they were still supposedly susceptible to local ethnic " contamination . " It also had held that since the ethnic Germans " have absorbed to a large extent Bolshevik and Russian doctrine , they can not be considered suitable persons for guidance and leadership in Russia . " 26 Thus with Himmlers approval , it was now necessary for the SS to transfer these people to Polish provinces absorbed by the Reich.27 <p> Because of wartime conditions and the enormous scale of the task at hand , the SS often had to improvise the series of mass evacuations of ethnic Germans . Three general cluster groups ( enclaves ) of German villages in western Ukraine , sometimes called " colonies , " experienced the SS mass transfer of 1943 and 1944the Grossliebental , Kutschurgan , and Beresan . Also , there still remained scattered German communities in Volhynia ( today in northwestern Ukraine ) and Mennonite settlements such as the Molotschna in south-central Ukraine.28 <p> From late 1943 to mid-1944 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred under the SS.29 The first phase began in August 1943 with the removal of ethnic Germans from the northeastern Black Sea region and southern Ukraine , including the Crimea . Many of these included Mennonites from the Molotschna region.30 By this time , the Soviet armies were threatening these areas . Often removed by train , about 73,000 of these Germans were ultimately placed in Warthegau to live and work on seized Polish farms . The second evacuation phase took place between October 1943 and March 1944 , when approximately 72,000 ethnic Germans from western parts of Ukraine went to " Greater " Germany . Many of these Germans were relocated as cheap labor for the rearmaments industry in the Third Reich . In January 1944 , a third removal action concerned about 44,600 Germans in Volhynia . The final emergency action affected the 135,000 ethnic Germans from Transnistria , who left in mid-March 1944 and arrived in Warthegau between May and June 1944 . By July 1944 , as the eastern front crumbled , nearly all Ukrainian Germans had been evacuated.31 <p> Life , Fear and Death on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Russia literature recounting this episode has appeared over the past thirty years in both English and German . The literature , including the voices of a good number of women authors , has helped provide a common historical link among members of a Diaspora ethnic community crisscrossing the globe since the war.32 <p> By most accounts , anxiety , uncertainty and fear pervaded the Ukrainian German villages as the news spread about an impending mass evacuation . Villagers made the painful realization that the removal from Ukraine would perhaps last forever . Having survived the Stalinist Terror only several years earlier , many of them dreaded Soviet reprisals upon capture , something perhaps far worse than leaving their traditional villages and homelands.33 On the general matter of forced population transfers ( so-called " ethnic cleansing " ) , Shaw embraces and even expands on the remarkable scholar Raphael Lemkins original definition of genocide established in 1944 , which also recognizes as genocidal the cultural and social destruction of particular communities , and not simply their physical annihilation . Though acknowledging gray zones in defining such concepts , Shaw observes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which mass expulsions of established populations would be legal , and impossible to conceive that they would be just . It is also difficult to imagine how they would not raise questions of genocide . The most plausible prima facie exceptions are those that are perpetrated by a state claiming to protect its " own " people . Thus prior to the destruction of German communities by the Allied victors after 1945 , some Germans of the Baltic states and elsewhere had already opted for German citizenship " pursuant to the population transfer treaties negotiated by Hitlers Germany with those countries between 1939 and 1941 " ; others had been evacuated by the retreating German army 1943-1945 . To the extent that the people involved genuinely embraced these movements , it is difficult to see them as genocidal . However , many movements were hardly voluntary : local Germans also had to follow the occupiers orders , and their lives were put at risk by " their " states violence against others.34 <p> Nervous villagers had to prepare for evacuation on relatively short notice , with perhaps a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers worked themselves into a near stupor following the evacuation announcement . Women made baked goods , while the men butchered animals to make sausage . Villagers had to work fast to procure a few basic provisions for a long and dangerous journey . <p> In late 1943 , the SS often transported the initial refugee groups , especially Mennonites , from eastern parts of Ukraine and the Crimea by train ( even in cattle cars filled with straw ) , since the Soviet military threat was most pressing in these areas . The accommodations were hardly first-class , but it was faster than and preferable to walking or traveling by wagon at that critical time . Those who were allowed on the trains in the first phase of evacuations still had to contend with bitter winter weather and various delays as they approached German-occupied Poland through the Carpathian Mountains . Problems on this leg of the journey included typhoid fever , lice , and a lack of proper heating , among other things . <p> Subsequent German groups who departed from Ukraine on foot or by wagon as late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order to evacuate , they hurried to repair wagons and harnesses . With the specter of advancing Soviet troops seeking revenge on all Germans looming over them , the villagers trepidation can only be imagined , especially when they saw long wagon trains from neighboring eastern communities already streaming past them.35 Amid the frenzy , they often could only take with them basic necessities and perhaps a small number of livestock for such a long journey . One female survivor from the village of Strassenfeld reminisces : " We ourselves started out with our cow , but had to leave her behind on the road ; we milked her and left the bucket of milk standing next to her so that she and her calf could survive for a while or until someone else might take care of them . She bellowed after us as if she knew that we were leaving , as if she did not want to be left behind like that . " 36 <p> For those who went on foot or by wagon , the treks first stage usually passed through Romania and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically lasted about two to three months . Village mayors often directed the wagon trains , thus keeping people together on a village basis as much as possible . The SS provided itineraries to the village leaders , informing them on where the trek was to proceed.37 <p> Sometimes refugee families had to share the few available wagons . Wherever possible , the children were placed in the heavily laden wagons , and the adults proceeded on foot . At other times , the children had to walk alongside the wagons with the adults . On the roads , the village caravans were now quite exposed and vulnerable to the harsh natural elements . It is not hard to imagine the many inconveniences and difficulties involved for pregnant women , children , the sick , and the elderly . Occasionally , refugees had to set up make-shift shelters or find abandoned farms and barns in which to stay . Sometimes they even slept under the stars . Depending on the terrain , weather , and other factors , a typical days journey on foot and by wagon covered between 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding wagon caravans stretched out for miles , slithering their way westward . Accompanying the flood of refugees were small groups of armed SS-men as well as " self-defense units " ( **26;864;TOOLONG ) formed among the few remaining able-bodied ethnic German males . Following the Nazi military conscription of most eligible young Ukrainian German men after February 1943 , a large percentage of refugees included the elderly , women , and children . Also , the 1930s Stalinist repression and terror had exiled or killed off many of the adult males from the ethnic German villages , depleting the presence of grandfathers , fathers , uncles , and older brothers . According to scholar Hans Werner , " by World War II , one-half of ethnic German families in the Soviet Union had no fathers . " 38 <p> One trek survivor recalls that when wagons broke down , fellow refugees or other wagon trains would not necessarily stop to help repair a broken spoke or wheel . In some cases , SS-men or German soldiers assisted them and got them on their way . Under such dire circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes the best and the worst came out in people.39 Some eyewitnesses also remember the random acts of kindness as well as generous offerings of food and shelter on the part of local ethnic Germans and other nationality groups , including Romanians , Bulgarians , and Turks , as they made their way . Others , however , recall the Romanians relatively cool reception to the incoming refugees.40 <p> Refugees , however , also had to contend with certain local nationalities who hated the Nazi occupiers . In western Ukraine , for example , Soviet partisans shot at them . Sometimes refugees who wandered off the main routes during a pause in the journey in order to feed their livestock , gather firewood , or secure food simply never returned , picked off by guerrillas . Not least of all , the menacing shadow of the Soviet Army always pursued the caravans . At times , refugees could even hear the sound of distant guns on the fluid battle front . <p> Unexpected heavy rains , sleet , and even blizzards struck parts of Romania in March and April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and steep hills , especially as refugees approached the great Carpathians , also presented hurdles along the route , not to mention the constant worry of finding enough fodder for the draft horses and livestock . Many survivors frequently recall the terribly thick mud and slime on the primitive roads , and it was not uncommon for wagons to get stalled in the omnipresent muck . Wagon caravans at times had to stop at Romanian or other ethnic villages for a number of days because of bad weather and other logistical problems . The local village populationsincluding groups as diverse as ethnic Turks and ethnic Bulgarianswere obliged by Nazi authorities to make accommodations for refugees in their dwellings . Some locals were quite hospitable with their German guests , expressing genuine curiosity about the most recent war news . Other locals contemplated their own dark future under possible Soviet occupation , especially Romanians in Bessarabia who already had their first taste of Communist " paradise " in 1940-1941.41 In other cases , wagon trains in Romania stopped overnight in the still empty villages once inhabited by the Bessarabian Germansan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of 1944 , some of the more unfortunate wagon caravans fell victim to intermittent Soviet attacks and even capture . For instance , Red Army forces fired upon and took prisoner most of the villagers from Selz of the Kutschurgan Enclave who were delayed in their motorized ferry crossing on April 6-7 , 1944 , along the Dniester River.42 <p> Refugees , exhausted and mud- or dust-covered at certain stops , in some instances made locals mistakenly believe that they were Gypsy ( Roma ) caravans passing through the area . They halted along the routes to eat and rest , whenever possible , but sometimes it was essential to prepare food and eat on the moving wagons . One trek survivor recalls in her published memoirs eating Zwieback as a staple food that her mother had prepared for them before the journey . It was an egg-bread roll , sliced and even dried , a staple in her peoples diet . Sometimes dried fruit , such as apples , were brought along for the winter journey , she remembers , but no vegetables . Malnutrition and outright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety , as rumors , fears , and misguided hopes spread by word of mouth among the villagers , German soldiers , and Nazi officials meeting along the way.43 <p> According to a number of personal accounts , some " elite " SS men held a rather low opinion of the impoverished ethnic German refugees , especially those who came from the Soviet Union , as they were believed to be " Bolshevized " ( i.e. , socially " backward " and lacking personal initiative ) and of lesser racial or ethnic value than German groups leaving other parts of Eastern Europe , such as Romania.44 Various SS welfare officers and civilian administrators indeed expressed sincere concern for the refugees , but the sprawling Nazi empire also employed less than receptive authority figures . For instance , in his trek diary entry for May 1 , 1944 , refugee Walter Hornbacher expresses a pervasive ambivalence between certain officials and the refugees during the trek . He writes , " So as not to get consumed by the bears the Soviet Russians , we had to remain among the wolves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing incidents of SS harassment of non-German locals during the journey , such as whipping people and shooting at farm animals . In one recorded incident , a trek leader even made disparaging remarks in front of a refugee group about how he as one SS man in Germany was worth more than the thousands of them.46 <p> As the final waves of humanity moved west in the spring of 1944 , a more than 150-year history of Germans in Ukraine ended . Personal accounts tell how villagers , men and women of all ages , cried and could not look back as they departed their traditional villages and homelands . Adding to the growing despair and homesickness were the odd scenes of chickens , pigs , goats , and cows set free and running loose in house yards and village streets . Rafael Jundt , a refugee from the village of Selz in the Kutschurgan Enclave , captures this sentiment of pain and loss in his 1994 poem , " Farewell to My Hometown , Selz , Fifty Years Ago " : <p> One final time I stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my village Like a queen , though in travail . <p> With her vineyards and fruitful fields Where the Liman does glide , There was the village , Selz , Known far and wide . <p> With its beautiful church and its dwellings In fun magnificence it lay . There , as in a dream My youth had passed away . <p> Then came the days of hardship , I had to leave you there . From place to place I wandered It was more than I could bear . <p> And you , my beloved Selz , You stayed behind me alone . You could not come along with me And I could not go home.47 <p> Many German village main streets like Selzs fell silent by March 1944 . Soon Ukrainian nationals moved into the abandoned German villages and homes , where their descendants reside today . <p> At locations in Romania and Hungary , such as the city of Dej , which Romania had to cede to Hungary until the end of the war despite that both countries were Nazi allies , the treks last stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken , other departure sites by train were located in Yugoslavia . Again , travel accommodations on crowded trains often proved less than satisfactory , and just as with the wagon caravans , there always remained the threat of Allied bombing attacks or sabotage of rail lines by local partisans . <p> Refugees Anton Bosch and Josef Lingor , who at the time were children from the village of Kandel in the Kutschurgan Enclave , recount a touching story about their unforgettable experience at Dej in mid-May 1944 . Here the weary German refugees stepped off the wagons and had to transport their baggage to the citys train station . A German army commission awaited them at the station and announced that all draft horses and wagons were to be requisitioned for military purposes . The soldiers then issued the farmers receipts for future reimbursement . Indeed , both the Soviet and German armies utilized hundreds of thousands of draft horses in World War II ; not everything was mechanized in those days . Because people traditionally tied to the land often grow quite attached to their livestock and draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elderly Kandel farmers wept bitterly with the departure of their beloved animals , which had served them well not only in the old village , but on the long , difficult trek to Dej . Refugees from other villages detail similar emotional outbursts , when people had to part from their trusted draft horses . Bosch and Lingor also recall that just a few hours after the exchange , the refugees from their village proceeded by train in the direction of Budapest , Hungary , arriving days later at the final destination of Lodz , Poland.48 <p> Arrival and Processing in Lodz , Poland ( Litzmannstadt ) From January 1940 until January 1945 , the Polish city of Lodz ( which the Nazis renamed Litzmannstadt ) served as the EWZ headquarters.49 One among many countless and overlapping Nazi " alphabet-soup " organizations , the EWZ stood for **26;892;TOOLONG ( Immigration Main Office ) , falling under SS oversight . In view of the long journey to Poland , Maria Kreiser later reflected that she and her fellow refugees " appropriately translate these three letters as Eternally Wandering Zigeuner ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis Island , " the EWZ at Lodz functioned as the central distribution point , welfare office , and archival repository for all ethnic Germans from across Europe , above all the occupied eastern territories . <p> The SS compiled meticulous records of vital statistics of all individuals who entered the Third Reich , as the Hitler regime considered itself the guardian of a clearly defined racial community . More than 400,000 applications by ethnic Germans living outside of the Third Reich between 1939 and 1945 have survived the war . The US Third Army under General George S. Patton captured most of the EWZ records near Nuremberg , Bavaria , in April 1945 , though about 70,000-80,000 documents were already lost or destroyed by that time . The US Government held these records until shortly after German unification in 1990 , when it agreed to transfer control to the Berlin Document Center.51 As many as 8,000 microfilm rolls of all surviving EWZ records remain accessible for viewing through the U.S. National Archives in College Park , Maryland.52 Since the 1990s , many researchers have combed these records now made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing in detail how the refugee application process for German naturalization worked . <p> In Lodz , all new arrivals first took a bath or shower for " delousing , " soon followed by screening , registration , and ultimately final resettlement . The Immigration Main Office consisted of various departments , such as administration , planning , accounts and registration , health and nationality matters , and it also created branch offices.53 Sometimes , particularly as the scope of the evacuations grew , " roaming " review boards or commissions ( Fliegende Kommissionen ) were established to help process individuals and families in surrounding refugee camps.54 Each roving panel consisted of 40 to 70 staff members.55 <p> Extensive registration procedures were involved with the EWZ at Lodz . Usually six to nine staff members conducted each screening session , which normally lasted three to four hours . Over time , as workloads increased , a session was extended to six hours , then two days . Though families were always processed together , all individuals aged 15 and over were registered separately.56 <p> EWZ processed each family at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lumans describes the initial stages of its screening procedure : <p> ... At the first station , a policeman scrutinized the familys papers and added any missing forms . The second station prepared identification papers and compiled all personal information . After a photographing session at station three , the family proceeded to station four , at which all property matters were settled . The amount of property left behind was ascertained , and the resettlers were issued receipts stating how much and what type of compensation they were to receive.57 <p> The primary EWZ form included sections to fill in ones name , age , place of origin , date of entry , and two photos ( full face and profile ) . Each individual file also established an applicants German background through a so-called " national passport " ( Volkstumausweis ) or " resettler status form " ( Umsielderausweis ) , which often had been issued to ethnic Germans during the Nazi occupation of the east in 1942 . In addition , the " family form " ( Stammblatt ) identified the ethnic backgrounds of an applicants parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes going back as far as four generations to prove German ancestry . Finally , individuals filled out a naturalization application form ( Einbnrgerungsantrag ) . Upon processing the application , the SS issued a declaration of naturalization ( Einbnrgerungsverfngung or Vfg. in abbrevation ) . EWZ officials also inserted related correspondence into an applicants file.58 <p> " The fifth stop , " according to Lumans , " was the most important . Designated as the physical examination station , it in fact performed racial examinations . The examiners had instructions to be discreet , since Himmler wanted the resettlers to think that these inspections were medical , not racial . " 59 Indeed , this physical probing and measuring almost always represented nothing more than phrenology or the pseudo-scientific practice of skull measurements and related racial profiling . Lumans uncovers one documented case where the SS examiner grew annoyed with a group of refugees ( it is unclear whether they came from Ukraine ) who had found the whole procedure so comical that they had broken out laughing . According to the report , the examiner scolded them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important this examination was for you , you would trouble yourself to be serious . " 60 <p> In many respects , the arrival of Ukrainian Germans into Warthegau revealed the stark racial dichotomy of the Nazi New Order . The city of Lodz by mid-1944 contained the last major Jewish Ghetto in all of Europe ; only the Warsaw Ghetto had been larger before the Nazis liquidated it just a year earlier . As the EWZ processed the final waves of the Ukrainian German flood , a last SS " special action " deported nearly all of the remaining 74,000 Jews to Auschwitzs gas chambers . More than 200,000 Jews had lived in the Lodz Ghetto as of 1942.61 <p> At station six , a familys political status faced scrutiny from the SS security police services ( Sipo-SD ) . In particular , this matter concerned the documentation of previous political activities , and reliable witnesses from the old home country often attended here to verify the familys political past . Interestingly , most of the refugee cases from the eastern territories , including the Soviet Union , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west.62 Perhaps the SS factored in the more repressive and extreme features of political life under Stalinism . Indeed , the EWZ records give us a better sense of the extent of persecution during the Stalinist era . Many Soviet Germansespecially during the worst periods of state persecution in 1930 , 1937 and 1938fell victim to Stalins collectivization drives and mass political purges . On the forms , the SS often simply listed the refugees missing family members from this period as " deported " or " evacuated " ( verschleppt ) .63 <p> Station seven decided a refugees occupation and final placement . In consideration of racial and political factors , this stage determined whether a family was assigned to work in agriculture , industry , or other trades . Most of these refugees were rural folk , however . Before the war turned against the Reich , Himmler had envisioned racially and politically acceptable Volksdeutsche buttressing the eastern expanses as " peasant-soldiers , " while the inferior or more ethnically susceptible ones would be relocated to the " Old Reich " ( Altreich ) as farm laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that " unless someone possessed a particularly crucial skill , racial and political considerations took precedence in determining a familys final placement . " 64 <p> The eighth and final station consisted of a review panel that evaluated all the examination results in order to establish a familys classification , upon which it provided refugees with identification cards and documentation . Lumans careful examination of Lodz indicates two fundamental categories prevailing among the refugees : " O-cases ( Ost ) , those selected as colonists in the east , and the A-cases ( Altreich ) , those designated to remain in the Reich . The primary consideration for both was racial quality . " 65 <p> Four racial classifications determined the O- and A-cases . Racial categories I and II included those families who were " above average " and " average " respectively . Meanwhile , racial category III consisted of those deemed " below average , " while group IV pinpointed those who were " unacceptable . " Categories I and II , including some cases in group III , were intended to remain in the occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the O-cases ) , while the lower classifications were designated for the Reich to undergo " Germanization " ( i.e. , the A-cases ) . Those cases from groups III and IV where the families were considered to be " non-German , " however , received the " S " designation , which meant either returning to the country of origin or settlement in the General Government of Poland with other " undesirables . " In this hierarchical , unequal racial system , the identification card colors gave the sole indication of the category to which a family now belonged.66 In short , a familys future status rested much upon the findings of a relatively brief classification procedure at Lodz . <p> According to Marianne Wheelers findings , the EWZ by the beginning of 1944 had registered about 771,000 ethnic Germans from all parts of Europe , with most coming from the USSR . Out of that total number , the SS resettled roughly 403,000 into eastern occupied areas like Warthegau ( O-cases ) , more than 70,000 received jobs in Germany proper ( A-cases ) , and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Finally , another 279,000 at this time were either still undergoing the screening process or were awaiting final placement.67 <p> Deceptive as it might seem , Nazi ideology gave rise to these EWZ genealogical records , as they comprised one part of a vast and deliberate racial record-keeping system to separate the so-called " master race " or " Aryans " from supposed " mixed " and " inferior " races . To understand this racial dichotomy , which meant life or death in the New Order , we need only compare the fate of the Lodz Jews in mid-1944 with that of the EWZ refugees . Without denying the enormous educational or factual value of these archival records , we should nonetheless pause to remember their historical context and original political purpose . Indeed , behind all the documents , names , dates , and statistics are human stories.68 <p> By July 1944 , the last of the Ukrainian Germans had stepped off the trains in Lodz . During the final year of the war , the refugees were now integrated into the ever-shrinking Third Reich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to observation camps until a suitable permanent destination was secured . The SS referred to the process of transferring screened German refugees to new locations in Warthegau as Durchschleusung ( " dispersal " ) . Nazi authorities in Warthegau also issued each refugee a preliminary identification card called a Bescheinigung . It is indeed quite remarkable that the SS bureaucratic machinery continued to implement the naturalization guidelines almost until the end of the war , even when it was becoming increasingly evident to authorities and refugees alike that such formalities were ultimately futile.69 <p> As wartime conditions only worsened , some groups of ethnic Germans resettled in " Greater " Germany felt compelled to post official complaints to SS-leader Himmler about the sometimes harsh working conditions and inadequate living accommodations . For example , on May 1 , 1944 , a complaint signed by 35 resettled German refugees from Ukraine was submitted to him . Their background was probably in agriculture and other related skilled trades , and they were working by this time as cheap labor for a German-run factory called Firm Robot ( Machine Factory ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 230 ethnic Germans working there . Highlights of their urgent appeal , which later appeared as Allied evidence against the SS during the Nuremberg Military Tribunals , follow : <p> Dear Herr Himmler , <p> We , the German resettlers from Ukraine , who have been put to work with the Firm Robot , are in difficulties and request assistance and help . <p> We are quartered in three barracks and in a large room in the factory building . In each room in the barracks , there are 24 persons and 70 in the large room ( in the factory building ) . The barracks have more the appearance of warehouses than homes for human beings . There are no ceilings and the walls and roofs are full of holes . <p> They were previously inhabited by Eastern workers and many children died there . The rooms are overcrowded and , therefore , the workers from both shifts have no facilities to rest and to collect their strength for work . Not even the most elementary sanitary facilities exist in the camp ( no hot water , no washrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already sick . <p> ... All our people are used as unskilled laborers in spite of the fact that there are people among us who have professions , many years of practice , and experience . They would be of much better use to the Reich if they were working in their profession . <p> ... We are being fed in the plant kitchen but we receive staple food for the whole week according to ration cards . In spite of our requests , the firm has not given us our Reich ration cards and has only promised to give us these cards in June in spite of the fact that the firm already received them for us in April . <p> ... It is still worse as far as the childrens food is concerned .... For supper , the children as well as the adults usually receive the remains of the noon meal diluted with water . <p> They conclude : <p> We are all refugees from combat areas who have lost everything ; our children have no shoes and are ill-clad ; we ask for an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in our distress because the firm promised us so much and kept so little ; we ask you to visit us after 1800 hours 6 p.m. because we are working in the plant from 0600 to 1800 hours 6 a.m. to 6 p.m . . <p> Heil , Hitler.70 <p> The Firm Robot episode poses deeper questions about the overall impact of resettlement on large segments of the refugee population , who had traditionally practiced agricultural and related professions . In many respects , the events of 1943-1944 helped destroy not only the Ukrainian Germans old villages and homelands , but ultimately many of the remaining vestiges of the peasantrys traditional way of life . The psychological and emotional impact of both Nazi and Soviet policies on ethnic German peasants and workers during this period of massive social dislocation deserves further exploration , as do the effects of the Nazis forced removal of local Poles from their communities and homes . Even before their arrival in Poland , Hornbacher contemplates this issue in his trek diary entry for June 4 , 1944 , recognizing the increasing stress factorsfear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many refugees , especially the women : <p> The head down , they trudge ahead , not turning backfarther along day by day . The facial expressions betray that these shadowy figures , their previous life rolling past their eyes like a film , are dreaming of the future . The people themselves have changed . They have become quite something else . They drag silently along . They are very quickly irritated and quite nervous . An unmistakable spiritual and moral pressure burdens the people . That is also the reason for the nervousness and irritability and probably the source for the ever-increasing quarreling and fighting among the people . Today , two women again have been getting on each others nerves . On these occasions , people lose their heads.71 <p> In his entry for June 14 , 1944 , he writes further on the subject : " Over the course of time , the men increasingly lost spiritual and moral balance . And always the results are frequently growing friction and conflict . Today , two men who got into a scuffle were the exception . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate on the refugees flood of thoughts and feelings at this time . Perhaps in part they were seeking survival and redemption in the " ancient homeland " ( Urheimat ) of Germany , but they were also running away from the painful hardships and memories experienced under Lenin and Stalin . Perhaps they now knew that they were not only heading into an uncertain future , but that their departure from their native lands was the final , bitter acknowledgment that their missing loved ones swept away into the night by Stalin and his henchmen only a few years earlier were indeed gone forever ; the last shreds of hope for joyous family reunions were now discarded for good . Also lurking in the back of their troubled minds was perhaps the fundamental desire to flee from Nazisms unwashed crime scenes that stained the entire region . <p> Based on available testimony , some groups of resettled ethnic Germans in Warthegau received kinder treatment , better shelter , and more food than others , depending on local circumstances . Of course , this was wartime , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground like Georg Leibbrandt and Karl Stumpppost-World War I German TmigrTs from Ukrainewent out of their way to assist the refugees , as far as it was humanly possible.73 In the final stages of the war , Stumpp had even grown depressed , disillusioned and isolated , seeing his ethnic compatriots increasingly as pawns of the vast Nazi administrative apparatus.74 In one case , a group of settlers from the Ukrainian German village of Mariental was assigned to live in a mortuary chapel ( morgue ) in a Catholic cemetery in Warthegau . For two months , they lived among the graves until a better location was found.75 <p> During the trek and in Warthegau , refugees sometimes received mail from their sons already serving in the Third Reichs various military branches.76 Some families also had the misfortune to get military death notices.77 To add to the heartache , beginning in September 1944 Nazi authorities conscripted the last remaining able-bodied men among ethnic Germans between the ages of 16 and 60 into the Wehrmacht ( combined German armed forces ) or Waffen-SS ( the military wing of the SS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legions , however , revealing just how powerful Himmler had become . Many of these soldiers never returned home to their families.78 <p> The Ethnic German Diaspora : 1945 and Beyond In January 1945 , the Soviets unleashed their last great military offensive . They advanced into Warthegau and pierced the original boundaries of the crumbling Third Reich . Mass panic set in among resettled ethnic Germans and native German residents alike , who now comprehended just how dire their predicament had become . A tidal wave of humanity raced westward , as now millions feared capture and even death at the hands of the understandably vengeful Soviets . Even before the wars conclusion , many German officials and civilians had already learned where the Allies planned to establish their respective occupation zones . For the most part , Germans sought to move as far west as possible in order to come under American and British control.79 <p> What was the treks legacy , and what was the fate of nearly 350,000 refugees ? Brown concludes correctly that " the German army came to bring order and Germanic civilization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ravished terrain . In just two years of occupation , German forces killed or transplanted nearly all of the Jewish and German communities of Ukraine . " 80 This traumatic ordeal was not least of all a human struggle against primitive living conditions , uncompromising natural elements , and a hostile wartime environment . An estimated 20,000-25,000 Ukrainian Germans died during the trek and SS resettlement process , or roughly 6-7% of the group total.81 <p> By late 1945 , shortly after the war , Communist authorities had captured or reclaimed most Soviet citizens of German nationality who fled during the conflict . Even in the western occupation zones , Allied officials ended up returning about 25,000 or one-quarter of their 100,000 refugees to Soviet officials , in accordance with Allied agreements at Yalta and Potsdam ( unofficially called " Operation Keelhaul " ) .82 According to the Mennonite Historical Atlas , " In all at least 23,000 of the 35,000 Mennonites about two-thirds who started on the Great Trek were sent back to the Soviet Union , mostly to the far north or Siberia . " 83 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans from the USSR , but to all Soviet citizens of any nationality found in occupied Germany and the liberated countries of Central and Eastern Europe , including POWs , slave laborers , and others . Sometimes the Soviets sent out posses or made brief incursions into the western zones . In other instances , they made false promises to Soviet citizens of German background that they would be returned to their native villages in Ukraine . In the immediate postwar period , many Germans from the Soviet Union now living in the western occupation zones had to be careful not to disclose their identity for fear of seizure by the Soviets.84 <p> Consequently , more than 200,000 of these valuable Soviet citizen-workers of German nationality , about two-thirds of the total , endured yet another deportation , this time packed into box cars from occupied Germany to Soviet Siberias and Central Asias remote labor camps called " special settlements . " Of this total number captured and returned , almost 70,000 or about one-third were minors under age 17 . For both economic and ideological reasons , Soviet authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the western Allies often had no choice but to oblige them . Upon their departure eastward , the ethnic German men were segregated from the women and children , but they all now joined the Volga Germans and other groups in official banishment until the mid-1950sand beyond.85 <p> Most scholars give a conservative estimate of 10-25% for the death rate of all ethnic Germans exiled by the Soviets during the immediate postwar period , a quite substantial number , but some figures go even higher . Exact calculations remain elusive , however . A good share of these deportation survivors now found themselves separated from relatives still living in the west . Moreover , they continued to carry the " fascist " stigma inside the USSR long after their exile concluded . On the whole , these deportations constituted the ethnic groups defining formative experience in the USSR.86 <p> When Cold War relations temporarily improved during dTtente , several thousand Ukrainian German exiles , only a trickle , received Soviet permission to emigrate to West Germany in the 1970s based on a policy of family reunification . Many tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the end of the Cold War before they could rejoin family members in a new , united Germany.87 <p> More than 70,000 Ukrainian German refugees , or about 20% of the total SS transfer , were permitted to remain in postwar West Germany . Amid the devastation across much of Europe , they received much-needed assistance through the International Red Cross and various international religious charities and organizations ( i.e. , Mennonite , Lutheran , Catholic , Baptist , Adventist , and Methodist ) . They also hoped to locate , if possible , family members and friends lost or missing as a result of the wartime chaos . <p> Many refugees of various nationalities who ended up in the western occupation zones of Germany applied to become Displaced Persons ( DPs ) , a new legal category established by the late 1940s for Europeans dislocated by the war . For instance , President Harry Truman ( 1945-1953 ) signed the United States first refugee law , the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 , allowing the legal entry of people dislocated by World War II into the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1950 to include those who came from Communist-dominated countries and feared persecution if they should ever return . In addition , DPs had to receive sponsorship from individuals , businesses , or organizations abroad capable of providing them with gainful employment , as government welfare was not permitted . The three primary groups of DPs into the United States consisted of Jews ( Holocaust survivors ) , East European nationalities ( especially Poles ) , and ethnic Germans from different parts of Eastern Europe . Between 1948 and 1951 , one-third of those admitted into the country were Poles , with ethnic Germans in second place . Around this time , other Western countries adopted similar refugee policies.88 <p> In particular , many Ukrainian Germans refugees who qualified as DPs sought new economic opportunities and political liberties outside of war-ravaged Europe . Some of them also expressed a perpetual fear of Communism as a result of their hard years spent in the USSR ; they desired to move as far away as possible from Europe.89 After 1948 , DPs of Ukrainian German background often received support and sponsorship from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who had migrated abroad decades earlier.90 With promises by sponsors that gainful employment was available to DPs , about 30,000 or roughly 40% of all Ukrainian Germans living in postwar West Germany primarily left for the United States , Canada , South America , and even Australia . Most of them arrived in their adopted homelands by the mid-1950s and were determined to establish new lives.91 <p> From Ukrainian Borderlands to North Dakota Prairies : The DP Case of Emma ( Schmalz ) Rieger Emma ( Schmalz ) Riegers ( 1918-2008 ) dramatic personal chronicle was in many respects a microcosm of the social and political vicissitudes then taking place in Ukraine . The oldest of seven children , she was born in the German village of Kandel in the Kutschurgan Enclave along the Dniester River , entering a world already shaken by profound political change and deep social turmoil . She survived the Russian Civil War ( 1918-1920 ) and the Stalinist mass famines and purges of the 1930s . Village witnesses and recently opened Soviet archival records report that Communist authorities at the height of Stalins Terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1899-1937 ) . The Soviet government performed the execution in retaliation for Barbaras taking personal care of Roman Catholic Bishop Antonius Zerr ( 1849-1932 ) in his final days and for her engaging in clandestine religious activities.92 <p> Following Hitlers invasion of the Soviet Union , Emma and her village witnessed the Romanian occupation of Transnistria under Nazi supervision , beginning in early August 1941 . The SS soon established its area headquarters in the nearby village of Selz to the north , and ample evidence shows that its death squads ( Einsatzgruppen ) and local auxiliaries executed Jews , Communists , and other political " unreliables " ( including some ethnic Germans ) in the area . In 1943 , during the Nazis last great military conscription drive in the war93 , Emmas husband and two younger brothers , like many young men in Kandel and surrounding German villages between the ages of 18 and 35 , were conscripted into the Waffen-SS.94 <p> As the war turned against Hitler , the SS ordered the evacuation of Emmas village on March 19 , 1944 . More than 3,500 Kandelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles on foot and by wagon through most of Romania . When boarding the train at the city of Dej in Romania , they had to deliver their horses and wagons to the German army . From there , their train passed through Hungary and Czechoslovakia , and on May 22 , 1944 , after a two-month exodus , they arrived at the EWZ in Lodz , Poland . After processing the refugees , the SS resettled the Kandelers onto confiscated Polish farms in Warthegau , near the city of Jarotschin , on May 28 , 1944.95 <p> By the end of 1944 or at the very beginning of 1945 , before the last great Soviet military drive , Emma and her two children at the time were able to leave Warthegau for Bavaria in Germany . Details for this part of the story , however , become murky , but apparently she and her children stayed with either her sister or sister-in-law , who was already living there . Between November 1944 and January 1945 , Nazi officials also decided to transfer about half ( around 1,500-1,750 ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Old Reich " ( Altreich ) , placing many of them in villages in Saxony and on farms in Thuringia . As for the remaining half of Kandel refugees left behind in Warthegau , by April and May 1945 the Soviets had seized and deported them to Siberia.96 Emma and her children in the American occupation zone therefore escaped the Red Armys rapid advance and capture . In addition , her husband and one of her sisters managed to stay out of the reach of Soviet authorities . <p> In what became West Germany , Emma soon sought a way out of war-ravaged Europe . She pursued Schmaltz family contacts abroad , because she was already aware of relatives on her fathers side who had left Russia many years earlier . She contacted a North Dakota relative who knew of John Schmaltz , Sr. ( 1879-1951 ) . In 1898 , Mr. Schmaltz had emigrated from their native Kandel , becoming a successful businessman in Strasburg , North Dakota . By the late 1940s , he had retired to nearby Linton . She proceeded to write three letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 . Though their exact family relationship remains unclear , he agreed to sponsor Emma , her husband , and their three children at the time to come to the United States as DPs . John died , however , just a few months before the Riegers arrival in March 1952 . <p> Emma and her family stayed for a month with Johns widow , Clara ( Bullinger ) Schmaltz ( 1884-1953 ) . After pursuing other Schmaltz family contacts outside of Linton , the Riegers moved in April 1952 to Minot , North Dakota , where her husband worked for 28 years at the Westlie Motor Company . The Minot Steam Laundry employed her for several years as a laundress until her retirement in 1964 . <p> Decades later , Emma mused in an oral history project interview with North Dakota State University in Fargo that she had produced four children in four countries , reflecting the many profound transitions in her life : The first , Barbara , was born in Ukraine ( the Soviet Union ) ; the second , Bernhardt , in Transnistria ; the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . All of the children could speak German well , save William who was American-born.97 <p> " Flotsam of World History " The Riegers , like so many other wartime refugees , began a new life in a new world . One of Emmas sisters decided to stay with her young family in West Germany , while her various friends and relatives from Kandel endured the exile in remote Soviet Siberia and Central Asia , scattered like leaves in the wind.98 <p> German from Russia historian and refugee , Richard H. Walth , calls the former Soviet Unions ethnic Germans the " flotsam of world history " that is , they have lived as humanity tossed about on the ocean of space and time.99 It is but one chapter of a greater tragic story . Millions of European peoples found themselves caught between the Nazis and Soviets during this time of tribulation and destruction . It is only appropriate , therefore , to conclude with respected historian Michael Burleighs insightful remarks on this most troubled era : " Our lives may be more boring than those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable to being prematurely dead because of some ideological fantasy .

Such designations as " Germans from Russia , " " Volga Germans , " " Ukrainian Germans , " " Black Sea Germans , " and " the Soviet Unions ethnic Germans " are often interchangeable . For the sake of clarity , this presentation tries to use as often as possible either " ethnic German " or " Ukrainian German " in reference to the mass transfer of 1943 and 1944 .

Much of the " Long Trek " literaturei.e. , mostly memoirs , diaries and biographiesappeared nearly two generations after the events in question , beginning in the 1970s . In part , it emerged after the successful integration of Ukrainian Germans into West German society , and because of the raised public awareness stemming from the migration of a few thousand people of Ukrainian German background from the Soviet Union to West Germany during the dTtente period . Also , some Displaced Persons ( DPs ) of Ukrainian German heritage , after establishing themselves in North America , began to document their remarkable experiences .

On the whole , the quality and sometimes even the reliability of the corpus of TmigrT memoir and biographical literature vary , but the moving stories of survival by ordinary people , most notably women , in extraordinary circumstances remain most informative of the general plight of the refugees . In addition , the authors or biographical subjects deep religiosity is often quite pronounced in their stories , understandably in view of the series of near " apocalyptic " or " exodus-like " political events experienced under both the Communists and Nazis . This reaction stems from the fact that the ethnic Germans had long expressed strong traditional ties to their resilient Catholic and Protestant faiths .

German civilian fears were not completely unfounded , as many Red Army soldiers , after fighting a brutal ideological war for nearly three years in their home country , sought revenge by raping and murdering thousands of women and girls of their Nazi enemy . The first documented case of Soviet atrocities against German civilians took place in Nemmersdorf , East Prussia , in mid-October 1944 , when the Red Army first crossed the border . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities were able to survey the carnage . A young Russian artillery officer ( later famous novelist ) Alexander Solzhenitsyn witnessed and subsequently wrote about similar or even worse episodes that occurred elsewhere in East Prussia in January 1945 . Instead of instilling the German population with the resolve to continue fighting the war , Nazi propaganda on the Nemmersdorf incident served only to inflame civilian fears even further . For all that , the conflict dragged out until May 1945 . To be fair to the Soviet side , some controversy later arose about the extent of the Nemmersdorf atrocities , as well as differing eyewitness accounts . It was true that other nearby German villages were also attacked in October 1944 .

A significant number of exiled Germans in the Soviet east worked in the mines or the forestry service . In 1945-1946 , the Soviet government also deported many captured Ukrainian Germans deemed incapable of heavy labor in the far north and Siberia to the cotton kolkhozes of Tajikistan in Central Asia . Conditions early on in Tajikistan were nonetheless quite difficult . For the first time , Tajikistan claimed a significant ethnic German minority population , though almost all 40,000 migrated to Germany ( also some to Russia ) during the 1990s amid civil war in the region .

Despite their German heritage , the ethnic immigrants to West Germany , however , found it more difficult to enter society because their imagined idea of what " home " would be like differed from the realities . In addition , Canadas established immigrant history and multi-ethnic character made the overall public reception of these new arrivals easier . By contrast , the populace of West Germany , who traditionally did not consider their country to be one of immigration , often viewed ethnic Germans as different and distinct from themselves .

At the same time , male ethnic Muslims in Bosnia ( then Yugoslavia ) also began to serve in Waffen-SS units .

@@13708286 @2308286/ <p> Humans , like all other living organisms , have genes . These genes instruct our bodies to make proteins , these proteins are the molecules that determine the shape and function of each cell . Each gene or set of genes encode for the production of a particular protein.What is a gene ? The term " gene " was created by Wilhelm Johanssen , a Danish botanist in 1911 . He was discussing units of inheritance that Mendel called factors.T.H . Morgan 's studies on fruit fly genetics led to the idea of a gene as the smallest unit of recombination . Aggregated with this idea was another that said the gene was the unit of mutation , and another that the gene is the unit of function ( the smallest unit of control over the phenotype ) . Modern evidence suggests that recombination can occur between any two nucleotide , which make the unit of recombination only one nucleotide long . Some mutations change only one nucleotide , so the unit of mutation could be only one nucleotide long . The unit of function is the cistron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the gene as the length of DNA that codes for one functional product ( 6 ) . <p> DNA of the human species carries more or less the same set of DNA with some variations . Variations in the DNA sequence can be neutral , others might have positive or negative influence . Genetic screening is testing of this variation ( 2 ) . <p> Human race carries 3000-4000 diseases in it 's genes , and it is important to distinguish between inherited diseases and infectious diseases . Inherited diseases are caused by mutated genes which are inherited by an individual from his or her parents ( 2 ) . The faulty gene will be one of the many healthy thousands of genes we possess in our cells . To pinpoint the location of these faulty genes , scientists search for variations in larger piece of DNA called markers , these subunits lie nearby on the DNA chain , and form the basis of genetic screening . <p> What is genetic screening ? <p> The principle of genetic screening is based on the binding of a probe to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screened . Complementary DNA nucleotide sequences bind to each other . The probe used is usually single stranded DNA , which binds to the test sample . The DNA sample can be analyzed by a technique called restriction fragment polymorphism ( RFLP ) . In this technique the DNA sample is cut up with a mixture of restriction enzymes which cut the DNA at a specific sequences . A radioactive probe is added to the fragments that can bind to certain sequences in the DNA . The fragments are then separated by gel electrophoresis . The DNA fragments move through the gel at varying rates depending on their molecular weight . The pattern of size distribution is quite individual , and the disease causing or linked fragment can be found . Currently the number of disorders that are screenable is measured in hundreds and is rapidly increasing , genetic diseases that have DNA probes available includes : Cystic fibrosis , Thalassemia , Hemophilia , Huntington 's chorea , Sickle cell anemia , and many more ( 3 ) . One of the problems in genetic screening is the genetic heterogeneity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where in the gene , and there are also many mutations that do not cause disease . It is possible to use different probes to cover different mutations , but it is impossible to be sure of a negative result of a disease ( 4 ) . Another problem of genetic screening is the differences in the expressivity . One person may express the disease to a different extent or at different age to another and this could be due to multiple gene action or variations in the environmental factors which can affect the expression of a certain gene ( 4 ) , an example of such differences in expressivity can be found in a disease like Wilms tumour or Glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ( 3 ) . <p> Types of genetic screening : <p> Generally there are two types of genetic screening , screening of children and adults , and screening of unborn children . Genetic screening of children and adults has two purposes : first it can confirm whether the person has a mutated genes of certain disease or characteristics . The second purpose is to test adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain disease . Knowing that one or both parents carries a dominant allele for a genetic disease might affect the decision parents make about having children , some times this kind of genetic screening is used for approval of marriage licenses in some countries , like in Danmark , marriage licenses are refused to persons carrying certain genetic defects ( 2 ) . <p> A successful screening program for Thalassemia has been used in Cyprus . This program was performed with cooperation of the local church , so all couples who were getting married have to provide a certificate showing the alleles that they have . If both of them were carriers of the Thalassemia then they would know that they should have prenatal screening . Another successful screening program for Thalassemia was performed in Italy . The carrier screening program has detected 30,500 carriers and 1544 at risk couples by mid 1990 , about 90% of possible cases are now prevented by prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion ( 3 ) . <p> The second type of genetic screening involving screening of unborn children is called Prenatal screening . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders during early pregnancy . An example of this type of screening is testing for Down 's syndrom when the mother is over 40 . Prenatal screening has been used for several decades using different techniques . The older technique used is amniocentesis , where cells from the amniotic fluid are removed and cultured . No harm is done to the fetus as these cells are no longer needed for the growth . The fetal samples can be taken at 12-16 weeks and provide sufficient material for analysis . It is now possible to take sample of the chorionic villi ( membranes around the fetus ) at 6-9 weeks and analyze the fetal DNA directly to determine whether it has a specific genetic defects . The chorionic villi sampling ( cvs ) may be combined with a maternal blood sampling to detect diseases like Spina bifida or Down 's syndrome . Ultrasound is also routinely used and has the advantage of being non-invasive ( 3 ) . But we are still unable , economically , ethically , and socially to screen every fetus for many diseases with these techniques . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high risk ( 3 ) . <p> Preimplantation screening has been used since 1989 . The first study involved embryos that were not implanted after screening . Evidence suggests that embryos are not harmed by this procedure . One ethical objection , once it is confirmed that this procedure is safe , is the interference with nature by discarding of diseased embryos at this early stage . But given the economic factors that often influence health care decisions , such as the high cost of health care for people suffering from severe diseases , this kind of screening may be encouraged by governments . On the other hand , religion has a problem with this kind of screening before the birth of the child , because the fact that carrying a defective gene does not mean that child will express this gene ( 3 ) . <p> As a result of the rapid developments in the field of genetic screening , genetic counselors are placed in a powerful position . The role of the counselors is to provide parents with information which allows them to make a good decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counselors after the birth of the first affected child to discuss the possibility of having another affected child . The acceptance of the genetic counselors from the public depends in the manner in which the counselors work . People would accept the non-directive counseling , which means that the counselors act as decision facilitators providing people with information and leaving decisions up to the patients autonomy . In many countries the genetic screening services are accompanied with counseling services ( 3 ) . <p> Benefits of genetic screening : <p> Genetic screening could have great value if used properly to help people take preventive measures to avoid suffering from some diseases . The first type of genetic screening used was screening of newborn children for PKU deficiency . This test was made compulsory in USA in 1960 's . If the new born is found to have PKU deficiency , they can be put on a special diet , and will not suffer from severe mental retardation ( 3 ) . <p> Genetic screening also works out economically , because it is cheaper to treat patients before serious damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep sufferers in institutions . There is screening for genetic susceptibility to environmentally induced diseases like elevated blood cholesterol . If screening shows the person is at risk , advise can be given on how to lower risk . <p> It has been found that many common cancers such as lung , breast , and colon develop by step- wise accumulation of mutations affecting many genes . The disease include the loss of some suppressor genes which inhibit cell growth . Genetic screening may help predicting a cancer , and can be used to warn people to avoid agents that causes more mutations like smoking ( 5 ) . Social and Ethical Dilemmas of Genetic Screening : <p> After the rapid progress in this field during the last decade , several issues of the consequences of the new technology began to appear , which in many cases have a negative effect on those people whose genetic tests reveals that they are under risk of some genetic diseases . <p> In this issue people need to realize that carrying a gene for susceptibility such as the breast cancer gene BRCA1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease ( 5 ) . If you have a susceptibility gene , you may or may not get the disease . If you get it , no one can tell when or how severe , and in many cases there may be no preventive treatment or cure , as is currently the case with the breast cancer ( 1 ) . And this leads to the difficult question , who should be screened and why ? For now , geneticist and physicians generally agree that no one should be tested just because of fear of an illness . Doctors should offer testing only to those people whose family history suggests that they could carry harmful forms of genes . On the other hand , one should consider the psychological and emotional effects on those people whose genetic tests revealed that they are under risk of such genetically inherited diseases . Most people would choose not to know about their genetic make up that might show that they are under risk , simply because they do not want to spend their lives worrying about some thing that is only possibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in the amount of patients genetic data . Many individuals will be identified as carriers of genetic diseases , and this data can play an important role in the life of the individuals , by affecting the choice of spouse , decisions on whether to have children , and whether to use prenatal screening and selective abortion or therapy ( 3 ) . <p> Genetic information can be a great benefit to the individual persons . However , one of the most dangerous aspects of new technology is the danger of the genetic information becoming available to other people who might be involved in making decisions , that affect every aspect of our lives , especially employers and health insurance companies . This might lead to a genetic discrimination , and recent surveys indicated that health insurance coverage has been denied to many people due to their genetic status . There are many benefits to the insurance companies of knowing people 's genetic data , the insurance companies costs could be lowered ( 3 ) . <p> An important question is whether it is ethical to use abortion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a new born , can be treated with a dietary measures . Other diseases such as albinism are undesirable but many people suffered from it and lived otherwise normal lives ( 3 ) . People tend to be more worried about genetic screening tests for people with mental diseases , people diagnosed with the XYY syndrom were imprisoned for long time , as they are considered violent . This kind of screening lead to unfair labeling of people leading to a new type of social discrimination ( 3 ) . <p> There are many other issues that could be topics of discussion about the right of people to have their genetic data confidential . These tests can be done with a pinprick to collect blood . How can we ensure that they are not done without our knowledge as a part of another medical examination ? Does the employers have the right to make genetic testing mandatory ? Could the banks use this kind of information to deny loans , mortgages and life insurance companies polices ? . These and many other aspects show how the knowledge of genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using this information ( 7 ) . <p> There is another argument that if we let the parents chose characters for their children , such as being free from the most common genetically inherited diseases , then this might have a harmful effect on social attitudes toward other people who failed to meet such characteristics . While genetic screening could help people have children free of the common genetic defects , it would make the life of other people , who did not use the genetic screening and have children who are suffering from a genetic disease more difficult and complicated . This matter could be seen as not an act of fate but the parents fault ( 3 ) . <p> The use of these new techniques raise many ethical issues . Should we screen embryos for genetic diseases ? If so what diseases must we screen for ? Should we allow couples to select the sex of their child . If genetic test can tell if some one will die young , this can change the way they live . So is it ethical to make him aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and many more , many people believe that most of these problems could be resolved through . implementation of regulations that prevent the misuse of this powerful technology ( 1 ) . <p> Personal opinion : <p> In response to what I have discussed previously , about the importance of this issue , and the strong debate about the role of this new technology in our lives , it is difficult to say a final word about the need to proceed with this kind of research or to stop , because this issue is complicated and has different scientific , psychological , economical , emotional , ethical , and religious aspects that should be considered before evaluating what is right and what is wrong . <p> However , according to the aspects that have been discussed about how this genetic screening data could be misused , by those people who might gain benefits on the expense of those whose genetic screening results revealed that they are under risk of some diseases , it is important to ensure that if the application of any new technology leads to negative impacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology will be unaccepted by the majority . <p> I believe that this kind of the studies and applications of this technology should proceed , because most likely it will has a positive effects in finding the solution for many fatal diseases that affect thousands of people every day . It might also rescue lives of millions who are suffering from diseases . I think the future will be the judge to prove the advantages or the disadvantages so we should not be hasty in our judgment about the misuse of such a new technology . 
@@13708287 @2308287/ <p> The trp operon of E. coli controls the biosynthesis of tryptophan in the cell from the initial precursor chorismic acid . This operon contains genes for the production of five proteins which are used to produce three enzymes . The products of the E and D genes form a multimeric protein comprised of two copies of each protein to produce the enzyme anthranilate synthetase . This enzyme catalyzes the first two reactions in the tryptophan pathway . The next enzyme , which is responsible for catalyzing the next two steps in the pathway is indole glycerolphosphate synthetase and it is the product of the C locus . The final step in the reaction is the pathway produces tryptophan from indole-glycerol phosphate and serine . This single step is catalyzed by tryptophan synthetase , an enzyme that is a multimer of two proteins that are the product of the B and A genes . <p> As with all operons , the trp operon consists of the repressor , promoter , operator and the structural genes . In this system , though , unlike the lac operon , the gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather is located in another part of the E. coli genome . Another difference is that the operator resides entirely within the promoter <p> The trp operon is a repressible system . The primary difference between repressible and inducible systems is the result that occurs when the effector molecule binds to the repressor . With inducible systems , the binding of the effector molecule to the repressor greatly reduces the affinity of the repressor for the operator , the repressor is released and transcription proceeds . The lac operon is an example of an inducible system . With repressible systems , the binding of the effector molecule to the repressor greatly increases the affinity of repressor for the operator and the repressor binds and stops transcription . Thus , for the trp operon , the addition of tryptophan ( the effector molecule ) to the E. coli environment shuts off the system because the repressors binds at the operator . <p> Inducible system - the effector molecule interacts with the repressor protein such that it can not bind to the operator <p> Repressible system - the effector molecule interacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operator <h> Attenuation of the trp Operon <p> One element of the trp operon is the leader sequence ( L ) that in immediately 5 ' of the trpE gene .

Domain 3 ( nucleotides 108-121 ) of the mRNA can base pair with either domain 2 ( nucleotides 74-94 ) or domain 4 ( nucleotides 126-134 ) . If domain 3 pairs with domain 4 , a stem and loop structure forms on the mRNA and transcription stops . This structure forms when the level of tryptophan is high in the cell . If domain 3 pairs with domain 2 , then the stem and loop structure does not form and transcription continues through the operon , and all of the enzymes required for tryptophan biosynthesis are produce . These events occur when tryptophan is low in the cell . <p> If domain 4 is deleted , the stem and loop structure can not form and transcription of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tryptophan .

You might recognize that " NRA proposal draws criticism " refers to National Rifle Association , but " AEJMC meets in Minneapolis " would likely be familiar only to types like me ( who belong to the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication ) . <p> Editors usually stick to serious heads for serious news stories . Lighter fare or feature stories might call for different treatment . That 's when good headline writers can prove that they could make a lot more money writing advertising copy , should they wish to stoop so low . " From hell to high honor . " ( Grand Forks Herald wins Pulitzer Prize . ) " Carolers ring in Christmas season . " ( Feature on high school group . ) " Poet Nash , first name Ogden ; he is gone but not forgogden . " ( Obituary in the style of the famous poet . ) <p> A second general category of head is the label head , or title . Even though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason editing students seem to have a harder time with them . A label headline : <p> has no verb ; <p> may have articles . <p> Let 's turn some of the standard head examples above into label heads . " The Twins ' opener . " " A presidential tax cut . " " This year 's Pulitzer awards . " " A season of Christmas carols . " Note : no verbs , like a book title . <p> Why would you want to use label heads in mass media style publications ? Magazines sometimes use them because they sound more literary , less like the newspaper . Newspapers , too , will sometimes use them , particularly on editorial pages . That 's because the label head contains no verb , so does not suggest an approach . Just what you might want for opinion pieces . In a letter to the editor , for instance , to use a verb suggests an interpretation of the letter-writer 's viewpoint . And that can be misinterpreted . A label head is more neutral . Example : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralized with a label : " The governor 's veto . " <p> Writing a headline <p> It 's usually best to read the entire story first . That way you can get a good idea of the theme , and you 're more likely to reflect it accurately in your head . It 's true , however , that many editors under deadline simply read the first couple grafs , and base their head on that . I usually find it easiest to begin with a lively verb that accurately suggests the story 's content , and build around it . Emphasize people doing things--a basic rule of all mass media content . For instance , if a story is about , say , a city council meeting , I 'd think , what did the council DO ? Well , perhaps they raised liquor license fees . I can build on that : raises . Or perhaps a more sprightly verb ? Bumps . Boosts . Jacks up . Gooses . Cranks . Pumps . ( Well , some of those are more appropriate than others . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City council boosts liquor fees . " <p> Next I see how many lines the head is supposed to be , and separate it as best I can : three-line head . <p> City council <p> boosts <p> liquor fees <p> Of course , if the head is too short ( or too long ) , you 'll need to rewrite . And you ca n't hyphenate words in a headline , such as <p> City council <p> boosts li- <p> quor fees <p> Sorry , but boy , would n't that make an editor 's job easier ! Generally , heads are written " sentence-style , " that is , first letter capitalized , and the rest " down " ( lower case ) except for proper names . Other tips : <p> Headlines must fit the space an editor has left for a story . For instance , if you have a three-column ( 3-col ) story , the headline must run across all three columns of type--or at least half way across the last column . All columns of type must have a headline above ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one editor determines head size , and another editor actually writes the head . The two will communicate using a shorthand of three numbers , such as 2-36-3 , a " two thirty-six three . " ( If no third number is listed , say 2-36 , it usually assumes a one-line head . ) That means a two-column , 36 point ( pt ) , three-line head . Head shorthand is always written this way : number of columns , type size , number of lines . Design principles for attractive headlines mean certain sizes of heads ca n't be used above certain sizes of stories . How do you know ? You consult the publication 's headline schedule , " hed sked " for short . <p> Let 's say you 'd like to do a 3-14 ( 3 col , 14 pts ) . You consult your hed sked to find this is not listed . That means you ca n't use it--because the publication 's designers or senior editors have determined that type this small across three columns is not attractive in your publication ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline 's type size in height is measured in points , while the width of columns is measured in picas . <p> About points and picas <p> This arcane way of measuring type goes back to 1700s France , and " hot type " days when letters were cast from a lead-tin alloy ( we moved to offset in the 1970s ) . A pica ( p ) contains 12 pts . Six picas equals one inch ( about ) . So how many points in an inch ? Of course it 's 72 . <p> Type sizes are standardized . Anything smaller than about 12 pt is considered " body text , " and not used for heads . Bigger than that is " display type " for heads . Standard display sizes : 14 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 , etc . So how big is , say , a 36-pt head ? I 'll let you figure out that one . Type about 5 pt is sometimes called " agate , " used for fine print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnifying class . <p> The hed sked also gives you an idea of how much space in width a headline will use . Note that type in a publication is not usually monospaced , that is , each character taking up the same amount of space , typewriter style . Instead type designers set up proportional spacing . Fatter letters , such as m and w , take up more space . Thinner letters , such as i and l , take up less space . How much more ? How much less ? The hed sked shows this with a column of " maximum units . " <p> A unit is the amount of space the majority of characters needs . That is , lower case a , b , c , d , e , etc . Generally they are counted as one unit each . Exceptions are the lower-case thin letters f , i , j , l , t , one-half unit , and fat letters m and w , one and one-half units . Capital letters take up one and one-half units , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M and W , two units . Spaces and punctuation take up one-half unit , except the colon , 1 unit . Numbers are one unit . <p> We used to determine head width by consulting the hed sked while counting units thusly : <p> Mayor praises tax cut . <p> LONG ... units . Would this headline fit a 1-18 space , according to the hed sked ? Yes . Would it fit as a 1-36 ? No . <p> Luckily for you we do n't count heds like this anymore--a computer does it for us . If you have InDesign or PageMaker software you can practice with this by downloading this online count guide . ( InDesign file ) . If that does n't work , or if you have QuarkXPress , or another program that can draw , you can make one yourself . General instructions are below . <p> If you 'd like a step-by-step demonstration using InDesign , take a look at these tutorials ( Flash files ) : <p> 2 . In the dialogue box , toggle off Facing Pages . Change the orientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins at 0 . <p> 3 . After the page opens choose Preferences from the pulldown ( InDesign pulldown using Macintosh ) . Choose Units and Increments . Change the ruler units from inches to picas for both vertical and horizontal . <p> 5 . After the page opens , choose the Solid Arrow tool from toolbox at top . Check to see that the 0 mark on the ruler is at the edge of the page . If it is n't , bring the arrow tool to the crosshairs at upper left of document window at the end of the rulers . Drag on crosshairs so that the 0 mark on both rulers begins at the end of the page . <p> 6 . From that zero mark , drag in the vertical ruler to bring guidelines to these measurements : 12 picas ; 25 p ; 38 p ; 51 p ; 64 p . These will represent your columns . Now you are ready to write your headlines . <p> To measure a headline , choose the Text Tool ( small T ) . Drag a text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , change the point size as necessary from the menu bar at top . For example , to write a 2-36-2 , drag a text frame to the second line ( 25 p ) . Type your headline in that frame , making the headline two lines . Drag over to highlight , choose 36 pt . Does it fit ? If not , you need to rewrite until it does . At left is a simple 1-18-3 head for the story we copy edited in Section One , using the InDesign count guide . <p> To write a multi-column head , your count guide might look something like this . Note that in this sample I 've entered a 2-36-2 , that is , 2 cols , 36 pt , 2 lines . Does it fit ? Yes--each line goes almost , but not over , the 3-col line . <p> General instructions if you are not using InDesign : <p> For a standard 6-col broadsheet ( full size ) newspaper represented by my hed sked , set up a custom horizontal ( landscape ) page 76 picas wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Recall : 6 p=1 inch ) . Now draw vertical lines at these intervals : 12 picas ; 25 p ; 38 p ; 51 , p ; 64 p ; . This represents columns of the newspaper . Note that two columns , or 25 p , is not just two times one column ( 12 pica ) . Why ? Because you have to leave a gutter ( space ) between each column . <p> To gauge the size of a head , then , simply begin typing it at the left side , making sure the size is as indicated . For example , in the head above , I typed it on the guide starting at the left as 24 pt . Will it fit two columns ? Yes--although it 's a bit short . Heads should go at least half way across the last column . <p> If you do n't have a pagination program , you can to do headline exercises counting the likely size of the heads using the unit count above , and the hed sked for maximum units . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , per line , without going over the maximum . <p> Editors sometimes try to attract more readers to a story by adding kickers ( also called eyebrows ) and decks . A kicker is a second head about half the size of the main head , located above a story , such as : <p> Calls price supports ' inadequate ' <p> Heitkamp denounces farm bill <p> Note the traditional kicker does not repeat the subject , but begins with the verb . <p> A deck is a second smaller headline below the first It may include a period .

@@13708293 @2308293/ <h> The History of the Tulip : <p> The true origin of this delicate flower , the tulip , is found in the country of Turkey where it is the national flower . The tulip is a major motif that is featured prominently in Persian and Turkish folk arts . Although Turkey is where it originated , its tightest association is with the country of the Netherlands . For centuries the tulip has been associated with the Netherlands . For instance , in an annual gesture of gratitude to Canada for liberating the nation from Nazi German tyranny in World War II and for serving as a refuge for the Crown Princess , Queen Juliana , a supply of tulips is sent to be planted in Canada 's national capital in Ottawa . <p> Numerous cultivars have been bred for garden use . It is often considered one of humanity 's " canonical flowers " , along with the rose , lily , orchid , and peony . Other varieties of tulip cultivars include the Parrot Tulip and the Double Tulip . <h> How to Grow Tulips : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures . Tulips can be grown in either of two ways : through offsets or seed . Being genetic clones of the parent plant , offsets are the only way to enlarge the stock of a given tulip cultivar . A tulip grown from seed will usually bear only a passing resemblance to the flower from which the seeds were taken . This makes for great potential in breeding new tulip flowers , and great variation in the wild . However , tulip growers must be patient : offsets often take at least a year to grow to sufficient size to flower , and a tulip grown from seed will not flower for anywhere between five and seven years after planting . To plant the perennial , first cultivate and fertilize the soil . The next step is to then dig one hole per bulb , about 2-3 inches deep . Generally it is best to plant in the fall as this allows having beautiful color in the early spring . The cost of growing 200 tulip bulbs runs from about 18 dollars to the high end of 532 dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into planting these gorgeous perennials . <h> Different Varieties of Tulips : <p> There are many different cultivars for tulips .

Clay mortar holds together the sandstone slab walls . Rough-hewn logs , brush , straw and eight inches of clay make up the roofs . <p> Unlike the drafty wood frame houses built for the purpose of staying just long enough to " prove up " the claim before selling it , earthen homes are a symbol of permanence on the Great Plains . Yet it does n't take long for an earthen building to decay . Cattle often do the work by rubbing up against the sides . Only a few earthen houses remain in secluded areas , and the art of building them has largely been lost . <p> The Hutmacher farm in western North Dakota is the best example in the Great Plains of earthen-roofed stone-slab vernacular architecture , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building materials . The Hutmachers used techniques imported with the Germans from Russia , an ethnic group that immigrated to North Dakota in the 19th and 20th centuries . <p> Frank Hutmacher was born in 1902 in Sulz , Russia . In 1911 , he immigrated to the United States with his parents , Valentine and Frances , who built their farmstead in western North Dakota 's rolling landscape . The remains of that farm still lie in a field where cattle graze around a nearby spring . <p> Frank grew up and married Veronica Nuss in 1927 . Between 1928 and 1930 , he and his brothers built a new earthen home across the road . It was a modest two rooms to overlook their 300- to 400-acre spread . Over the years , they continued to add rooms on either end - a new kitchen in 1941 , another bedroom in 1950 and a vorhausl , or entry vestibule , in 1962 , where they washed laundry and housed the cream separator . Electricity was added between 1961 and 1964 . They never added plumbing to the 1,000-square-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hutmacher farm as one of the few remaining examples of this architectural style .

The house quickly fell into disrepair . <p> From Manning , N.D. , the farm is a 12-mile drive down hilly , gravel roads lined with wild sunflowers , cattle ranges , flax fields , road construction equipment and the occasional oil well . On a sunny July morning , a caravan of vehicles carrying students , ranging from a North Dakota State University junior to a retired couple from Washington , kicks up dust over the last ridge to the Hutmacher farm .

They are ready to re-roof the kitchen . <p> Restoration efforts took decades to get to this point . In 1980 , Steve Burian of rural Manning purchased the farmstead and donated it to the Dunn County Historical Society . Lack of manpower and resources kept the society from doing much , and they gave it back . Steve Martens , NDSU associate professor of architecture , led a group to the site in 1995 to record what they could before the building completely degraded . <p> In 2007 , Burian 's son , Arnold , deeded the property over to Preservation North Dakota , a statewide non-profit organization for historical preservation . They landed a $98,000 grant to fix the site from Save America 's Treasures , a federal program . Now they needed workers . <p> Labor came from Tom Isern , NDSU distinguished professor of history , and Suzzanne Kelley , doctoral candidate and president of Preservation North Dakota . The students are here for Isern 's field school , " Prairie Earth , Prairie Homes .

On Tuesday , a gray and spitty day , they stop at the Hutmacher farm to deconstruct the roof over the kitchen and entryway . Strong winds and sudden downpours make the work miserable . One graduate student falls thigh-deep into the roof . They huddle together under a tarp they stretched over the garage . <p> By Friday , the sun is out and a slight breeze keeps the temperature from becoming unbearable . The air smells of sweet clover , dry mown grass , wild sage and clay . The odors help to evoke the farm 's past . <p> Hutmacher wanted to keep his building costs down by using nearby resources .

Cottonwood trees provided ridge beams to support the green ash rafters . Buckthorn , chokecherry , buffalo berry , willow , plum and red haw brush were laid over the rafters , followed by straw .

Every piece of the house draws from the land around it , and soon it 's easy to imagine life on the farm . The children struggling up the ditch to the gravel road carrying water . Frank mixing clay to patch the roof . Veronica cooking her famous chicken noodle soup . The farm comes to life , and its story is of a family using what they had at hand to make their home at an estimated cost of $100 . <p> Eleanor ( Hutmacher ) Urlacher grew up in the house from 1932 to 1953 .

They played whist and other card games at the living room table while catching up on news of neighbors . A notch in the plaster wall still marks the spot where the table stood .

It looks precarious , but he seems comfortable . <p> Even with sample testing to determine what the plaster is made of and what recipe they used for the roof , re-creating the technique of building takes more than ingredients . They still ca n't get the plaster to stick to the wall as well as it used to , and they must constantly adjust the clay mix for the roof to contend with weather conditions and ingredient quality .

This publication provides colored pictures of the disease symptoms and management practices . <p> Mohamed F.R. Khan , Extension Sugarbeet Specialist , Department of Plant Pathology North Dakota State University , Fargo and University of Minnesota , St. Paul <p> The local sugar beet-growing areas have been in a wet cycle during the past 20 years . Fields with high disease severity probably have resulted from a combination of wet conditions and a prevalence of other susceptible host crops in the rotation . For example , nonsusceptible crops such as wheat and barley formerly used in rotation with sugar beets have decreased in acreage and have been replaced with susceptible crops such as soybeans , edible beans and corn . <p> Rhizoctonia root and crown rot may reduce yield significantly and diseased beets may cause problems in storage piles . Growers at some sugar cooperatives are required to destroy fields with more than a 50 percent incidence of root rot because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage . <h> Causal agent <p> Rhizoctonia root and crown rot is caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani . This fungus is divided into a number of anastomosis groups ( AGs ) based on vegetative compatibility reactions that occur when hyphae of two similar isolates fuse and genetic material is exchanged . <p> The main AGs that seriously impact sugar beets in Minnesota and North Dakota are AG 2-2 IV and AG 2-2 IIIB . The pathogen is present in all soils but becomes problematic in fields where the pathogen population is high because of the frequent use of susceptible host crops in the rotation . <h> Disease symptoms <p> The most common symptom is wilting of the leaves , starting with the oldest leaves , and is likely a consequence of damage to the vascular system ( Figures 1 and 3 ) . Leaves may or may not become yellow . In some instances , the petioles may develop some blackening where they are attached to the crown ( Figure 2 ) . <p> Crown rot infection probably is initiated when infected soil is thrown into crowns during cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or where the petiole attachment to the crown is covered with infected soil ( Figure 2 ) . Root rot infection typically starts at or just below the soil line ( Figure 3 ) , and sometimes lower on the tap root ( Figure 4 ) . <p> Root rot symptoms may range from scattered brown to black lesions on the root surface to complete rotting of the root . Initially , the disease may occur in a few patches in a field . If significant inoculum is present , often as a result of continuous planting of susceptible hosts , entire sugar beet fields may be lost to the disease when conditions are favorable for disease development . <p> Figure 4 .

The fungicides azoxystrobin and prothioconazole with a non-ionic surfactant at 0.125 percent volume per volume ( v/v ) , and a mixture of pyraclostrobin and fluxapyroxad applied in a 7-inch band before infection takes place provide effective disease control . <p> Fungicides should be applied when the average daily soil temperature at the 4-inch soil depth is about 60 to 62 F or before the canopy covers the rows ( four- to 10-leaf stage ) . <p> Mention of trade names or commercial products in this article is solely for the purpose of providing specific information and does not imply endorsement .

@@13708410 @2308410/ <h> Regular Rate of Pay Under the Fair Labor Standards Act <p> The " regular rate " of pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act can not be left to a declaration by the parties as to what is to be treated as the regular rate for an employee ; it must be drawn from what happens . The Supreme Court has described it as the hourly rate actually paid the employee for the normal , non-overtime workweek for which he is employed ; as an " actual fact . " <p> The " regular rate " under the Act is a rate per hour . The regular hourly rate of pay of an employee is determined by dividing his total remuneration for employment ( except statutory exclusions ) in any workweek by the total number of hours actually worked by him in that workweek for which such compensation was paid . At NDSU , in most cases , it is appropriate to use the regular rate and overtime rate contained in an employee 's payroll record on the computer . This will not be accurate if the employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of pay . <p> The following sections give some examples of the proper method of determining the regular rate of pay in particular instances : <p> Earnings at one rate of pay : If the employee is employed solely on the basis of a single hourly rate , the hourly rate is his " regular rate . " For his overtime work he must be paid , in addition to his straight time hourly earnings , a sum determined by multiplying one-half the hourly rate by the number of hours worked in excess of 40 in the week . <p> For example , a $10 hourly rate will bring , for an employee who works 46 hours , a total weekly wage of $490 ( 46 hours at $10 + 6 hours at ( $10 x 0.5 ) ) . <p> Earnings when multiple rates of pay apply : Where an employee in a single workweek performs two or more different types of work for which different non-overtime rates of payhave been established , his regular rate for that week is the weighted average of such rates . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are computed to include his compensation during the workweek from all such rates , and are then divided by the total number of hours worked at all jobs . For overtime purposes , NDSU is considered one employer , even if the two or more different positions are in two or more departments . <p> For example , if an employee works at NDSU for 30 hours in a position that pays a $10 hourly rate , and 16 hours in a position that pays a $15 hourly rate for a total of 46 hours , the employee 's " regular rate " of pay on which overtime is computed is $11.74 per hour ( ( 30 hours at $10 + 16 hours at $15 ) /46 hours ) . The weekly wage is $575.22 ( 30 hours at $10 + 16 hours at $15 + 6 hours at ( $11.74 x 0.5 ) ) .

When Alexander I brought Germans and a few other farmers into South Russia , he did not just abandon them to their own devices , he appointed Richelieu as governor to supervise them . Richelieu was a man with energy , intelligence , and imagination , plus a sense of style . Bored with life in Paris , he had come to Russia and participated in the battle of Ismail , an important event in the war that preceded the call for settlers .

Richelieu , who was full of ideas , built up Odessa , where he arranged for the construction of Orthodox , Lutheran , and Catholic churches , established a hospital and a sanctuary for the poor , and an institution of higher education that later became the University of Odessa .

Kohl was a kind of roving reporter from Germany who spent some time in Lustdorf just 30 years after its founding . ( Kohl 's report also appears in Homesteaders on the Steppe . ) " The sight of so many settlements really came to me as a surprise . I never encountered a similar scene on the steppes . " He notes the presence of Greeks , Russians , and Cossack villages in the area . His report has descriptions of the German villages , the achievements and enterprise of their hard-working people , and the gardens ( bashtans ) , in which watermelon ( arboose ) was king , though they also grew onions , cucumbers , pumpkins , potatoes , and a surprising variety of other vegetables and fruits .

Even when they are traveling across country , they usually take along a large head of sunflower seeds and hold it under one arm while they pick out kernel after kernel with the other . " He inserts a human-interest vignette about the love life of a farmer ? s daughter " Babele , " but he also does some hard-headed reporting . He compares the Russian farmers unfavorably with the industrious Germans . He notes that the colonists were required by the government to provide labor , such as general maintenance of roads and other common facilities . They were also required to lodge soldiers and provide transportation for persons connected with the government . He describes the primitive harvesting technology that wasted much grain .

The migration led by water down the Danube River from Ulm or by land over Pololia near Odessa , to Bessarabia , into the Crimea and the southern Caucausus . <p> The settlers from the Palatinate , Alsace and northern Baden migrated to southern Russia in the years 1809-10 . They traveled mainly through Poland and Podolia , primarily into the Odessa area , where many large Catholic villages were founded . The settlers often gave their colonies the same names of the villages and cities they left behind in their old homeland ; for example Stuttgart , Karlsruhe , Mannheim , Selz , Straburg ; Tiege , Tiegenhagen , Altonau , Lichtenau , Orloff ; Basel , Darmstadt , Mariental , Rosenberg , Rheinhardt .. In all , 181 mother colonies were founded in the area of the Black Sea , in Bessarabia and in the southern Caucusus . <p> Settlement areas in Russia <p> During the years 1763-1768 approximately 8,000 families totaling 27,000 people immigrated into the Volga region . Here , on the hilly side ( right bank of the Volga ) 45 colonies were founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Volga ) 59 colonies were founded . The Settlements were laid out strictly along religious lines . <p> Lutheran <p> Catholic <p> Hillside <p> 31 <p> 14 <p> Meadow side <p> 35 <p> 24 <p> Total <p> 66 <p> 38 <p> The Volga Germans are mainly of Hessian descent , but also come from the Palatinate and from Wnrttemberg . <p> The rural settlements near St. Petersburg and Belowesh , ( northeast of Kiev ) and Rebendorf were founded at almost the same time as the German settlements on the Volga . <p> The Volhynian Germans are for the most part Low-Germans from the area of the Weichsel River and from Pomerania , Middle-Germans from Silesia and Poland and High-Germans ( Swabians ) from central Poland . By descent , therefore , the Volhynian Germans are northern Germans , by religion , Protestant . <p> Whereas the Volga and Black Sea-Germans settled in large closed villages , the Volhynian-Germans had to a large extent been settled in scattered settlements and on individual farms . This made community life more difficult . During Soviet times , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective farms . <p> The first group of any size that settled in the Black Sea region was comprised of Mennonites from the Danzig area , who because of improved conditions for settlement established themselves south of Jekaterinoslaw ( Dnjepropetrowsk ) in 1789 . The well-known region of Chortitz developed in this area . In 1803 , the Mennonites , some from Chortitz , and some from the regions of Danzig and Elbing , settled in Taurien in the immediate vicinity of the small river Molotschna . The largest Mennonite group was created here in the HalbstSdter or Molotschna territory . <p> On February 20 , 1804 , by means of a decree ordered by Alexander I , a stringent selection process was applied to recruiting prospective emigrants from Germany . It was required that the emigrants prove they possessed a certain level of means of livelihood . This recruiting process was particularly successful in the provinces in southern and southwestern Germany . <p> In the provinces of Cherson , Bessarabia , Jekaterinoslaw , Crimea and South Caucusus ( 1817 ) very large closed settlement areas were founded on allotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea area were divided as follows : <p> Protestant <p> 246,280 <p> 45% <p> Catholic <p> 195,640 <p> 35.8% <p> Mennonites <p> 104,370 <p> 19.2% <p> In addition , there were German settlements in the Caucusus like those later founded south of the Urals and in western Siberia . As for the German villages there were 50 villages in Russia with a German population between 500 to 5,000 people ; to this one must add Odessa with as many as 12,000 , Moscow with up to 20,000 and St. Petersburg with up to 42,000 Germans ( in 1905 ) . ( cf. also p.6 ) <p> The founding of Daughter Colonies <p> The system of inheritance ( the youngest son inheriting the farm ) , the abundance of children , and the privilege of being allowed to buy land , were all factors which led to the founding of numerous daughter colonies . At first these were founded in the neighborhood of the mother colonies in the Volga and Black Sea region . Beginning in the final third of the 19th century daughter colonies were also established in the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and central Asia . The last settlements were founded in the Amur region as late as 1927-28 . <p> Four hundred and forty daughter colonies were founded in the Volga area , about 1800 in the Black Sea area and about 500 in Siberia . All told , 3,232 daughter colonies developed from the original 304 mother colonies ; consequently , in 1940 the German villages numbered about 3,500 ( without the Baltic ) . The colonies were strictly divided along religious lines : Lutheran ( 43% ) , Catholic ( 27% ) , Baptist ( 16% ) , Mennonite ( 8% ) and others ( 6% ) . <p> An additional reason for the extensive spread of Russian-German culture was the abundance of children or the high birthrate among German emigrant families . While in Europe the birthrate of all national minorities was less than that of the native population , in the case of the Russian-Germans the birthrate exceeded that of the native Russian population . The birthrate of German inhabitants in European Russia was 43.8 per 1,000 compared with 39.8 per 1,000 among the ethnic Russian population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47.3 per 1000 compared with 40.3 per 1,000 of the native population , and in Vohynia 36 per 1000 . In Germany , at the same time , the birthrate was 19 per 1,000 . Before 1918 the average number of children per family in Germany was 8 . <p> 150 years later , 100,000 German immigrants became a national group of 1.7 million in the Russian Empire ( 1914 census ) , i.e. the numbers increased by a factor of 17 . <p> Over the years , the Russian-Germans developed a distinct and localized consciousness of their homeland . In contrast to other immmigrants who , for example , set out for the United States or Canada , the German settlers did not want to disappear into the indigenous population because they considered themselves to be carriers of culture into the Russian Empire . They wanted to remain " Germans " in their new homeland . Therefore , from the beginning of migration they placed great value on painstakingly cultivating their religious beliefs , mother-tongue , and folklore traditions ( folk songs and folk art , music , costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop these customs and traditions further and pass them on to succeeding generations . In this way they were able to preserve their national identity in southern Russian and the Ukraine for over two hundred years and successfully withstand assimilation . <p> Landscapes in the Black Sea and Volga Region <p> In the three largest regions of German Russian settlement ( Volga , Black Sea and Volhynia ) there were great variations in the character of the countryside . Volhynia was in large part an undulating forestland . This influenced the manner of settlement ( scattered settlements with many individual farmsteads ) and the construction of homes ( houses mainly built from wood ) .. <p> In contrast , the Black Sea region was a flat , treeless , steppe region which was later cultivated . No hills or forests blocked the view over the meadows and fields of grain . From afar , one could view herds of cattle on the wide plains , grazing and returning home in the evening . Peasants could be seen ploughing or harvesting their crops . In summer , one saw clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of high winds or moving wagons . When the heat was too intense the flickering air appeared to be water ( Fata Morgana ) or one saw swirling dust columns ( whirlwinds ) rise up . Nowhere a tree , nowhere a forest . Nothing but steppe and more steppe , and after settlement and cultivation , farmland and grain fields . <p> The landscape in the Volga region that enclosed the area of German settlement , exhibited a somewhat different character , than did the Russian river , the Volga , which divided into the meadow side on the east and the hilly side on the west .. The German customs and culture in the Russian countryside were almost exclusively molded by a rural population . Craftsmen and merchants did not appear until later times . <p> With great industry and agricultural knowledge the German Russians began to cultivate the allocated land . Soon they had adjusted to the new circumstances and had dealt with the almost insuperable task of soil management . The black soil , rich in humus ( " Tschernosjom " ) in the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , less fertile soils ( lacking humus ) were predominate , and as a result wheat , barley , oats and corn were primarily planted . In some areas like Bessarabia and Crimea , but above all , the southern Caucusus , viticulture played a large role . It was also the Germans who bred a strain of cattle ( " the German red cow " ) , which was known and desired everywhere . Several port cities , above all Odessa on the Black Sea , and Berdjansk on the Sea of Azov , became important export cities for grain . For the most part grain was delivered to these ports by German farmers . <p> Land Ownership <p> Economically , the first German settlers had a difficult time , but soon a huge upturn occurred in the economy as the result of the introduction of industry , the abundance of children , thrift , and improved agricultural knowledge . New settlements were founded and new land was purchased . If the Black Sea Germans were able to buy up significantly more land than the Volga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Periodically , every five to seven years , the Volga Germans divided the common land among the males anew , as a result the individual holdings became smaller and smaller . Among the Black Sea Germans the family 's entire land ( " the enterprise " ) was left to one son undivided . Therefore , it became necessary for the other sons to buy land , as every farmer was determined that each son would become a farmer . In the Black Sea region 647.000 desjatin ( 1 desjatin = 2.7 acres ) were allotted to the Germans at the time of settlement , and until 1914 they bought an additional 4.2 million desjatin ( 11.34 million acres ) . For the Volga Germans the comparable figures were l.4 million desjatin and 2.5 million desjatin , respectively ( 3.78 million and 6.75 million acres ) . Together , these two groups owned 8.747 million desjatin or 23.617 million acres of land .. If one includes the land ownership of the Germans in Siberia and Volhynia as well as that around St. Petersburg of about 3.5 million desjatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ownership of 12.247 million desjatin = 36,142.2 million acres , or 56.5 million square miles ; that is more than the entire area of the former DDR ! East Germany . <p> Industry <p> With the large increase in the German population in southern Russia and as the possibility of buying new land was more and more limited , a shortage of land soon arose . Therefore , one had to consider providing the children with a higher education to produce German physicians , teachers and ministers ; or the sons had to learn a craft or trade . <p> In the Volga region , in and around Balzer , a sizeable textile industry arose , and in Katharinenstadt ( later Marxstadt ) a flourishing metal-working industry . In southern Ukraine , Odessa , Alexandrowsk , Prischib , Chortitza , Neu-Halbstadt and Spat there developed outstanding centers of German industry and crafts . There were large enterprises in these areas with as many as l , 000 employees . The German " colonist wagon " was much desired by all ethnic peoples . Factories for the manufacture of plows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the milling industry which spread out everywhere . Every larger German settlement had at least one or more mills . In some German regions large flour mills arose that serviced wide areas and , above all , the large cities . Numerous brickworks supplied the building materials necessary to build these mills . <p> House and Village <p> In the Volga region large villages were built , often similar to towns . The houses were built one next to the other on several streets running the length of the village . In Volhynia , the settlements were smaller , or the houses lie scattered among the woods . In the broad Black Sea region , where there was no shortage of land at the time of settlement , one built on a grander scale . The tidy houses were built 1 - 3 kilometers in length and 30 - 80 meters in width . The streets were laid out straight as a string . On each side of the roadway footpaths were separated by means of acacia trees ( " acacia is colloquial for " robinia " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a village plan made , a parcel of land in the middle of the village large enough for school and church was included .. The farmyards were uniformly 40 meters wide and up to 120 meters long , so that the village plan made a regular , almost chess-board-like impression . Because all the houses had only one story , the church with its high tower dominated the village . At the time of settlement , the German colonists were encouraged to plant trees . And so , a German village arose like an oasis from the otherwise treeless steppe . In the spring the village lie in a sea of blossoms , redolent of honey . Often the houses were completely hidden behind the thick acacia trees . <p> In the Black Sea region the houses were separated from the street and the neighboring farmyards by a beautifully shaped wall . The entrance gate and the entryway often had decorated columns or gaily painted arches . The buildings in such a farmyard were large and regularly laid out . On the one side , separated from the encircling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two dwellings of usually four rooms provided shelter for the father and the oldest unmarried son . Stables for horses and cows were included under the same roof . Beyond them were the sheds for wagons and machinery . In front , across from the main building , stood the " summer kitchen " where life was carried on during the hot and dusty summer months . The barn was connected to this building . At the rear of the yard was the large threshing area , and surrounding this one saw high straw piles and manure piles , in the absence of coal and wood , both provided indispensable fuel . <p> In the Volga region , with the exception of the Mennonites , things were different . Here the house stood isolated with the front yard on the street side . Across from it , on the other side of the street , stood the so-called " summer kitchen " or the house for the younger generation . The stables were located on the border between the front and the back of the farmyard . The manure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stable onto the manure pile the backyard , never in the front yard ! <p> The exterior of a colonist 's house always gave a neat , well-cared-for impression . In Volhynia the houses were made of wood . In the Volga region they were partially made of wood and stone . In the Black Sea region the houses were always made of limestone or sandstone . The houses were all plastered and beautifully whitewashed . Every year , usually at Pentecost , the walls were often freshly whitewashed .. The roof , depending on the situation , was covered with reeds , tin or tiles . Often one saw the year of construction inlaid or drawn onto the roofs . <p> In addition to the closed German settlements there were a number of estates that lay scattered and isolated on the broad steppe . Entrepreneurial , wealthy farmers , for whom it had become too cramped in the village , bought land from Russian estate-owners . These often consisted of between 500 and 2,000 acres . Around the manor house lie the pasture , farther away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and storage buildings for agricultural implements and wagons were marks of such an estate . <p> On the strength of the communal autonomy granted them , the colonists elected their own mayors ( chairmen ) and chief mayors ( chief executive officers ) . These officials were obliged to render a public accounting to the village council or , as the case may be , to the regional assembly . The regional authorities were not controlled by the local representatives of the state but rather by the welfare committee in Odessa , or the welfare office in Saratov , that in its part was assigned directly to the government in St. Petersburg . <p> Ecclesiastical life <p> Religious life was strongly expressed in the German settlements . Many had emigrated from other places in Europe for religious reasons , Because religious freedom was guaranteed by the Russian Government , they were able , and prepared to , make great sacrifices for the building of the church . The churches always had to be built with their own resources . But there were never any difficulties in doing this . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and participation in the construction was a matter of honor . Therefore , in every middle-sized and larger community there was a stately church with a high steeple that towered over the farm houses . The " church garden " and the " church wall " were always well-tended . <p> In every church there were organs , most of which came from Germany ; the Walker organ from Ludwigsburg was particularly well represented in the Swabian settlements . In the smaller villages and among the Mennonites there were only meeting houses without steeples ; these often also served as schools . The church buildings primarily distinguished themselves from the Orthodox churches both in their outward appearance and also in their interior furnishings . <p> The style of the churches , that expressed the great pride of the Germans , was modeled after the neo-classical and historic examples of the 18th and 19th century that were predominant in the homeland they had left . The choir usually was oriented toward the east . The towering steeples displayed a great variety of forms . According to availability one used wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials . <p> Church attendance in the German settlements was excellent . Only one person per family stayed at home . Therefore , the churches were always overflowing on Sunday . Sunday was strictly observed as a day of rest . No work was performed on Sunday , not even during the harvest or during threshing-time . There were German churches , not only in every German settlement , but also in most of the larger cities of Russia ( Moscow , St. Petersburg , Saratov , Odessa , Tiflis , Baku , Omsk etc . ) The Germans were strictly forbidden from conducting any missionary activity among Orthodox Christians ( until 1905 ) . <p> The school system <p> The second cornerstone for the preservation of the German identify in Russia was the school . Illiteracy was unknown in the German Russian colonies . At the time of settlement Germans were promised complete scholastic freedom by the czar 's government and every effort was made to raise the school system to an appropriate level . In every German settlement there was a school ; until 1891 German was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in the 1890s and the Russian language was placed more and more into the foreground . <p> The school buildings , that usually had to be built with local funds without any help from the state , bore witness to the desire for universal education in the German colonies of Russia . They stood out in many places through their magnificent architecture , which reflected the wealth and self-assurance of the German settlers . <p> Soon it became evident that institutions for higher education were necessary . In part these were so-called " central schools " which basically assumed responsibility for the education of teachers , village scribes and merchants . Great value was placed on these schools and on the cultivation of the German language and literature , but also on the learning of the Russian language . This was , of course , necessary because Russian was prescribed for contact with the Russian officials . The sexton-teachers were also educated in the central schools . As the pastor often served five to twelve parishes , these had to substitute for him , holding " reading services " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large numbers of central schools . As time progressed ( particularly after 1905 ) seminaries for teachers , ministers , high school administrators , commercial and agricultural educators as well as institutions for the deaf-and-mute were founded . There were also numerous girls ' schools whose instructional offerings were comparable to those of the central schools . <p> The schools in the larger cities , such as St. Petersburg , Moscow and Odessa , were particularly outstanding and were also popular among Russian and Ukrainian children . <p> Curtailment and cancellation of privileges <p> While the Germans enjoyed good relations with their Ukrainian and Russian neighbors , beginning in the second half of the 19th century there developed a growing sense of Germanophobia ( parallel with Panslavism ) among the influential circles of the Russian soceity which included the nobility , politicians and middle-class intellectuals . This directed itself above all , and with particular virulence , against the Germans living in Russia . Native Russians envied their " privileges " and economic success and found them to be a foreign body that could eventually become dangerous ( envy-hate-complex ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding of the German empire , the special privileges originally given to the German emigrants " for all time " were canceled in the year 1871 . In 1874 compulsory military service was extended in the Russian Empire to include the Germans . Only the Mennonites , who held fast to the principle of non-violence , after long negotiations were entitled to a kind of substitute duty , ( forestry duty ) . Their men of military age engaged in caring for forests , tree nurseries , and model fruit orchards . During World War I the Mennonites were also conscripted into the medical service . <p> Traveling onward to America <p> Because of the changes in the Czar 's policies towards the Germans living in Russia , a large wave of emigration to America began in late 19th century . This emigration also included the Mennonites . Initially , great numbers of colonists withdrew to Siberia , where the czar 's laws were not enforced as strictly . Some Germans traveled to Manchuria and took the long journey across the China Sea and the Indian Ocean . Others crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in America . By 1912 , approximately 300,000 Germans had emigrated from Russia to North and South America . A new wave of emigration began after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918 which took Russia out of the Great War . <p> As late as the fall of 1929 about 14,000 German farmers and their families made their way to Moscow with the intention to emigrate . After long negotiations , Germany finally accepted 5,000 of them , but only for transit overseas ; the others were returned , in many cases under inhuman conditions and often with the use of brutal force . <p> A transit camp was set up in Mlln , where the refugees could remain for several months . Weakened by the psychological and physical strain endured in and around Moscow , some of them did not live to complete the journey . Even now their grave sites in the cemetery in Mlln bear witness to those days . In 1940 approximately 350,000 to 400,000 Germans from Russia lived in the USA , in Canada 200,000 , Mexico 30,000 , Brazil 250,000 , Argentina 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers are , of course , those who emigrated overseas in the 1920 's . These could be estimated at 150,000 to 200,000 . <p> In 1978 the " Association Argentina de los Alemanes del Volga " , which publishes the magazine , " El Centenario " was founded in Argentina . In the USA the " American Historical Society of Germans from Russia " has existed for about 12 years , and recently , the " North Dakota German Heritage Society " composed only of ancestors of the Russian-Germans , was founded . <p> World War I <p> Even though approximately 300,000 Germans served in the czar 's army , the hatred of everything German reached new heights during World War I. Citizens were no longer allowed to speak German in public ; preaching in German was forbidden ; more than three Germans were not allowed to meet together and other restrictions .. On May 27 , 1915 , a hate campaign erupted in Moscow in the form of a pogrom against the Germans . The worst harm was done by the so-called " liquidation laws " of February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws provided that all Germans living in a strip 150 kilometers deep , east of the western border and on the Black Sea were to be removed from this zone and " all fixed property was to be confiscated . " These liquidation laws were carried out only in Volhynia . Approximately 200,000 Volhynian Germans made their way to Siberia , completely impoverished ; many did not survive the transportation which took over a period of several months . <p> The laws were supposed to be enforced in all areas as far as the Urals . Due to the bourgeois revolution of February 1917 " only " the Volhynian Germans were affected . <p> Years of famine , collectivization and persecution <p> Until 1941 the treatment of the Germans in Russia was worse than that of other minorities and the general population ; they were much more severely persecuted than others . During the years , 1921-1933 , famine , previously unheard of , stalked the land of this people for the first time in the history . Death made deep inroads , above all among the children and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and famine produced a decrease in the number of Germans in Russia from l , 621,000 in 1914 to 1,238,500 in 1926 . <p> During the course of the collectivization of Soviet agriculture , the so-called de-kulakization , particularly in the years 1929-1930 , thousands of Germans , above all men , were carried off from the colonies into the far north and Siberia , without being allowed to show any signs to family members that they were still alive . The Germans were particularly affected by the mass arrests of 1937-38 . The number of arrests was fixed for each settlement ; Russian or Ukrainian party functionaries would rather sacrifice fellow German citizens than their own countrymen . The prosperity and the cultural level of the Germans were higher on average than that of the indigenous population and therefore resulted in greater persecution . Many Germans had relatives abroad ( in Germany , the USA or Canada ) ; often a single letter from one of these ( " connection with abroad , " " espionage " ) was cause for arrest . The help that NAZI Germany gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1936-39 ) produced anti-German resentment in the Soviet Union . <p> During 1937-1938 , in some villages and towns , as many as 48% of all the males over 20 years of age are believed to have been deported . The number of fatherless Germans at that time was greater than it was for the general population after World War II . The last wave of arrests and murders of Russian Germans came in the first month after the German attack on the Soviet Union , ( June 22,1941 ) when the large losses suffered by the Red Army led to the sacrifice of the ostensible " guilty ones . " <p> Hardly any of the Germans returned from exile . For example , of 132 taken into custody in a small suburb of the city , Kopejsk , in the southern Urals , only three returned . The German children who lived there were surprised when someone still had a father . In the villages of Grnnfeld and Bergtal ( Kirghis ) with a total of about 60 farms , more than 40 men over 20 years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ThSlmann ( County Molotowobad , region Duschanbe ) with 58 farms , 29 men and 4 women were arrested , ( five of the men after the outbreak of the war ) . In 1942 , 37 men were conscripted into the " Trud Army " for forced labor . Only 12 lived through the war years . In this way the size of the population declined considerably , particularly in two of the largest areas of German settlement . According to the 1926 Census , only 379,630 Germans remained in the Volga region in contrast to the 650,000 in 1914 . For the Black Sea region the comparable figures were 355,000 as opposed to 650,000 . <p> With the introduction of collective farms and the confiscation of land , members of other nationalities began to be introduced into villages that had previously been purely German . The outward aspect of the villages also changed . The stables were torn down ; as a result , the houses became shorter in length . The long buildings for cows and horses appeared that now belonged to the collective and no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawstacks in the farmyards disappeared . In place of the beautiful stone buildings of former times , small mud houses appeared , particularly at the ends of the villages . The walls and fences , so carefully tended before , deteriorated . The collective triumphed over the individual . Only barely recognizable remnants of the former magnificence of the colonists ' villages survived . <p> Cultural and Administrative Autonomy between the Wars <p> After the Soviets had established their power in Russia , there was another stormy , but short upturn in the life of the German minority in spite of the famine of 1921-1924 . The autonomous " Worker 's Commune of the Region of the Volga Germans " whose status was up-graded to the " Autonomous Soviet Socialistic Republic of the Volga Germans " ( ASSRVD ) in 1924 , had been founded in 1918 . In 1926 the regular Soviet Congress accepted the constitution of the Autonomous Republic . <p> Even in its first ten years , the Volga German Republic developed its industry and to a large extent mechanized agriculture . The Republic of the Volga-Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods into agriculture in the USSR . The yields from the harvests rose from year to year . <p> Coinciding with the growth and change in the economics of the Volga Republic the culture also began to unfold . The Republic of the Volga-Germans , that in the official Soviet publications of those years was very often called " Stalin 's blooming garden " , was one of the first Soviet republics that completely conquered illiteracy . In 1918-1919 alone there were 236 " country schools " ; in 1921 there were 317 primary schools and 23 middle schools , as well as a number of other educational establishments . There were eleven technical schools , five colleges , three worker 's institutions , twenty houses of culture , a German national theater and a children 's theater . In the Republic more than 20 regional and five supra-regional newspapers appeared . Between 1933 and 1935 , 555 German books were published , collectively about three million volumes . <p> In the Volga Republic two-thirds of the inhabitants were German and had all of the characteristics of a nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only those who lived there , but also people from the German volk groups in other regions of the USSR . Everywhere in the Soviet Union that Germans settled in their closed communities , there was cultural and administrative autonomy ( German as the language of instruction in the schools , language of government and the law courts ) . In the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic ( RSSR ) there were six German rayons ( districts ) and 414 German schools . At times , the Germans had nine German rayons and 628 German language schools in the Ukraine . <p> Beginning in the school year of 1938-1939 the official language of instruction in all schools was changed to Russian or Ukrainian . At first the change only took place outside of the Volga German Republic but , by 1939 all German districts were dissolved . The churches had already been closed in the period between 1929-1931 . Religious services were forbidden and most of the pastors and church sextons of all denominations had been arrested and deported . In this way , the Germans had already been robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were helplessly abandoned to Russification . Before WWII the industry and accomplishments of the Russian-Germans had been acknowledged and praised . The Germans had no problems living together with members of other ethnic and national peoples . However , the situation of the Germans in the USSR radically changed at the beginning of World War II . <p> The Second World War and the " Trud Army " <p> World War II sounded the death knell of the Germany minority as a unified ethnic group in the Soviet Union . Beginning in July , 1941 , within a very short time , the 45,000 Crimean Germans were " resettled " in central Asia . On August 28 , 1941 the Presidium of the Ruling Soviet of the USSR enacted an edict concerning the " resettling " of the Germans from the Volga region . In this edict the Russian-Germans were accused of actively supporting the German troops . 340,000 Volga-Germans were loaded into cattle cars and deported to Siberia under inhuman conditions . The men were separated from their families ; above all , the aged , children and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , 1941 the Caucusus-Germans followed , and in March , 1942 the Germans from Leningrad . A total of 800,000 Germans were deported , in fact more than 400,000 of them , whether by choice or by coercion , lived in the Asian part of the USSR . There the women and their children were settled in scattered makeshift shelters and placed under the strict oversight of the state security apparatus ( Spezkomendatura ) . The men between ages 15 and 60 , and women who had no children under the age of three , were placed in the " Trud Army , " where they were treated as " enemies of the state " and " betrayers of the fatherland . " <p> The literal translation of " Trud Army " into English means " Labor Army . " It was actually a collection of forced labor camps that were surrounded by high barbed-wire fences and kept under close guard . The conditions under which the members of the Trud Army were forced to live and labor resembled in their inhumanity those of a penal prison camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers who had strict orders to use their guns based on the least suspicion . In the camp itself the will of any of the guards was law . The German word " Fritz " was used in the standard Soviet colloquial to mean " enemy " or " Fascist . " This term was not only used for subordinates and uncultured people , but also for the leading personnel in the work place . Under these difficult circumstances , crammed together in camps , the members of the Trud Army died in huge numbers from cold , starvation , hard labor , and emotional despair . The Trud Army camp was finally dissolved some time after the war . <p> Because of the speedy advance of the German troops in the summer of 1941 some of the Russian-Germans were spared this tragic fate for a short time . They were under German and Russian occupation . In 1943-1944 , 350,000 Black Sea Germans were resettled from the region between the Dnieper River and the Dniester River into the Wartheland and from there in part to Germany . Almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the entry of the Red Army into Germany 250,000 Russian-Germans were transported to the USSR , where " because of betrayal of the socialist homeland " they were sentenced to a lifelong ban and forced labor . As " traitors " they were treated much more harshly than the Germans who had been deported earlier in 1941 . Also , a special commandant 's headquarters were set up for them , where those " banned " had to report regularly . The commanding officers enjoyed rights of the kind enjoyed by estate owners during the time of Russian serfdom . For visiting a neighboring village without the permission of the commandant , one received ten days arrest . For a trip that crossed the border of the region the penalty was up to 20 years in prison . <p> Women labored as woodcutters in the primeval forests in the north , as laborers in the mines of the Urals and the coal-mines beyond the Arctic Circle . They were fed pitiful bread rations of 300 grams per day . The camps were characterized by starving children , bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope at all for release . Death , in short , was the fate and long awaited savior of many of the Germans in Russia after World War II . Under these conditions , considerable part of this generation of the Germans in Russia perished ( ca. 300,000 ) . <p> The Amnesty of 1955 <p> After 1945 nothing was heard of the plight of Germans still remaining in the Soviet Union . Neither in newspapers , magazines or books were they written about , nor were they spoken of in speeches or radio broadcasts . There was no correspondence with relatives in the West . Only after the visit of West German Chancellor Conrad Adenauer in September , 1955 , and the establishment of diplomatic relations between Moscow and Bonn did the Supreme Soviet of the USSR enact the decree : " Concerning the cancellation of the restrictions in the legal situation of the Germans and their family members , who are in the special settlement . " After that , the humiliating command headquarters was abolished , but the prohibition on Germans returning to their home villages remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans in the USSR were not restored . The Germans were forced to sign a declaration in which they committed themselves never to return to their former regions and to make no claims to their confiscated property . <p> About 200,000 Germans petitioned the German Embassy in Moscow , but they were not allowed to emigrate . In spite of this , the amnesty improved the lot of most Germans in the Soviet Union . Many moved to the south , to warmer regions . None of them were allowed to contact the Red Cross to begin their search for relatives and friends , whom they had been separated from in the Soviet Union and Germany for the last ten to fifteen years . Again , there were German newspapers ( 1955 in the Altai , 1957 " Neues Leben " in Moscow ) , radio broadcasts ( Moscow in 1956 , Kazachstan in 1957 , Kirghis in 1962 ) . In 1957 a decree was publicized allowing German instruction in the mother tongue ( however , only in Kazachstan ; more than 1 million Germans lived in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register a Lutheran congregation in Zelinograd . Lutherans and Mennonites made the first contacts with their fellow believers in the West and the Catholics soon closed ranks . According to the Soviet Census of 1959 , there were 1,615,000 Germans living in the Soviet Union but their distribution among the republics remained a secret . It was later found that 820,000 Germans lived in the Russian Republic in 1959 . In the same year 648,000 Germans lived Kazakstan , and a combined population of 91,000 lived in the republics of Kirghis , Tadzikistan and Uzbekistan .. <p> The Partial Rehabilitation of 1964 <p> The decade of the sixties arrived and with it the so-called " thaw " in Soviet and Western relations that gave hope to many people in the Soviet Union which , as it later developed , were groundless . Even for the Germans things finally seemed to have changed : On 8-29-1964 ( after 23 years , almost exactly to the day ! ) the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR passed the resolution : " Concerning the resettlement of the Volga Germans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Life has shown that these sweeping accusations were groundless and were a sign of the arbitrary use of power under the conditions surrounding the personal cult of Stalin . " However , this was only a formal rehabilitation . When at the XX Party Day of the KPDSU ( Communist Party of the Soviet Union ) of 1956 , the wrongs inflicted on some small peoples were corrected , one silently passed over the Russian-Germans , and thus their acquittal appeared only on paper . The little that had been promised in the edict of 1964 was in reality either not carried out , not carried out immediately , or not carried out completely . The Germans ' demand for the restoration of their autonomous republic was interpreted as nationalism . <p> The political rehabilitation of the Volga Germans ( and of practically all of the Germans in the Soviet Union ) was presumably planned by Soviet Premier Kruschchev as a conciliatory gesture towards the Federal Republic of Germany . It was only publicized in the USSR ( January , 1965 ) after his fall from power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitation from " Neues Deutschland " ( East Berlin ) and protested the fact that the edict had not been published in the Soviet press . <p> The Struggle against Russification <p> It would be wrong to believe that the Germans initially put their hands in their laps and then threw themselves head over heels into emigrating to the West . They tried to work against Russification , to further develop their own language and culture . Immediately after the rehabilitation of 1964 , the movement for the restoration of German autonomy was set into motion . Petitions to the Soviet government were drawn up , signatures collected , delegations put together and sent to the Kremlin in Moscow . <p> Whereas the delegation of 13 women and men in 1965 , had collected 660 signatures demanding autonomy ( which in the opinion of their opposite numbers was not sufficient ) , the second delegation , that made the trip to the Soviet metropolis less than six months later , was able to supply 4,498 signatures . This second delegation had 35 members , Volga Germans and Black Sea Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak for more than one million Germans . They asked for a return to the Volga , easing of cultural restrictions and proportional representation in the Supreme Soviet . However , even a third delegation of the Germans that called at the Kremlin had to return without success ; they received a hearing , however , their demands produced no results . <p> Here is the viewpoint of the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR at that time , A. Mikoyan , who received the delegation of the Germans on June 7 , 1965 " ... We can not restore the republic now . That is beset with great difficulties ... We need the Germans in the new region , Kazakstan , and in the coal mines in Karaganda ... Not everything that has happened in history can be restored ... You are Soviet citizens and have the right to newspapers , schools ... We can not , in the present situation , manage the restoration of the autonomous republic , because that is connected with an immense economic cost , but we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , those were only sweeping promises . <p> German schools , whose founding ( in Kazakstan ) was authorized by an order of 1957 " at the wish of the parents " if there were enough pupils , were not forthcoming . There were some schools in the cities in which German as mother-tongue was offered two or three hours a week to one or two groups outside of the normal school day . The acute shortage of teachers and text books contributed to the fact that , German as a subject , was frequently removed from the schedule . In many cases young German teachers , who had been trained for German instruction in the mother-tongue were utilized to teach German as a foreign language at Russian or Kazakstan schools . Therefore , from the beginning , the participation of German children instruction in their mother-tongue was minor because of the lack of motivation ; in succeeding years it decreased even farther . According to statistics from the Ministry of Culture in Kazakstan , of the more than 600,000 Germans in Kazakstan in 1958 , only 975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that time , the children of the Russian-Germans , if they spoke German at all , spoke only the local dialect learned from their parents . <p> Since 1965 several dozen books written in German have appeared from the publishers " Progress " in Moscow and " Kazachstan " in Alma-Ata , that are not in great demand because of their mostly political content or too small a number of copies were printed of editions which quickly became out-of-print . Even books from the DDR East Germany were only available in very limited numbers . No printed matter was allowed to be imported from the Federal Republic West Germany . <p> Therefore , it was not surprising that the Germans could not even read " their own " newspapers , the weekly " Neues Leben " ( New Life ) , Moscow , " Freundshaft " ( Friendship ) , Zelinograd and " Rote Fahne " ( Red Flag ) , Slavgorod . <p> Aside from the language difficulties , the content of these newspapers , overloaded with ideology , and often a translation from Pravda , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this reading material was informative in one respect ; in the pages dedicated to the problems of the Germans , the sharp-eyed reader discovered a deeply shocking indirect admission of the actual situation of the Germans in the USSR with their " equal rights . " Consistently , one read about collective farmers , dairy maids , tractor drivers , cattle raisers , but rarely about qualified technicians , let alone academics . That was proof that , in spite of the highly-touted equality of opportunity , the Germans in the USSR were reduced to being a laboring and farming people . Only 3% of the Germans were allowed to attend college . Thread-bare excuses were often used to keep young men and women descent from matriculating . <p> The Seventies and Eighties <p> In spite of the partial rehabilitation of 1964 , the Germans had to remain in the areas to where they had been expelled . Even into the 1980 's the moral heritage of the German-Soviet war of 1941-1945 weighed upon them . It was not easy for them to get ahead in a country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious term " The ugly German " , had become the personification of all things evil and the synonym for " fascist . " For this reason , Soviet journalist for a long time gave them only marginal consideration . German-language newspapers , such as " Neues Leben " and " Freundschaft " ( now " Deutsche Allgemeine Zeiting " ) and the few German-language radio and television broadcasts , could scarcely dare to criticize the politics of state and party . German churches were subjected to considerable difficulties when they tried to register their congregations . " Heimatliche Weiten " ( Native Horizons ) , a collection of Russian-German poetry , prose and journalism , ceased publication after a few years . The German Theater of Drama , founded in 1981 in Temirtau , ( now in Alma-Ata ) had constant difficulties in staying alive . Instruction in the mother-tongue stagnated or in many places retreated , due to a lack of teachers and textbooks . <p> The efforts to achieve autonomy after 1964 had been unsuccessful . One could not expect help from their " Brother State " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Russian-Germans . For them they were only " Soviet citizens of German nationality . " In view of the Basic Law ( Art.116 ) , the government of the Federal Republic of Germany felt itself obligated to intercede on behalf of the Russian-Germans . The West German government was also repeatedly challenged to do so by the German Bundestag ; but at the same time their hands were tied , because the Soviet government considered every attempt to provide aid for the Russian-Germans an interfere in their internal affairs . That finally changed in the autumn of 1990 with the signing of the pact between the Federal Republic of Germany and the USSR. dealing with a good-neighbor policy , partnership and working together . Thus , downgraded to being a marginal group in Soviet society , the Russian-Germans saw only one way out of their desperate situation , emigration to Germany Federal Republic , the ancient homeland of their forefathers . <p> Family Reunification <p> During the years 1950 to 1957 only 3,895 Russian-German families received permission to emigrate . In 1958-1959 family reunification was agreed upon between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , the number of permissions rose only slowly or at times actually fell , while the requests to emigrate piled up at the Red Cross by the hundreds of thousands . Whoever received permission to emigrate was overjoyed , but , the large number of those who had to remain behind were bitterly disappointed . They were happy for their countrymen yet envied them at the same time . Who still remembers what things were like in those days ? <p> For the Russian-Germans , reaching Germany was the goal of their dreams . On this dream they staked everything ; profession , future , health , livelihood , even the little freedom that one possesses in a totalitarian state . <p> Because of their openly expressed wish to emigrate , Germans began what became a sort of living hell for them ; loss of jobs , harassment in the workplace and school , not being allowed to register with the police in another location , confiscation of property and houses , house searches and arrest while petitioning the authorities , to mention just a few obstacles . Worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation and rejection that was artificially aroused against those desiring to emigrate . Is it possible for someone in the free West to understand the torments of a person who was labeled a " criminal " and forced to live as a criminal only because he attempted to make use of his legitimate right to emigrate ? And can anyone here really understand how a Russian-German lived and felt after already spending 30 years ( since 1956 ! ) trying to emigrate ? <p> Can we in the West really understand how someone like Johann Wagner from the Modavian city of Tiraspol , had for years been tossed back and forth between hope and despair , and then finally delivered up to the whims of the bureaucracy ? That quiet , taciturn and hard-working man , who was the head of a large family was actually found guilty of being a " parasite " simply because of his dogged efforts to emigrate ! Later , however , he was freed on grounds of " insufficient evidence . " This Russian-German had sent about 200 petitions to all possible Soviet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet nothing happened . <p> Rejections , rejections , rejections ... usually they were completely baseless . The Germans inside the Soviet Union were at the mercy of the authorities even though they relied upon the Soviet laws , the Constitution , the Charter of Human Rights , and the Helsinki Accords . They also cited the " International Pact concerning Civil and Political rights " of 1966 adopted by the United Nations and signed and ratified by the Soviet Union . The official representatives countered : " You do not understand these documents , " or " We too have read the documents , but as yet have received no instructions ! ! " In Kirghis , for example , curious things happened ; the representative of the OWIR-station there , a certain Ssadybekow , explained his rejection to Mr. Wiebe as follows : " You were refused permission to emigrate , because in Germany the fascists are seeking to gain power ! " Anton Feininger from the Moldavian city of Bendery heard from the relevant authorities in Kischinjow : " It is West German Chancellor Schmidt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plain-speaking " was the rule , along the lines of : " We make the decision . If we want to , we will let you out , if not , then you will just stay here . " <p> The usual formula for rejection was : " You are an independent family and economically not dependent on your relatives in the Federal Republic . As you have only distant relatives in West Germany , you do not fit into the category of family reunification . " Seen in this light , there would never be any family reunification . <p> That was really a complicated subject , this notorious " Family reunification Soviet style " which was impossible to reconcile with logic or sound common sense . Who is related to whom , was decided by the local authorities on their own responsibility , there was no uniform regulation on this subject . Thus , for example , some brothers and sisters ( often within the same family ) , came under the rubrik " distant relatives " , others , however , were considered to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many such dissonances . The following are several examples : <p> Because of the wartime situation in 1944 , Alois Steiert was separated from his family , a wife and four children . Herr Steiert , who had lived in Germany since the end of the war , was not able to achieve family reunification until 1976 , but without his children . The son , Peter Steiert from Duschanbe commented : " The rejections of the OWIR of the Tadzikian SSR are incomprehensible ; with us it is really a clear case of family reunification . I grew up without a father and would finally like to get to know him , to find out what it means to have a father . Why does the state rob me of this right ? " <p> Another example is Frau Zilke who in her efforts to emigrate in 1978 had to leave two of her ten children behind . In one of her petitions the despairing mother wrote : " After many difficulties , we finally received permission in 1978 for all family members to emigrate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called up for military service and our daughter , Olga , had married . When she applied to the passport office in Tokmak ( Kirghis ) , to get permission for her husband , Herr Seidel , to emigrate also , she was told : " Get a divorce , then you can go ! " Olga Seidel had to remain behind , hoping that a request ( Wysow ) from her parents would lead to a positive decision for her and her husband . But Viktor Zilke and his sister , Olga Seidel , nee Zilke , remained separated from their family through the arbitrary use of Soviet power and force . <p> The authorities devised various harassments that sometimes verged on the grotesque ; emigration forms were given out in limited numbers at restricted times . For example , one could only pick up the forms with one 's supervisor at the workplace . But Olga Breitkreuz from this town was a housewife ; therefore she had no supervisor , and as a result did not receive any forms and could not prepare an emigration application . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1980 a group even demonstrated in Moscow 's Red Square , carrying banners on which they conspicuously demanded permission to emigrate . The militia led them away , the episode appeared in the foreign news , but the situation remained the same . <p> The issue concerning immigration and emigration did not change until the law of January 1 , 1987 .. Indeed , at first only relatives of the first degree could emigrate in the context of family reunification , but the authorization procedure became more liberal and more generous . <p> Current Areas of Settlement <p> Purely German villages , as witnessed before the the Second World War no longer exist in the European part of the Community of Independent States ( CIS ) . Those who were driven out were " settled " in outlying areas east of the Ural Mountains . And even though there are still some closed settlements in ( Omsk , Altai , Barnaul and Kirghis ) the overwhelming majority of the Russian-Germans are widely scattered among Russians in Siberia , Kazakstan and central Asia and among Kazachs , Kirghisi , Usbecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 1989 census about two million Germans live in the former Soviet Union . In reality this number is probably considerably larger , because at the time the census was taken there was still a personal risk in acknowledging oneself to be German . That was particularly true in the case of mixed marriages . During the past two decades a slow migration of individual families or smaller groups has taken place into the republics west of the Urals , so that an estimated 120,000-150,000 Russian-Germans have again settled in that region . The others live as before in the areas to which they have been expelled . <p> Because of the changed political situation in the republics of central Asia after the dissolution of the USSR , Germans who do not wish to immigrate to re-unified Germany are moving into the newly constituted German national districts Altai and Asowo . According to the latest information , at the end of 1993 these numbered about 170,000 . This migration appears to be continuing . <p> Social and Linguistic Restructuring <p> Before the First World War 95% of the Russian-Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of city dwellers gradually increased from 15.4% in 1926 to 27% in 1941 . According to the census of 1959 , 636,189 ( 39.3% ) of the Germans lived in cities . In 1970 the number grew to 838,515 ( 45.4% ) , and by 1989 the figure had reached 52% . <p> Male Russian-Germans are particularly numerous in the cities , especially those of the younger generation . The Germans in the city are less likely than those in rural areas to report German as their mother tongue . The pressure to assimilate is therefore , considerably stronger in the city . <p> Striving for Autonomy <p> In places where the Germans lived in closed settlements before World War II there were national governmental units such as the German Republic on the Volga , 16 German rayons ( districts ) and 500 German Soviets ( communities ) with their own government , judicial system and instructional language . The German districts and communities outside of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics ASSR of the Volga-Germans were dissolved in 1993 , the Volga-German Republic in 1941 . <p> In the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Russian- Germans initially gave up their efforts for the restoration of their own state , and solely concentrated on emigrating to the Federal Republic of Germany . But the Soviet government had an extremely restrictive attitude towards the Russian-Germans and gave out very few permissions to emigrate ; ( the low point was 1985 : 460 during the entire year ) . Therefore , the discussion for autonomy of the Germans did not arise again until the beginning of the democratization process in the second half of the 1980 's . In order to give more force to their demands the Germans organized themselves . Three social organizations were created which today are called : <p> III . International Association for German Culture , abbreviated German IVDK , Russian MSNK ) <p> Under the leadership of " Wiedergeburt , " the largest association of Russian-Germans which increased its membership to 170,000 . Three congresses of Russian-Germans were held between 1991-1993 , at which approxiately l , 000 delegates from all parts of the Soviet Union or Community of Independent States ( CIS ) participated .. A 108-member " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MGSR ) was established to protect the interests of all Germans in the CIS . <p> After a long struggle over a common program , today all three organizations have the same two goals : the restoration of the Volga Republic and the founding of German national districts in predominantly German areas . <p> At the third Congress in February , 1993 , it was decided to hold a national referendum and to elect a Volkstag as a preliminary parliament of the Russian-Germans ( cf.p.34 ) . <p> In the meantime there were some successes in the question of autonomy . Two German districts were formed : the rayon Halbstadt , in the Altai region and the rayon Asowo , in the Omsk area . <p> The Russian president , Boris Yeltsin , ordered the founding of a German district and a German county ( Okrug ) in the areas of Saratov and Volgograd , but without further designating their borders and without any orders for carrying this out . That appears to be simply a promise ( cf.p.31 ) . <p> The German federal government supports the Russian-Germans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1992 , Germany and Russia signed a mutual protocol concerning the restoration of the Volga Republic in stages ( 4-5 years ) . A German-Russian and a German-Ukrainian governmental commission were founded , that are responsible for all concerns of the Russian-Germans . <p> The Russian-Germans associations cooperate with the commissions .. As the most recent results of this consultation , three regions were designated to be the first to be supported : the Volga area , western Siberia and southern Ukraine . ( cf.p.19 ) . The founding of more German districts was demanded by the Germans . As long as the Volga German Republic is not restored as the cultural center for all Russian-Germans in the former Soviet Union , it is uncertain whether the number of Germans preferring to emigrate to the Federal Republic of Germany will decline . <p> The Present Situation <p> Although knowledge about the Russian-Germans in all parts of the former Soviet Union is alarmingly full of gaps , the Germans in the nations of the Community of Independent States ( CIS ) , with few exceptions , are today no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old prejudices are expressed towards them by members of non-German groups . But officially they are encouraged to stay where they are , or they are invited with grand promises to settle in other republics , regions and cities . Usually some financial support from Germany is expected in connection with this . <p> In spite of this the number of Russian-Germans wanting to emigrate does not decrease . There are many different reasons for this desire . In the nations of the CIS , for example , the democratization process is proceeding very slowly . A judicially enforceable guaranty of the right to the restoration of their own sovereignty does not yet exist . And the Russian-Germans , after decades of discrimination and persecution , are very distrustful of all governmental promises . The most recent occurrences in Moscow and in the Russian Federation have awakened new fears . <p> In addition there is the fear that the Islamic fundamentalism that is expanding in many parts of the world could one day go too far , producing conditions like civil war , as in Tadzikistan . The instability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their coalescing national self-interest are creating additional fears for the future . <p> Also , the introduction of the language of the nominal nation as the official language in the central Asiatic republics has brought new concerns : In addition to the Russian language , all citizens , if they wish to hold their own in the future , have to learn the official language . Thus , the mother-tongue of the Germans is pushed even further into the background . <p> And assimilation proceeds with giant steps ; although in the 1926 Census 95% of the Russian-Germans reported German as their mother tongue , this percentage has declined steadily : in 1959 it was 75% , in 1970 , 67.8% , in 1979 , 57% and in 1989 , 48.7% . <p> Today , five years later , this percentage will likely have sunk further still . The most important reason for this is that even today , no German schools of the pre-war kind exist . There is only a sporadic offering of instruction of the German language as a regular subject and then only in the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oddly qualified teacher . In addition , professional instruction in German as mother-tongue ( MUD ) is in an unsatisfactory condition . Properly trained teachers are lacking , there are no long-range instructional plans , and proper textbooks and teaching materials are absent . <p> Instruction in German as a foreign language can not fill the gap , as at most Russian Federation schools the only foreign language taught is English . In addition , English is not , of course , in a position to replace German as the mother-tongue . Since no German schools have existed since the period between 1938-1941 , a Russian-German already at retirement age , for example , has been unable to receive any regular instruction in German . In spite of this , German is still spoken in many families today , mostly in the dialect of their forefathers , if parents or grandparents were able to pass it on . That is why the Russian-Germans are very concerned about regaining and maintaining their ethnic traditions . As with all plans for the future , they set their hopes above all on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The German Federal Republic and Baden-Wnrttemberg , the patron state of the Russian-Germans , try to be helpful in manifold ways to those Germans who wish to " stay " in the Russian Federation and search for realizable future prospects as a national minority . Those officials of the Federal Republic 's Ministry of the Interior who are responsible for immigration , promote German instruction of the mother-tongue in Russian Federation kindergartens and schools . The Ministry contributes millions of Deutsch Marks for sending German teachers and language consultants , as well as supplying teaching and learning materials . <p> Effective help is also being provided by the Federal Republic for the founding , furnishing and continuing support of German cultural centers inside the former Soviet Union . Existing establishments and new settlements are being sponsored ; the German rayons Asowo and Halbstadt are being assisted in the build-up of their administration and in the completion of their infrastructure through financial subsidies and the sending of consultants . In spite of this , large deficits remain . The German-Russians happily accept this support and are grateful for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run will also depend on the larger political and economic development in the components of the Community of Independent States . <p> From Emigration to Integration <p> Due to the change in course of Soviet policies in the 1980s as a result of Gorbachev 's " Perestroika " and " Glasnost " and from the pressure of world opinion , the government of the former Soviet Union was no longer able to ignore obligations entered into by treaty under the framework of international agreements for the protection of human rights . The Russian-Germans , who had already been waiting for many years for permission to emigrate , especially profited from these changes . After the " Law Concerning Immigration and Emigration " became effective on January 1 , 1987 , the approval system was loosened step by step and the numbers of emigrants began rosing slowly in 1987 . There were 14,488 ; in 1988 , 47,572 ; in 1989 , 98,134 ; in 1990 , 147,950 ; in 1991 , 147,320 and in 1992 , 195,576 . In 1993 the number is expected to be about 200,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of laws . At first , the procedure was regulated according to Article 116.1 of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal Expellee and Refugee Act ( FERA ) of 1953 . With the increase in the number of Russian-German emigrants extending into the hundreds of thousands , restrictions and reductions in benefits were gradually introduced . For example , late applicants could only send their applications from their country of origin , and after their arrival it is only under certain circumstances that they would be allowed to freely choose their place of residence in Germany . The War Results Adjustment Act , which took effect on January 1 , 1993 , in addition to a series of deletions and restrictions of benefits and rights , set an annual quota for the admission of late emigrants , ( ca.225,000 ) . The considerable reduction in the benefits and rights of the later emigrants is very difficult and painful for those concerned . In spite of the hardships that they are being asked to endure , and against which the Landsmannschaft has taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should not overlook the fact that the law has been clarified in various ways . <p> The approximately two million Russian-Germans still living in the countries of the CIS can now be certain that legal return to Germany will be on a fairly long-term basis , and that the rules for admittance have been stated in unambiguous and concrete terms . Other than that , the public discussion about if , and how , latecomers to Germany should be admitted has been considerably reduced in its shrillness and in general has greatly subsided . <p> Those later Russian-German emigrants arrived in Germany with great expectations . After the fulfillment of a decades-long dream of being finally able to immigrate to the home of their forefathers , they are overjoyed to step onto German soil . It was difficult for them to make the decision to abandon relatives , friends and colleagues , property acquired through years of hard work and savings , their houses , furnishings and automobiles . Still , they make these great sacrifices to live in freedom as " Germans among Germans , " to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a new life for themselves and their families . Therefore , they want to work and adapt themselves to their new circumstances . <p> They want to become German citizens as quickly as possible and aspire to speedy integration . However , they resist giving up their identity , as they consider themselves to be a nation molded by a hard fate , which does not seek any kind of favor , but requires only an acknowledgement of its particular nature , singularity and culture . The process of inclusion requires time , integration must evolve . That is particularly true for the middle and older generations ; it is easier for the young people . In general , it is not realistic to expect patterns of behavior from new immigrants that ought only to be found at the end of this inegration process . <p> The Russian-Germans have their own values , which they desire to maintain . In the years of persecution and deportation their belief in a " higher justice " was the only thing that they could hold on to ; that gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced these injustices still hold fast to their religious beliefs today . A highly developed sense of family , including the extended family , customs and usages from long ago , readiness to help neighbors , frugality , diligence and industry are all ethnic qualities of their particular nature rooted in their combined German cultural history . Through their ethnic particularities maintained for centuries , they increase the diversity of modern German culture . The Russian-Germans revive long-forgotten cultural values , customs , songs and dialects and bring them back into the combined German consciousness . <p> One should not ignore the fact that the Russian-Germans have lived together peacefully and as good neighbors with other national groups . Because of their suffering under the Bolscheviki dictatorship , they turn aside every strain of political radicalism , whether of the right or the left . The Russian-Germans have prerequisites for becoming a bridge to the Russians , Ukrainians , Kazachstani and other peoples of the Community of Independent States . <p> Beyond that , they are an economic asset for modern Germany . For example , among the indigenous population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years make up 21.5% , the age group over 65 years makes up nearly 15% , the corresponding figures among the Russian-German emigrants are 37.9% and 6.8% . Thus the comparatively younger population of emigrants will contribute to the long-range security of pensions and annuities . The large consumption needs of the immigrant arriving with one suitcase are a considerable addition to the German retail economy . Therefore , the later Russian-German emigrants are not only consumers , but also producers . They desire no exaggerated sympathy or charity , but are thankful for self-help . <p> Whenever the Russian Germans are openly or behind their backs referred to as " economic refugees , " or accused of receiving " pensions at our expense , " it affects them deeply . Everyone knows that the pensions are paid from current contributions to the social insurance in the Federal Republic includes working Russian-Germans . It is equally depressing when they are blamed for being partially responsible for the German shortage of housing and jobs , as they are satisfied with comparatively small dwellings and are happy if they get any job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifications . For them the most important thing is that they are finally living in Germany . <p> They , however , react with the utmost sensitivity when they are accused of " not being Germans at all , because they do not even speak German . " After all , they did acknowledge themselves to be German in the times of the worst persecution and ethnic discrimination . In addition , their lack of German language skills can be explained by the fact that since 1938-1941 there have been no German schools in the former Soviet Union . <p> While the churches , private charitable organizations , and many individuals are assisting the later emigrants in an exemplary fashion , these and similar misunderstandings put a strain on the relationship between the " natives " and one million Russian-German emigrants who live in Germany . They are essentially victims resulting from widespread ignorance of the history and fate of the Russian-Germans , the only group of German people collectively denied their human rights for decades . <p> The German federal government through its own measures and financial support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The churches are also doing a good job enlightening people and spreading information . It would also be very welcome change if Russian-German themes were more emphasized in teaching and programs in the schools , in adult education and higher education , in the media , in publications and in trade unions and employer associations , organizations and municipalities . <p> It should generally be made public , that the Russian-Germans today are still suffering from the consequences of deportation and discrimination for which they are not to blame . Germany has a historical duty to care for them , because the history of the Russian-German people is a part of German history . <p> The Landsmannschaft and the Cultural Council of the Germans from Russia <p> Of the 350,000 Germans from Russia that made it to the Wartheland and farther to the West during the the Second World War , 250,000 of them were " forcibly repatriated . " About 100,000 were able to save themselves by escaping into the occupation zones of the Western Powers , but even there , with the knowledge , acquiescence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the hunt for these people . About 30,000 Russian-Germans emigrated from West Germany during the years 1945-1950 for economic reasons and out of fear of Soviet oppression . They predominantly migrated to the USA , Canada , South America and Australia . The remaining intimidated minority of 70,000 persons nevertheless created their own representation . For safety and political reasons this was called " Worker 's Community of Resettlers from the East " and was built up under the protection of the churches . Among the founders were Superintendent Johannes Schleuning ( + ) , Pastor Heinrich Roemmich ( + ) , Dr. Karl Stumpp ( + ) , Dr. Gottleib Leibbrandt ( + ) and Prof. Dr. Benjamin Unruh ( + ) . In 1950 the organization was renamed the " Landsmannschaft der Deutschen aus Ruland " ( The Brotherhood of the Germans from Russia ) . <p> The Landsmannschaft is a registered organization based in Stuttgart , whose contribution to the public welfare is acknowledged . It utilizes many volunteer workers and has a small staff of full-time employees ; it supports state groups in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and district groups . It devotes itself to the material , cultural and social integration of the late emigrants in the Federal Republic of Germany through cooperation in the production of a social framework for the emigrants . The Landmannschaft also provides education and offers legal assistance for those concerned .. <p> It pursues and promotes research into the history , the culture , and the present situation of the German minority in the Community of Independent States ( CIS ) and brings the results to the attention of the public by means of the media , politicians , scientists and associations . It does this through its monthly journal , " Volk auf dem Weg " ( since 1950 ) and by means of a number of publications . In 1981 the Cultural Council of the Germans from Russia was founded for the purpose of researching the history of the Germans from Russia to cultivate , maintain and pass on their cultural heritage . This is a non-profit institution which works closely with the Landsmannschaft . <p> The Landsmannschaft and the Cultural Council also consider themselves to represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle for sovereignty they support as much as they are able . In addition they use their influence to support the realization of the national and individual rights of the Germans in the CIS , as well as free emigration from the CIS and unlimited immigration into the Federal Republic of Germany . <p> Both organizations support the principles : Whoever does not wish to or can not emigrate , must be helped in his search for dependable prospects for the future , but whoever is striving to emigrate , for him the gate must remain open .

Genetic knowledge was needed to determine the resiliency of the human genome ( 1 ) . <p> Worldwide discussion about a HGP began in 1985 . In 1986 , the DOE announced its ' Human Genome Initiative which emphasized the development of resources and technologies for genome mapping , sequencing , computation , and infrastructure support that would lead to the entire human genome map ( 3 ) . United States involvement began in October 1990 and was coordinated by the DOE and the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) .

Because of the involvement of the NIH , DOE , and NSF who receive U.S. Congressional funding , the HGP is partly funded through federal tax dollars ( 1 ) . Expected to last 15 years , technological advancements have accelerated the expected date of completion to the year 2003 . This completion date would coincide with the 50th anniversary of Watson and Crick 's description of the structure of DNA molecule ( 3 ) . <p> Human Genome Project Goals <p> The specific goals of the HGP are to : : <p> Identify all the estimated 80,000 genes in the human DNA , <p> Determine the sequences of the 3 billion DNA chemical bases . <p> Store this information in databases , <p> Develop tools for data analysis , and <p> Address the possible ethical , legal , and social issues ( ELSI ) ( 3 ) . <h> Technical Aspects of the HGP <p> The process of determining the human genome involves first mapping , or characterizing the chromosomes .

Physical maps are a series of overlapping pieces of DNA isolated in bacteria ( 6 ) . Physical maps are used to describe the DNA 's chemical characteristics . Mapping involves dividing the chromosomes into fragments that can be propagated and characterized , and then ordering them to correspond to their respective chromosomal locations ( 7 ) . Genetic markers are invaluable for genome mapping . Markers are any inherited physical or molecular characteristics that are different among individuals of a population . An example of a marker includes restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLP ) . RFLPs reflect sequence differences in DNA sites that can be cleaved by restriction enzymes . To be useful in mapping , markers must be polymorphic , or have more than one form among individuals so that they can be detectable in studies ( 7 ) . Another marker is Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeats ( VNTR ) , which are small sections of repeating DNA . VNTRs are prevalent in human DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variability gives individuals unique VNTR regions . This is the application behind solving crime cases with blood samples ( 1 ) . A genetic map shows the relative locations of these specific markers on chromosomes ( 7 ) . <p> Used in RFLP markers are restriction enzymes . These enzymes recognize short sequences of DNA and cut them at specific sites . Since scientists have characterized hundreds of different restriction enzymes , DNA can be cut into many different fragments . These fragments are the DNA pieces used in physical maps ( 7 ) . <p> Different types of physical maps exist . Low-resolution physical maps include chromosomal ( or Cytogenetic ) maps that are based on distinctive banding patterns of stained chromosomes . High-resolution physical maps represent sets of DNA fragments that were cut by restriction enzymes and placed in order as previously described ( 7 ) . <p> Sequencing Strategies <p> To sequence DNA , it must be first be amplified , or increased in quantity . Two types of DNA amplifications are cloning and Polymerase Chain Reactions ( PCR ) . Cloning involves the propagation of DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , DNA fragments isolated from restriction enzymes are united with a vector and then reproduced along with the vector 's cell DNA .

Cloning provides an unlimited amount of DNA for experimental study ( 7 ) . <p> With PCRs , DNA can be amplified hundreds of millions of times in a matter of hours , a task that would have taken days with recombinant DNA technology . PCR is valuable because the reaction is highly specific , easily automated , and capable of amplifying very small amounts of DNA . For these reasons , PCR has had major impacts on clinical medicine , genetic disease diagnosis , forensic science , and evolutionary biology ( 7 ) . <p> PCR is a process through which a specialized polymerase enzyme synthesizes a complementary strand of DNA to a separate given strand of DNA in a mixture of DNA bases and DNA fragments . The mixture is heated , separating the two strands in a double-stranded DNA molecule . The mixture is then cooled and through the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find and bind to their complementary sequences on the now separated strands . The result is two double helix strands from one double helix strand . Repeated heating and cooling cycles in PCR machines amplify the target DNA exponentially . In less than 90 minutes , PCR cycles can amplify DNA by a millionfold ( 7 ) . <p> Now that the DNA has been amplified , sequencing can begin . Two basic approaches are Maxam-Gilbert sequencing and Sanger sequencing . Both methods are successful because gel electrophoresis can produce high-resolution separations of DNA molecules . Electrophoresis is the process of using gels with stained DNA and then separating those DNA fragments according to size by the use of electric current through the gel . Even fragments that have only one single different nucleotide can be separated . Almost all of the steps in both of these sequences are now automated ( 7 ) . <p> Maxam-Gilbert sequencing , also called chemical degradation method , cleaves DNA at specific bases using chemicals . The result is different length fragments . A refinement to this method known as multiplex sequencing enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequencing gel . <p> Sanger sequencing , also called the chain termination or dideoxy method , uses enzymes to synthesize DNA of varying length in four different reactions , stopping the replication at positions occupied by one of the four bases , and then determining the resulting fragment lengths ( 7 ) . <p> A major goal of the HGP is to develop automated sequencing technology that can accurately sequence more than 100,000 bases per day . Specific focuses include developing sequencing and detection schemes that are faster , more sensitive , accurate , and economical ( 7 ) . In 1991 , computer technology entered the sequencing process at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where an artificial intelligence program called GRAIL was tested ( 1 ) . <h> Applications of the HGP <p> Scientists estimate that chromosomes in the human population differ at about 0.1% . Understanding these differences could lead to discovery of heritable diseases , as well as diseases and other traits that are common to man ( 6 ) . Information gained from the HGP has already fueled many positive discoveries in health care . Well-publicized successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retinoblastoma , cystic fibrosis , and neurofibromatosis ( 2 ) . Increasingly detailed genomic maps have also aided researchers seeking genes associated with fragile X syndrome , types of inherited colon cancer , Alzheimer 's disease , and familial breast cancer ( 3 ) . <p> If other disease-related genes are isolated , scientists can begin to understand the structure and pathology of other disorders such as heart disease , cancer , and diabetes . This knowledge would lead to better medical management of these diseases and pharmaceutical discovery ( 2 ) . <p> Current and potential applications of genome research will address national needs in molecular medicine , waste control and environmental cleanup , biotechnology , energy sources , and risk assessment ( 3 ) . <p> Molecular Medicine <p> Through genetic research , medicine will look more into the fundamental causes of diseases rather than concentrating on treating symptoms . Genetic screening will enable rapid and specific diagnostic tests making it possible to treat countless maladies ( 3 ) . DNA-based tests clarify diagnosis quickly and enable geneticists to detect carriers within families . Genomic information can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , if the gene responsible for Huntington 's disease is present , it may be certain that symptoms will eventually occur , although predicting the exact time may not be possible . Other diseases where susceptibility may be determined include heart disease , cancer , and diabetes ( 2 ) . <p> Medical researchers will be able to create therapeutic products based on new classes of drugs , immunotherapy techniques , and possible augmentation or replacement of defective genes through gene therapy ( 3 ) . <p> Waste Control and Environmental Cleanup <p> In 1994 , through advances gained by the HGP , the DOE formulated the Microbial Genome Initiative to sequence the genomes of bacteria useful in the areas of energy production , environmental remediation , toxic waste reduction , and industrial processing . Resulting from that project , six microbes that live under extreme temperature and pressure conditions have been sequenced . By learning the unique protein structure of these microbes , researchers may be able to use the organisms and their enzymes for such practical purposes as waste control and environmental cleanup ( 3 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry with a wealth of opportunities . Sales of biotechnology products are projected to exceed $20 billion by the year 2000 . The HGP has stimulated significant investment by large corporations and promoted the development of new biotechnology companies hoping to capitalize on the implications of HGP research ( 3 ) . <p> Energy Sources <p> Biotechnology , strengthened by the HGP , will be important in improving the use of fossil-based resources . Increased energy demands require strategies to circumvent the many problems with today 's dominant energy technologies . Biotechnology will help address these needs by providing a cleaner means for the bioconversion of raw materials to refined products . Additionally , there is the possibility of developing entirely new biomass-based energy sources . Having the genomic sequence of the methane-producing microorganism Methanococcus jannaschii , for example , will allow researchers to explore the process of methanogenesis in more detail and could lead to cheaper production of fuel-grade methane ( 3 ) . <p> Risk Assessment <p> Understanding the human genome will have an enormous impact on the ability to assess risks posed to individuals by environmental exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people to be more susceptible than others to such agents . More work must be done to determine the genetic basis of such variability , but this knowledge will directly address the DOE 's long-term mission to understand the effects of low-level exposures to radiation and other energy-related agents , especially in terms of cancer risk ( 3 ) . Additional positive spin-offs from this research include a better understanding of biology , increased taxonomic understanding , increased development of pest-resistant and productive crops and livestock , and other commercially useful microorganisms ( 8 ) . <h> Ethical , Legal and Social Implications <p> Early planners of the HGP realized that human genomic mapping and sequencing would have profound implications for individuals , families and our society . Although this information can potentially and dramatically improve human health , it would raise a number of ethical , legal and social issues ( ELSI ) such as how this information would be interpreted and used , who would have access to it , and how can society prevent harm from improper use of genetic information . To address these issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HGP . ELSI was created so that potential problem areas could be identified and solutions created before genetic information is integrated into modern health care practices ( 4 ) . This is a unique aspect because the HGP is the first large scientific endeavor to address social issues that may arise from the project ( 3 ) . The DOE and NIH genome programs each set aside 3-5% of their annual budgets for the study of ELSI ( 4 ) . <p> There are four major priorities being addressed by ELSI . The first is the issue of privacy and fairness in the use and interpretation of genetic information . As genetic information is being discovered , the risk of genetic discrimination increases as new disease genes are identified . The issue of privacy and confidentiality , including questions of ownership and control of genetic information becomes critical . Fair use of this information for insurance , employment , criminal justice , education , adoption , and the military is necessary . Also , the impact of genetic information on psychological responses to family relationships and individual stigmatizations becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ELSI is the clinical integration of new genetic technologies . It has been questioned if health professionals are adequately educated about genetics , genetic technologies and the implications of their use . Important issues include individual and family counseling and testing , informed consent for individual considering genetic testing , and the use of such genetic test for the use of reproductive risk assessment and making reproductive decisions ( 5 ) . <p> The issues that surround genetic research are the third priority of ELSI . Such issues include the commercialization of the products from human genetic research . Examples are questions of the ownership of tissue and tissue derived products , patents , copyrights , and accessibility of data and materials ( 5 ) . <p> The fourth priority is the education of the general public and health care providers . ELSI funded surveys have revealed that most of the public and health professionals are not knowledgeable about genetics , genetic technologies and the implications of having genetic information . It is essential that the public understands the meaning of genetic information and that the nation 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrate this new knowledge and technologies into diagnosis , prevention , and treatment of diseases ( 5 ) . <h> Personal Opinion About the HGP <p> Although vast issues of social implications have arisen from genetic research , society has too much to gain from the discovery and consequent understanding of the human body and all its components . Americans alone spend enormous sums of money on personal health care including diet pills , hair loss , and virility drugs . It is unforeseable to me that our society will stop its ' quest to be healthier and happier . <p> I believe that genetic research and information should not be allowed in any discriminatory manner . Insurance companies should not be allowed to deny coverage to individual or even have access to that information . The rights of privacy need to be strengthened . Employers and employments agencies should not know an individuals ' genetic information . This information should be for the individual at risk of health concerns only and used in treatment or possible prevention . <p> To be valuable to society , genetic information must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class distinctions between those who can afford better health care must not enter the use of genetic research and information . <p> The positive endeavors such as environmental issues of clean-up and waste management , increased agricultural production and safe food quality should be strengthened . <p> Genetic research is further extension for the human mind to understand our own beings . We desire information . I do not believe it is possible , if even necessary , to stop the advancement of scientific discovery . As a society and human race , the question that should be concerning and focused on is rather what issues resulting from this discovery need to be addressed . Our curiosity will not stop . Let us use new genetic information to advance the prosperity of the human population . 
@@13708460 @2308460/ <h> The Ethics of Gene Therapy <h> Emilie R. Bergeson <p> Copyright 1997 <h> Introduction <p> Francis Crick was quoted as saying , " We used to think that our fate was in our stars . Now we know that , in large measure , our fate is in our genes . " Over 40 years ago , James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . From this a new technique has evolved called gene therapy . Gene therapy was discovered in the 1980s a few years after researchers were already able to isolate specific genes from DNA . These techniques matured from the massive surge of ideas generated during the Recombinant DNA ( rDNA ) era . Gene therapy is basically the repairing of genes to correct for diseases that result from a loss or change in our genetic material . It is hard to comprehend the total effects of gene therapy , because we do not know if it should really be used ? Who does it really benefit ? And ultimately people can easily contemplate how it affects him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene therapy some technical aspects need to be discussed . <h> Technical aspects <p> DNA is present in the nucleus of cells and is the genetic information of all organisms . The information of a human genome could be thought of in terms as an " encyclopedia " , the 23 chromosome pairs would be " chapters " , each gene a " sentence " , three letter words " codons " , which are spelled by each letter a " molecular nucleotide " --adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , and thymine ( T ) ( Elmer-Dewitt , 1994 ) . A gene acts as a blueprint and if these were blueprints for a house and the measurements were off by a foot , it has a huge influence on its total structure . This is the same for our bodies , if a slight alteration in our genetic information occurs like a mutation this could lead to a disease . <p> Detecting whether an individual has the capacity to develop a specific disease during their life and being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene responsible is done by genetic testing . Genetic testing is basically done by cutting a piece of DNA with restriction enzymes and inserting them into a plasmid and finally analyzing the gene . Once a gene is located and defined as the cause of the disease , scientists can then start to develop a plan of action for gene therapy . <p> There are three sequential steps to gene therapy : first , the partial removal of a patients cells , second , the introduction of normal , functional copies of the gene via vectors to replace defective cells in the patient , and finally , the reintroduction of the modified cells into the patient once the genes have been fixed in their vectors ( Gardner et al . 1991 ) . <p> According to Mulligan ( 1993 ) , transfer of appropriate target cells is the first critical step in gene therapy . Many different methods of accomplishing gene delivery are available such as viral methods like retrovirus , adenovirus , adeno-associated virus , herpes virus , vaccinia virus , polio virus , sindbis and other RNA viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injection of DNA , or CaOP4 precipitation are also used . For example , retroviral vectors are very promising because of their ability to stably transduce close to 100% of target cells . They have also become a widely used vector because they can not transfer their own genetic material into their host ( only the newly modified genetic material ) . One of gene therapys most evasive goals has been the development of safe and effective methods of implanting normal genes into the human cell . <p> One of several obstacles to human gene transfer has been the reoccurring plague of inconsistent results . For example , two children with an ADA deficiency receiving periodic infusions of T cells modified ex vivo with the normal ADA gene have shown a resulting proportion of normal ADA cells varying from 0.1 to 60% . There have been problems with development of gene transfer in animals and once experimented on humans the predictions have deviated . There have also been significant problems with the production of vectors . The ability to generate replicates and be able to keep them uncontaminated has posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be capable of efficiently delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application . The vector should be very specific , unrecognized by the immune system , stable , highly reproducible , and be purified in large quantities at high concentrations . Once the vector is inserted into the patient it should not induce an allergic reaction like inflammation , it should be safe not only for the patient , but also for the environment . This is a huge hurdle for vectors because generally the most effective vectors are the most toxic . They have the ability to get the DNA into the cells , but are very costly to the patient . Finally , a vector should also be able to express the gene for as long as it is required , generally the life of the patient ( Crystal 1995 ) . <p> To deliver vector two techniques have been used : the ex-vivo and the in-vivo . The most common technique has been the ex-vivo method ( outside the living body ) , which uses extracted cells from the patient . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease-causing genes have been removed . Next , the blood cells with defective genes are removed from the patient , the patients blood is mixed with the engineered viruses , and the genetically engineered blood cells are reinfused in the patient to produce the protein needed to fight the disease . <p> The in-vivo method ( in the living body ) does not use cells from the patients body , thus eliminating expensive , and very time consuming laboratory procedures . Vectors , like viruses are again cut of their disease-causing genes and given the normal genes . The vectors are then injected into the patients bloodstream to seek out and bind with the targeted cells like ADA diseased cells . The normal gene in the virus is incorporated into the chromosome of the target cell and forces a reaction with the protein needed to reverse the effects of the disease . <p> Inserting the gene into specific cells of the body where the defect is causing the disease is called somatic cell gene therapy . Each cell in the body has the exact same DNA as the original fertilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genotype to develop different tissues that perform different functions . As a result , the genetic defect is often only distinguished in a specific area like tissues . The goal of somatic cell gene therapy is to insert the normal or transformed cell into the specific affected tissue . Not all tissues need to be treated , only enough cells need to be treated to provide the correct amount of enzymes to allow for the protein to develop and reach the site of action in a particular tissue . <p> The first use of somatic cell gene therapy was for the treatment of adenosine deaminase deficiency ( ADA ) in children commonly known as " bubble babies . " This is a rare immune system disorder that ultimately prohibits the body from defending against invaders like the common cold . Because doctors were able to successful insert healthy , normal cells into the child with the blood from its umbilical cord , their immune defenses were able to fully form . The child did not reject the healthy genes and doctors claim the genes are " expressing " ( Gorman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is germline gene therapy . The altered gene is inserted into the sperm or egg cells ( germ cells ) , and this ultimately leads to a change in not only the individual receiving the treatment , but also future offspring . It is also possible to insert the altered cells into an early stage embryo that would affect both the germline and somatic cells . Yet , most governments have limited all gene therapy experiments to somatic gene therapy because the alteration performed in germ gene therapy would change future generations . <h> Pro and con arguments <p> " Medicine has been waiting for this for thousands of years . This is a truly historic moment , " said Gerard J. Garrity , chairperson of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ( R.A.C. ) of the National Institute of Health ( N.I.H. ) . This comment came when the first R.A.C. committee approved two experiments in human gene therapy . The N.I.H. took more than three years to consider and approve these two experiments . The researcher must answer several questions to gain approval of performing gene therapy experiments upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good candidate for gene therapy , what makes the scientists sure that the new gene will be properly inserted and regulated so as to be expressed usefully in the patient , and what are the technical details of the DNA and vector to be used . The technical aspects involved , risks endeavored by the patient , and the fear of human genetic engineering are some of the major reasons why human gene therapy experiments have long been delayed . <p> People polled have shown approximately a 50/50 split for and against gene therapy . Dr. Maurice Super , a consultant clinical geneticist at the Royal Manchester Childrens Hospital in Manchester , England and supporter of genetic engineering capabilities , opened a pavilion type Gene Shop ( a motto : " What keeps body and soul together ? Your genes " ) in an airport that aims at educating people about the benefits of new technologies . He has said , " The aim is to decrease the fear of a brave new world and encourage people to be more proactive about their health . " Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet more than 7,000 people have visited the Gene Shop <p> No one denies that gene therapy will yield results that will in some peoples eyes be a miracle . Yet , even citizens for the advancements of gene therapy are growing increasingly concerned that the initial studies and excitement led to a premature rush of approved gene therapy experiments ( Gorman 1995 ) . Researchers are not certain what is the best method of gene transportation . As stated earlier , there are several different types of transport systems such as : viral ; retroviral or adenoviral , or non viral ; ligand-DNA conjugates or lipofection and deciding the best vector takes time . <p> Proactive citizens for genetic engineering believe they can use gene therapy to stop a sick child from dying to helping their own children be smarter , jump higher , or even grow bigger . Problems can arise when the parental love will go to the extreme of making their child as superior as possible . These people also believe new developments like the genetically engineered cancer vaccine is an incredible tool that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress that genetic diseases cause suffering to the patient and to their families . They believe in the proactive direction of medicine to try to cure diseases and alleviate suffering . Gene therapy is new and if properly controlled it will help the public from suffering . <p> Taking bits and pieces of DNA , inserting them , and hope they are expressed is what many people believe our body is ready to ward off against . So how can people against genetic engineering experiments understand the concept of gene therapy ? There are some sites on the World Wide Web and journal articles of people who believe that this can not happen , but these are some people that do not believe in the whole theory of genes and the study of genetics . <p> These opponents have reservations because gene therapy is so new and unpredictable . The rationalizations of the World War II come flooding back and the believability of Hitlers dream or eugenics will come true once more . This is a reality and a fear to many people . They often feel that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to deal with the ethical consequences , " stated David King , editor of Genethics News . He also went on to say there is nothing holy about a fragment of DNA . Which is contrary to what 58% of the people polled by Time/CNN think , that altering human genes is against the will of God . And that is holy in many peoples eyes . Of those same people polled , 90% said they thought it should be against the law for insurance companies to use genetic tests to decide who is insured ( Elmer-Dewitt 1994 ) . <p> Other opponents are not so tentative when dealing with advancements in gene therapy . For example eight years ago , Jeremy Rifkin , along with 75 religious leaders , strove unsuccessfully for a permanent ban on gene therapy by submitting a resolution to the U.S. Senate . People honestly believe altering our God given body is very wrong and sinful . It is not right playing around with Mother Nature , she has created something sacred and it should not be changed . Not being a responsible citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the opposition to gene therapy . <p> No topic in genetics has provoked as much controversy as patent rights to human life forms . The Supreme Courts 5-4 decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty in 1980 permitted the right to patent life forms . Many opponents said the courts decision permits ownership of things that can not , morally or ethically , be owned . Other objectors also say " it debases life itself " by commercializing human and animal life forms , and again fuel supporters of eugenics . Jeremy Rifkin , president of the Foundation on Economic Trends , said , " It took Congress 30 years of debate before allowing patents for some varieties of plants . The Supreme Courts decision was a construction created out of sand that has no foundation . " <p> Chief Justice Warren E. Burger , writer for the majority of the Supreme Courts decision , argued that the decision for patents was justified . Their example was the case of genetically engineered bacteria that was designed to degrade petroleum and help clean up oil spills . He said the bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered Gods handiwork , but the result of human ingenuity . Patent supporters do not confer ownership or try to make gods of human beings , but enable researchers to raise money . Investors could not support expensive and uncertain biotechnological endeavors without the guarantee of a patent ( Donegan 1995 ) . <h> Personal opinion <p> People dream of a life without disease and sickness . I know I do . Being able to have a healthy , normal child and die from plain old age , is something I believe everyone has thought about or even prayed for . I believe that gene therapy is a necessity . But I must be specific in saying that I believe somatic gene therapy is essential to the development of making a sick child healthy . I do not believe in " playing God " and therefore think that germ line gene therapy is off limits , more so not even comprehensible . <p> What makes a disease suitable for gene therapy ? Darryl Macer , Ph.D . ( 1990 ) stated that gene therapy is generally considered for single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are easily understood medically and genetically and have no other recourse for treatment ( a last resort ) are suitable diseases . This can cover a broad base of diseases from enzyme deficiencies to AIDS or cancer . I do not like to see people suffering , especially when it is someone very close to me . If a somatic cell gene therapy were medically available , I know I would use it to help them . But who is really suffering ? A child that cant shoot the ball as well as a professional athlete ? No , none of these children are physically suffering from a genetic disease it has no control over , but suffering from a society that places a lot of pressure on kids to be an all American . <p> I think we will talk about gene therapy for years to come . But I strongly believe that my views will help shape the 21st century . As a responsible citizen , I need to listen , think , and be involved with the decision-making processes or gene therapy could lead to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I believe our government has done the right thing ever since the Asilomar conference by forming the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ( R.A.C. ) of the National Institute of Health ( N.I.H. ) . We are not changing the car to be more aerodynamic or one that can travel by air , as many people believe the 21st century will bring , but we are changing people . I know I would always try to make my opinion be heard and incorporate them into the huge pool of philosophies . I do not want the practice of medicine or the human race to be heading down a very dark tunnel . <p> The " blueprint is written not in the helix , however , but rather in our wills " ( Keenan 1990 ) . I also believe that whatever moral trespassing we entrust is not caused by the things that we discover , but what we decide as a responsible citizen . Researchers have promised a life free of diseases like cystic fibrosis , cancer , and AIDS . But crossing the line to diseases that are germ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ever should be .

As the country grew and became more industrialized , the number of people who produced their own foods decreased drastically . Therefore , the nation depended on the newly emerging food industry to produce and distribute its food .

These laws were difficult to enforce . The first major Federal law governing food was the 1906 Federal Food and Drug Act .

The HGP in the United States was started in 1990 and was expected to be a fifteen year effort to map the human genome . There have been a number of technological advances since 1990 that have accelerated the progress of the project to a completion date sometime during the year 2003 . The U.S. HGP is composed of the Department of Energy ( DOE ) and the National Institute of Health ( NIH ) which hopes to discover 50,000 to 100,000 human genes and make them available for further biological study ( 1 ) . There are a number of other countries that are involved in the project , including Australia , Brazil , Canada , France , Germany , Japan , and the United Kingdom ( 1 ) . Besides numerous countries involved in the project there is also a number of commercial companies that are involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar price tag will be used to sequence the possible 3 billion DNA base pairs of human DNA . <p> The possibilities from the information that will be obtained from the project are virtually endless .

The knowledge that will be obtained will help lead to new ways of diagnosing , treating , and possibly preventing diseases . Through the discovery of the human genome , the possibilities are endless for agriculture , health services , and new energy sources also . The end result of the HGP will be information about the structure , function and organization of DNA , as we know it today . <h> Technical Aspects of HGP <p> There are a number of goals that have been set forth by the HGP that they hope to have finished by their completion date in 2003 . One of the first goals of the project is to identify the 50,000 to 100,000 genes that are found in DNA ( 2,3,4 ) . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical bases that make up human DNA . DNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of the chemical building blocks " bases " that make up the DNA of the human chromosome . This information will then be stored into a large database so that information can be used by other individuals ' . The HGP hopes to then be able to develop tools for the analysis of this data . Finally , the HGP would like to address the ethical , legal , and social issues that will no doubt arise from the project . As of 10/8/99 , the working draft sequence 's goal of 90% by the summer of 2000 is at 13.6% of its goal ( 453,968,000 bases ) . The finished high quality sequence 's goal of 100% by 2003 is at 13.8% ( 466,883,000 bases ) of their goal(1) . <p> The DNA that is being used in the project is from four individuals ( 5 ) . This can be done because humans differ in their genetic makeup by 0.1% of their DNA . This 0.1% accounts for all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . <p> There are a number of different techniques that are used in the genome project to determine the sequence of DNA . One is the use of a new high resolution mass spectrophotometer equipped with vacuum ultraviolet photoionizer to sequence forrecene-tagged DNA(1) . This new technology could eliminate the need for both gel electrophoresis and radioactive tagging while sequencing DNA segments . This method is accomplished by a primer being labeled with organometallic compound such as ferrocene . The new DNA segments that terminate at each occurrence of a particular DNA base are built up on the primer using the original DNA template . Later , the primer is read in a high resolution time of flight mass spectrophotometer where masses and sequences are determined . <p> Another technique is automated DNA sequencing . This process is used to speed up the task of DNA sequencing . There are a number of dyes that attach specifically to the bases of the DNA ( 2 ) . The fragments of DNA are then sent through a glass tube that is filled with a transport gel . The fragments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dye will give off a certain color . These colors are then read by a computer , which will give the DNA sequence . <h> Benefits of the HGP <p> The benefits of the Human Genome Project will more than likely be felt throughout the world . The expenditures on genomics research in U.S. industry is projected to be 45 billion dollars by 2009 . This projected dollar amount is through the sales of DNA based products and technologies in the biotechnology industry . <p> One of the potential benefits is in the field of molecular medicine . The benefits in this field could include better diagnosis of disease , early detection of certain diseases , and gene therapy and control systems for drugs ( 1 ) . In the future there should be new treatments in molecular medicine that do n't treat the symptoms but look at the causes of the problem at hand . <p> Another field that may reap the benefits of the HGP is the field of microbial genomics . This field may be able to find new energy sources , through the sequencing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful in energy production , toxic waste reduction , and industrial processing ( 2 ) . <p> The HGP can also be very useful for the understanding of human evolution and human migration . It may help lead scientists to find out how humans have evolved and how humans are evolving today . It will also help to understand the common biology that we share with all life on earth . Comparing our genome with others may help to lead to associations of diseases with certain traits . <p> One last field that will undoubtedly receive monumental benefits from the HGP is the field of agriculture and livestock breeding . This technology could help to develop disease , insect , and drought resistant crops thus being able to produce more for the world . It would also help to produce healthier , more productive , and possibly disease resistant animals to be sent to market . <h> Ethics issues of the HGP <p> The general public and people in the HGP have shown a lot of concern over the ethical issues involved with the Human Genome Project . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Health have put 3 to 5% of their annual budget for the HGP to studying the ethical , legal , and social issues ( ELSI ) involved in the project ( 1,3 ) . The use of sequencing will make a profound impact on genetic screening of individuals . Medical professionals will be able to look at a person 's genome and be able to tell many things about a person just by looking at the person 's genes . This new technology will bring a number of issues such as the fairness in the use of genetic information . This issue is targeted mainly at who should have access to genetic records and how can they be used . Some of those targeted are insurers , employers , courts , schools , and the military . If this information is used by some of these agencies there could be discrimination based on genetic disorders . This discrimination could be from diseases that run in a family to mental disorders that a person can not help . <p> The privacy and confidentiality of genetic information could also lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no one to see what their genetic makeup is . There would also be concerns of psychological problems associated with knowing your own genetic makeup . If someone were to find out they have a good chance of developing a rare disease it would most likely drastically change their thinking on life . For reproduction , there could be compatibility problems of two individuals to have normal children . This would cause stress in a large number of people 's lives . <p> Another issue that has risen is the use of gene therapy to treat disease . The use of a person 's genome to tell if a person carries a genetic disease will help in the treatment of these diseases . In gene therapy a faulty or infected gene is replaced with a normal gene , so the individual does not display the trait that they were naturally born with . Many people feel that this is wrong because we are more or less taking over the course of nature , and they feel that this is not the natural way . <p> There are also clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the project is finished , many new techniques will need to be taught to our health service people .

If there are only a few agencies that are working on the project , who will get the rights to the technology . The major concerns will most likely be over the patents and copyrights of the technology . <p> There are also critics of the HGP that contend that the high cost of the project is not justified . Some critics also say that the ability to diagnose a genetic disorder before any treatment is available causes more harm than good , because it will create anxiety and frustration among individuals ( 2 ) .

When and where will the use of genetic material be able to be used in society after the HGP is finished . <h> My feelings on the subject <p> I believe that the Human Genome Project will have a profound input on our daily lives as we enter the 21st century . The amount that it could effect our lives is limitless . I think that there are many beneficial outcomes to the project , but I also feel that there are a number of things that could hurt our society as a whole . Overall I feel that the beneficial effects far outweigh the negative effects that can be bestowed upon us by the HGP . <p> I believe that the project in the future will greatly change the way in which health care is provided .

This certain person most likely is not able to change their genes so they should not be discriminated against . <p> On the issue of who gets the profits from the project , I believe that we , as tax paying citizens should get the information on some sort of public access medium . Since the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health are funded by the U.S. government , we are actually footing most of the bill as taxpayers . <p> I think that it should be an individual 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain gene manipulated so that they will not have a certain disease .

When the baby is developing , I also feel that the parents should have a choice to see if there are any birth defects or other abnormalities of the fetus that would lead the child to live a miserable life . <p> The technology should not necessarily be used for personal gain . If we were able to do this it would get to a point to where people would more or less be clones of one another . This is where there should be some form of regulation put in place . I 'm not so sure that it can totally be stopped . There will always be someone who will offer their services to help another person out for the right amount of money . <p> I think that the use of genetic engineering is very useful for prospective use in agriculture and animal production .

@@13708492 @2308492/ <h> The Ethical Considerations of Genetic Screening <h> Shaun Christenson <p> Copyright 1998 <h> Introduction <p> Ever since Watson and Crick deciphered the biological code of life , scientists have been busy unraveling the mysteries of life . A recent development in the area of genetic research has been the Human Genome Project ( HGP ) . The HGP is a massive international effort to map and sequence the entire human genetic code . The primary goal of this research is to link certain diseases with abnormal genes that may be possessed by certain people . This would allow researchers the ability to screen individuals for certain diseases . This has already been a success with a number of conditions . PKU is a condition that causes severe retardation in children if nothing is done to prevent it , but by genetically screening the infants , doctors are able to tell who has the disease ( Davis 1990 ) . By simply altering the diet of these children , the mental retardation effects of the disease can be prevented . In addition , diseases such as Huntingtons disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in humans ( Jaroff , 1996 ) . <h> How researchers are able to screen for genes <p> New developments have given researchers the ability to decipher the genetic code of organisms . Some of the techniques that researchers use are RFLP ( restriction fragment length polymorphism ) analysis and DNA probes . RFLP analysis utilizes enzymes from bacteria that are thought to be used as defense mechanisms against invading viral DNA . The enzymes fragment foreign DNA at specific locations depending on the base sequence ( Griffiths , 1996 ) . In order to analyze an organisms genome a researcher will add a certain restriction enzyme to DNA . This produces small restriction fragments of DNA that vary in length . Electrophoresis is then used to separate out the various fragments of DNA . This is accomplished by subjecting the fragmented DNA to an electrical charge after it has been placed onto an agarose gel plate . Due to differences in length , the DNA restriction fragments will be separated in the gel plate . <p> Another useful tool for scientists has been the DNA probe . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain sequences of the hosts DNA ( Devore , 1998 ) . The probe is able to do this because the DNA strand of the probe only binds to the appropriate DNA with a complementary sequence . Scientists label the probe with florescent markers or radioactive markers so that the gene of interest can be visualized . Often probes are used in conjunction with RFLP . After the organisms genome has been fragmented and electrophoresed , an absorbent membrane is placed over the gel and the DNA bands are " blotted " onto the membrane ( this technique is called Southern Blotting ) . The membrane is then exposed to a labeled probe . The probe will then hybridize to the DNA segments that contain the complementary sequences . Since the probe is labeled , the researcher is able to visualize the DNA fragments that were produced from the restriction enzymes . When the probe is bound to the restriction fragment a band is formed on the membrane . Scientists can then analyze the bands and determine the genetic composition of an individual . <p> The ability of scientists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations in which the ethics of genetic screening come into play . They are embryo and fetal screening , neonatal screening , carrier screening , and testing for economic reasons . <h> Embryo and fetal screening <p> A natural instinct in all parents is to have perfect children . All parents would like to have children that are free from diseases . This has led to screening of children before they are born . Fetal screening involves taking tissues from a fetus inside the mothers womb and screening the fetal tissues for genetic abnormalities . Some of the abnormalities that are tested for are PKU , downs syndrome , and turner syndrome . The first condition , PKU , is tested for because early detection and treatment prevent the onset of sever retardation in children positive for PKU . The other syndromes are screened for in order to allow the parent to accept the fact that their child may not be normal . <p> The advent of in vitro fertilization has had a tremendous impact on fetal screening . In vitro fertilization technology allows doctors to fertilize a human egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be pulled off and screened for certain genetic abnormalities . Parents now have the ability to have multiple eggs fertilized and have each one screened for abnormalities . The parents can then choose which zygotes they would like to have implanted into the uterus . This can be viewed as a form of eugenics . <h> Neonatal screening <p> Neonatal screening is similar to fetal screening in that the purpose is to identify genetic abnormalities in which an early treatment could prevent the symptoms of the disease . PKU is again a good example for what doctors are looking for . Neonatal screening is also done in order to confirm diagnosis in children such as downs syndrome and turner syndrome . <h> Carrier screening <p> Screening people to determine if they are a carrier for certain genetic defects . One of the genes that is important in this instance is the gene that codes for Cystic Fibrosis . People would want to know if they were a carrier for this gene in case they were planning to have a child . If a couple found out that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks for themselves . Do we want to take the risk of bringing a child with a devastating disease into this world ? <h> Testing for economic reasons <p> Testing for economic reasons is different from the previous subjects in that it would not benefit the individual in any way . This would be genetic information that would be used by insurance companies and employers in order to make a profit . Insurance companies would like to have the ability to screen customers in order to determine their dispositions for certain diseases . They then could charge the individual with a high risk an inflated premium or deny them entirely . Employers would use genetic information to determine which workers would suit their jobs . <h> Arguments against genetic screening <p> There are two good arguments that go against genetic screening . Some feel that genetic screening would lead to discrimination of those individuals , which possess " inferior " genes . Second , people fear that genetic screening will lead to reproductive decisions being based on the genetics of their child . <p> Discrimination is a very real prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents . As discussed previously , insurance companies and employers would like to be able to determine insurance rates and employment statuses based on the genetic composition of people . Individuals may be prevented from obtaining insurance due to a high risk factor for a certain disease . In addition , some diseases such as sickle-cell anemia are predominant among those who are of African American heritage and therefore could lead to racism ( Reich , 1995 ) . <p> Many people fear that genetic screening will change the way humans reproduce . Instead of allowing reproduction to occur naturally , people could use fetal and embryonic genetic screening in order to select for a better child . Many that people would be messing with Gods creation and nature , and that humans are not meant to do this . Secondly , abortion also becomes an issue , because if the parents of an unborn child find out that their child has a certain genetic defect , they may decide to end the pregnancy . In addition , some religions consider any interference with the natural act of reproduction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of reproduction that is not performed by the natural way as immoral ( Smith , 1989 ) . Thirdly , what would happen to individuals who were carriers for genetic abnormalities ? Would they be encouraged not to reproduce ? In this situation it seems as though the individual would be better off not knowing about their condition . <h> Arguments for genetic screening <p> The first argument is that by screening for genetic abnormalities , a doctor can prescribe an early treatment that would allow the person to live a longer more productive life . If an individual was found to be positive for a cancer-causing gene , then the individual could modify their behaviors in order to prevent the expression of the gene . There is an argument that an individual would probably not want to know if they were predisposed for a condition that was untreatable . This may be true , but on the other hand , if an individual knows their fate they would be able to make adjustments in their life in order to deal with their condition rather than learning about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cystic fibrosis , which is chronic and incurable , the number of patients screened for this disease has risen from 9,000 in 199 to 63,000 in 1992 ( Grace , 1997 ) . Therefore people must want to know their fates if the rate of screening for an incurable disease are going up . <p> The obvious argument here is the wonders it could do for medicine . The procedure that will probably follow genetic screening will probably be genetic engineering . Mayeux and Schupf state that , " Molecular genetics promises a greater and more precise understanding of how genetic factors influence disease . " ( 1995 ) . By linking genes to diseases scientists will be able to develop treatments for diseases . The genetic knowledge of the disease process will create a revolution in how medicine is performed . <h> Conclusions <p> The main theme that many of the people whom are against genetic screening is that " some things man was not meant to know . " However , in my view this is a very narrow minded approach to the situation . A look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible. 450 years ago it was thought of as sick , repugnant , and sinful to dissect a human cadaver ( Shinn , 1996 ) . Today this procedure is generally accepted . Think of what state our medicine would be in if someone had not taken up this practice . Our understanding of human physiology would be greatly lacking . Galileo was thrown in jail and forced to recant for his sins because he discovered that the earth was not the center of the universe . Today we accept this idea as a universal truth . <p> I believe that unreasonable fears have gripped those who are opposed to the use of genetic screening . Knowledge about genetics will be a great tool of the future and will lead to the elimination of numerous diseases . In the beginning , people were afraid that automobiles were a creation of the devil . Today , people accept travel by car as totally normal and most of the people in the United States feel that ownership of a car is a necessity . We do not look at the negative sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy driving our cars , or that thousands of people die each year in auto accidents . Instead we tend to think about the positive aspects of what car ownership does for us . New developments will probably always unsettle people because it presents people with a new way to look at themselves and the world around them , but after time people accept these changes . Genetic screening will probably present a similar scenario . Fear will be present in the beginning , but as time passes people will begin to accept genetic screening as a norm and will see it as a benefit to society , even if some of the effects of it are negative . <p> There are certain protections that will have to be provided for people though . A fear that many people have is that insurance companies and employers will be able to obtain your genetic information and deny health insurance or employment due to genetic dispositions of an individual . This definitely needs to be prevented . Already state governments are instituting laws against employers and insurance companies using genetic information for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

@@13708497 @2308497/ <p> Daffodils are one of the most loved garden bulbs to bloom year after year . Scientifically known as , Narcissus pseudonarcissus , daffodils contain over 13,000 types of hybrids within 25 different species . <p> Native to Northern Euroupe , daffodils can be grown in almost all zones , but the hardiness of the plant depends on the ancestry of each bulb . Daffodils should be planted in the fall before the frost , usually when the ground temperature reaches 60- 65 degrees Fahrenheit . The bulbs need a cold temperature vernalization period to promote root developement and to prepare for flowering in the spring . Daffodils prefer a well drained , slightly acidic soil , and sunny to partly sunny planting areas . Depending on the zone and species of the daffodil , they will blossom between March and the middle of May . Along with Tulips , daffodils are one of the first flowers seen in the spring . <p> Daffodils are grown from specialized vegatative structures , known as bulbs . Bulbs are underground organs consisting of a basal plate , growing points , flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as food storage and reproductive stuctures . Of the two types of bulbs , tunicate and nontunicate , daffodils fall into the categoriy of tunicate bulbs . These types of bulbs have outer bulb scales that are dry and membranous . <p> The daffodil flower consists of two regions , the perianth ( petals ) and the corona ( cup ) . The corona makes the daffodil unique from many other flowers and very attractive to the eye . The cup or trumpet like corona is the most interesting part of the flower . Daffodils have light , fleshy stems and leaves that grow from the bulb and are usually 12 inches in length . <p> Here is a picture of a daffodil , you can easily see the corona and the perianth . <p> Daffodils do not only come in yellow , but in whites , oranges , lime greens , and a combination of the above . <p> Propagation <p> Daffodils can be propagated both sexually and asexually . Following are some examples of how to propagate Daffodils by these means . <p> Sexual Propagation <p> Daffodils can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is relatively simple , seeds are obtained and then planted in protected areas , such as a greenhouse , and then when bulbs are formed they are planted in pots or outdoors . This type of propagation is rarely used by growers because it is such a timely process from the planting of the seed , to the flowering from a bulb . <p> Asexual Propagation <p> Daffodils can be propagated asexually by offsets , stem bulblets , and division of basal sections . <p> Offsets , are bulbs grown from bulblets , which are miniature bulbs produced on the scales and stems of the parent bulb . Offsets can be cut off the parent bulb and planted in a moist , slightly acidic soil , in the fall of the year . These bulbs should produce flowers within a few years . <p> Stem bulblets , are underground bulbils produced on the stem of the daffodil . These bulblets can be cut or peeled off and planted just like the offsets are . <p> The third type of asexual propagation of daffodils is the division of the basal sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , scooping , scoring , coring , and sectioning . <p> Scooping : The entire basal plate of the bulb is literally scooped out , and planted in the fall . The shoot and flower bud at the center of the bulb is removed , and the leaf bases are exposed , where small bulblets will develope . <p> The scooped bulb should be dipped in a fungicide to protect the cut surface . Scooped bulbs are then placed in a cool , dark location for about 2 weeks . Once new roots form on the developed bulblets , they can be planted . Scooping may produce as many as 30 bulblets per parent bulb . However , it may take up to 5 years to have a good size bulb and flower . <p> Scoring : The entire center of the bulb is removed , leaving just the outer core of the bulb to be planted in the fall . Scoring can be done by making three v-shaped cuts through the basal plate creating six pie-shaped sections . These cuts will destroy the main growing point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bulbs can be placed in a warm , dark place at high humidity for a few months . Scoring will produce 12-25 bulblets from the mother bulb . The bulblets can be planted in the fall and should sprout in spring . It usually takes scored bulblets 3 years to reach a good size bulb and flower . <p> Coring : The center portion of the basal plate of the bulb is removed . Cored bulbs can be treated as described for scoring . Cored bulbs usually produce larger flowers , and take less time to mature to a good sized flower and bulb than any of the other three methods . <p> Sectioning : The entire bulb is cut into sections , like pieces of a pie . It is benefitial to treat with a type of fungicide to prevent disease . Each of these sections can be planted in the fall . <p> The best time to perform scooping , scoring , coring , and sectioning is in the summer after all foliage has died back . Dig up the parent bulb and then perform one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of the bulb in a plastic bag filled with sunshine mix , store in a cool well ventalized place . After the warm summer period and the ground has cooled ( October- November ) plant outside , in a well drained place . <p> Now that you have learned about the history , botany and types of propagation of Daffodils you can enjoy their beauty for years to come . Hundreds of plants can come from just one bulb , a little time , and little care . 
@@13708498 @2308498/ <h> US Agencies Involved with Food Safety <p> The complex challenge of assuring safe food has led to numerous federal and state government agencies having a role in U.S. food safety matters . This page provides an overview of the role of various agencies . The discussion begins by addressing federal agencies . <p> The Government Agencies ( web page with links to U.S. federal and state government agencies involved with food safety concerns ) <p> Who Do These U.S. Agencies Regulate ? <p> 6,100 meat and poultry processors <p> 50,000 food establishments <p> more than 1 million food vending locations <p> more than 70,000 labeled food products <p> FDA describes itself as annually regulating $417 billion worth of domestic food and $49 billion in imported food ( this does not include the food regulated by the USDA ) . <p> The U.S. food industry includes more than 136,000 registered domestic food facilities ( including more than 44,000 U.S. food manufacturers and processors and approximately 113,000 U.S. food warehouses , including storage tanks and grain elevators ) . <p> The industry also includes more than 2 million farms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 114,000 supermarkets , grocery stores , and other food outlets . <p> There are approximately 189,000 registered foreign facilities that manufacture , process , pack , or hold food consumed by Americans . <p> Much of U.S. food law is based on federal law , even though many states also have addressed issues relating to food safety . The number of agencies involved in food safety research , regulation and education adds further complexity , but it also illustrates the breadth of issues involved in assuring a safe food supply . <p> Federal Government Involvement <p> All federal agencies are granted their authority from Congress ; federal agencies can do no more to regulate food safety than Congress authorizes them to do . Thus food safety issues often take on a political appearance as Congress works to define the role of government in addressing these concerns . <p> The basis for federal government involvement in many of food issues lies in the U.S. Constitution , more specifically the " interstate commerce " clause that states Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce , that is , business that occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress shall have power to ... regulate commerce ... among the ... states " <p> Business that occurs entirely within a state can not be regulated by the federal government ; those activities are for the states to regulate . However much of our modern economy involves products or services that cross at least one state line sometime during the manufacture and sale of the product . Thus the majority of items in our economy , including most of our food products , involves interstate commerce and is subject to federal authority . Federal statutory law ( e.g. , 21 U.S.C. 331(a) ) explicitly states that it is regulating only those food items that involve interstate commerce ; but the reality is that nearly all food involves interstate commerce . As a consequence , the federal government has authority to regulate nearly all food produced or consumed in the United States . <p> Federal law preempts state law ; again this is based in the U.S. Constitution . If there is a conflict between federal law and state law , the federal law prevails ; that is , federal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , and the laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme law of the land " <p> However , Congress addressing an issue does not prevent a state from also addressing the issue ; both Congress and state legislatures can address the same issues . If there is a difference between the two laws , the federal law will prevail or preempt the state law . In some situations , <p> Congress recognizes that a state may have a particular issue that requires special attention . In those situations , a common practice is that the federal government sets a minimum standard and then allows states to impose additional standards as necessary to protect the state 's special or unique need . <p> Congress sometimes encourages this type of a relationship by providing financial resources to states that take an active role in administering a federal program or direction , e.g. USDA meat inspection program . <p> There are situations , however , where Congress will not allow a state to impose additional requirements . <p> Key federal food safety agencies <p> Food safety concerns frequently focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily since the mid-1990s that discussions about food safety have broaden to encompass " farm to table . " Despite the added breadth , the emphasis for food safety is still on processing and final preparation of food items ( but do not overlook the recent ( e.g. 2006 ) surge in concerns about food safety at the commodity production level ) . Accordingly , this introduction to agencies involved with food safety begins with an overview of agencies responsible for regulating the processing sector of the industry . <p> FDA 's role includes " seeing that products are made right and labeled truthfully . " FDA inspects facilities , collects and analyzes samples of products , and checks product labels . FDA relies on scientific expertise in fulfilling its mission . <p> " Another major FDA mission is to protect the safety and wholesomeness of food . The agency 's scientists test samples to see if any substances , such as pesticide residues , are present in unacceptable amounts . If contaminants are identified , FDA takes corrective action . FDA also sets labeling standards to help consumers know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nation 's food supply is protected in yet another way as FDA sees that medicated feeds and other drugs given to animals raised for food are not threatening to the consumer 's health . " <p> FDA responds to violations by encouraging firms " to voluntarily correct the problem or to recall a faulty product from the market . A recall is generally the fastest and most effective way to protect the public from an unsafe product . When a company ca n't or wo n't correct a public health problem with one of its products voluntarily , FDA has legal sanctions it can bring to bear . The agency can go to court to force a company to stop selling a product and to have items already produced seized and destroyed . When warranted , criminal penalties--including prison sentences--are sought against manufacturers and distributors . " <p> FDA is the primary ( lead ) agency responsible for regulating food that moves in interstate commerce ( except meat , poultry and egg products , those are regulated by USDA ) ; any food that moves among states is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> FDA addresses the safety of ingredients used in formulated foods <p> For example , FDA has identified ingredients that are Generally Recognized as Safe ( GRAS ) <p> " CFSAN , in conjunction with the Agency 's field staff , is responsible for promoting and protecting the public 's health by ensuring that the nation 's food supply is safe , sanitary , wholesome , and honestly labeled ... " <p> A site that may be of interest : Food Protection Plan 2007 by the Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration . November 2007 . <p> This plan includes proposal for legislation during the Bush administration . Recognize that an agency 's recommendation for legislation is not always enacted by Congress . <p> " The Food Safety and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) is the public health agency in the U.S. Department of Agriculture responsible for ensuring that the nation 's commercial supply of meat , poultry , and egg products is safe , wholesome , and correctly labeled and packaged . " <p> Agency History -- provides an excellent overview , including an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for administering the laws and regulations associated with meat , poultry and eggs <p> FSIS inspects the operations of plants processing meat and poultry products as the plants are being operated ; these plants can not operate without a federal inspector or federally-approved inspector on site . <p> FSIS inspects the animal before slaughter and the product after slaughter <p> Background FSIS , under its current name since 1981 , has been protecting public health since 1906 , when the Federal Meat Inspection Act ( FMIA ) signaled the real beginning of domestic inspection of meat and meat food products in the United States . The Act began a system of continuous , daily organoleptic ( sight , smell , touch ) inspection in slaughterhouses to detect unsanitary conditions and adulterated products . Poultry inspection began in 1926 on a voluntary basis , and in 1957 , Congress passed the Poultry Products Inspection Act ( PPIA ) , which established mandatory , continuous , daily inspection of poultry products . <p> The 1967 Wholesome Meat Act and the 1968 Wholesome Poultry Products Act amended the FMIA and PPIA , extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry inspection programs . These Acts ensure uniformity in regulation of products shipped interstate , intrastate , and in foreign commerce . <p> The Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970 required USDA to ensure that egg products are safe , wholesome , and accurately labeled . In 1995 , responsibility for egg products inspection was transferred from USDA 's Agricultural Marketing Service to FSIS . <p> The next major change to meat and poultry inspection occurred when FSIS published the landmark Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point ( HACCP ) Systems rule on July 25 , 1996 . Implementation of HACCP was phased in and completed in January 2000 . Under HACCP , all slaughter and processing plants are required to adopt a system of process controls to prevent food safety hazards . <p> Also , the HACCP rule clarifies the respective roles of industry and government in ensuring food safety and , therefore , makes better use of government resources in addressing food safety risks . Industry is accountable for producing safe food . Government is responsible for setting appropriate food safety standards , maintaining vigorous inspection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enforcement program to deal with plants that do not meet regulatory standards . <p> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) of the Department of Health and Human Services <p> " The mission of Centers for Disease Control CDC 's Food Safety Office is to lead CDC 's food safety programs to prevent illness , disability and death due to domestic and imported foodborne diseases . We collaborate with and support other CDC organizations with focus on attainment of food safety program plans , goals and objectives . We work in partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , state and local health departments , and other public and private organizations to strengthen regulations and policies for prevention of foodborne diseases . " Taken from CDC 's Food Safety Office <p> Although not directly regulating food processing businesses , the CDC impacts the food industry through its role of preventing food-borne illnesses and its involvement when a food safety problem arises . For example , the FoodNet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , USDA and FDA consisting of " active surveillance for foodborne diseases and related epidemiologic studies designed to help public health officials better understand the epidemiology of foodborne diseases in the United States . " <p> Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) <p> The introduction to this section states that concerns about food safety continues to emphasize issues pertaining to food processing and final preparation . However , this brief overview of the EPA 's role in food safety is one example of concerns that ag producers need to address . It may also be an indication of how the concept of " farm to table " may evolve to include the production sector of the industry . <p> Food Safety " Although the Food and Drug Administration regulates most aspects of food production and consumption in the United States , the EPA is responsible for regulating the use of pesticides on food . If improperly used , pesticides can cause serious health problems , including birth defects , nerve damage , cancer , and unique health risks to children . The EPA , in cooperation with the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not compromise food safety . In particular , the Federal pesticide program is designed to ensure that pesticides can be used without posing harm to the most vulnerable members of society , children and infants . " <p> The introduction to the previous section states that food safety concerns still primarily address processing and final preparation . In this section , other agencies that impact food safety are introduced , including agencies with responsibilities to the production sector of the food industry . For those agencies , their food safety role is just beginning to evolve and will likely continue to be refined in the future ; their mission in the past has not directly focused on food safety concerns . If ( or " as " ) their food safety responsibilities are revised , their traditional missions are not likely to be eliminated . Thus an understanding of their traditional role may suggest how food safety concerns could be incorporated into their future missions . <p> Note that the grades and standards are not regulations , thereby allowing USDA and the industry to update the grades and standars by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of these standards have existed for many years and address quality characteristics but not the safety of the product . Although this may change in the future , it may be a slow process . One example of this possible refinement is the Fresh Produce Audit Verification Program . Note the reference to FDA , FSIS , " Good Agricultural Practices " and " Good Handling Practices " <p> " In 1991 , the USDA was charged with designing and implementing a program to collect data on pesticide residues in food . Responsibility for this program was given to the USDA AMS which began operating the Pesticide Data Program in May 1991 . The data produced by PDP are reported in an annual summary each year . " <p> " PDP concentrates its efforts in providing better pesticide residue data on foods most consumed by children . " <p> " PDP is a Federal-State partnership . Program operations are carried out with the support of 12 States : California , Colorado , Florida , Maryland , Michigan , Minnesota , Montana , New York , Ohio , Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 2001 , the USDA was charged with implementing a program to collect information regarding the incidence , number , and species of important foodborne pathogens and indicator organisms on domestic and imported fresh fruits and vegetables . USDA 's AMS was appointed to undertake the creation and implementation of such a program , currently known as the Microbiological Data Program ( MDP ) . MDP began collecting and analyzing samples in April 2001 . " <p> " MDP was primarily designed to provide data on microbial presence in order to establish a microbial baseline to assess the risks of contamination , if any , in the domestic food supply . " <p> AMS purchases surpluses and other foods used in food assistance programs . <p> " Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 ( 2002 Farm Bill ) requires country of origin labeling ; that is , any retailer engaged in the business of selling beef , lamb , pork , fish , fresh fruits and fresh vegetables , and peanuts at retail ( except restaurant , cafeteria , lunch room , food stand , saloon , tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an enterprise engaged in the business of selling food to the public ) shall inform consumers , at the final point of sale , of the country of origin of the commodity . This includes muscle cuts of beef , lamb , and pork ; ground beef , ground lamb , and ground pork ; farm-raised fish ; wild fish ; fresh fruits and vegetables ; and peanuts . " <p> This law has not been without controversy . Its implementation has been delayed but its scope has also been expanded . <p> The regulation begins on page 45 of the pdf ; the previous pages summarize public comments on the proposed regulation and the agency 's response . These pages also include agency explanation of the regulation . <p> Note that numerous sections of the regulation are " reserved ; " this suggestions the regulation will be refined as time passes . Bottom line -- this is not the end of AMS promulgating regulations to implement COOL . <p> " This program establishes national standards for the production and handling of organically produced products , including a National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic production and handling . " <p> " The National Organic Standards require all agricultural products sold , labeled or represented as organic in the United States be certified by a U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) accredited certifying agent . " <p> In a subsequent discussion on the expanding role of Good Agricultural Practices ( GAP ) , a similarity may become obvious ; that is , agricultural producers can decide whether to be certified as following GAP and the certification will be done by private certifying agents , rather than by government . <p> " GIPSA 's Federal Grain Inspection Service ( FGIS ) establishes the Official Standards for Grain , which are used each and every day by sellers and buyers to communicate the type and quality of grain bought and sold . FGIS also establishes standard testing methodologies to accurately and consistently measure grain quality . Finally , the program provides for the impartial application of these grades and standards through a network of Federal , State , and private inspection agencies known as the official system . " <p> The standards were initially intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address food safety concerns . However , there is a relationship ; for example , a moldy grain may form a toxic that would be present in the baked product and dangerous to for human consumption which would fit the definition of being adulterated . Even though the primary purpose of the law may not be food safety concerns , there is an interaction between grain standards and the safety of the final food product . <p> " APHIS-PPQ safeguards agriculture and natural resources from the risks associated with the entry , establishment , or spread of animal and plant pests and noxious weeds . Fulfillment of its safeguarding role ensures an abundant , high-quality , and varied food supply , strengthens the marketability of U.S. agriculture in domestic and international commerce , and contributes to the preservation of the global environment .

The U.S. federal government enacted its first food law in 1906 and has revised it numerous times since then . The involvement of the federal government began to supplant the regulatory role of state and local food laws but did not totally replace them . Thus , each level of government remains involved in regulating food safety , but much of the direction or leadership is currently coming from the federal government . <p> States remain involved in regulating food safety because they assumed this role before the federal government became involved , they are physically closer to the industry , and the federal government does not have the staff necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and federal agencies responsible for food safety can be described as collaborative and supportive . <p> Federal law preempts but federal law addresses only food in " interstate commerce .

@@13708499 @2308499/ <h> Cystic Fibrosis and Gene Therapy <h> Jennifer Senn <p> Copyright 1998 <h> Introduction <p> The average life span of a person with Cystic Fibrosis is 25-30 years of age . Although the more traditional treatments of this disease are adequate , is there something else that could be even better ? Gene therapy is fast becoming one of the more studied aspects of genetics today . Let 's take a look at some details of Cystic Fibrosis and gene therapy . <h> Technical Aspects <p> Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) is the most common fatal genetic disease in the United States today . CF is an autosomal recessive disease that occurs approximately one out of 3,300 live births ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , 1998 ) . Autosomal means that the gene for CF is not carried on the sex chromosomes and males and females are both afflicted by this disease . Recessive inheritance is when both parents " carry " the abnormal gene in their DNA but they themselves do not show evidence of the disease . The mother and father have one normal gene and one abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal gene dominates the abnormal gene . To have CF , a child must inherit two abnormal genes , one from each parent . Remember that chromosomes are made up of DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid . DNA is made up of genes , and genes are made up of building blocks called base pairs . The specific gene responsible for CF was identified in 1989 on human chromosome 7 ( Pseudomonas Genome Project , 1998 ) . A mutation , or change in the genetic material , resulting in a substitution or loss of one of the base pairs causes the CF gene to be abnormal ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , 1995 ) . <p> CF does not affect all people the same way . The basic problem for all patients however is an abnormality in glands , which produce mucus or sweat . The mucus produced by people with CF is thick and sticky instead of thin and watery . The major systems most affected by CF are the respiratory and the digestive . In the respiratory system , the mucus causes breathing difficulties , frequent respiratory infections and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria with a place to flourish . The most common infection comes from a bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The body 's response to P. aeruginosa includes inflammation , which causes episodes of intense breathing problems ( Pseudomonas Genome Project , 1998 ) . Normally the body will get rid of excess mucus by coughing before it 's a problem but with the thick mucus involved in CF the body has a harder time to get rid of the thicker mucus . Lung disease is the usual cause of death in most patients ( National Institutes of Health , 1995 ) . In the digestive system , mucus can block the supply of enzymes used to break down food . The result of the blockage of such enzymes is malnutrition . The patient will have an excessive appetite but will not experience any weight gain . What is also evident is a failure to grow , CF was often misdiagnosed vaguely as " failure to thrive " when physicians did n't know the reason for this poor growth . Sweating is also a problem in people with CF. One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sodium and chloride ( salt ) . People with CF lose excessive amounts of salt when they sweat . This causes the natural balance of salt in the body to be off balance , which may cause abnormal heart rhythms ( National Institutes of Health , 1995 ) . <p> For most people , diagnosis of CF is usually made within the first three years of life ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , 1995 ) . Although CF is present at birth , the symptoms do n't always show up right away or are often confused with other childhood illnesses . The most common way to diagnose CF is by the sweat test . Because CF causes abnormal levels of salt in sweat , the salt content is measured . If the test shows a high salt content , this is a positive test for CF. The sweat test can be used only to determine whether or not a person has CF. There is no relationship between the salt level in the sweat and the severity of the disease ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , 1995 ) . <p> The traditional treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organs involved . When the lungs are involved , chest physical therapy is used . This involves vigorous percussion on the back using cupped hands to dislodge the thick mucus from the lungs ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , 1995 ) . Varying the positions of the patient and where the therapy is given drains the mucus from various parts of the lung . Antibiotics are also sometimes given to help with the respiratory infections that might occur . Antibiotics may be given orally ( pills ) , through IV ( intravenously ) , or by the use of medicated inhalers . When the digestive system is involved and the patient is n't getting enough nutrients , they may have to eat a diet rich in nutrients . They may also have to take supplements to replace the enzymes needed to digest . All of these treatments are traditional ones that are widely accepted by the general public . Since the gene causing CF was discovered , treatment of this disease may come from a more ' untraditional ' method . <p> Here enters gene therapy . Gene therapy offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root cause of CF , rather than only treating the symptoms ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , 1998 ) . The basic concept behind gene therapy is to identify the defective gene and to correct the defect with a normal gene . There are two forms of gene therapy that may be used as a method of treatment . The first is called germ line gene therapy . This form not only helps the individual being treated , but also his or her children as well . Germ line therapy would change the genetic pool and future generations would have to live with that change ( Genentech Inc. , 1998 ) . The other form of therapy is called somatic gene therapy . Somatic means of , relating to or affecting the body . This therapy involves changing the defective gene in the individual but the change wo n't be inherited by the next generation . Somatic gene therapy would be the therapy of choice since it does n't have the ethical considerations that germ line therapy creates . <p> The defective gene in the case of CF carries the code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CFTR ) . This protein regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells and the alteration of this protein is what causes the thick , sticky mucus typical of CF ( Pseudomonas Genome Project , 1998 ) . In theory , this defective gene would be replaced by a gene that was normal and this protein would then be able to do what it 's suppose to do . However , gene therapy comes with some limitations as well as abilities . One of the first limitations is how to get the ' normal ' gene to replace the defective one . Replacing the defective gene in one cell would n't be good enough since there is more than one cell involved in the disease . Once the corrected gene was inserted into the cell , the next problem is getting it to go to the right place . Each cell in the human body contains 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes , or chromosomes that are not associated with sex chromosomes . Remember that the gene for CF is found only on chromosome 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contain the corrected gene , are used . The first vector used was an attenuated or weakened adenovirus . Adenoviruses are responsible for a number of respiratory illnesses but since they are weakened they are harmless to use for gene therapy . The use of this virus was the first evidence that it 's possible to get the healthy gene for CF into the lungs ( Fackelmann , 1994 ) . <p> Now that there is a way to get the gene into a patient , there is still the problem of getting it to go to the right spot on the chromosome . For the most part , the healthy gene will insert itself randomly in the cell DNA . The new gene might alter the phenotype , or the expression , of the gene because of changes in the position or chromosomal environment of the gene . This is called position effect ( McClean , 1997 ) . Depending on where the new gene inserts , since it is a random insertion , it can be harmful or helpful . Before gene therapy can be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deposit these healthy genes into the body . The first gene therapy experiments involve lung cells because they are readily accessible and lung damage is the most life-threatening problem . Researchers know that the gene can be safely transferred into CF airways of the lungs and will express itself . They now need to take information from experiments and refine the delivery methods to carry healthy genes to damaged cells in other organs affected by CF ( Cystic Fibrosis Foundation , 1998 ) . <h> Pros and cons <p> The obvious con of gene therapy involves the germ line therapy . This therapy not only changes the gene expression for the individual but it also affects following generations . No one knows what this will do to the gene pool that exists afterwards . Another con would be that researchers are n't sure how long the results of gene therapy will work . They also do n't know how often the therapy would have to be repeated to get results . As of now , the technology being used is n't adequate enough for gene therapy to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy at this stage is experimental and can not be used for any disease . Another point that should be made is about the ethics involved in changing a human beings make-up . Is this the right thing to do , even though it may help a person afflicted with CF ? <p> A pro of gene therapy is that it does n't cover up what 's wrong but fixes the ' problem ' . It has the capability of producing a normal life for the individual that receives the therapy . Another pro is that gene therapy is a fast growing field of its own and more and more is learned about it every day . The technology is there to develop it , so the technology is there to bring it to life . When gene therapy can be actively used , it will be regulated to prevent unnecessary treatment that may be harmful to the patient . Part of the Hippocratic Oath states , " that I will lead my life and practice my art in uprightness and honour ; that into whatsoever house I shall enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the utmost of my power ... that I will exercise my art solely for the cure of my patients " . <h> Personal Opinion <p> My opinion about gene therapy is somewhat on the pro side and a little on the con side . First of all , I do n't believe that gene therapy should be used in cases where the disease can be helped by traditional methods . I think that gene therapy should be a last resort , used by doctors when all else fails . A sort of last ditch approach to what may be a cure . I do n't believe that prospective parents who want to decide what ' kind ' of baby they want should use it . If such parents want a blonde-haired , blue-eyed baby , one of the parents should be that way and they should just play the odds . Gene therapy should n't be used to manipulate the genetic make-up of an individual for personal gain . Instead gene therapy should be used to help an individual afflicted with a disease that is fatal . CF is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use gene therapy for AIDS patients , I 'm all for it . If it can further a person 's life and enhance life for a person that would otherwise have no chance , gene therapy may be their only answer . <p> The whole issue of cloning is taking this technology too far . The human race will survive the best way it can , I believe in survival of the fittest . A species is balanced so that everything is in its place and there is harmony . When you start messing around with a gene pool that is doing okay on its own , why mess with it ? I believe that all things natural happen for a reason . Who are we to change that ? What makes us so superior as to change the natural force of things ? If gene therapy helps an individual to live , use it . Otherwise , just leave well enough alone .

Two factors , marbling and maturity or age of the carcass , determine beef quality grades . Marbling is the intramuscular flecks of fat dispersed in the lean tissue . The degree of marbling is measured when a carcass is ribbed or split between the 12th and 13th ribs . There are nine different degrees of marbling ( shown in Figure 1 ) : Abundant , moderately abundant , slightly abundant , moderate , modest , small , slight , traces , and practically devoid . Abundant has the highest degree of marbling , while practically devoid has the lowest degree of marbling . The second factor , maturity is determined by analyzing the degree of ossification of the bone and cartilage in the thoracic vertebrae region . There are five maturity levels of carcasses , A , B , C , D , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the oldest appearing carcasses being graded maturity level E.

Jackie is 32 years old and is in good health . She is 15 weeks pregnant and wants to do everything possible to ensure a healthy baby . Even though they do not have risk factors within their families , she and Michael decide to have an amniocentesis . <p> The results indicate that their baby is a female with Turner Syndrome . This condition is caused by a missing X chromosome and results in short stature , ovarian failure , and medical problems involving the heart , thyroid glands , and kidneys . Some of these conditions can be treated and managed with great success . The question that arises after diagnoses is whether or not they will choose to terminate the pregnancy with an abortion or carry the child to full term . <p> The availability of methods that determine the genetic predisposition of a fetus gives rise to a whole array of questions and issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with genetic testing . In this essay , I will present current and future methods for prenatal diagnosis , ethical concerns and related problems dealing with this new technology , my personal opinion on the issue , and finally , future goals in the science of genetics . <p> All of us are potential carriers of several deleterious recessive genes that could be lethal to our offspring if combined with another recessive allele carrying the same fate ( IOM 1994 ) . The chances of a genetic disease being passed on are 1 in 100 Americans born today ( March of Dimes 1997 ) . Because of the risks involved , many people are having prenatal tests to examine the genetic makeup of their fetuses . For many couples , this option enables them to ensure they will have healthy children that they might not have had because of a history of inherited diseases . This information relieves a lot of parental anxiety and unfulfilled expectations of an impaired child . <p> People who may be especially interested and advised for testing might include couples with a family history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pregnant women over the age of 34 , couples who already have a child with a genetic disorder , and couples concerned about specific disorders that occur more frequently within their ethnic group ( March of Dimes 1997 ) . <h> Techniques <p> Currently , there are four prenatal diagnosis techniques used . The first , and safest method , is an ultrasound . It is noninvasive and can assess and evaluate gestational age , fetal position , growth , development , and any structural birth defects . When performed by highly skilled operators , abnormalities can be detected with as high as 90% accuracy ( IOM 1994 ) . <p> The next technique routinely performed for prenatal diagnosis is amniocentesis . A long needle is inserted into the mothers uterus to withdraw a sample of amniotic fluid containing cells shed by the fetus . The cells are cultured and analyzed for chromosome abnormalities . Despite the lengthy time in obtaining results because the cells need to be cultured , this method has become widely accepted as a safe and accurate way to determine genetic disorders . <p> Chorionic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be performed very early on in gestation-between 9 and 12 weeks . A catheter is passed through the cervix into the uterus , and a sample of the chorionic villus surrounding the sac , which protects the fetus , is obtained . Large amounts of DNA are gathered and analyzed within 24 hours . Because of the quick results and use early on in pregnancy , abnormalities can be identified and used to make more acceptable decisions about selective termination of the pregnancy . Abortion is also much safer at this early stage ( Weatherall 1991 ) . <p> The last method involves fetal blood sampling and is called percutaneous umbilical cord sampling ( PUBS ) . A needle is inserted into the umbilical cord and fetal blood is obtained and evaluated for metabolism or hematologic abnormalities ( IOM 1994 ) . <p> In addition , a couple of new technological advances may become combined with prenatal diagnosis in the near future . First , the use of dot-blot technology could be used to detect point mutations more easily and more accurately . CVS and PUBS methods are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA is then simply spotted on a nylon filter , probed with oligonucleotides , and non-radioactively labelled with probes to identify genetic diseases ( Weatherall 1991 ) . <p> Another advancement on its way combines prenatal diagnosis with in vitro fertilization . This technique would involve acquiring a number of fertilized ova and analyzing them for a particular genetic disorder before implanting a healthy one into the uterus . This approach may be more acceptable to couples who oppose abortion ( Weatherall 1991 ) . <h> Pros and Cons <p> Although many of these options for prenatal diagnosis are being used and benefited from by amiable couples wishing to have healthy children , opponents of these genetic tests are not giving up without a fight . They bring up many concerns and issues that must be dealt with if we are to evolve in the science of genetics . <p> Many opponents believe in the preservation of all life , and until we come up with cures to all genetic diseases , terminating the lives of inflicted fetuses will remain prevalent in our society . Besides the fact that eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of medicine , prenatal diagnosis combined with the option of terminating the pregnancy raises two more issues : selective breeding , or eugenics , and value judgements . <p> The first , eugenics , might include using abortions as a means of eradicating a disease and eliminating an entire population that did not fit into societys criteria for an ideal community . Also , specific physical characteristics , such as eye color and IQ , will eventually be obtainable . Will we , as a society , emerge into a supremacy in which those with bad genes will be scorned . <p> A second problem that might need to be addressed involves value judgments . Prenatal tests are being used more and more . Parents are choosing to abort a child based on any indication of a birth defect , no matter what the severity . The Institute of Medicine recommends that prenatal diagnosis not be used for minor conditions or characteristics ( Botkin 1995 ) . But who decides what a minor condition is ? Different views depend on the couples race , culture , education , religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on what information about the abnormality is presented to them and how they interpret the data . <p> Undoubtedly , these problems address the need for ethical and legal standards . A parental crusade for the perfect baby is well on its way . While we must uphold the freedom of choice , we must decide what is best for society as a whole . <p> While there are opponents to the use of these tests , more people are in favor of them . Prenatal testing and selective abortion to avoid a seriously genetically impaired child is widely accepted in the United States . It was determined that 79% of Americans believe abortion should be available for a fetus with a severe abnormality ( Botkin 1995 ) . Some believe that the birth of a child with a severe genetic disorder may bring the mother and/or family distress , psychological harm , emotional harm and suffering , loss of a child , loss of opportunities , loss of freedom , isolation , and financial expenses ( Morejon 1996 ) . <p> An additional potential threat that could present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of the relationship between parents and the child . For instance , a child may be subjected to activities that do not necessarily benefit the child because of the parents lack of preparation for dealing with the child . Also , the childs personal freedom may be restricted or his/her condition may lead to fragile treatment . <p> Societal discrimination also makes raising a child much more difficult , not only for those actually having a genetic disease , but also for individuals who have a predisposition to one . The latter refers to late onset disorders in which the person may be symptomless until later on in his/her life . There has already been over 200 reported cases cases of genetic discrimination involving health insurance , employment , and adoption ( Arc 1997 ) . A key element that must be remembered , however , is that just because we may have the gene for a disease does n't  mean we will get the disease . Many other physical and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease . <p> According to Francis Collins , Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us carry probably 4 or 5 really fouled up genes and another couple of dozen that are not so great and place us at risk for something ( Arc 1997 ) . If this is true , everyone is genetically impaired and could be subject to discrimination . <h> My Beliefs <p> My personal opinion coincides with the majority of the population . Although my ideal scenario would be carrier screening of all at risk couples before conception , I believe in the use of prenatal tests to determine severe abnormalities in a fetus . I would never want to subject any child to a disease in which the consequences are severe and detrimental as well as something the child has no control over . I can not bear the thought of any child suffering needlessly because of an unforeseen deleterious inheritance from its mother and father . <p> To me , the benefits far outweigh the consequences of bringing a helpless baby who may surcome to a serious and fatal destiny into this world . Until we can intervene with effective treatments , I believe testing is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worldwide effort to map out the entire sequence of human genes , we will be able to develop these treatments . New diagnostic and prevention techniques will enable us to detect genes leading to disease . The knowledge will bring about an increased availability of genetic testing and gene therapy . Along with this profound discovery , the field of genetics will give rise to an even more debated issue . Government intervention of standards and policies will be called upon to regulate genetic testing . <p> To prepare citizens for informed personal decision making , public education and counseling will become vital to understand these new genetic concepts . We will also need to rely on our pre-existing knowledge and values if this emerging technological field is to be dealt with appropriately . My outlook for the future is optimistic . We will be able to cure diseases we never dreamed possible , and the lives of humans will be improved eminently . 
@@13708514 @2308514/ <p> Houseplant and fruit loving Americans are basically unaware that some of the most appreciated plants and delicious fruits consumed in our country are from bud sports or chimeras . The terms are often used interchangeably , and to the average consumer , the differences are a moot subject . Botanically speaking , the chimera is where two or more distinctly different tissues are overlaying one another , while a sport is a part of a plant that shows unusual or singular deviation from the normal or parent plant ; mutation ( Random House College Dictionary , April 2001 , 2nd revision ) . <p> Horticultural scientists go a little further in their definition : " A plant is said to be a chimera when cells of more than one genotype ( genetic makeup ) are found growing adjacent to tissues of that plant " ( **28;1253;TOOLONG , Lineberger , Professor of Horticulture , Texas A&amp;M ) . Perhaps the best known chimera is the variegated **31;1283;TOOLONG , D.G. " The Houseplant Expert " 2002 Edition ) . Likewise , the more scientific definition of a bud sport " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somatic cells , leading to the phenotypically altered shoots on plants " ( South African Journal of Botany Abstracts 2002 , 69 : 117-128 . S. De Schepper , et.a. , Ghent University , Belgium ) . <p> These definitions aside , this paper will deal some of the more important bud sports and chimeras that have had a significant impact on horticulture . <p> Fruits : <p> Apples , oranges and grapefruit are among the most interesting and sports or chimeras to occur that have had profound economic impacts on the fruit production industry . <p> Apples , for example have been consumed by humans for over 2800 years ( Growing Fruit in the Upper Midwest , Don Gordon , 1991 , UMN , pg . 22 ) and although being native to Eurasia , it was " Johnny Appleseed - aka - John Chapman ( Ibid ) that was responsible for establishing the popularity of the apple in America . From the seedlings that emerged , selections were made for superior hardiness , fruit production , and disease resistance , and grafted onto seedling rootstocks . Sometimes superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , were isolated and gave rise to important cultivars as is the famous case with the Red Delicious . The Golden Delicious arose as a chance seedling tree as did the popular modern cultivar Braeburn . All modern apple cultivars are highly heterozygous , providing ample opportunity for continuous variation in the development of new cultivars ( http : **32;1316;TOOLONG ) . <p> Citrus producers , both grapefruit and orange growers have benefitted from genetic variations . To put the importance of these two fruits into proper perspective , the United States is the undisputed leader in commercial grapefruit production , accounting for 63 percent of the world supply , with the vast majority of it grown in Florida , at an economic value of about $122 million . Anyone over the age of 50 can remember the annoying number of seeds found in a typical green fleshed grapefruit , almost making them a nuisance to eat in spite of their nutritional value . Today , several seedless ( or nearly so ) cultivars exist that have originated from bud sports or chimeras , with the Ruby series being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport that has provided millions in income to California growers during the winter months , and is relished by those of us in the " frozen north " during the long , snow-covered months that mark our winters . <p> The two fruits - the apple and the red-fleshed grapefruit have unique nutritional qualities about them . The whole apple is considered a low-glycemic index fruit which means that it is slow to elevate the glucose in the blood , making it an acceptable food source for diabetics . The red or ruby grapefruit is a rich source of lycopene and vitamin A , which are both important in maintaining good health ( along with the generous amount of vitamin C they contain ! ) along with being good anti-cancerigenic agents ( The Concise Encyclopedia of Foods &amp; Nutrition , Ensminger , et.al. , CRC Press , 1995 , pg . 628 ) . <p> From Chimeras and Bud Sports Come Clones : <p> Most of the horticulturally important plants arose from the periclinal chimera , which is a complete layer of mutated tissue within the plant , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

Clearly , traditional sexual propagation research will be carried on for the potential it holds for the industry , but much of what we enjoy and take for granted these days has come from natural mutations.

Ramsdale <p> Copyright 1997 <h> Introduction <p> The prospect of human gene therapy was first realized in 1971 when the first recombinant DNA experiments were planned . Gene therapy can be simply viewed as inserting bits of foreign DNA into a patients tissue in hopes of evoking a biologic response that will effectively eliminate the targeted disease . Major advances in recombinant DNA technology have occurred over the last 20 years so that now gene therapy is becoming a reality . Gene therapeutic techniques have recently been attempted to treat patients with the genetic diseases severe combined immune deficiency ( SCID ) , cystic fibrosis , and Duchennes muscular dystrophy ( Donegan , 1995 ) . The optimist foresees a time when a patient will simply receive a snippet of DNA and go home cured . There are many ethical and scientific hurdles that must first be crossed for such a dream to become reality . The technology has advanced so rapidly that many ethical questions werent originally addressed and accordingly are now becoming the center of attention regarding human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outwit the bodys immune system which is primed to fight any foreign material such as inserted genes . There are also difficulties in getting the targeted cells to open up their molecular locks to allow the foreign genes inside . Gene therapy , like other medical advances before it , will have numerous failures before reaching its full potential . It will be important for the public , press , and medical industry to be patient in waiting for the dream of gene therapy to become a reality . <h> Technological Aspects of Gene Therapy <p> The underlying principle of gene therapy is the transfer of genetic material to specific cells of a patient in an effort to initiate a biological response to fight or eliminate a disease . There are two possible types of target cells , somatic cells that are non-reproducing , or reproducing germ-line cells . If germ-line cells are permanently altered , all future generations would be effected . Most of the current human genetic research involves somatic cells since the ethical ramifications of germ-line cell modification is still being debated . Some scientists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to reproducing , germ-line cells ( Donegan , 1995 ) . Accordingly , regulations are strict in regards to somatic cell gene modification techniques so that this gene migration will not occur . <p> Transfer of genes to target cells is usually accomplished by some sort of vector such as retroviruses , adenoviruses , or liposomes ( Mulligan , 1993 ; Crystal , 1995 ) . Viral vectors are modified such that the reproductive genes are removed . The therapeutic genetic material is inserted into the genetic makeup of the vector which subsequently attacks the somatic cells . This effectively transfers the therapeutic genetic material into the targeted tissue . The delivery of genetic material can be conducted ex vivo ( outside the living body ) , in vivo ( inside the living body ) , or in situ ( in position ) . In the ex vivo method , the target cells are removed from the body so that the vector can be administered to the cells in the laboratory . After successful gene transfer , the cells are then re-administered to the patient . The in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to the target cells inside the patient . A modification of this technique is the in situ method ( Donegan , 1995 ) . The vector is inserted directly into the affected tissue rather than the blood so that only the immediate area is treated . The in situ method had been used to treat Duchenness muscular dystrophy patients . <p> Retrovirus vectors have been used in many of the first attempts at gene therapy such as the treatment of SCID patients . Retroviruses are best suited for ex vivo gene therapy . One of the most desirable characteristics of retroviruses is that they are able to stably transduce close to 100% of the targeted cells ( Mulligan , 1993 ) . Retroviruses also transfer the genetic material to the genome of the target cell so the genotype of that cell is permanently changed . Accordingly , a major risk associated with retroviruses is the potential for chronic over expression or insertional mutagenesis ( Crystal , 1995 ) . This could prevent a tumor suppressor gene from being expressed or lead to the expression of an oncogene . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because the target cell must have the appropriate viral receptor in order for the retrovirus to gain entry into the cell . Retroviruses are limited because the target cells must replicate so that proviral DNA can integrate into the cell genome . Since retroviruses are relatively labile , they also suffer from low production problems . <p> Although adenoviruses can be used ex vivo like retroviruses , their greatest potential is for in vivo gene transfer ( Mulligan , 1993 ; Crystal , 1995 ) . This is primarily due to the fact that adenoviruses can transfer genes to both replicating and non-replicating cells and because they can express large amounts of gene product . One factor that distinguishes adenoviruses from retroviruses is that the genetic material is transferred to epichromasomal regions so the cell genotype is not permanently altered effectively eliminating any associated risks . On the other hand , many of the current adenoviruses can lead to inflammation and antivector cellular immunity and consequently limit the duration of gene expression . <p> In vivo therapeutic gene delivery by the use of plasmid-liposome complexes has received less attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such an approach . These liposome complexes can deliver virtually an unlimited amount of genetic material compared to the limitations of 9 kb for retroviruses and 7.5 kb for adenoviruses ( Crystal , 1995 ) . Additionally , there is no danger of the formation of an infection as the result of replication . Since the plasmid-liposome complexes lack proteins , there should be little chance of inflammation or antivector cellular immunity responses . The primary disadvantage is that the complexes are rather inefficient requiring the administration of thousands of plasmids to the target cell to successfully transfer the genetic material . <p> A relatively new approach of transferring therapeutic genetic material to target cells is by using a bacterial vector ( Donegan , 1995 ) . Like the viral vector approach , the reproductive genes are removed from the bacteria in order to prevent a debilitating bacterial level from developing . Scientists believe that bacteria will reliably move to specific areas of the body such as the intestines and bowels . Once the bacteria reach the target cells , it will try to reproduce though unsuccessfully . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene . <h> Ethical , Legal , and Social Considerations of Gene Therapy <p> The rapid progression of recombinant DNA technology has stimulated great debate over the numerous ethical , social , legal , and regulatory implications of human genetics research and gene therapy . Questions regarding the need for the strict regulations implemented by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ( RAC ) and the Food and Drug Adminstration ( FDA ) have been raised by the biotechnology firms that conduct the genetics research . The decision by the Supreme Court to allow gene patenting is continually being denounced by various religious organizations . Should germ-line gene therapy even be considered is a question that is pondered by not only religious organizations but also the scientific community itself . There are also many questions involving genetic screening such as when and if it should be done as well as whether or not prospective employers and insurance companies should be allowed to require such tests . The fear of a new era of eugenics is also a legitimate concern given past events that illustrate the downside of human nature . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not germ-line therapy should be pursued . Since germ-line cells are the reproducing cells , each subsequent generation will be effected by such alterations . Proponents of germ-line therapy offer these arguments : 1 ) there is an obligation to use what ever technology is available to treat genetic diseases ; 2 ) parents should have the opportunity to ensure the health of their children ; 3 ) future generations should benefit from the elimination of genetic disorders ( Donegan , 1995 ) . Much of the opposition to germ-line therapy argue that such permanent alterations are too risky since mistakes can not be corrected . Obviously risks should be considered , but morally speaking , do we have the right to determine the fate of our future generations . The alternative to germ-line manipulation , offered by some opponents , is to utilize genetic screening as a tool to identify deadly genetic disorders and selectively eliminate affected embryos or fetuses . This brings up an entirely separate ethical dilemma as to the implications involved in genetic screening . <p> Dan Brock , a philosopher in the Bioethics Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation to have prenatal genetic screening and to abort any affected fetuses thus preventing " wrongful life " ( The Gene Letter , August 1997 ) . He described " wrongful life " as one in which the childs existence would be brief and of poor quality as a result of diseases like anencephaly , Trisomy 13 , and Tay-Sachs disease . Brock also stated that women have a moral obligation to prevent " wrongful disabilities " by selecting a different mate ( or donor sperm or egg ) . Perhaps the best argument against Brocks " wrongful life " and " wrongful disability " views is where does one draw the line in regards to what is a life not worth living . An alternative view has been adapted by the National Down Syndrome Congress on Prenatal Testing and Eugenics ( The Gene Letter , May 1997 ) . Their position is that it is a pregnant womans exclusive right to decide whether or not to have prenatal testing regardless of age , reproductive history , and disability status . The decision to continue a pregnancy is also solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis reveals . <p> Donegan , 1995 , outlines a hypothetical situation involving Huntingtons disease which is incurable at this time . The question he offers is when should a genetic screening test be conducted for individuals with a family history of Huntingtons disease . Should a parent be tested before deciding to have children ; should the children be tested after they are born ; or should the fetus be screened by amniocentesis . Difficult decisions would then have to made based on the results such as should the fetus be aborted or should the parents seek other alternatives for obtaining a child . Probably the most important aspect of genetic screening is proper counseling so individuals will be well educated as to their options . <p> Another point of debate is whether gene therapy is being pushed forward too quickly by commercial interests or is the current state of regulation too restrictive . The Biotechnology Industry Organizations ( BIO ) view is that the review and approval process conducted by the RAC and FDA is too slow and ultimately restricts major advances from occurring . Congressman Newt Gingrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America " ( Donegan , 1995 ) . He also pushed to eliminate the FDA from the review process entirely . Instead , he suggested that an organization of " biomedical entrepreneurs " would be best suited for approving new products and research protocols . Supporters of the current review process point to the fact that the RAC reviews are open to the public and press while the FDA sessions are closed . The RAC is a combination of a science and ethics advisory board representing individuals with a diverse background . This representation ensures that ethical issues will be weighed equally against safety issues and potential monetary gains . Recently , there has been a change in the review process such that now the FDA conducts the case-by-case approval while the RAC provides a more holistic regulation and maintains the focus of human gene therapy . <p> Genetic patenting is an issue which can have an indirect impact on the progress of human gene therapy . In 1980 , the Supreme Courts 5 to 4 decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty granted the right to patent life forms ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made 17 years ago , it is still a major point being debated today . A coalition of Protestant , Catholic , Jewish , Muslim , Buddhist and Hindu leaders are currently pursuing a joint appeal against the patenting of human and animal life forms . This coalition approves of somatic cell therapy and the patenting of genetically engineered drugs , but disapproves of genetic patenting . Leaders of this movement consider it morally and ethically wrong stating that genetic patenting degrades human life itself . Biotechnology firms argue that patents do n't  necessarily provide ownership but rather simply provides a means to raise money and protect their investment . Do patents protect investments or rather just limit competition resulting in a monopoly on human gene technology . An interesting argument points to the fact that it took Congress 30 years of debate to allow patenting on plant varieties while the Supreme Courts decision was made in the infancy of human genetic research ( Donegan , 1995 ) . <p> As scientists continue to reveal the meaning of the human genome , there is an ever increasing fear of using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to successfully alter human genes for therapeutic purposes , what is preventing them from manipulating other genes that may affect intelligence or physical appearance . A major source of funding for human genetics research is various commercial interests ( Gorman , 1995 ) . Biotechnology and medicine is literally a billion dollar industry so , for example , a quick genetic fix for obesity would be quite attractive . Some would argue that the current state of regulation governs against mis-directed genetic research . However , a cloned sheep suddenly appeared from the area of animal husbandry , shocking many medical geneticists who thought cloning could never be accomplished ( The Gene Letter , March 1997 ) . The Gene Letter , May 1997 , recently reported on a temporary halt imposed by the British Medical Research Council on IQ gene research . Even though this research is being delayed to address ethical issues , it does illustrate that other less noble research projects are being pondered . This brings up an important question . Should research for reasons other than therapeutic advancement be allowed and financially supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social , and legal issues regarding human gene therapy have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs . I would like to take this opportunity to express my opinions on the many questions that the reality of gene therapy creates , most of which I did n't  know even existed a short time ago . The following can be considered as Ramsdales rules of human gene therapy and related issues : <p> I approve of somatic cell therapy techniques as this should be the area where the research dollars are concentrated . <p> At this time I feel that germ-line therapy should not be pursued not only because of the potential risks but also because I feel we do n't  have the right to determine our future generations fate . <p> I feel it is important to keep the current regulatory agencies in place ( i.e. the RAC and FDA ) . Policies should not be dictated by the commercial interests even though they are a major source of funding . There is a unique opportunity for gene therapy to give equal consideration to ethical issues . This wasnt always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the focus of all research projects on developing gene therapy techniques . <p> As I understand it , there has been legislation implemented which prevents insurance companies and potential employers from discriminating based on genetic screening tests . I completely agree with this policy . <p> Genetic manipulation should only be used to treat diseased genes . At no time should this technology be used for other means such as physical appearance or mental capability . A eugenics movement should definitely be guarded against . <p> Genetic patenting is an issue than I am not completely sure about . I do not view genetic patents as signifying ownership of human life forms but rather as the right to the technology of working with that life form . The question I have is what is most beneficial to the overall advancement of gene therapy . Is it exclusive rights to protect investments or would it be more beneficial to allow competition by sharing this information ? <p> I do n't  think anyone has the right or obligation to abort a fetus which has been diagnosed as having a genetic disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether or not to be genetically screened before deciding to conceive a child . If it is determined that there is a possibility of a diseased child , then the couple could seek other alternatives such as adoption . However , if a couple decides to have a child realizing the potential risks , it should be followed through to the end . <p> Gene therapy should proceed with cautious optimism and should n't be considered as the only alternative . Additionally , genes should not be viewed as the sole source of diseases such as cancer in which the environment may also contribute to disease development . <p> At this time I would question any gene therapy that would affect an individual before that individual has a chance to take its first breath . This of course would include germ-line therapy and any fetal gene therapy . The question I would raise is can we truly decipher what a person has to offer by his or her existence here on earth . I feel that each individual has some unique quality to contribute to those who come to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time is limited . Philip Elmer-Dewitt ( 1994 ) concludes his article on " The Genetic Revolution " by stating " ... life , even after the genetic revolution , is still a poker game . Our genes are simply the cards we are dealt . What matters most is how we play the hand . " God has graced each and every one of us with numerous gifts , some of which we have n't even realized yet . We should ultimately concentrate on living life as he would want us to .

Let 's plan to discuss the following materials . <p> Anaheim Union Water Co. v. Fuller <p> Harris v. Brooks <p> Pyle v. Gilbert <p> Adams v. Greenwich Water Co . <p> Hudson River Fisherman 's Association v. Williams <p> Village of Tequesta v. Jupiter Inlet Corporation <p> Franco-American Charolaise , Ltd. v. Oklahoma Water Resources Board <p> Riparian doctrine is primarily adhered to in the eastern half of the United States ; a climate with considerably more water than the western states . The theory of riparian rights stems from European influence , but even this doctrine is being modified to accommodate current needs . <p> Riparian doctrine is generally common law , but some " eastern " states are beginning to codify their water law . Note however , that some statutes are codifications of the common law of riparian doctrine while other statutes are deviating from the common law . <p> Missouri : 256.400 to 256.430 -- establishes a registration process for major users -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information required in the technical assessment of current and future requirements for the regulation of water use or consumption , or both , on a regional or statewide basis , as may be required ...

" <p> 373.219(1) " The governing board or the department may require such permits for consumptive use of water and may impose such reasonable conditions as are necessary to assure that such use is consistent with the overall objectives of the district or department and is not harmful to the water resources of the area .

" <p> 373.223(1) " To obtain a permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter , the applicant must establish that the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as defined in s. 373.019 ; ( b ) Will not interfere with any presently existing legal use of water ; and ( c ) Is consistent with the public interest . " <p> " To conserve and use water resources of the state in the best interests of its people , and to promote the public health , safety , and welfare , it is the policy of the state that : ( 1 ) subject to existing rights , public waters are subject to the control of the state ; ( 2 ) the state , to the extent provided by law , shall control the appropriation and use of waters of the state ; and ( 3 ) the state shall control and supervise activity that changes or will change the course , current , or cross section of public waters ... <p> Riparian land is a parcel that is adjacent to a watercourse . Riparian rights permit the riparian landowner to use the water from the watercourse . But which land is riparian ? <h> Basis of Right <p> Defendants built a dam upstream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injunction against the defendants from diverting water from the river because the defendants ' land that would be irrigated was not riparian . <p> The land on which the water is used must be within the watershed , must be owned as one tract that extends from the water source to the point of use , and never have been severed from the land that borders the water source . <p> Land that is not within the watershed of the river is not riparian and is not entitled as riparian land to the use or benefit of water from the river , even though it may be part of a tract that extends to the river . <p> A principal reason for confining riparian rights to lands that border the stream is so after its use , the water returns to the stream . <p> Where two streams unite , it is correct to consider them as separate streams above their confluence and the land within the watershed of one stream is not riparian to the other stream . <p> Land that is conveyed and severed from the tract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riparian right even though it is in the watershed . <p> In California , riparian owners have correlative rights in the stream and neither are trespassers against the other until one diverts more than that user 's share , and injures and the damages the other ; water of a stream belongs by a common right to the riparian owners and each is entitled to sever their share for use on the riparian land . <p> A riparian right is not lost by disuse , but it can be lost to a trespasser whose use matures into a prescriptive right . <p> Riparian rights are part of riparian land ; sticks in the bundle of rights . ( p. 242 of Gould 's 7th ed . ) <p> Which land is riparian ? <p> Source of title test : smallest tract held under one title in the chain of title leading to the present owner ; each time a portion of land is separated from the riparian land , the separated portion is no longer riparian and can never regain its status as riparian even if it is subsequently owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( under this test ) is land bordering on a watercourse that has been in the same ownership in an uninterrupted chain of title . <p> Unity of title test : all land comprising a tract that is adjacent to a watercourse ; thus separated land can regain its riparian status if it is again owned as one tract by the riparian landowner . <p> Government subdivision : riparian land should be defined by government survey subdivisions such as 40-acres or 160-acres <p> Must riparian land be within the watershed of the watercourse ? Apparently , yes . <p> Riparian landowner does not need to own the riverbed to have riparian rights ; only need to own the land adjacent to the watercourse . <p> Am I entitled to use diffused surface water ( p. 241 taken from notes to a case we did NOT read ) . <p> Diffused surface water may be captured , used , dammed and redirected by the landowner even though the water would otherwise reach a watercourse and these activities diminish the flow of the watercourse . <p> But how do people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , but how do they acquire it ? <p> Purchase the right from a riparian owner ? <p> Steal it ( that is , acquire it as a prescriptive right ) ? Non-riparian entities can acquire water rights via prescription ( continuous use for an extended time without the permission of the riparian landowner ) ; conversely , riparian water rights can be lost by not stopping a trespasser water user . <p> But how much water can I use ? -- Reasonable Use <p> Harris v. Brooks , Arkansas , 1955 ( p. 246 of Gould 's 7th ed . ) <p> Appellees were pumping water from a lake to irrigate rice . <p> Appellant operated a boating and fishing business on the land and sought to enjoin the irrigation because it was reducing the water level of the lake . <p> Injunction was not granted and the case was appealed . <p> Owners of land that borders a lake have the right to use the water and this right is an incident of the land ownership . <p> Natural flow theory -- land owner is entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take water for domestic purposes only . <p> Reasonable use theory -- there is no reason to maintain water source at its normal level when the water can be used without causing unreasonable damage to other riparian owners ; the rights of riparian land owners is mutual , common , or correlative ; the riparian land owners are limited to using the water to what is reasonable having due regard to the rights of other riparian users . <p> Domestic use of water is superior ; all other uses are of equal value ; when one lawful use destroys another lawful use , the destructive use must be enjoined ; when one lawful uses only interferes with another lawful use , the court must decide if the second use is reasonable . <p> Determining reasonable use involves evaluating the conflicting interests ; equal protection to promote the greatest beneficial use of the water ; individuals must put up with reasonable amount of annoyance and inconvenience from other lawful activities . <p> Riparian use does not give rise to a prescriptive use ; in this case , the first users were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other riparian land owners . <p> In the eastern states , initial water uses were in-stream : navigation , power to operate saw mill , gristmills , cotton gins . Legal issues often address whether " my dam interferes with the water flow that you desire . " Since so little water was being diverted , riparian rights focused on water flow and the rule became that I can not alter the flow of the water . Thus the basis for the " natural flow " doctrine . <p> With time , more diversionary uses arose , especially for growing municipalities and new industrial uses . But the rule that " my use can not alter the water flow " meant users could divert very little water . This left unmet needs even though significant water was flowing past the land . A new legal theory was needed - reasonable use . <p> The reasonable use rule states that a riparian landowner 's reasonable use is protected from unreasonable uses by other riparian landowners . <p> Note that a use must be reasonable before the user could argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use theory allows more water to be put to use than the natural flow theory . <p> Domestic uses were given priority over all other uses . Domestic use preference - riparian landowner can use the entire flow if necessary for domestic purposes . But domestic use was defined as natural wants . What is encompassed in natural wants ? Does natural wants include minimum ( not natural ) in-stream flow ? Is irrigation a preferred use ? Are municipal uses preferred ? <p> Examine 1 ) the use being harmed , 2 ) the use causing the harm , 3 ) the impact of the harming use on the harmed use , and 4 ) the impact of the harming use on society , the economy and the environment . It is a matter of weighing the benefits and harms of each use against each other . <p> Users will be required to use reasonable means to capture and divert water . <p> Existing users must accept later uses that do not impose substantial economic losses or that impose only an inconvenience ; this is the inevitable result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish between a non-riparian use by a riparian owner and a non-riparian use by someone who is not a riparian landowner ? <p> One rule : non-riparian use can be enjoined even if it does not cause harm to a downstream riparian landowner . <p> A more likely rule : there must be damage in order for the non-riparian use to be enjoined . <p> Non-riparian use that causes injury or harm is per se unreasonable . <p> Downstream non-riparian use is per se unreasonable and is not entitled to be protected from an upstream riparian use that reduces the flow of water . <p> Non-riparian use by riparian landowner is not per se unreasonable . <p> How do I acquire water rights if I am not a riparian landowner ? <p> Nonriparian Use : Grant <p> Pyle v. Gilbert , Georgia , 1980 ( p. 279 of Gould 's 7th ed . ) <p> This case involves a well-established power mill urging natural flow theory against an upper stream new irrigator who urges the adoption of reasonable use . <p> Trial court ruled for the plaintiff ; irrigation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation is unreasonable is a question for the court . <p> Court rejects notion that water can be used only riparian land ; instead , riparian rights are property rights that can be transferred ; water law should be utilitarian and allow the best use of water . <p> Georgia recognizes the right to condemn water rights ; and that water acquired through condemnation can be used on non-riparian land . If water can be acquired through condemnation for use on non-riparian land , it also can be acquired for use on non-riparian land by grant ( purchase ) . <p> The only question remaining is whether the use of water to irrigate non-riparian land is reasonable , and that is a question to be resolved at trial . <p> Water right also can be acquired by lease , as long as riparian landowner 's domestic ( natural ) needs are not substantially impaired . <p> Can a non-riparian entity acquire water rights by prescription ? See Pabst case on page 272 ( 7th ed. ) which we are NOT discussing . The general answer is " yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for public and domestic use to the town . <p> Plaintiff are riparian owners seeking to enjoin the diversion and the attempt by the defendant to take the water by condemnation . <p> Defendant began to pump water from the river when it became apparent that the original water sources would not be enough to meet the contract due to drought conditions . <p> Defendant admits it has no right to pump water from the river and will proceed to use condemnation , but that under the circumstances ( drought and not enough water to the town ) it was justified in its actions . <p> Even though water was being diverted , plaintiffs were not injured . <p> Previously , the General Assembly had granted the defendant authority to take by eminent domain . <p> Water company should plan 10 to 20 years into the future . <p> Trial court did not grant injunction because harm to plaintiffs was far outweighed by the needs of the defendant and the town it was supplying with water . <p> Eminent domain question -- " taking " water is allowed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future ; courts will interfere with eminent domain in case of bad faith or unreasonable conduct . <p> Plaintiffs are entitled to be paid , but not necessarily entitled to an injunction . Court can deny an injunction if granting it would adversely affect public interest . <p> But the trial court did not impose a limit on when the defendant must acquire the water right by eminent domain ; therefore judgment reversed with trial court to determine a reasonable time in which the defendant must acquire the plaintiff 's water rights and if that time is not met , an injunction will be issued . <p> What is the value of riparian water rights , especially if I am not using my rights , or if my needs will be met even if the other use is developed ? <p> Can a user proceed with inverse condemnation if the municipality does not initiate eminent domain ? <p> The authority for municipalities to acquire water rights from riparian landowners is often based on specific statutes . <p> During hearings , the need for additional water was obvious , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved the project but established a triggering event for issuing the construction permits . <p> Concerns about the project include loss of trout habitat . <p> Petitioners argue that Spring Valley failed to demonstrate the public necessity for the construction of the water project -- the project should not be approved unless it will be developed in the immediate future . <p> Court rejects this argument for 3 reasons -- present need does not mean dire need ; there is a need for greater peak demand capacity ; the trigger mechanism assures permits will not be issued prematurely . <p> The trigger is based on average demand , rather than peak demand ; but it is the peak demand that is of greatest concern ; however , average demand is an acceptable benchmark due to its relatively constant ratio to peak demand . <p> Environmental law was complied with -- the requested mitigation would doom the project , mitigation was provided for , and the high priority of domestic and municipal uses was a consideration . <p> Regulation of public water supply projects - state enacted statutes to authorize municipalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to address the issues that arise under riparian rights ; that is , there are non-riparian needs . But municipalities are required by the statutes to address a range of issues as part of acquiring the water rights . <p> Priority among competing public water supply projects - Pennsylvania - municipalities ' unused water rights are cancelled , used rights must be registered ( documented ) , and permit must be applied for . <p> Other rules - can only acquire water this is not already appropriated ; imposed conditions on water usage ; difficulty of determining whether downstream user is entitled to have the flow of the water undiminished ; also , it is not clear that the upstream use is reasonable . <p> Federal regulation - federal law does not directly appropriate water , but laws such as Clean Water Act , Endangered Species Act , etc can influence whose project will be constructed . <h> State Regulation <p> Corporation proposed developing housing and pumping water for domestic purposes from a shallow aquifer that a nearby village was already pumping at its safe yield level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the water . This was modified by the correlative rights theory . <p> Florida enacted a statute requiring a permit for all new withdrawals and provided for recognizing common law rights by also issuing permits . <p> Corporation 's application was denied . <p> Corporation sues village in inverse condemnation for taking the corporation 's water . <p> Water right in Florida does not mean owning the water ; only owning the right to use it . <p> Water Act recognizes need for conservation and control , and makes all water subject to regulation . <p> Right to use water under common law is different than right to use water under a permit . <p> The act makes no provision to continue an unexercised common law right . <p> Since corporation 's common law right is now invalid , the village does not need to acquire the water right through condemnation . <p> Why permits in riparian states ? To replace a system where rights are vague ; unstable ; not adequate on which to invest or build ; is litigation driven ; determination of rights is slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment or public values ; does not effectively allocate water during drought ; and limits use to riparian land . <p> Characteristics of permits in riparian states : <p> time of initiating use is not the issue ; <p> can expire or be cancelled ; <p> administrators have considerable discretion to reallocate <p> Purpose of permit is to record ( register ) and quantify existing water right/usage . Also to control future/new use . <p> But system implies priority based on time of use by requiring that new use does not interfere with existing use . <p> Non-riparian entities can acquire a permit . <p> Administrative discretion -- do the permitting systems in riparian states grant the administrator too much discretion ? If " time of initiating use " does not allocate water , and all uses are equal ( except domestic use ) , what are the criteria for allocating water ? Will some uses become unreasonable during time of shortage but are reasonable during time of plenty ? If we are weighing competing water uses ( as is implied under the Restatement of Torts ) , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permits in riparian states are subject to too much administrative/judicial discretion , are too unpredictable , and may be based on type of use ( e.g. , domestic v. municipal v. irrigation ) . <p> How does the law address the issue when a later use seems to be more valuable than senior uses ? Prior appropriation requires that the senior ( but less valuable ) use gets the water . The question of who gets the water during time of shortage is difficult for both riparian and prior appropriation doctrines . <p> " Shortage plans " as a way to address this problem ; as a way to bring some predictability to these situations . <p> Inadequate control of over-development -- permit systems focus on use and assume only temporary shortages ; is there an adequate process to stop issuing permits when water is fully appropriated ? <p> Flexibility and reallocation -- use market ; but if permits expire , market will adjust the value of water rights . <p> Other criticism -- no coordinated approach to planning and permitting ; permits expire and no certainty of renewal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of private property by proper exercise of police power for the preservation of public health , morals , safety and general welfare without compensating the property owner . <p> But these rules abolish the right of riparian owner to assert a vested interest in the prospective reasonable use of the stream . <p> The legislation falls short of protecting the riparian owner 's common law right ; riparian rights are broader than those protected by the legislation . <p> Rights of riparian owners are to be determined by relative reasonableness ; not past use , present use , or non-use . <p> DISSENT : majority misperceives the future ; does not follow the lead of other jurisdictions ; unexercised riparian rights are not property ; legislature was placing everyone on equal footing with a unitary system ; the legislation did not leave the land economically unviable . <p> Abolition of riparian rights - primarily in the western states that started with riparian rights and then developed and adopted the doctrine of prior appropriation ; but those who already had riparian rights had to be protected ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in legislation ; issues include <p> how to protect existing rights that will not be allowed to arise in the future , such as riparian rights . <p> how to accommodate riparian owners who have not used any water but who would argue they intended to use it in the future . <p> The first issue is legal ; the second issue is more political . <p> States recognized only rights that were actually put to use ; the states will not recognize ( compensate for ) " possible " water use . <p> States did not distinguish between water that was once used but is no longer being used , and water that was never used . In both cases , the water is unused and thus the opportunity to use it again or for the first time in the future was not a property right . <p> Preserved the right ( and the priority ) to use water for domestic purposes . <p> California doctrine - effort to preserve the dual system <p> An unreasonable water use is not limited to only a wasteful water use ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or economically valuable . <p> Unexercised riparian rights would be subordinate to perfected appropriated rights ; but the subordination can only occur through a statutory stream-wide ( basin wide ) adjudication . <p> Alteration of doctrine by permitting systems in eastern states -- permits are mandatory for new uses . This is different than riparian doctrine where one can simply begin using the water that is adjacent to your land . <p> Purchase of unused riparian rights -- pay you for your water right even though you are not using the water ; that provides you an economic reward for allowing me to put the water to use . This clarifies that you have relinquished your right to me . <p> Resolving disputes by augmenting supply -- stopping someone from using water does not address the problem that there is not enough water ; so in California ( an area with water shortages ) the focus has been on augmenting the water supply , rather than fighting over the existing supply . <p> Reversal of trend - Hawaii experience ( p. 323 of Gould 's 7th Ed. ) -- state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change can not divest vested rights . Rights that were based on practice can be required by subsequent law to be documented through a " declaration of use " or permit .

For each data point , a Recurrence Interval ( RI ) is calculated using the Weibull equation <p> RI = ( n+1 ) /m <p> which is the average time interval between the occurrence of two discharge events of a given or greater size ( Lundgren , 1986 , p. 240 ) 2 . <p> The RI is the reciprocal of the probability of an occurrence . <p> As an example , in the flood record of the Red River of the North at Fargo , North Dakota , the 11th highest discharge was 11,200 cubic feet per second on April 3 , 1994 during the 112 year record ( 1882 - 1994 ) in the National Water Data Storage and Retrieval System ( WATSTORE ) database for North Dakota . The Recurrence Interval of this discharge level is 113/11 or about 10 years , and the probability of a flood discharge of this size occurring in any one year is 1/10 , or about ten percent . <p> The 100-year flood level is that gage height that corresponds to the discharge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met or exceeded of 1% . Similarly , the 500-year flood level is that gage height corresponding to the discharge extrapolated at RI = 500 , which has a probability of being met or exceeded of 0.2 % . <p> To determine the flood plain that will be inundated by a 100- or a 500-year flood , compare the topography of the area adjacent to the river to the predicted gage height . <p> How do you translate from discharge to gage height , or vice versa ? <p> The USGS has tables of discharge vs. gage height for each gaging station . For example , if you scroll to near the bottom of the gage for Fargo , you 'll see a table that shows discharge vs.gage height . Below is part of that table . 
@@13708520 @2308520/ <h> Genetic Screening <h> Laura Simenson <p> Copyright 1999 <p> On the last day of February 1953 , a young British scientist named Francis Crick entered the Eagle Pub , his rumored hangout , and announced that he and American , James Watson had discovered the secret of life ( Shreeves 49 ) . The secret they found was the structure of DNA , which would finally allow the properties of this tremendously important molecule to be understood . <p> Now more than 50 years later , the secret of life is not so secret anymore . Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) is the material that composes genes , which contain the hereditary material that is passed from generation to generation . The entire set of DNA in an individual is the genome , which in the human , amounts to about 80,000-100,000 genes . Each gene may work singly or in combination with other genes to code for a protein that has a specific function in the body . Proteins that digest food , give eye color , enable red blood cells to carry oxygen efficiently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a gene or genes . Genes exist in different forms ( alleles ) . The result of the specific combination of alleles is the genotype ( genetic make-up ) of the individual . <p> Sometimes mutations occur in the DNA sequence . These mutations can affect a person in negative ways that result in diseases , defects , or other general maladaptions . These defects can be hereditary and are then passed on to offspring . Scientists now have tools to predict or determine genotypes of individuals and see the polymorphisms ( differences ) in the DNA sequence that cause genetic variance in the population . Genetic Screening is the examination of the genetic constitution of an individual--whether a fetus , a child , or an adult--in search of clues leading to the likelihood that this person will develop of transmit a hereditary defect or disease . ( Suzuki 144 ) . <h> Technical Aspects of Genetic Screening <p> Before the development of advanced molecular analysis , the only way to determine that an individual was at risk for having or carrying a disease or trait was to consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a particular trait " ran " in his/her family . Today , progressive techniques in molecular genetics can be used to detect minute differences in DNA that cause a person to exhibit a trait . There are two basic test types used in detecting human genetic abnormalities . <p> The first strategy involves the examination of bodily substances . This biochemical analysis can indirectly show the presence or absence of variant genes ( Suzuki 146 ) . Testing fetal fluids using fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) or amniocentesis are two ways fluids can be analyzed to show the effects of genetic variance . Amniocentesis involves testing fetal fluids to recognize detrimental disease at an early stage in human development . Cell-rich amniotic fluid is extracted from the womb to obtain information about biochemistry and chromosome number . <p> Because of family history of a hereditary disease , some people are at an increased risk of giving birth to a child with a genetic disorder . Certain ethnic groups with family history of disease may opt to have these tests done on the fetus of their developing child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickle cell anemia , and if both parents are carriers they have a 25% chance of giving birth to an afflicted child in each pregnancy . Other diseases can be detected by amniocentesis . For example , Tay-Sachs disease is a medical condition that results from the absence of an enzyme needed to breakdown certain fats . An accumulation of fat in the brain causes neurological problems and eventually death of the infant . Cystic Fibrosis is a disorder which causes mucus build-up in the lungs and reduces life expectancy . Also , some infants can be born with PKU , an enzyme deficiency affecting 1 in 15,000 babies . This condition results from the inability of the body to metabolize the amino acid , phenylalanine . The accumulation of this amino acid in the body shifts a metabolic pathway to the production of pyruvic acid . High levels of this acid can cause brain damage . <p> FISH is a newer method that determines chromosome numbers in fetuses . This method uses fluorescent markers as probes to find to fetal chromosomes . The markers are stained and show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is an error in chromosome duplication ( Wingerson 62-63 ) . Some diseases which can be detected are Turner syndrome , Klinefelter syndrome , and Down syndrome . <p> Biochemical screening tests have also been used on people in the workforce . They are designed to identify individuals that may be more susceptible to certain hazards , such as pollutants , chemicals , and radiation . An example given in the book , Genethics , examines the red blood cells of people born with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency . These people are thought to be more susceptible to oxygen depletion when exposed to industrial chemicals such as napthalene . Employees with this deficiency could be assigned to work in a less hazardous area . <p> The previously discussed tests have all involved the use of body fluids as a method for detecting disease . The second strategy involves directly observing human chromosomes or chromosomal DNA . Karyotyping involves looking at chromosomes and detects chromosomal duplications similar to FISH , discussed earlier . <p> PCR-RFLP ( Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Length Polymorphism ) is another technique frequently used in the lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mixing it with a restriction enzyme that recognizes certain sequences and cuts them at a specific site . The result is a banding pattern of different size fragments that show up on gel-electrophoresis . The banding pattern shows polymorphisms ( small variances ) in the DNA . The polymorphisms are observed by the presence or absence of a particular sized band that is not characteristic of an unaffected individual . These specific bands can be used as markers for disease . <p> Multiplex gene testing is another method that can be used to detect genetic conditions . Commonly , the term multiplex gene testing refers to the testing of multiple mutations that give rise to a single disorder . But as the Human Genome Project gets closer to completion and new tests are developed there is an increasing possibility that one test could show many different genetic disorders ( The Council 15 ) . There are three broad categories of multiplex tests : <p> Tests that find genetic conditions that will lead to onset of an inevitable disease <p> Tests that detect the risk of developing a certain disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status <h> Pros and Cons of Genetic Screening <p> DNA tests can provide instant information on future ailments and life expectancy ; currently there are tests to detect probabilities of developing only certain diseases . These tests can have many ethical implications . How people deal with and use the information and who should have the information are issues that continue to be highly debated . The October 1999 issue of National Geographic provides a story of just how lives can be affected by these tests . <p> Fifty-eight-year-old Ina Savage , wife and mother , was struck with Alzheimers disease , a progressive and irreversible disease characterized by degeneration of brain cells . Now she cant remember the simplest tasks ; even getting dressed is a challenge . <p> Eight genes have been linked to Alzheimers disease , but there is no cure yet . Conclusive tests for the disease should be available upon the completion of the Human Genome Project . When asked if she would have a genetic test done , one of Inas daughters said , " It would be irresponsible not to ; I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different view : " What if an insurer learned the test was positive and decided not to pay for treatment ? " These statements bring up strong points on the pros and cons of genetic screening . <p> Screening for specific diseases can pose major advantages . With PKU , treatment can be administered to correct the disease before it becomes detrimental . Susceptibility testing is also beneficial for detecting the likelihood of developing certain cancers . If tested early enough , people can take precautions such as changing diet and exercise , and getting routine medical examinations to curb cancers of the breast and colon before the tumors become established in the body . <p> There is also a realistic possibility with the completion of the Human Genome Project , that people will soon be able to match up their genome and test it against a database of knowledge about diseases and implications of behavior , diet , and drugs ( NAG 68 ) . Affymetrixs Steve Fodor states in the October 1999 issue of National Geographic that " people can begin to look for themselves at how their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kind of perfume they choose to wear . We think genetic information will give people more control of their lives .. " <p> Will genetic information really give people more control over their lives ? Or will their lives be controlled by genetic information ? For as many reasons there are to get gene screened , there are many ( if not more ) reasons to not get tested . What are the negative implications of genetic screening ? Some examples can be noted with insurance companies , employment , child-bearing , and dealing with possibly knowing too much about the future . <p> The Code of Medical Ethics , written by the American Medical Association , has specific citings dealing with ethical issues in screening of genetic disorders . The code states that all carrier testing must be voluntary , and should not be disclosed to third parties without consent of the individual being tested . Insurance companies and employers should not be allowed to discriminate against carriers of genetic disorders . However , there have been documented cases of individuals who have been turned down or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the development of a certain disease . <p> Another negative side to genetic screening has to do with fetal testing . What happens when parents are given too much information regarding the status of their unborn child ? Should parents have to decide whether or not to give birth to a child with Down syndrome or that will have cystic fibrosis ? These decisions can cause emotional hardship for the family involved . <p> There are also justifiable concerns regarding adulthood diseases . Case in point , tests that can show if a person will develop Alzheimers in the future . This also can cause emotional distress on the individual as well as the family . <p> Can people know too much about their future ? I think the most important issue in the field of genetic screening is choosing which genes we should screen . For any disease that is reversible , such as PKU , or for diseases that can be treated or risk diminished by diagnosing in early onset , knowing genetic information is extremely beneficial . However , consider the implications of knowing everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , " Forget about Harvard , with your IQ genes , you 'll be lucky to make it out of high school . " This seems very depressing , but is a very realistic possibility . As difficult as it may be , a line needs to be drawn between what is knowing the right kinds of information and what is knowing too much . There is a great need to establish a strictly followed genetic screen code that takes into consideration the well-being of all humans . 
@@13708522 @2308522/ <p> A half century has passed since a vaccine developed by Jonas Salk made polio a disease of historians . While it still may be found in developing nations , few people in the United States remember what was once one of the country 's most feared diseases . " Infant paralysis " affected mostly children , who seemed perfectly healthy one day , paralyzed the next . Outbreaks could devastate an area , spreading the virus and fear . This research examines the history of one of those outbreaks , in North Carolina , rapid response of a community , and how the press was involved : the " Miracle of Hickory . " This research was completed as part of COMM 636 , History of the Mass Media , on line course . <p> About the Author <p> Marvin L. Elliott has lived in Hickory , North Carolina , since 1998 . Elliott holds a B.A. in Bible from Milligan College in Tennessee ; an M.A. in Christian Leadership from Kentucky Christian University ; and has done additional graduate studies in Communication from North Dakota State University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Communication at Catawba Valley Community College , Hickory , North Carolina . <p> Introduction <p> If the people of western North Carolina desired a miracle in 1944 , the shores of Lake Hickory would likely have been far from their minds . With World War II raging on in Europe as well as in the Pacific theater ( Eller , 1997 ) , the front page of every edition of the newspaper featured reports from the front lines , and little else . A prayer for a miracle would certainly have been for a quick defeat of the German forces . <p> But even as the war in Europe continued to claim the lives of young men from western North Carolina in significant numbers , a new battle--a different kind of war--lay ahead on the home front . Infantile paralysis , or polio , was not a new enemy , but had reared its ugly head time after time , summer after summer , all across the United States . A major outbreak had ravaged Chicago the previous summer ( Eller , 1997 ) . The people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Carolina , knew little about the disease except that it had crippled President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( " The great polio epidemic , " 1992 ) . But that was to change . As the calendar moved toward the first days of summer , it was evident that polio would be an unwelcome visitor in Hickory and throughout western North Carolina during the summer of 1944 . <p> As parents fled the mountains and northern foothills searching for medical care for their stricken children , they headed toward Charlotte Memorial Hospital and the polio ward of that large institution . The hospital was quickly overwhelmed , though , and closed its doors to new patients . Many of the parents traveling south out of the mountains made it no further than Hickory , but , in early June 1944 , there was no facility for polio treatment there--yet ( National Foundation , 1945 ) . <p> It was out of necessity , generosity , and compassion that " The Miracle of Hickory " was born . The " miracle , " the Hickory Emergency Infantile Paralysis Hospital , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hickory reacted with compassion and received not only local patients , but polio victims from the entire region . Although some funds were quickly received from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis , as the March of Dimes organization was known until 1979 ( March of Dimes , n.d. ) , it was an outpouring of support from the local community that made the " miracle " possible . For nine months , regardless of race , hometown , or ability to pay , the hospital received hundreds of young people whose lives were disrupted by a random stalker ( Bridges , 1975a ; LaBarr , 1945 ; " The Miracle of Hickory , 1965 ; National Foundation , 1945 ) . <p> What caused the people of Hickory to react with compassion and concern when confronted with the rapidly-spreading disease ? What caused the city to willingly take on the stigma of being known as " Polio City " ? ( Bridges , 1975a ) The actions of local leaders--and media coverage of those leaders-- " set the bar high , " and became the lofty challenge to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper is an exploration of the coverage of " The Miracle of Hickory " through the pages of the Hickory Daily Record and other primary source material . There have been other major projects relating the story of the " miracle " in the past--a Life magazine article ( " Infantile paralysis , " 1945 ) and an issue of Coronet magazine ( Hughes , 1945 ) , both in 1945 ; a half-hour video written , produced , directed , and narrated by a fellow instructor at Catawba Valley Community College in 1997 ( Eller , 1997 ) ; and a brief book published in 1998 , primarily detailing the story from the accounts of those gathered for a 50 th reunion of patients and staff of the hospital ( Sink , 1998 ) . In addition , various newspaper articles , usually occasioned by the passing of some significant anniversary of the polio epidemic , have recounted the story of the " miracle . " <p> This work seeks to add to the body of knowledge of this significant local event by exploring the motivation behind the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved area residents to respond . In particular , it examines the role of the media in shaping the community 's response . <p> This is a portion of the story behind " The Miracle of Hickory . " <p> Polio Arrives <p> In 1944 , Hickory was a quiet town of 15,000 people in the North Carolina foothills , 55 miles north of Charlotte and 80 miles east of Asheville . The city was--and still is--located on the banks of Lake Hickory , where the primary industries in the 1940s were hosiery , furniture , and textiles ( National Foundation , 1945 ) . The city prided itself as North Carolina 's " best balanced city " ( Hughes , 1945 ) , and the people of Hickory enjoyed a peaceful existence , although somewhat distracted by the harsh realities of World War II . <p> The announcement of polio 's arrival in Hickory was made in less than three column inches of space near the bottom of page one in the Hickory Daily Record on June 7 , 1944 . According to a report by Frances Allen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 17-month-old girl from Hickory , was hospitalized at Charlotte Memorial Hospital with a tentative diagnosis of polio ( " Possible polio case , " 1944 ) . The child received the revolutionary " Kenny " treatment , which treated polio victims with hot compresses , hot baths , and flexibility exercises for affected limbs , rather than the rival treatment that consisted of immobilization by use of splints and casts ( Zubar , 1997 ) . The little girl 's case had been diagnosed a few days prior by a local physician in Hickory ( " Possible polio case , " 1944 ) . <p> The following day , the Record reported that Wanda Sue Scronce , a four-year-old girl from Hildebran , just outside Hickory , was also hospitalized in Charlotte and receiving the Kenny treatment . The second child had been delivered to Charlotte Memorial by the public health nurse , who also reported that Linda Kiser was in satisfactory condition upon her visit to Charlotte ( " 2 in this area , " 1944 ) . <p> Cases three and four were announced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , respectively . The third case was an older child , 12-year-old Jack Williams from Granite Falls , another small community just outside Hickory ( " Third polio case , " 1944 ) . On the opposite side of Hickory , in Conover , Franklin Little , age 10 , became the fourth admission to the Charlotte hospital with a tentative diagnosis of polio ( " Conover boy , " 1944 ) . Less than a week had passed , and four children--from four different communities in the Hickory area--were hospitalized in Charlotte . <p> June 14 brought a report on the front page of the Hickory Daily Record --but still near the bottom of the front page , with a continuation inside--of another polio case in Hickory , and a total of 10 cases in the three-county area , including Catawba , Burke , and Caldwell counties . Dr. H. C. Whims , county public health physician in the Catawba county seat of Newton , issued a statement saying , " Community hysteria does not help at all , " and pleaded with residents to not become " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epidemic rules " may be looming in the future for Burke and Caldwell counties , since there were larger numbers of polio cases in those counties , but not for Catawba county . The county physician went on to discuss typical symptoms of infantile paralysis in children that , unfortunately , mirror the symptoms of a great many illnesses--vomiting , constipation , diarrhea , headaches , fever , and colds . The Charlotte hospital reported to the Hickory newspaper a total of 14 cases , including the 10 from the Hickory area ( " 10 polio cases , " 1944 , pp. 1 , 10 ) . <p> Two days later , on June 16 , 1944 , the situation portrayed by the Hickory Daily Record was dramatically different . In its first polio-related story " above the fold , " a bold headline proclaimed Dr. Whims ' change in approach : " Polio Epidemic Bars Public Places To Tots 12 , Under . " In a meeting the previous evening , Dr. Whims was quoted as saying that " an epidemic of infantile paralysis definitely exists in Catawba county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " prohibited from attending churches , Sunday school , theaters , playgrounds , swimming or wading pools , kindergartens , day nurseries , and similar places . " An epidemiologist from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in New York was reported to be enroute to the hospital in Charlotte , and Dr. Gaither Hahn , of the National Foundation , announced that a physiotherapist from New York was available to travel to Charlotte , as well . Dr. Whims pleaded again for calm , and pointed out that panic would be of no benefit in the current situation . He urged parents to not delay in calling a physician , as early intervention was thought to be essential in preventing many of the most serious effects of the disease ( " Polio epidemic bars public places , " 1944 , pp. 1 , 10 ) . <p> On page 6 of the same edition that proclaimed the situation to be an " epidemic , " the editors of the Hickory Daily Record published the first of many editorials related to the community 's response to the presence of polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a watchful eye on their children , and asked for public compliance with the ban on public gatherings of children ( " Communicable disease , " 1944 ) . The initial polio editorial provided good advice for area residents , but , within a matter of days , the editorial page of the Hickory Daily Record would be used in a significant way to further the " miracle . " <p> The following day , June 17 , 1944 , the Hickory Daily Record reported two additional cases of polio in the Hickory area and the scheduling of a special children 's sermon on local radio station WHKY by Dr. John R. Hay , pastor of the First Presbyterian Church ( " 2 more polio cases , " 1944 ) . It is clear that WHKY played a large part in the initial dissemination of information regarding the polio epidemic ( " The Miracle of Hickory , " 1992 ) ; however , the inherent difficulties in documenting radio broadcasts--especially those of more than 60 years ago--make consideration of the radio station 's role in the " Miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halma , current executive director of the Catawba County Historical Association and curator of the association 's museum in Newton , expressed his opinion that the radio station 's role in the community 's reaction and response was a substantial one ( S. Halma , personal communication , June 29 , 2005 ) . <p> June 19 , 1944 , brought a report of seven new cases of polio in various areas of Catawba county over the weekend , and the first indication of problems at Charlotte Memorial Hospital . The wards being used for polio victims were full , and an army hospital tent was being erected on the hospital grounds to house additional patients . Nurses were reported to be in short supply at the hospital , also , and the Catawba county public health nurse asked for registered nurses to contact her if they were willing to work on a temporary basis at Charlotte Memorial . Only one of the seven new victims was reported to be from Hickory , while the other six were from outlying areas surrounding Hickory . Dr. Whims issued a statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been swimming recently and drank unprocessed milk from dairy cows kept at home . In addition , several of the homes did not have screens on doors and windows , and the possibility of flies spreading the disease was being investigated . Even while issuing the statement , Dr. Whims was complimentary of the early efforts of the public to respond in every way needed ( " Seven new polio cases , " 1944 ) . An editorial in the same edition further discussed the great need for nurses , and called it an " essential public duty " ( " More nurses needed , " 1944 , p. 4 ) . <p> Of course , the Hickory Daily Record was not the only area newspaper reporting on the polio epidemic . Based in Newton , the Catawba News-Enterprise carried reports of the spread of the disease . Typical was a front-page article on June 20 , 1944 , under the headline , " Polio Epidemic Hits Over Catawba County , " relating a statement from Dr. H. C. Whims and a tally of the current cases ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 4 ) . The newspaper in neighboring Lincoln county carried reports , as well , usually focused on the effects of the epidemic on Lincoln residents ( " 43 polio cases , " 1944 ) . <p> The June 21 , 1944 , edition of the Hickory Daily Record contained a story detailing some of the effects the epidemic was having on various programs and gatherings . In particular , the Civil Air Patrol 's Cadet program had been suspended , along with other programs that prompted the assembly of children . A scrap paper drive sponsored by a Boy Scout troop was cancelled for the same reason . The front-page article also listed the latest admissions to the polio ward at Charlotte Memorial Hospital and reported on the arrival of visiting specialists from Yale University who had worked in the previous year 's Chicago epidemic ( " Polio suspends , " 1944 ) . <p> The " Miracle " Begins <p> On Thursday , June 22 , 1944 , what was later dubbed " The Miracle of Hickory " began . Three men , all leaders in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat those affected , met in a solemn gathering that morning . Word was received from Charlotte that the hospital--including the temporary tent wards--was filled to capacity and would be accepting no more patients from outside the immediate area . Gastonia Orthopedic Hospital was full , as well . Something had to be done with the growing number of patients , and the responsibility fell on these three to decide upon a plan of action ( " New polio cases , " 1944 ; Sink , 1998 ) . <p> Dr. H. C. Whims , county public health officer , Dr. Gaither Hahn , chairman of the Catawba county chapter of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis , and Dr. C. H. Crabtree , North Carolina representative for the National Foundation , realized that a local facility was needed . By default , although there were only a few cases of polio within the city of Hickory , the community was quickly becoming the center of the polio war . Discussion began of possible existing facilities , including schools and churches ( Sink , 1998 ) . <p> A facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways , though . Three years prior , a stone building was constructed by the WPA on 62 acres of wooded land near Lake Hickory , just three miles northwest of the city ( Sink , 1998 ; Zubar , 1997 ) . The facility at that time was in use as the Lake Hickory Health Camp , a " fresh air " camp for underprivileged children . Less than a half-hour after the meeting began , Dr. Whims ordered that the 57 children be sent home from the camp , and an emergency hospital for polio victims be established on the site ( " Polio treatment center , " 1944 , p. 6 ) . It was Thursday morning when the decision was made ; on Saturday afternoon , the first patients were admitted ( National Foundation , 1945 ) . <p> Published just a few hours after the meeting of the three physicians , the afternoon edition of the Hickory Daily Record contained the first report of the use of the camp as a temporary hospital . The headline read : " New Polio Cases Will Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Campers Sent Home . " The first paragraph reported : <p> Provisions are being made to use the Catawba County Health Camp as a center for the treatment of possible new infantile paralysis cases that may develop in Catawba and adjoining counties , following notification from Charlotte that the Charlotte Memorial hospital can not accommodate additional cases from this area . ( " New polio cases , " 1944 , p. 1 ) <p> The story in the Record went on to explain that the epidemiologists from Yale had been sent to Hickory , and had established an office at the county health department . The polio experts expressed the opinion--proven over time to be tragically inaccurate--that the epidemic was nearing an end , because only a few new cases had been reported in the past two days . All physicians in the county were summoned to a meeting set for Thursday evening to detail the developing plans ( " Epidemiologists here , " 1944 ; " New polio cases , " 1944 ) . <p> The three physicians spearheading the effort divided the duties among themselves . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities at the camp ; Dr. Hahn began arranging for needed supplies and equipment ; Dr. Crabtree was in charge of locating medical personnel and adequate funding ( Sink , 1998 ) . <p> The Thursday afternoon edition of the Hickory Daily Record also contained an editorial praising the quick response of the local leaders in the fight against polio , and reporting the start of work to transform the camp into an emergency hospital with a capacity of 40 patients . The strong action of Dr. Whims , in particular , was presented to the public as reason for confidence that the people of Catawba county were in good hands ( " Polio treatment center , " 1944 ) . <p> Early in the afternoon , Dr. Whims met with Mr. and Mrs. Q. E. Herman , two local architects in Hickory , and enlisted their help to design--in a matter of hours--a plan for constructing an addition onto the small , stone structure that existed at the camp , and to supervise the construction . By mid-afternoon , truckloads of lumber began arriving from three local lumber companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come later , if at all . Before the day was finished , a host of carpenters , electricians , and other tradesmen joined the construction project on a voluntary basis . Professionals from the community left their practices and joined the volunteer effort . Floodlights were set up so that work could continue through the night ( National Foundation , 1945 ; Sink , 1998 ) . <p> Dozens of other volunteer workers joined the effort on Friday , even though rain fell most of the day . A prison work team dug a trench for a new three-mile water main from Hickory to the new hospital . Hickory Fire Department members , working on their own time , installed hydrants , and the telephone company donated and installed a switchboard . Volunteer electricians , as well as employees from Duke Power Company , wired the hospital for electricity . Members of the National Guard cleared trees and brush to make room for the new hospital addition ( Sink , 1998 ) . <p> Friday 's edition of the Hickory Daily Record contained the first of dozens of pleas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were needed to assist the Red Cross in making isolation gowns , nurses ' gowns , nurses ' caps , and surgical masks . Hot plates were needed to boil water in the hospital wards . Electric wringer washing machines were needed for loan to the polio effort . At the same time , the Record reported many items already received , including blankets , beds , mattresses , and other supplies ( " Cooperative effort , " 1944 ; " Mrs. Matthews , " 1944 ) . A respirator , better known as an " iron lung , " arrived on Friday from Morganton ( " Iron lung , " 1944 ) . <p> The Friday , June 23 , 1944 , edition of the newspaper from Newton contained a report on the establishment of a hospital at the camp , but the focus of the News-Enterprise was more on facts , and less on an appeal for assistance ( " Turn fresh air camp , " 1944 ) . As previously mentioned , it is clear that , because of its immediacy , the local radio station played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital ( Sink , 1998 ) . Over time , though , the pages of the Hickory Daily Record would serve to encourage and sustain public interest in the humanitarian effort underway on the shores of Lake Hickory . <p> By Saturday afternoon , 54 hours after it was first conceived in the minds of three physicians who were confronted with a seemingly impossible situation , the Hickory Emergency Infantile Paralysis Hospital opened its doors to the first patients ( National Foundation , 1945 ) . It was , as historian Richard Zubar phrased it , " almost miraculous " ( Zubar , 1997 ) --it was " The Miracle of Hickory . " The Saturday afternoon newspaper reported that the hospital was ready , pending the arrival that afternoon of additional nursing staff ( " Center awaits , " 1944 ; " Officials confer , " 1944 ) . <p> The Monday , June 26 , 1944 , edition of the Hickory Daily Record reported the opening of the hospital on Saturday , indicating that 16 patients from five North Carolina counties were admitted over the weekend ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial nursing staff consisted of 10 local volunteer nurses and two nurses from the State Board of Health ; the arrival of 15 to 20 additional nurses in Hickory was expected soon . With so many admissions over the weekend , Dr. Hahn became convinced that additional space would be needed beyond the two wards already completed by workers . Two military hospital tents were sent from Moore General Hospital in Black Mountain , and workers on site in Hickory had walls and floors for the new tent-topped wards virtually completed by the time the tents arrived by army truck . Cooks were being recruited to serve in the not-yet-functional hospital kitchen , even as women of Hickory labored initially to prepare hundreds of meals in their homes . Volunteers staffed the reception area of the hospital around the clock ( " Richmond boy , " 1944 ) . The newspaper also reported additional cases of polio , as well as other restrictions and cancellations of children 's activities ( " Camp delayed , " 1944 ; " Ross sisters , " 1944 ) . <p> The same edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , submitting that " the response and cooperation on the part of citizens has been commendable . " Numerous specific examples of public assistance were cited , including a donation of $25 by the Sweetwater Sunday School , an outreach of the First Presbyterian Church of Hickory . The Record went on to point out the expense involved in the undertaking . The local chapter of the National Foundation sent $1000 to Charlotte to pay for the cost of treating Catawba county residents there , and expenses were " being hourly incurred " at the emergency hospital . The editors praised the " fine spirit of cooperation " that had prompted physicians , nurses , and laymen to respond in every way needed during the polio crisis ( " Excellent public response , " 1944 ) . This was the first report of dozens made by the Record over several months listing donations to the National Foundation for use in the operation of the emergency hospital in Hickory . <p> Also on Monday , June 26 , 1944 , a bylined article by Ann Seely Davey appeared inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vivid language what was happening out near Lake Hickory , maintaining that the " modern treatment center " was a " perfect place for the care of polio victims . " Davey wrote : <p> Sunshine streams through the two screened wards , which are completely isolated from the main building . Long rows of hospital cots , donated for the emergency by Moore General hospital at Black Mountain , line the knotted pine wards , one of which is used for diagnosis and one for cases definitely diagnosed as infantile paralysis . Nurses in crisp white uniforms and white shoes and stockings go quickly about their work , folding blankets which will be used in the Kenny treatment , making up beds with clean white sheets and flawlessly tucked " hospital corners , " filling jars with alcohol for thermometers , hanging fly-swatters within easy reach of anyone , in case a curious fly should find his way through the protective screens in the wards . <p> Electric hot-plates , donated by local citizens , are being put into condition for use .

( Davey , 1944 , p. 10 ) <p> Davey went on to maintain that the " best-trained specialists , physio-therapists , epidemiologists , doctors , nurses and health authorities that the nation has to offer " were at work at the emergency hospital on Lake Hickory , using " every weapon known to modern medicine " ( Davey , 1944 , p. 10 ) . <p> The Hickory Daily Record on Tuesday , June 27 , printed a front-page story detailing many of the medical experts who were on hand to assist in Hickory . The same article appealed to the community to loan baby beds for use by younger children at the emergency hospital . The Record also included the names of numerous volunteers serving at the hospital , as well as merchants who had made donations ( " 2 physio-therapists , " 1944 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first used at the hospital . Boyce Rash , a 27-year-old male from West Jefferson in the North Carolina mountains , was placed in the respirator . The Ashe County man was paralyzed from the chest down and was said to be in critical condition ( " First patient , " 1944 ) . The Record , in an editorial , also warned of the danger to adults during the polio epidemic . Although the disease most often affected children , Rash 's admission , as well as a handful of others , pointed out that adults were susceptible as well ( " Reasonable request , " 1944 ) . <p> The Wednesday , June 28 , edition of the Hickory Daily Record contained another article praising residents for their assistance to the Red Cross in the organization 's sewing project ( " Women lauded , " 1944 ) , as well as a report that the state chairman of the National Foundation was in Hickory to inspect the hospital ( " Dr. McDonald , " 1944 ) . An editorial the same day stressed the need for additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expansion of the hospital was planned to care for at least 100 patients at a time--a plan that was referred to as " an insurance policy , " in case the need developed . The Record also dealt with the early seeds of a disagreement that would develop over the next 15 years concerning the disposition of funds received by the local chapters of the National Foundation , and what portion of the funds would be used locally . The Record editors assured the public that funds received by the National Foundation would indeed benefit the residents of the county ( " More money needed , " 1944 ) . <p> One week after the Hickory Emergency Infantile Paralysis Hospital opened its doors , 45 patients had been admitted to its wards . Another 12 patients had been examined at the hospital , but had been sent home after seeing a physician . After only a week , staffing of the hospital was nearly complete , and another iron lung was received in the event it was needed . Work was progressing on an addition to the hospital 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp had been oiled . The polio epidemic , the Record reported , was confined to 18 counties in western North Carolina , and many organizations had banded together in a short period of time to attempt to confine the disease to the areas already affected ( " Polio hospital cases , " 1944 ) . The Record 's editors stated : <p> It is a real tribute to those who have been responsible for the miracle already wrought in the establishment of an efficient hospital within a few days ' time that Stone Crane , assistant disaster relief director of the American Red Cross , has praised the project as the most outstanding example of cooperative effort he has ever seen . Mr. Crane made the statement out of an experience of more than thirteen years of work with all kinds of emergency hospital centers . ( " Local management , " 1944 , p. 6 ) <p> Over the next few weeks , articles in the Hickory Daily Record focused on medical advice and further restrictions on children 's activities as authorities sought to contain the epidemic ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " 1944 ; " Protection against polio , " 1944 ; " Visiting specialist , " 1944 ) ; three deaths at the emergency hospital , which had a great impact on those working and volunteering at the facility ( " Second death , " 1944 ; " Valdese baby , " 1944 ) ; the appointment of Dr. Whims , the county health officer , as the official director of the hospital ( " Whims to head , " 1944 ) ; and the construction of additional wards at the hospital to handle a growing number of patients ( " Adequate funds , " 1944 ; " New ward , " 1944 ; " Polio building addition , " 1944 ; " Polio center , " 1944 ) . A controversy arose , also , over comments made by a Charlotte News columnist , who alleged that there was great hysteria in Hickory because of the epidemic . The Record quickly came to the defense of the people of Hickory ( " Apology made , " 1944 ) . Three weeks after the hospital opened , it housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The " Miracle " Continues <p> Daily articles in the Hickory Daily Record continued to report on the emergency hospital throughout its operation . Detailing the contents of those hundreds of stories , although a worthy endeavor , is far beyond the scope of this project . <p> National exposure came to the Hickory Emergency Infantile Paralysis Hospital in July 1944 . A reporter and a photographer from Life magazine arrived in Hickory to do a feature story on the emergency hospital , and the result was four pages of photographs , accompanied by a brief article , in the July 31 , 1944 , edition of the prominent magazine , all displayed in Life 's well-known style ( " Infantile paralysis , " 1944 ) . The following January , the hospital was again featured in a national publication as Independent Woman focused a rather lengthy feature story on the hospital ( LaBarr , 1945 ) . In February 1945 , Coronet magazine devoted five pages to the hospital ( Hughes , 1945 ) , based on interviews conducted in September 1944 ( " The great polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drama featuring the story , called " My Home Town , " that featured Academy Award-winning actress Greer Garson as narrator ( " The great polio epidemic , " 1992 ) . <p> The most extensive national coverage of the hospital in the 1940s , though , was a booklet published by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis called The Miracle of Hickory . The booklet served primarily as a fund-raising tool , but contained an excellent summary of the events related to the hospital that has largely served as the basis for later works on the " miracle " ( National Foundation , 1945 ) . <p> After nearly nine months of operation , the Hickory Emergency Infantile Paralysis Hospital closed on March 5 , 1945 . There were 87 patients in the hospital at the time of its closure , and the afternoon edition of the Hickory Daily Record recounted how they were moved to a new treatment center at the Charlotte Memorial Hospital in a mile-long caravan of 70 cars and 12 ambulances . Ranging in age from 10 months to 29 years , the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affection and care received in Hickory . The reporter closed the article by stating : " So ends the final chapter of the ' Miracle of Hickory . ' It 's history now " ( Dashiell , 1945 , pp. 1 , 10 ) . The editors bid the " kiddies " farewell in the same issue ( " Au revoir , " 1945 , p. 6 ) . <p> Beyond the " Miracle " <p> Over the course of the hospital 's existence , 663 patients were evaluated at the facility ; 528 were diagnosed with polio , of which 454 were admitted to the hospital . There were 364 males and 299 females evaluated ; most were white , although 55 African-Americans and one native American were evaluated ( " ' Miracle of Hickory ' hospital stats , " 2000 ) . According to one source , 12 patients died at the hospital , the lowest percentage of any polio facility at the time ( " The great polio epidemic , " 1992 ) . <p> In spite of the great effort expended by people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city itself . A total of 71 were from Catawba county . Most of the others were from counties spread across western North Carolina ( Sink , 1998 ) , although patients treated in Hickory came from a total of 74 counties from five states ( Braswell , 2000b ) . <p> The hospital was largely , but not totally , operated with funds from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis . The facilities , though , were constructed with local donations , as no funds from the National Foundation could be used for physical structures ( LaBarr , 1945 ) . An accurate accounting of funds expended by residents of Hickory to care for the patients was impossible even in 1944-45 , as many donations were made spontaneously , with no log books or receipts involved . <p> Following World War II , the facilities of the emergency hospital were used by returning soldiers and their families upon their initial arrival home ( Sink , 1998 ) . The temporary additions to the original stone building were torn down in April 1957 to make room for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1957 ; " Symbol of Hickory , " 1957 ) . Later , the old stone building would serve as the headquarters for the Hickory Parks and Recreation Department ( Sink , 1998 ) . <p> Polio would rear its head two more times in the Hickory area . Four years later , in 1948 , 95 cases were reported in Catawba County ; in 1953 , there were 105 cases in the county ( Sink , 1998 ) . The Salk polio vaccine arrived on the scene in 1955 , and with large vaccination campaigns , the threat of polio subsided ( Martin , 1955 ; Ross , 1955 ; " Salk vaccine , " 1955 ; " Thousands get vaccine , " 1955 ; " Vaccine given , " 1955 ; " Volunteers to help , " 1955 ) . <p> The aftermath of the " miracle " included a dark period in the late 1950s . A bitter dispute arose between the national organization of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the officers of the organization 's Catawba county chapter . The controversy erupted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the county to pay for the continuing treatment of area polio victims through the Catawba County Health Department . The national organization insisted that the funds be remitted to them , and , on May 13 , 1958 , terminated the affiliation of the Catawba chapter with the national organization ( " Refusal to give up , " 1958 ) . This action prompted a flurry of articles , letters , and editorials in the Hickory Daily Record , many of them in support of Dr. Gaither Hahn , who had labored locally for many years in the fight against polio , but had drawn the ire of the national organization ( " Appreciation expressed , " 1958 ; " Charleston , W.Va. , " 1958 ; " County polio group , " 1958 ; " Dan Ligon , " 1958 ; " Dr. Hahn gets cash , " 1958 ; " The Foundation , " 1958 ; Lewis , 1958 ; " N.

In 1960 , the National Foundation was awarded $44,000 of the funds collected by the then-defunct Catawba chapter . However , the National Foundation was ordered by the court to use the money solely for the benefit of Catawba county polio victims ( Sink , 1998 ) . <p> Interest Continues in the " Miracle " <p> Beginning with the 20th anniversary of " The Miracle of Hickory , " every decade 's anniversary of the hospital 's founding has brought significant media interest . In 1965 , a significant retrospective , complete with numerous photographs of the hospital 's construction , completion , and treatment of patients , was published in the pages of the Hickory Daily Record . The lengthy feature story , written without a byline , contained a moving summary of the hospital 's story ( " The miracle of Hickory , " 1965 ) . <p> Perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th anniversary of the " miracle " by Wake Bridges , a reporter for the Hickory Daily Record who had worked for the same paper during the days of the hospital 's construction and operation , and was instrumental in the newspaper 's coverage of the " miracle , " although few stories from the 1944-45 period were bylined ( Bridges , 1945 ) . Bridges ' 1975 reflective series in the Hickory Daily Record was informative , insightful , and compelling ( Bridges , 1975a , 1975b , 1975c , 1975d , 1975e , 1975f ) . A few years later , Bridges authored a book on the history of Hickory , called Hickory : It 's One Hell of a Town , that contained three chapters on the " miracle " ( Bridges , 1982 ) . <p> The approaching 50th anniversary of the Hickory Emergency Infantile Paralysis Hospital prompted several observances . A group of polio survivors sponsored a commemorative event , including the showing of a home video taken by one patient 's father at the hospital in 1944 ( " Area 's polio epidemic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Polio patient recalls , " 1992 ) . A reunion of surviving patients from the hospital was organized and held in 1994 , an event covered extensively by author Alice Sink , associate professor at High Point University , in her book , The Grit Behind the Miracle ( " Book eyes epidemic , " 1998 ; " ' Miracle of Hickory ' explored , " 1998 ; Sink , 1998 ) . Reporters for the Hickory Daily Record ( Price , 1994 ) , the Charlotte Observer ( Canrobert , 1994a , 1994b ) , and the Associated Press ( Patterson , 1994 ) , as well , covered the 50th anniversary . <p> Historian Richard Eller , now an instructor at Catawba Valley Community College in Hickory , wrote , produced , directed , and narrated a half-hour video on the " miracle " previously mentioned , and the release of that work prompted significant media coverage of the story of the emergency hospital ( Eller , 1997 ; Kramer , 1998 ; " Local history program , " 1997 ; Pennell , 1998 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical marker commemorating the " Miracle of Hickory " near the site of the former hospital ( Braswell , 2000a , 2000b ) . Later the same year , as a part of the Millennium Art Project in Hickory , a public vote was held to select one of three proposed monuments to be erected in downtown Hickory to observe " The Miracle of Hickory " ( " Cast a vote , " 2000 ; MacKay , 2000 ; Rooke , 2000 ) . A 25-foot obelisk designed by a western North Carolina artist , Maryrose Carroll , was dedicated in June 2001 ( Deal , 2001 ; Greene , 2001 ; Mitchell , 2001 ; " Tower of miracles , " 2001 ) . <p> The Media 's Role in the " Miracle " <p> Strength of character comes from a deeper source than the daily newspaper . It is clear that the strength and compassion exhibited by the people of Hickory during the 1944 polio epidemic came from a profound sense of humanitarian concern . The people of Hickory opened the doors of the city to polio victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distrust to color their reactions and inhibit their response . <p> Although compassion itself was not provided by the mass media , encouragement toward action based on that compassion was .

It was the action of the newspaper that , in large part , spurred the people of Hickory to action . <p> The power of the mass media is , indeed , great . Far too often , that power is used casually , with little thought toward consequences . However , occasionally , there arises a situation in which the power of the mass media is used in the best way possible--a situation in which the best in people is stimulated by the highest and best action of the media .

Everyone wants to be healthy and have a healthy family but some diseases are genetically related . How are these diseases avoided ? This question was pondered by molecular biologists and geneticists . What they developed will revolutionize medicine and health care as we know it . The technique used to try to cure these " incurable " genetic diseases is called human genetherapy . <p> Gene therapy is by no means a new field of scientific query . The idea was first proposed back in the 1950 's when Watson and Crick described a model of the double-stranded helix of DNA ( Griffith 316 ) . Knowing that DNA is composed of nucleotide base pairs in certain ways , scientists began to ask questions about the DNA structure in the 1970 's ( Becker ) . If the bases can be arranged " incorrectly " , then why ca n't they be rearranged in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments involving base pairing went on for years . After these years experiments with bacteria and viruses began . The genetic codes of these cells were changed to express different products like insulin . These products are human based but can be produced by non-human cells . This led to more thoughts and questions . If a bacteria cell can be altered to produce a human product , then why ca n't a human cell which ca n't produce this product be altered to produce it also ? New experiments began with animals and creatures with larger genomes . Answers formed from the animal experiments . Technical advances occurred to the point that gene therapy could be performed on humans . <p> Gene therapy has now become a relatively simple process . The basics of the process are the identification of the gene in question , duplication of that gene , and insertion of the gene into the human genome needing the gene ( CIS ) . The gene that needs to be altered or replaced must be identified . The correctly functioning gene that replaces the defective gene must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question can be isolated by attaching a molecular marker to the gene . The gene is then removed from the genome by a restriction enzyme that will break the genome only at the desired base junctions ( i.e. when ATA is next to GAT ) . Genes removed from the genome can be duplicated easily by PCR . PCR is a process where the genetic sequence of the gene is replicated by the introduction of base pairs in the sequence along with replication enzymes , which induce , cause , and proofread replication . <p> Next the gene must be inserted into the cell needing it . This can be done either in-vivo or ex-vivo . In in-vivo therapy a vector ( generally a retro-virus ) is modified with the desired gene and injected into the cells that need the product of the gene . A retro-virus that replicates itself by inducing it 's host cell to produce it 's genome . The cell host of the retro-virus , after the virus introduces it 's genome in the cell , produces the product the retro-virus genome is programmed to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the body . The cells are then injected with the gene mechanically or naturally by a vector . The engineered cells are the reintroduced into the organism they were removed from ( Suzuki 176 ) . New types of gene therapy are being developed now and some day will be applied . <p> The effectiveness of gene therapy applied in humans is not proven with hard evidence . There are some cases of advocated success but no real evidence . One such case , and the best chance of an effective therapy , is one where two little girls with ADA deficiency were given gene therapy . In 1990 some cells were removed , altered and replaced in the girls ( Marshall ) . The results of the therapy are good ones except for the fact that the girls were given injections of ADA while the experiments were in progress . ADA production by the engineered cells can not be measured because of the injections of ADA . The injections mask the production by the engineered cells . These results would be good if the girls were taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cells are enough to produce the necessary ADA ( Marshall ) . <p> Ethical questions about gene therapy have been raised . Should we allow gene therapy to be performed ? Can there be possible side effects to the therapies ? Is gene therapy a way of playing God ? All of these questions are good ones , ones raised every time a new form of medical technology comes along . <p> Should we allow gene therapy to be performed ? With more time and effort put into research gene therapy can become a great tool to doctors . Gene therapy may be unaffordable for some people now , but as the technology advances the of gene therapy will affordable and available to the common citizen . Money will be saved the world over due to less hospital time and more infrequent and shorter treatments . The life of the next president or Nobel prize winner could be saved . Everything that could possibly save a life should be done . <p> On the other hand people with genetic defects may not want the therapy or feel the therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and they should play it . Not all people may be able to handle the therapy ( either due to the vector or the " foreign " gene reacting with their system . ) Many people may feel that if a treatment does n't work for some people that no one should attempt to take the treatment because of the potential risks . Who would n't be willing to risk it to lead a " normal " life ? <p> The possible side effects actually could possibly be predicted . The only possible side effects are a reaction to the vector or to the introduced gene . The vector can be reduced to a protein shell and be inactive as far as it 's natural function is concerned . The reaction to the introduced " foreign " DNA in the cell could possibly destroy all attempts to engineer a cell in a person . The bodies defenses could attack the cell because it is genetically different than the other cells similar to the rejection of a transplanted organ . The few side effects or risks are largely outweighed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of geneticists playing God does bring up a serious question ; will gene therapy be performed on germinal , reproductive cells or just somatic cells ( Becker ) ? If so would these cells be modified to correct defective genes or to produce a " super race " as Hitler wanted to ? Questions like these are brought up frequently in ethical and moral discussions . If gene therapy is used only for correcting defective genes then there should be no problem with it ethically or morally . With the possibility of using gene therapy to produce more advanced humans , creating our own piece of evolution , it could be considered that we are playing God ( Suzuki 183 ) . The selection and replacement of undesired genes would narrow the gene pool slowly , but narrow the gene pool just the same . The loss of some genes would seem fine at first , but lead to a lower number of heterozygous or hybrid humans which could possibly be better off than either of the homozygotes . The lack of " random " mating would produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool leading possibly to a loss of vigor or viability ( Suzuki 184 ) . If some genes are therapeutically removed from the gene pool and a new form of disease comes along that is counter-acted by the lost gene what will happen ? Will the human race be wiped out ? It 's doubtful ( but possible ) , the gene would probably show up as a mutation in the population anyway , but who wants to take the chance ? Somatic cell gene therapy can not change the gene pool because it does n't affect the reproductive cells . Only reproductive cells can pass on their genes to future generations . Somatic cell therapy should n't be questioned as a therapy but germinal gene therapy should be looked after and highly regulated . Germinal gene therapy is highly questioned and all the answers seem to be negative . The answers so far are that the proposed advancements are faked due to the large amount of money to be made by developing a method of genetic therapy that consistently work . <p> Gene therapy is leading in new directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire for the ever powerful dollar ) . The cells being engineered now are cancer and bacteria cells . Cancer cells are being engineered to be susceptible to certain forms of antibiotics and pharmaceuticals . The engineering allows the antibiotics or pharmaceuticals to destroy the cancer cells . This form of gene therapy and others like it are in their infantile and experimental stages ( CIS ) . It has been proven to work in laboratory tests but will truly be tested when tried on humans . The possibilities seem endless . <p> With all the controversy of ethical questions and accusations of non-scientific testing and falsified evidence , the process of gene therapy trudges onward . The technology will be used some day in ways not yet thought of . It is the wave of the future and most people would like to catch this wave for profit or for the desire to create a new technology and help people .

@@13708526 @2308526/ <h> The Genetic Testing Controversy <h> Tim Friesen <p> Copyright 1997 <p> Genetic screening uses a variety of laboratory procedures to find out if a person has a genetic condition or disorder or is likely to develop a disease based on his or her genetic makeup . Individuals may wish to be tested if the family shows a history of one specific disease such as Huntington 's Disease or breast cancer , if they show symptoms of a genetic disorder which could be improved by early diagnosis , or if they are planning a family and are concerned about the possibility of passing on a genetic trait to their offspring . This last type of screening can look at the parent 's genotype or look at the genotype of the fetus or newborn . This type of screening can also look for a specific disorder or can be done as a general test for common disorders as in prenatal testing or more commonly newborn screening . <p> Genetic tests use techniques to examine genes or markers near the genes . Direct testing for diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's specific genes . A technique called linkage analysis , or indirect testing , is used when the gene can not be directly identified but can be located within a specific region of a chromosome . This testing requires additional DNA from an affected family member for comparison . Because each person 's DNA is unique ( except for identical twins ) , genetic tests also can be used for individual identification ( " DNA fingerprinting " ) . This technique is often used in forensic work , where samples from a crime scene such as blood or semen could be used as incriminating or acquitting evidence . <p> Genetic testing is a complex process , and the results depend both on reliable laboratory procedures and an accurate translation of results . Tests also vary in sensitivity , that is , their ability to detect mutations or to detect all patients who have or will develop the disease . Interpretation of test results are often complex even for trained physicians and other health care specialists . <h> Types of Genetic Testing <p> Carrier Identification includes genetic tests used by couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are considering having children . Three common tests include those for cystic fibrosis , Tay-Sachs disease , and sickle-cell trait but more tests are coming on the market at a very high rate . Norman Frost of the University of Wisconsin Madison Medical School says , " Potential new genetic tests roll off the conveyor belt of the human genome project almost once a week " ( 2 ) . <p> Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis ( PGD ) combines recent advances in genetics with the well established techniques of in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) . In IVF , a woman 's monthly reproductive cycle is manipulated . She is given hormones that stimulate her ovaries so that many eggs mature at one time . The eggs are surgically collected and fertilized with her partner 's sperm in a lab dish . The resulting embryos are then transferred to the women 's uterus and , if all goes well , pregnancy begins ( 3 ) . <p> In 1989 , a couple by the names of Renee and David Abshile , who were both carriers of the disabling condition Tay-Sachs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tay-Sachs is a recessive disorder , two carrier parents each have a 50% chance of donating an abnormal allele . This gives the newborn a 25% chance of procuring both recessive abnormal alleles , a very high risk when regarding humans . <p> According to a Scientific American report ( 2 ) , the Abshiles promised they would never again have another child unless they could be sure it would not be predisposed to the disorder . The only way to be sure was to have a prenatal genetic test that would show whether or not the child would acquire the disorder based on its genetic makeup . This type of test has its obstacles in that if the fetus does have the abnormal genetic makeup , the only way to stop it is to abort the fetus . Abortion was not an option for the Abshiles because of strong religious beliefs . <p> The Abshiles were out of luck until they heard of a new procedure of genetic testing called preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) in which fertilization is done in vitro ( IVF ) and the cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genetic mutation/malfunction . <p> In the Abshile 's case , they were able to implant three pre-embryos that were not even carriers for the disease . From those three embryos came the first baby to be certified free of the Tay-Sachs disease . <p> Prenatal Diagnosis is genetic testing of a fetus . This may occur when there is a risk of bearing a child with genes associated with mental retardation or physical deterioration . Down Syndrome is one of the most common genetic diseases screened by this method . <p> Prenatal testing is probably the most controversial type of diagnosis because of the abortion issue . When do we draw the line on abnormalities ? Is it ethical for parents to abort a child because the child will have Tay-Sachs disease or an even more ethically consuming question , is abortion okay if the child is not going to be the right sex ? <p> According to the book Feminism and Bioethics : Beyond Reproduction , Korea is currently predicting a 10% increase in the male to female ratio within the next thirty years . Sex selection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of enthusiasm they show the mothers . If the doctor lacks enthusiasm upon the test results , the mother often calls for an abortion , knowing that the fetus is a female ( 1 ) <p> Newborn Screening is frequently done as a preventative health measure . Tests usually have clear benefit to the newborn because treatment is available . Phenylketonuria and congenital hypo-thyroidism are conditions for which newborn testing is conducted in all 50 states . <p> Late-onset Disorders include adult diseases such as Huntington 's Disease , cancer and heart disease . Diseases like cancer and heart disease are complex and have both genetic and environmental causes . Genetic tests may indicate a susceptibility or predisposition for these diseases . Diseases like Huntington 's disease , are caused by single genes that also are seen later in life . These types of disorders can be tested for at any time . <p> Recently through studying blood samples of families in which there is a history of breast cancer , scientists have isolated and identified a gene linked to breast cancer . In families with hereditary breast cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , mutations in the BRCA1 gene confer an 85% lifetime risk of the disease , as well as a 45% chance of ovarian cancer . Some women in such families who have learned that they carry a mutated BRCA1 have elected to undergo Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy ( removal of the ovaries ) , a procedure that may reduce but does not eliminate the risk of cancer ( 4 ) . <p> By being able to identify these genes through particular " markers " associated with the gene , doctors will know which individuals are more susceptible to cancer and therefore can follow the proper procedures to more effectively observe the individuals for signs of the disease . The earlier the doctor can diagnose the cancer the more effective the treatment will be . <p> Mass population testing is a large scale testing usually of a particular ethnic group that shows a high rate of a specific genetic disorder . This type of testing has been both successful and unsuccessful . <p> A voluntary genetic screening program was set up in the early 1970 's for Tay-Sachs disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million Jews throughout the world , which Tay-Sachs predominantly affects , have volunteered to be tested to see if they were carriers of this genetic disorder . A carrier is not affected because to develop the disease symptoms , a person must carry two recessive alleles , one from each parent . <p> Before the people were tested they were educated as to what the tests would mean and what they could do with the information from the tests . Once they were tested , genetic counseling was available to answer any questions about the implications of the tests . This mass genetic test was a huge success , especially to Jews because it gives the individual the knowledge they needed to plan their family future . <p> About the same time as the Tay-Sachs testing was taking place , another ethnic minority group was being tested . This testing was for a different disorder with a very different response . <p> African Americans were being tested for the blood disorder sickle cell anemia . This mass testing was not as big a success as the Tay-Sacks testing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hereditary disease that affects the hemoglobin molecule . The result is a sickle shaped red blood cell which , in the absence of oxygen , clumps . The two alleles for sickle cell are codominant and a heterozygous individual ( Ss ) produces both normal and sickle shaped blood cells . People homozygous for the sickle cell allele rarely make it to reproduce . <p> The screening was done by an easy-to-administer blood test that could be given by anyone , including clergymen and local community volunteers . The test checks for carriers who will have some sickle cell RBC and some normal . Where the test was faulty was the lack of education that went along with the tests . Massachusetts required African American children at risk for sickle cell to be tested before entering school and soon the people carrying a single allele were thought to be diseased even though there were no outward manifestations of the disorder . <p> To add fuel to the fire , scientists suggested that the solution was for blacks carrying the allele to forego breeding . This sent a message that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who funded the program ) to eliminate the African American community ( 2 ) . <p> Even though this mass testing started out with the best of intentions for the African American community , it ended in disaster because of poor planning . Because of the implications that could and do arise from mass genetic testing , it is a volatile issue and needs to be approached most delicately and tactfully . <p> Individual Identification can be used in areas ranging as widely as forensic testing to paternity testing . In these cases a " DNA fingerprint " is used to compare two different individuals or samples to see how closely they match . The O.J. Simpson trial is a well known example of individual identification where a blood sample was found and matched to the accused . <p> It is also possible to do individual identification testing in a prenatal fashion as will be described in the following scenario provided by the U.C. Berkeley program in Genetic Counseling and Georgetown University Medical Center . The scenario is based on an actual situation . Mr. and Mrs. C. come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers of one cystic fibrosis allele . Cystic fibrosis is a lung disorder which causes a mucous buildup and prevents proper breathing . Mrs. C , who is pregnant , undergoes the prenatal test . The results that come back show the fetus having two abnormal cystic fibrosis alleles , but with a small twist of gargantuan proportions . Much to the dismay of the doctor , one of the mutations that the baby carries is different from that of the mother or the father , making it virtually certain that Mr. C is not the father . This scenario shows both an example of prenatal testing , but more importantly , individual identification . <h> Conclusion on genetic testing <p> Genetic testing is not a single technology . Rather , it refers to a broad range of methods for gauging the presence , absence or activity of genes in cells . At the relatively low tech end , researchers can count the chromosomes in a patient 's cells or measure the amount of tell tale proteins in his or her blood . At the most sophisticated level , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a specific genetic sequence among the three billion base pairs that make up human DNA . ( 2 ) <p> Genetic testing can cost less than $50 for a simple blood screening for sickle cell or cost in the $10,000 range for a complicated preimplantation genetic test for Tay Sachs disease . These are two extremes of genetic tests with varying costs . <p> Real and conceivable controversies <p> Genetic screening has great potential for our society . It has the capability of improving and lengthening human life . If used in an ethical manner , genetic testing can eliminate unforseen suffering and distress . But , issues such as privacy , consent , discrimination , equity , and social engineering are potential barriers that many individuals have confronted already . Both legal and personal family conflicts may arise because of testing of individuals or immediate relatives . <p> Privacy <p> What about privacy ? Does it really exist ? Should it exist ? How can we ensure that it does ? These questions and more are being studied by researchers in order to make genetic screening as promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Alliance of Genetic Support Groups , in Chevy Chase , MD says that , " information learned about you or your family through your participation in genetic research can become known to persons other than the research team . " ( 5 ) This is incriminating evidence for the lack of genetic privacy . <p> Should others have access to your genetic records ? According to a nationwide Time/CNN poll , 90% of respondents thought it should be illegal for insurance companies to use genetic tests to decide whom to insure . But regardless of public opinion , a 1992 congressional study revealed that underwriters at 11 of 25 Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans said they would turn down an applicant if pre-symptomatic testing discovered likelihood of a disease. ( 6 ) <p> Genetic Privacy can also bring up other issues like who has the right to know ? Because your genes are not exclusively our own ( you share your genes with your parents and siblings ) , do you have a moral obligation to tell potentially affected individuals . Is it important whether the effect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that 98% of those polled thought a spouse or betrothed should know about a defective gene(4) . <p> If for instance you find through genetic testing that you are carrying two BRCA1 dysfunctional alleles for breast cancer , this means your mother also carries the gene and is at risk . If you carry two alleles your female siblings also are at a potential risk . What if you do n't tell anyone ? Does your doctor have the ethical obligation to tell your family members that could be affected ? Should this be a legal obligation ? <p> In a poll of doctors , 54% said that even over a patient 's objections , they would tell relatives at risk about the results of a test from Huntington 's Disease . 24% said they would tell a patient 's employer and 12% said they would tell an insurance company ( 4 ) . This makes the privacy issue a bit more perplexing . <p> Consent <p> Do individuals have the right not to know ? This has been a question that the Federal government has been toying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate . Many states have proposed legislation similar to the one proposed by Indiana in 1997 . This legislation would prohibit insurance companies from forcing people to be tested in order to be insured and would also prohibit inquiries into the results regarding genetic screening or testing ( 9 ) . But is it possible to stop all inquiries into genetic testing ? Insurance companies have the right to look at medical records and family histories before granting coverage and indirect or direct genetic results could be obtained from these records . Unfortunately , these are all questions that will inevitably be answered in our court systems . <p> Discrimination <p> Discrimination could be a nightmare to someone with a genetic disorder or to someone with a family history of genetic disorders . A study done at Georgetown University looked at the perceptions of 332 members of genetic support groups and found that 25% of respondents of affected family members believed they were refused life insurance . 22% believed they were refused health insurance and 13% believed they were denied or let go from a job due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many doctors have indicated that people will get genetic testing done anonymously or under false names in order to avoid potentially discriminating situations ( 4 ) . <p> Even if a genetic test is not done , discrimination based on possible gene makeup can still take place . One woman who applied to become an adoptive parent was denied because a family history of Huntington 's disease made her a high risk ( 2 ) . <p> In another case , a family 's HMO learned of a prenatal genetic test showing that the fetus carried two recessive alleles for Cystic Fibrosis . When the HMO learned that they were going to continue with the pregnancy the family was informed that if the pregnancy was not terminated , movement to withdraw or limit the entire family 's health coverage would result . This was the case until threats of lawsuits from the family encouraged the HMO to change their minds ( 2 ) . <p> Equity <p> Is genetic testing equally available to all ? Will the rich be able to alienate itself from all genetic problems creating a lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genome Project , genetic abnormalities spanned all socioeconomic classes with similar percentages . This is no longer the case . <p> If gene patenting is allowed to proceed , the cost of genetic tests could skyrocket based on demand . This could lead to only the wealthy being able to afford genetic testing and from this , genetic problems could be isolated to the poor . <p> Social Engineering <p> Leon Kass makes excellent sense in the following statement , " I was conceived after antibiotics yet before amniocentesis , late enough to have benefitted from medicine 's ability to prevent and control fatal infectious diseases , yet early enough to have escaped from medicine 's ability to prevent me from living to suffer from genetic diseases . To be sure , my genetic vices are , as far as I know them , rather modest , taken individually -myopia , asthma and other allergies , bilateral forefoot adduction , bowleggedness and pessimism , plus some four to eight as yet undiagnosed recessive lethal genes in the heterozygous condition-but taken together , if diagnosable prenatally , I might never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preimplantation testing , that looks for desirable traits , all bad ? Is it wrong for a parent to desire to choose the best traits in its soon-to-be offspring ? Some critics say it would give the parents a more enthusiastic role in conceiving a child if they had some control over its beginnings . <p> Are we out to make the perfect child ? It may seem farfetched now , but what if we could ? Will we ever have the technology to make a human more intelligent ? This may only be a pipedream . As geneticist Eric Lander puts it , " We can tinker at the edges , but we are talking about an understanding of single components in a system that has 100,000 components . " As long as that 's the case , the best way to produce smarter kids is to educate them ( 11 ) . But , when it comes to humans , who knows what we will try to do . <p> Conclusion <p> All of this discussion and debate ultimately stems from the Human Genome Project . This project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genes of the human cell . The project has allocated a large amount of its funds , some $40 million , to the ethical , legal and social implications ( ELSI ) of genetic research . This allocation has created many social , legal , and hard science studies . These studies included the production of a widely accepted set of principles to guard against genetic discrimination , insuring quality in DNA labs , educating doctors in the use of genetic data , and guiding researchers on obtaining informed consent . <p> Many of the issues that are controversial with the system revolving around genetic testing can be prevented with foresighted social and legal policies , health care reform , and state and national legislation . But European countries with universal health care and national legislation still have problems with discrimination and privacy . <p> Do we eliminate the most extensive technology ever known to man or do we do our best to improve on the mistakes we have made and create a better world for the future ? In order to improve on anything , a risk must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good from this endeavor . With this in mind , I am reminded of my favorite quote by probably the most famous scientist of all time , Albert Einstein . <p> As a conclusion I can not say it any better than Tom Dworetzky ( 8 ) . " I 'm not saying we should n't proceed with the Human Genome Project . The gifts it will bear in treatment for devastating inherited diseases outweigh its societal risks . However , we must begin , individually and collectively , to prepare for this knowledge by addressing our prejudices . Those are the most deadly of all inherited diseases , ones we must cure before our genetic knowledge will ever flower into wisdom and we truly become human beings . "

And on the other side of the coin there is some people that think we have no business playing God . They feel that playing God may possibly cause devastating effects to the human gene pool and may also led to misuse . <p> Merriam-Websters Collegiate Dictionary defines gene therapy as the insertion of normal or genetically altered genes into cells usually to replace defective genes especially in the treatment of genetic disorders . By using gene therapy , we can go to t he base of the disorder instead of using drugs to alleviate symptoms . Some diseases that have been treated include ADA Deficiency , familial hypercholesterolemia , cystic fibrosis , cancers that include melanoma , Neuroblastoma , brain tumors and AIDS ( Nation al Cancer Institute , 1993 ) . <h> Technical Aspects <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first method includes either retroviruses or retrotransposons . Retroviruses are viruses that can transfer their own genetic information and also genetically alter the huma n gene . These viruses are unable to copy themselves but still pose a problem in altering protein synthesis when these retroviruses splice a patients cells . This is were retroviruses come into play . There are parts of DNA from a cell that " can copy th emselves onto other sites in the cells genome " ( Glausisus , 1996 ) . One type of transposon is a yeast transposon called Ty3 . This yeast transposon is still under research . <p> The second method involves blasting genes with a pressurized gun filled with helium ( Glausisus , 1996 ) . The helium gun will fire very small gold bullets which will be coated with the genetically altered genes . This technique was done on mice that had tumors . The gold bullets coated with the altered genes were shot at the skin of the mice that surrounded the tumors . The cells that were successful in receiving the altered genes code for cytokines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the ac tivation of the immune cells , they hope the tumors will decrease . This study was done at Northwestern University by Wen Sun and colleagues . They found out by shooting the mice three to five times a day , there was a significant decrease in the size of t he tumors and an increase life span for the treated mice compared to the control mice ( Glausisus , 1996 ) . By using the gene bullets the genes are not permanently in the cells of the mice but the effects ware off in a few days to a few weeks . This may be a n advantage or a disadvantage . <p> The third method involves liposomes , hollow fat molecules in solution . This method is being researched by the Royal Brmpton Hospital in London headed by Natasha Caplen ( Glauisisus.1996 ) . She is using liposomes in experimentation with cystic fibr osis . Cystic fibrosis is a disease that is caused by a chloride ion build up in the respiratory tract which causes difficulty in breathing . By inhaling liposomes coated with genetically altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signi ficant decrease in chloride ion levels . This method does not pose the harmful side effects that retroviruses do . <p> The first disease that was approved for gene therapy was adenosine demeans deficiency or ADA . This is a very rare disorder . A normal ADA gene produces an enzyme that is called adenosine deaminase . A person with ADA deficiency does not produce this enzyme . Children who have this deadly disease are seriously prone to the most minor of illnesses . If ADA Deficiency is untreated . life for these kids is only a couple of years and replacement ADA is limited . ADA Deficiency is effected by one gene whi ch makes it an easy target for gene therapy experimentation ( National Cancer Institute , 1993 ) . This same procedure is under development and research for AIDS . <p> Another major issue that attracts gene therapy attention is cancer . An experiment done at the University of California in LA led by Habib Fakhrai done studies on rats with tumors . They had sixteen rats of which eleven of them received the genetica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer cell , it blocks off the synthesis of a protein called TGF - beta . TGF-beta greatly decreases the quality of the immune system . After all was said and done the eleven rats that t receiv ed the altered 9L gliosarcoma cells were alive and the five that did not died ( Seligman , 1996 ) . <p> There are many other diseases that may be cured by gene therapy of which include Rubinstein-taybi syndrome , partial epilepsy , cataracts , prostate cancer , male infertility , Alzheimers , schizophrenia , usher syndrome , and maternal acute fatty liver of pregnancy . All of these disorders had there genes identified in 1995 ( Glausisus , 1995 ) . <h> The Pros and Cons of Gene Therapy <p> The ethics that surround the issue of gene therapy are very overwhelming . Some people think that we will get burnt trying to play God while others think this is a great advancement for man kind . One reason for unacceptance may be that gene therapy m ay be used for the enhancement or modification of human capabilities . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be changed . Even if some small countries experimented with gene therapy , could they develop unstoppable armies ? If gene therapy was done to a certain extent could it alter the human gene pool for good ? And also would this form of treatment be a luxury only for the rich which could very well make the rich , richer and make the poor , poorer . For just these reasons an d theories , all gene therapy experiments must receive approval from the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ( RAC ) and the National Institutes of Health , ( NIH ) . After approval by these committees the trials must also receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( National Cancer Institute , 1993 ) . <p> Many countries have been approved for trials in human gene therapy including USA , China , France , Italy , and the Netherlands . The publics opinion has a lot of influence on whether the trials get approved or not . So a survey was done by Darryl R.J. M acer on ethics surrounding gene therapy in many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , France , Italy and Germany . <p> These surveys were done from August of 1991 to October of 1991 . All surveys were as random as possible . The questionnaires were delivered by mail in Japan and were also done face-to-face to get a better response rate in some cases . <p> The survey found out that 74% of the Japanese thought that gene therapy was unacceptable . In the USA 42% said that changing genetic makeup was wrong while 52% said it was acceptable . In both New Zealand and Japan , scientists found gene therapy more acceptable tha n teachers , and teachers more accepting than the public . In the USA , 24% of the people interviewer said they knew nothing about genetic engineering , 39% said they have heard of it while 35% said they knew more than average . In Japan and New Zealand , 63 % of the people that were in the survey suggested that gene therapy was a form of playing God . Also 20% of the people said that there must be a form of control to deter misuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of UK , France , Italy , and Germany , included that one third thought it is ethical and the other one third thought it was unethical while the last one third were undecided . Some of the consequences that were cited in a 1986 poll included , difficulties in the control of the spread , health hazards , mutants , environmental contamination , because knew and unknown diseases and also cause antibiotic resistant strains ( Macer , 1992 ) . Whether or not these theories are correct or no we must still investigate the possibilities . <p> It is unsure to say that the advantages out weigh the disadvantages but to some people it may be their only chance to live . Man kind is still in need of more information surrounding this topic . I do think gene therapy could be a wonderful thing in curing series diseases that would other wise led to death . But the costs of gene therapy would certainly be outrageous . Gene therapy could possibly be only for the rich and not the poor . The public needs to be more informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . If the public is more willing to accept this our scientists will discover more and better things . But just like anything else , anything not in moderation could be devastating . The possibility of misuse could led to a highe r standard of normal or could led to misuse in other forms . For just these reasons we definitely need RAC ( Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee ) , NIH ( National Institutes of Health ) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . Without these committees the p ossibility of misuse will be greatly enhanced .

@@13708533 @2308533/ <h> Human Gene Therapy <h> Kiran Oberoi <p> Copyright 1999 <h> Introduction <p> Gene therapy is the use of genes to treat disease . It represents a quantum leap in our approach to the treatment of human disease and will have a significant effect on medicine over the next ten years . William French Anderson , Michael Biase , and Ken Culver performed the first successful gene therapy on a human in 1990 . They developed a protocol for treating Adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) deficiency , severe combined immune deficiency , also known as the " Boy in the Bubble disease " . ADA deficiency is a result of inheriting two copies of the defective ADA gene ( in other words it is a recessive disease ) . Possession of a normal gene leads to the continuous , regular production of ADA in cells throughout the body . Without at least one properly functioning gene , children have no way of converting deoxyadenosine ( a waste product ) into inosine . This leads to the rapid build up deoxyadenosine in the system , which becomes phosphoralysed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost complete failure of the immune system and early death . <h> Concept of Gene Therapy <p> The term gene therapy originally referred to proposed treatments of genetic disorders that would involve replacing a defective gene with its normal counterpart Current usage of the term now extends to include all treatments in which there is an introduction of genetic material into body cells to treat a variety of diseases . Gene therapy utilizes two theoretically possible approaches : <p> 1 ) Somatic gene therapy entails the transfer of a gene or genes into body cells other than germ ( egg or sperm ) cells with effect only on the patient . The new genetic material can not be passed on to offspring . Examples of Somatic gene therapy have already proven to be clinically effective . The first successful treatments of adenosine deaminase deficiency took place in 1990 in 1991 with two patients aged 4 and 11 . Both are thriving with continuing treatment . The first successful treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia , a genetic condition , which affects the livers regulation of cholestrols in the blood , took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable for the 18 months of the study and liver biopsy demonstrated activity of the inserted gene and no discernible abnormalities . Five patients have been treated as of 1994 . Current research involving Somatic gene therapy is focusing on a number of areas . Clinical trials are being performed on a treatment for cystic fibrosis , a chronic genetic disorder . <p> 2 ) Germline gene therapy would involve the genetic modification of germ cells . Such therapy would change the genetic make up of the egg or sperm of an individual and would be carried on to future generations . This would offer the possibility of removing an inherited disorder from a family line forever . This could be achieved by other methods , such as , at present , diagnosis when there is a known risk before embryo implantation during IVF . Germ line therapy is a remote prospect and general opinion is strongly negative ; such therapy is currently illegal in most of Europe . Somatic and Germ line gene therapy raise different issues . Somatic gene therapy offers the prospect of effective treatment and cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used experimentally for a small range of genetic disorders ; even in these cases treatment is complex , difficult and success uncertain . <h> Technical Aspects of Gene Therapy <p> The most fundamental requirement for gene therapy to be successful is that a therapeutic gene can be effectively delivered to a target cell . Once delivered that gene must enter the nucleus of cell wall where it will act as a template for production of protein molecule . The protein then exerts the primary therapeutic effect . This may be , for example , cell killing in the case of tumor therapy or cell preservation in the case of neurodegenerative disease . <p> There are several ways to get genes into cells . The most efficient of these uses disabled , engineered viruses . These systems are efficient because viruses have evolved over long periods of time to deliver their own genes to cells . Whenever , we get a viral disease , be it a cold or AIDS , the particular virus concerned is placing its genes into our cells in order to reprogrammed our cells to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we disable them so that they are unable to cause disease and we engineer them in such a way that they pick up and deliver the genes of our choice rather than their own genes . These derivatives of viruses that are used for gene delivery are known as viral vectors . The most frequently used viral vectors are of two types . The vectors based on adenovirus are generally used for therapeutic strategies that require the therapeutic gene to be active for only a short time . Gene delivery by adenoviruses is very efficient but because the gene does not become integrated into the chromosomes of the target cell the gene is lost overtime . <p> This not a disadvantage for some therapeutic strategies such as cell destruction in the treatment of some cancers , restinosis or inflammatory disease . However , it is a disadvantage where sustained gene activity required for many months such as in the treatment of some tumors , neurodegenerative disease and HIV infection . <p> The second major type of vector is generally used and this is based on the retrovirus , murine leukemia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivatives of MLV they become integrated into the chromosomes of target cell and are maintained for as long as the cell remains alive . Gene activity is easy to control and continues over long periods of time . Many clinical trials have been conducted with these MLV based systems and has been shown to be well tolerated with no adverse side effects . <p> One of the major difference between adenovirus vectors and MLV vectors is that the former can deliver genes to cells that are not multiplying by cell division whereas the latter can not . Until recently this has meant gene therapy strategies that demand long term gene activity in cells that are not dividing have been feasible . Examples of important target cells that do not divide are neurons , certain cells of the immune system and certain epithelial cells . <p> Lentiviruses are a subgroup with in the general family of retroviruses but they are distinct from the MLV like viruses in that they are able to infect non-dividing cells . The best studied of the lentiviruses is HIV and when observation was made , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macrophages , which do not divide , there was a move within the research community to develop gene delivery vectors from HIV . There were number of early technical difficulties and first generation vectors could not be used in the clinic as they had potential to generate infectious HIV . Over past two years we have seen new HIV based vectors emerge that are severely disabled containing only the few HIV components that are required for efficient gene delivery to non dividing cells . These so called minimal vectors are now candidates for gene delivery vehicles for clinical use in gene therapy . <p> The technique , called Chimeraplasty , was developed for mammalian gene therapy . It has an advantage over current genetic engineering methods in that it can seek out any specific gene and cause tiny mutations with high precision . Instead of adding a new gene to trick a plant into doing something it would not normally do , Chimeraplasty simply switches on or off function for which the plant already has a gene . <p> Until now , an entire gene had to hitch a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to insert itself into the genome . However , the virus could settle anywhere on the genome , sometimes choosing a location that is less than optimal for the replication of new gene . Technique also eliminates the danger from inserting large sections of genes with potentially undesirable side- effects , such as poisoning beneficial insects . <p> For Chimeraplasty , researchers start with small chunks of artificial genetic material , called oligonucleotides or " oligos " , with about 25 bases each . They mirror one specific plant gene except for a mismatch of a few bases . The chunks are hooked up to tiny gold particles , which are then shot into nucleus of cell with a particle gun . When the oligos attach their counterparts in the cell , the DNA repair machinery tries to " fix " the mismatch , using the new sequence of the bases as blueprint . <p> Boosting blood cell production does little good for patients , whose blood cells are malformed , such as those of sickle cell anemic . The ultimate goal of gene therapy is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preliminary work published in the September 6 issue of science offers a reason to hope that goal may be possible . A team led by Allyson Cole-strauss and Kyonggeum Yoon of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia experimented on cells containing a mutant gene that causes sickle cell anemia . To make their genetic drug they combined DNA for the normal version of this gene with RNA for the same gene . When they injected the drug into the diseased cells , the RNA/DNA particles homed in on the particular stretch of the genome that matched their codes and formed triple stranded DNA that covered the mutation . The cells normal DNA repair machinery then apparently replaced the mutation with the normal code thus permanently curing 10 to 20 percent of cells . The researchers still have to demonstrate that this technique works in human cells and in human bodies . <p> In about half of lung cancer cases , a gene called p53 has mutated and thus falls to encode a protein that oversees programmed cell death . In the absence of this protein , Which helps to curb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foothold . Replacing such defective p53 genes with fresh ones has shown promise against a variety of cancers in animal experiments and studies of a few patients . <p> Scientists now report further progress in such localized gene therapy . By enlisting a virus to deliver p53 to tumor sites in 28 people with lung cancer , they temporarily stabilized or reversed the course of the cancer in more than half patients . The patients , average age 65 , had lung cancer that was either inoperable or was no longer responding to radiation treatment or chemotherapy . The researchers injected the tumors with an adenovirus engineered to contain p53 genes . The virus was modified to prevent it from replicating and thus causing the upper respiratory infection that it might otherwise bring about . <p> During the 6 months treatment period patients received one to six monthly injections of the modified virus . The researchers delivered a range of doses -from 1 million to 100 billion viral units to gauge any toxicity of the treatment . 3 of the 28 patients died of cancer before doctors could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tumors shrank in 2 patients , stabilized in 16 and continued to grow in the other 7 . <p> The dose of virus mattered ; cancer progressed unabated in three of five patients who received injections of 10 million or fewer viral units . In contrast , only 4 of 20 patients getting larger dose experienced cancer growth . <h> Argument of Human Gene Therapy <p> Consider what a nation would gain by permitting parents to genetically enhance their children . By assumption , the genetic enhancement technology increases the ability of children to learn and perform cognitive tasks , and thus to acquire and generate knowledge . Permitting or facilitating genetic enhancement would therefore increase the collective human capital embodied in nations workers . The increasing prevalence of high ability genotypes would also multiply the effects of other national investments in education , training , and scientific or engineering research . Because genetic enhancements are heritable , the effect of these investments on the stock of human capital are cumulative unless enhanced offspring or their descendants emigrate . Finally , permitting genetic enhancement would be a cheap way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition between parents would lead some parents to pay for it out of their own pockets . If expanding stock of nations human capital brings increasing returns in productivity and economic growth , it means that in economic competitions among nations , small initial differences in the distribution of able people can multiply , over time , to large international differences in the rate of economic growth . Thus nations have an incentive to defect from an international ban on genetic enhancement to get a jump on others in the accumulation of human capital . <p> It is said that the day is not far of when parents will be able to browse through gene catalogs to special order a hazel eyed , red headed extrovert with perfect pitch . Every new discovery gives shape and bracing focus to a debate we have barely begun . Even skeptics admit it 's only matter of time before these issues become real . If you could make your kids smatter , would you ? If everyone else did , would it be fair not to ? <p> It 's an ethical quandary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about vanity and values . Which side effects would we tolerate ? What if making smarter kids also made them meaner ? What if only the rich could afford the advantage ? Does god give us both the power to re-create ourselves and moral muscles to resist ? Self-improvement forever been an American religion , but norms about what is normal keep changing . <p> While gene therapy shows a great deal of potential , opponents , biomedical reductionism will undoubtedly have several responses . The way a person experiences a disease involves many social and psychological elements ( such as emotional impact of the disease , the stigmatism attached to it , the cost and employment implications , etc ) . These important aspects of disease are neglected by therapeutic approaches aimed strictly at the genetic level . <p> Today in many countries governments sets up committees , which included not only scientists and doctors but also religious leaders , lawyers and ethicist , to consider the matter ( Nichols 1988 ) . A distinction should be drawn between making genetic changes in somatic cells and in germinal cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual patient , e.g. by inserting a properly functioning gene into patients bone marrow cells in vitro and then introducing the cells into patients body . They differ , however , in that gene therapy an inherent and probably permanent change in the body rather than requiring repeated applications of an outside force or substance . An analogy is organ transplantation , which also involves the incorporation into an individual of cells containing DNA of foreign origin . Germinal gene therapy , in which the changes would be made in germ cells and would be passed on to the offspring , is not allowed . <h> Personal Opinion <p> In my personal opinion gene therapy is both beneficial and potentially harmful depending on how it is applied . Somatic cell gene therapy will have great benefits for some of the diseases that human beings suffer . I think before carrying a gene therapy every researcher should keep following questions in mind <p> What is the disease to be treated ? <p> What alternative interventions are available for the treatment of this disease ? <p> What is the anticipated or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> What procedure will be followed to ensure fairness in the selection of patient subjects ? <p> What steps will be taken to ensure that patients , or their parents or guardians , give consent to participating in the research ? <p> How will privacy of patients and the confidentiality of their medical information be protected ? <p> If proper guidelines and policies are made gene therapy can be utilized to its fullest potential . Everyone irrespective , of wealth , sex and so on should have same opportunity to make the best use of gene therapy . The government , the public groups and the scientific society should cooperate and walk hand in hand to encourage gene therapy applications and make the best use of it . <p> The advantage of gene therapy is to cure someone who is born with a genetic disorder or who develops deadly disease like AIDS , cancer and so on . The technique has the ability to cure so many diseases that have affected our society for years I think the advantages are more than disadvantages . Genetherapy has brought revolution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both doctors and patients . <p> As more and more discoveries are made , the scope of gene therapy is getting wider and wider . Government regulators and scientist must take an initiative to solve the issues related to gene therapy and enlighten people about the benefits of gene therapy . 
@@13708534 @2308534/ <h> Gene Therapy : A new generation of molecular medicine <h> Erick De Wolf <p> Copyright 1997 <h> Introduction <p> In September of 1990 , eight year old Ashanthi DeSilva made medical history when she received the first authorized human gene therapy treatment . Ashanthi has been born with a defective gene that normally produces an essential enzyme adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) . If left untreated the inability to produce this enzyme results in the fatal malfunction of the immune system . Four years after receiving the first of many treatment of transgenic cells containing functional ADA genes , Ashanthi was still doing well . Since that first treatment , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and evaluate new gene therapy protocols for a variety of genetic diseases ( Marshall 1995 ) . <p> Gene therapy has made a profound impact not only in the treatment of genetic disease but also in the way that we look at human disease as a whole . The following text describes the technical and ethical aspects of gene therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's personal opinion is presented . <h> 1 Technical Aspects <p> Recombinant DNA ( rDNA ) technology has made the transfer of genes from one organism to another possible . The use of rDNA technology in conjunction with humans and other mammals is referred to as gene therapy . Gene therapy can be classified into two categories , germinal and somatic ( Sections 1.1 &amp; 1.2 , respectively ) . In general , gene therapy involves augmenting the functions of an absent or dysfunctional gene by the introduction of a functional gene into the cells of the individual . If the transfer is successful , the result is a transgenic individual , who is now free of the effects of the dysfunctional gene as long as the new gene is expressed ( Griffiths et al . 1996 ) . Gene therapy has been successful in mammalian models , and potential applications for treatment of human genetic disease such as Cystic Fibrosis , ADA and various types of cancer are now being aggressively persued by researchers . Clinical trials have already begun ( Section 1.4 ) ( Kolberg 1994 , Gibbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy <p> Germinal gene therapy involves the introduction of genes into both somatic cells and the germline of an individual . The result is not only that the individual is cured of the genetic disease but some of the gametes of the individual may also carry the altered trait . Germinal gene therapy in mice has been successful , but thus far protocols developed for use in mice have not been effective in humans . One protocol that might be feasible in human germinal gene therapy involves the removal of an embryo during the blastocyst stage of development and injection with transgenic cells . As the embryo develops the injected cells then become integrated into tissues of the body , including the germ line and ultimately the gametes of that individual ( Griffiths 1996 ) . <p> 1.2 Somatic gene therapy <p> Somatic gene therapy focuses on the correction of genetic disease by treating non-reproductive or somatic tissues . This method of gene therapy involves the removal of some of the dysfunctional cells and inserting a cloned wild-type gene . The transgenic cells are then reintroduced into the patient 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases not all of the affected cells need to be altered but only enough to relieve the symptoms of the disease . In contrast to germinal gene therapy , somatic gene therapy technology has advanced rapidly and is presently being evaluated in numerous clinical trials ( Griffiths 1996 ) . Somatic gene therapy currently focuses on treating those diseases that are limited to the one tissue , including CF and ADA . Soon somatic therapy may be used on multigenic diseases ( Msezane 1997 , Marshall 1995 ) . However , the weakness of somatic gene therapy lies in the delivery of the wild-type gene and sustaining expression ( Verma 1997 ) . <p> 1.3 Gene delivery <p> At present , there are two types of gene delivery vehicles , non-viral and viral . Non-viral gene delivery includes approaches such as direct injection or mixing the DNA with compounds that allow the gene to cross the cell membrane , but these types of gene delivery systems have not been efficient . Gene delivery with viral vectors has been more successful and most current protocols involve this type of gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus that has been pathogenicly disabled , but still maintains its natural ability to transfer DNA into living cells ( Verma 1997 , Msezane 1997 , Crystal 1995 ) . <p> Retroviruses are a group of RNA viruses that convert their genome into DNA in the infected host cell . Researchers have identified regions of the viral genome that are required for integration into the host genome , and control gene expression . By manipulating these regions of the viral genome and replacing portions with transgenes , researchers have been able to use the viruses to effectively deliver wild type genes . The retroviral vectors only have the ability to infect rapidly dividing cells , and can not infect the cells that make up muscle , brain , lung , and liver tissue . In a procedure called ex vivo gene therapy , cells from the target tissue are removed and grown in vitro where they can be infected with the altered retro viral vector . The transgenic cells are then transplanted back into the patient where they express the desired gene product . However , gene expression ceases after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posses the transgenic DNA . Longer gene expression has been observed in other systems , and the solution may involve finding the correct enhancer-promoter combination for a given cell type . Lentiviruses are viruses that belong to the retrovirus family , but can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells . The best known lentivirus is the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , which has been disabled and developed as a gene delivery vector in vivo . Lentiviruses can be manipulated in a similar fashion to the retroviruses , and appear to sustain expression for over six-months . Another advantage of the Lentiviruses is that they do not elicit an effective cellular immune response ( Verma 1997 , Msezane 1997 , Crystal 1995 ) . <p> Adenoviruses are a family of DNA viruses that can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells . Upon infection the adenovirus genome is not integrated into the host DNA , but is replicated as extra chromosomal elements in the host nucleus ( Crystal 1995 Verma 1997 ) . The replication process of these viruses can be disabled and the genome manipulated so that the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discussed previously . However , in contrast to the retroviruses the Adenoviruses can infect cells in vivo and express the trans gene products at high levels . Host immune response usually results in a short ( &lt; 10 days ) duration of gene expression and in the production of antibodies that make additional treatments with the recombinant virus almost useless . Moreover , a large percentage of the human population already has antibodies for Adenoviruses because of prior naturally occurring infections . Immunological difficulties may be overcome in time , but at the present time Adenoviruses have limited application ( Verma 1997 ) . <p> One final family of viruses that warrants mention as potential vectors in gene therapy is the Adeno-associated viruses . Adeno-assiciated viuses are single stranded DNA viruses that are non-pathogenic . These viruses contain relatively few genes and require additional genes to replicate ( usually an adenovirus ) . While more information about this family of viruses is needed , preliminary results indicate that therapeutic amounts of gene product can be produced in vivo for up to six months ( Verma 1997 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gene therapy as a treatment for genetic disease such as cancer , ADA , CF , and other genetic diseases has begun in the United States ( Kolberg 1994 , Gibbs 1996 &amp; Marshall 1995 ) . Many of the trials have resulted in short term improvement in patients receiving treatments , but effects have not been sustained . In some cases clear assessment of the effects of gene therapy have been difficult because the therapies have been used in tandem with other treatments ( Marshall 1995 , Verma 1997 ) . <h> 2 Public Debate <p> The science of genetics , and particularly recombinant DNA technology , has seemingly always been in the media since the early 1970 's ( Berg and Singer 1995 ) . The impact of the involvement of the media , both positive and negative , has shaped how the public views not only genetics , but science as a whole . Gene therapy has not been an exception and the following sections address only some of the issues that have emerged during recent years regarding the ethics and potential of this technology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years the concept of what can be considered a genetic disease has been changing . The term genetic diseases is no longer restricted to diseases like Huntington 's , Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , or Sickle-cell anemia that are the result of a defect in a single locus and have 100% heritably . Rather , genetic disease has been expanded to include any trait that has a genetic component even though the heritably is reduced . As a result , cardiovascular disease , some types of cancer and diabetes are now considered to be genetic diseases . Ultimately , behavioral and psychological disorders such as alcoholism , schizophrenia , obesity and even criminal behavior have come to be considered genetic diseases . The concern over this trend is that too much emphasis will be placed on gene therapy as a potential treatment of disorders that are not entirely genetic in origin , but have important associated environmental factors ( Magnus 1997 ) . <p> 2.2 Safety of gene transfer <p> The safety concerns of the gene transfer that are required for gene therapy to be successful are not trivial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune responses . The complementation of replication deficient vectors could occur resulting in undesirable viral replication , infection , or insertional mutagenesis . There have been reports of adverse events in human gene therapy including inflamation of the airway and central nervous system induced by the administration of viral vectors . However , when the total number of individuals involved in the gene therapy trials is considered , adverse events have rare and , in most cases , related to dose or method gene delivery ( Crystal 1995 ) . <p> 2.3 Ethical issues <p> It is clear that gene therapy holds both great promise and potential for misuse . The promise of gene therapy is that individuals with previously untreatable genetic diseases may be effectively and safely treated with gene therapy ( Crystal 1995 ) . Any delay in the development of this technology would only result in the needless suffering and possibly needless deaths . However , the present state of gene therapy is irreversible , and this technology should not be approached without prudent and judicial caution . In the case of germline gene therapy , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the offspring of that individual ( Msezane 1997 ) . <p> Potential misuse of gene therapy is undeniable and concerns of gene therapy being used for enhancement of desirable qualities such as intelligence , cosmetic appearance , or physical performance need to be addressed ( Macer 1995 , Brownlee 1994 ) . Perhaps the most difficult question to answer is who defines what or who is normal and what is considered genetic disease ( Brownlee 1994 ) . <h> 3 Personal Opinion <p> 3.1 Hype and disappointments <p> The media has played a pivotal role in the public perception of what the goals of these trials truly are . This can result in hype about treatments that have not been fully evaluated ( Wadman 1995 ) . Whether clinical trials can be considered a success or a failure depends on one 's expectations . For example , if one expected the trials to result in the complete relief of patient symptoms without side effects or the need for further treatments , the treatments would most certainly be a failure . However , if the expectation was that trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated with gene therapy or other treatments , the trials may appear to be a success . Scientists need to clearly convey their goal to the public and avoid hype that can lead to public disillusion . <p> Since the Alisomar conference in 1974 , scientists have shown that they feel a sense of moral and social responsibly . As a result , committees and government agencies alike have played an important role in the evaluation of the ethics of recombinant DNA technology including gene therapy . The positive and negative potentials of gene therapy are not uncommon for developing technology . No amount of regulation could prevent all potential misuses of this technology and a total ban of gene therapy research would not prevent misuse but rather would delay the development of gene therapy treatment of genetic disorders . <p> 3.2 Need for basic research <p> Researchers have made great strides in the treatment of human genetic diseases with gene therapy , but a renewed emphasis in basic research is needed to sustain these efforts . Researchers must address short comings in the understanding of critical components of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advance . Perhaps gene therapy will never result in a cure for genetic disease , but what we learn about the human genome , gene expression , virology , immunology , and cell biology may one day bring treatments for not only genetic disease but for many other diseases as well
