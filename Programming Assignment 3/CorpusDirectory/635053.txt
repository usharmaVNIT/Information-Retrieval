@@119029461 @8029461/ <h> Power Requirements <h> What Power Supply Should I Use With My Origin Effects- Pedal ? <p> Our Origin Effects compact pedals are designed to be accepting of a range of power supplies , whilst delivering impeccable performance . On paper , any power supply which meets our pedals specifications will be suitable , however , if the supply does n't  have sufficient internal filtering then unwanted noise may be heard . Here is a list of power supplies which we have used with our compact pedals and we can recommend for use with our pedals : <p> Voodoo Labs Pedal Power series <p> Cioks supplies <p> Truetone 1 Spot Pro series <p> Strymon Zuma <p> Dunlop ECB-004 <p> 100mA will be perfectly adequate for the Cali76-C &amp; SlideRIG-C models . In the case of the more thirsty , Cali76-CD , Cali76-CB &amp; SlideRIG-CD , we suggest using a DC supply with a current rating in excess of 100mA . In the case of Voodoo Lab , Strymon Zuma , Truetone and Cioks supplies , a 100mA rated output will be fine under normal operating conditions . <p> Supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DC. 18V will give the most headroom , allowing for higher levels of compression before clipping occurs . <p> We always recommend using a regulated power supply for noise and reliability considerations . Having said that , the compact units feature a voltage-limited , floating regulator which will help clean up some of the noisier supplies out there , as well as reducing the risk of failure due to plugging in the wrong supply . It should be noted that while linear-supplies noise can be filtered relatively easily , certain switch-mode supplies can be highly problematic due to noise artefacts that extend well into radio frequencies . <h> How To Power The Cali76-TX , -TX-L , -TX-P , And -TX-L-P Models <p> The Cali76-TX and Cali76-TX-L pedals can be powered by a 9V PP3 battery but this will bypass the transformer output stage causing the unit to behave like the original Cali76 Standard . Powering these pedals with a supply below 12V will also cause the transformer stage to be bypassed . <p> The transformer circuitry is switched in by relays when provided with- 14.6V. - If the -TX has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below 12.6V will switch out the transformer circuitry ; the Cali76-TX will then perform like a Cali76 Standard . <p> We do not recommend using a supply of 12V " 15V as any- possible variation in regulation of mains voltage could- cause the transformer stage to switch in and out of operation . 18V is recommended for best results when using the transformer output stage .

If noise or hum is entering your signal chain before the compressor it will become louder when leaving the compressor circuit . <p> Best practice is to place a compressor pedal before any devices which could be adding hiss , hum , or noise . Likely culprits are distortion-based effects such as overdrive , fuzz and distortion pedals . <p> Hum picked up by singlecoil pickups will also be amplified by a compressor pedal . Try your pedal straight into an amplifier with a humbucker-loaded guitar to see if the noise disappears . <p> This video should help show what kind of noise you can expect when increasing the gain in a pedal or amplifier : <h> I do n't hear any sound from my amp <p> Check guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're still getting no signal it 's either the amplifier or both cables which are at fault . If you do hear signal then move on to- step 2 : <p> Plug your instrument into INSTR jack and the amplifier into the AMP jack of your pedal using the two cables you tested in step 1 . Power the pedal with a center negative power supply that supplies between 9Vdc and 18Vdc . <p> Toggle the footswitch to ensure the LED lights up .

" Its one of those rare pedals that just seems to make every guitar sound nicer , fuller and more like itself , " is just one of the great things that was said of our large format comp . <p> The guys at SOS have picked up a couple of our compact SlideRIG compressors and have run them through the gauntlet , giving them a stunning review from the ears of pro-audio professionals . We 've republished it below but you can also view it on the Sound On Sound website . Enjoy ! <p> The Origin Effects SlideRig is a unique compressor pedal designed primarily for electric slide guitarists . Building on the Urei 1176-inspired design of Origin 's flagship Cali76 compressor , the SlideRig sets out to reproduce the peerless slide guitar sound of Little Feat 's Lowell George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a crystal-clear yet endlessly sustaining sound . The pedal has won countless admirers , with slide and steel specialists and conventional players among them , and Origin have now extended their compact range to include two new versions of the SlideRig . <p> As with the Cali76 , there are both Compact and Compact Deluxe versions available . The former is slightly cheaper and more user-friendly , while the latter offers some desirable in-depth features . Both use the same circuit topology as the original , with two dual-chained Cali76 blocks inside the box . The SlideRig Compact is devastatingly simple to use , with only three knobs to worry about . The input-gain control also sets the amount of compression , the output control applies make-up gain and the central blend knob mixes the output of the two compressors , allowing you to select single-stage or dual-stage compression at either extreme , or a mix of the two . In contrast , the SlideRig Compact Deluxe offers individual level controls for each stage , plus an additional dry level knob , allowing you to precisely blend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side , these pedals deliver exactly the same sound and , indeed , sound all but identical to the original , full-sized SlideRig " that 's no mean feat given the reduction in size to roughly a third of the original 's dimensions . Attack and release times are fixed , as is the compression ratio , a parameter previously adjustable on the original SlideRig . These compact pedals are also mains-power only " presumably there was n't space for a 9V cell within this greatly reduced enclosure . In practice , neither feels like a great loss . I personally find the pedals much easier to dial in than the original SlideRig and the ability to mix single- and dual-stage compression " something not available on the dual-stage-only original " makes for a much more versatile effect . <p> The SlideRig Compact is particularly simple to operate , with its single blend knob that might as well be labelled more sustain ' ! Perhaps the best way to understand the sound of these pedals is to imagine the kind of compression , sustain and touch-sensitivity you get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any distortion whatsoever . What you get is ultra-clear and glassy sustain that just goes on and on . The preset attack and release give a pleasing , rounded plunkiness to the pick attack and the strings become extremely sensitive to the slightest touch , so sloppy playing is quickly found out . But for slide playing , the overall effect is simply superb , levelling out string volume and delivering oodles of gorgeous sustain . <p> As with all of Origin 's compressors , the unrestricted frequency range and lack of additional noise are extremely impressive . Obviously , when you 're applying this much compression ( or , in effect , limiting , when it comes to the dual-stage output ) , noise from the guitar 's pickups will be considerably amplified , but there 's little in the way of extra noise from the pedals themselves . <p> The SlideRig Compact is by no means limited to slide playing , and blending right over to the single-stage output delivers instant chimey arpeggios and solo sustain . From there you can adjust how much compression you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compact Deluxe has the edge when it comes to versatility , however , as the dry level control means you can blend the natural dynamics of your playing back in , creating an addictive combination of outrageous sustain and full dynamic integrity . This extra facility , alongside the separate single- and dual-stage blend controls , makes the Compact Deluxe a no-brainer if your budget will stretch the extra distance , especially as it remains devastatingly simple to use . But really either pedal would make a worthy addition to a discerning guitarist 's pedalboard , particularly if clean sounds make up a large part of their repertoire . For electric slide guitarists , the verdict is even simpler " you 've simply got to try one of these !
