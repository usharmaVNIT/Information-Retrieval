@@118040713 @7040713/ <h> About Block Sewer Rate <p> While the majority of the sewer rate applies to fixed costs that are required to maintain EMWDs extensive sewer collection and treatment system as a whole , a flat rate structure does not consider how much each household contributes to the system . For example , smaller households generally contribute less to the sewer system than larger households . <p> Therefore , to set sewer rates that are closer in line with the size of households , EMWD adopted a new rate structure with four blocks , based on household size , in January 2013 . Each block is designed around a specific household size to be more representative of the amount contributed to the sewer system . As a result , smaller than average households pay a smaller portion of the current rate , average size households pay the current rate , and larger than average households pay a larger portion of the current rate as follows : <p> Sewer Block <p> Number of People in Household <p> Sewer Rate Calculation <p> 1 <p> 1 - 2 <p> 75% of current sewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current sewer rate <p> 3 <p> 5 - 6 <p> 125% of current sewer rate <p> 4 <p> 7 or more <p> 175% of current sewer rate <p> This rate structure applies only to customers on water-budget based tiered rates who are also billed directly by EMWD for sewer services .

Water " Use It Wisely <p> No one can control what Mother Nature provides , and we have little control over environmental issues that affect our ability to import water . What we do have the power to control is how we use our water . EMWD encourages existing and future customers to make water efficiency a permanent way of life by using water wisely . 
@@118040771 @7040771/ <h> How can I find out what my water budget will be ? <p> Customers may see their water budget for the current billing period as well as an estimated water budget for the next three months on the left hand column of the billing statement . <h> What are water budgets based on ? <p> The total water budget is based on indoor and outdoor water budgets . All single family residential customers will begin with an indoor water budget to accommodate 3 people per household , based on Census data . All customers will have an outdoor water budget set according to their property 's estimated irrigated area , based on County parcel data ( lot size ) and GIS information ( house footprint , garage/carport area , and driveway space ) . <h> What if I think I 'm going to go over my budget ? <p> Customers may take advantage of a variety of programs and rebates such as a home water audit or rebates for indoor and outdoor water-efficient devices when available . <h> Why do I have to pay a higher rate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public health and safety . The vast majority of outdoor watering is not . Therefore , the cost of providing outdoor water is proportional to the need . However , in a tiered rate system , the averaged cost of indoor and outdoor water is usually less expensive than in a non-tiered system . <h> How much water is in a billing unit ? <p> One billing unit is 748 gallons of water . <h> What is daily ET ? <p> Daily ET is the amount of evapotranspiration ( ET ) that occurs on a daily basis in our service area . It measures - in inches of water per square foot , per day - what is lost to the atmosphere by the combined processes of evaporation ( from soil and plant surfaces ) and transpiration ( from plant tissues ) . Many factors affect daily ET measurements such as solar radiation , air temperature , relative humidity , and wind speed . <h> What is CIMIS ? <p> CIMIS is the California Irrigation Management Information System , a program of the Office of Water Use Efficiency ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DWR ) that manages a network of more than 120 automated weather stations in the State of California . CIMIS was developed in 1982 by DWR and the University of California , Davis to assist irrigators in managing their water resources efficiently . Efficient use of water resources benefits Californians by saving water , energy , and money . <h> Where does EMWD get its ET data from ? <h> Why is my ET value different from CIMIS data ? <p> EMWD is using spatial CIMIS data . DWR gathers daily weather data ( temperature , humidity , wind speed and rainfall ) from CIMIS weather stations within and near the service area and then extrapolates that data into 50 different weather zones to accommodate for microclimates within EMWDs 542 square mile service area . <h> Where can I see my ET data ? <p> At this time , daily ET data is not available for viewing by the customer .

EMWD had been in Stage 4b , the Mandatory Outdoor Reduction stage since April 2016 , which included a 30-percent cut in outdoor water budgets . <p> Stage 3c fully restores water budgets , but still prohibits runoff and water waste , in alignment with the Governor 's permanent restrictions on water waste and EMWD 's water waste prohibitions . All water used in excess of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . These on-going requirements for customers to avoid water waste are in recognition that four of the last five years have been exceptionally dry , and this year 's improvement in rainfall and snowpack was primarily concentrated in the northern portion of the state . <p> May 18 , 2016 : The State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ) significantly altered its regulatory framework regarding emergency water conservation measures , as put forth by the Governor through a series of Executive Orders . The new SWRCB regulations are based on a supplier 's actual water supply sources . EMWD has advocated for such an approach , as the approach supports its customers ' investments in a diverse water supply portfolio . <p> Under the revised regulations , EMWD anticipates it will be able to self-certify its new reduction target . It is anticipated that the relief will be significant . <p> On June 1 , 2016 , EMWD 's Board of Directors will review EMWD 's current drought stage and it is anticipated that the Board will take action on behalf of its customers to modify the drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our service area and California are still experiencing drought conditions and that conservation is still crucial toward ensuring long-term water supply management . Water waste restrictions will continue to be in effect and customers are encouraged to remain efficient with their water use . <p> April 7 , 2016 : The State Water Resources Board ( SWRCB ) lowered the water savings target for EMWD to 20 percent . <p> April 6 , 2016 : EMWD 's Board of Directors approved moving the District into Stage 4b of its Water Shortage Contingency Plan , effective immediately , based on improving statewide water supply conditions and pending adjustments to the conservation mandate imposed on EMWD by the SWRCB . Outdoor water budgets are now reduced by 30 percent compared to non-drought conditions ; they had previously been reduced by 70 percent in Stage 4c . <p> February 3 , 2016 : On February 2 , 2016 the State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ) extended the Emergency Drought regulations until October 2016 . In addition , the SWRCB approved adjustments could be made based on growth , climate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . EMWD is applying for the maximum adjustments possible . <p> Please check back often for additional updates . <p> January 27 , 2016 : On February 2 , 2016 , the SWRCB is likely to extend the Emergency Regulations and will consider proposed adjustments to the water savings targets based on the following categories : <p> If the SWRCB decides to allow for adjustments to water savings targets based on the categories above , EMWD will apply for the maximum credit possible . Please check back after February 2 , 2016 for updated information . <p> January 20 , 2016 : EMWD 's Board of Directors approved a change to the Administrative Code which prohibits all Commercial , Industrial and Institutional customers from irrigating non-functional ( decorative ) turf while EMWD is in Stage 4c of its Water Shortage Contingency Plan . <p> January 6 , 2016 : El Ni+o conditions and predictions in early January , combined with cooler temperatures and shorter days in winter , means outdoor watering could actually be unnecessary over the next few months . Plus , if customers stop watering outdoors this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water savings target ordered by the SWRCB . <p> As of January 1 , 2016 , EMWD had achieved a cumulative water savings of 19 percent toward the 28 percent water reduction goal set by the SWRCB . If EMWD customers can come closer to the 28 percent water savings target , we could avoid possible fines or other penalties from the SWRCB . <p> Therefore , EMWD 's Board of Directors voted to move into Stage 4c of the Water Shortage Contingency Plan . Stage 4c became immediately effective , and will be reflected on bills beginning February 1 , 2016 . <p> In Stage 4c , all outdoor water budgets are reduced 70 percent from what they would be under non-drought conditions . Outdoor water budgets were previously reduced by 30 percent in September 2015 , so Stage 4c reduces outdoor water budgets an additional 40 percent . <p> EMWD 's rate structure provides a direct financial incentive for customers to conserve and those who reduce use may see their bills go down . EMWD has also not placed drought surcharges on customers , as some neighboring agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial and Institutional customers to make further water use reductions , as we believe there is significant savings to be achieved by these larger landscape customers . <p> December 8 , 2015 : In the months of October and November , EMWD once again fell short of the State-mandated conservation target of 28 percent as compared to 2013 . We have not been able to achieve the target water savings since mandatory conservation reporting was implemented in June 2015 : <p> June 2015 - 15 percent reduction <p> July 2015 - 27 percent reduction <p> August 2015 - 18 percent reduction <p> September 2015 - 24 percent reduction <p> October 2015 - 17 percent reduction <p> November 2015 - 8 percent reduction <p> EMWD 's cumulative water savings is currently at 20 percent . <p> October 20 , 2015 : Through the first three weeks of October and projections for the remainder of the month , EMWD anticipates a roughly 15-percent reduction in water use compared to 2013 's baseline figures . EMWD has been instructed by the State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ) to reduce use by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , but increased temperatures in October " this year has averaged 10 degrees warmer than October 2013 " have led to a smaller reduction in water use . <p> Failure to meet the state-mandated reductions could result in fines of $10,000 per day . EMWD has been proactive in communicating with the SWRCB about its efforts to reduce usage in an effort to avoid a Conservation Order . <p> As a result , EMWD is asking customers to take extra steps to reduce water usage in the coming weeks in an effort to help bring EMWD closer to reaching its state-mandated reduction in water usage . <p> Customers can reduce water use by limiting outdoor irrigation , taking shorter showers and ensuring that they only do full loads of laundry and dishes . Because outdoor water budgets are significantly reduced in the fall , customers should reduce their irrigation schedules in order to remain within budget . <p> Customers are also encouraged to report any water waste " including run-off " by clicking here or calling EMWD 's Water Waste Hotline at 951-928-3777 , ext. 3306 , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available for all smart phone devices . <p> September 16 , 2015 : EMWD is currently in Stage 4b of its Water Shortage Contingency Plan ( WSCP ) . This reduces outdoor water budgets by 30 percent , which will be reflected on bills dated after September 30 , 2015 . <p> All customers are encouraged to stay within their new water budgets . Those customers who exceed their water budgets will be subjected to higher price points . Customers who remain within their new budget will see no increase in pricing on their monthly bills . <p> September 2 , 2015 : EMWD 's Board of Directors voted unanimously to move into Stage 4b of the District 's WSCP , which reduces outdoor water budgets by 30 percent . Stage 4b allows for reductions of up to 50 percent in outdoor ( Tier 2 ) water budgets as a response to California 's ongoing drought . <p> The changes will be effective no sooner than September 16 , 2015 . EMWD 's Board delegated to staff the determination on the effective date based on the outcome of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in outdoor water budgets is from the baseline figure for each individualized customer account . EMWD has been in Stage 4a " which includes a 10-percent reduction in outdoor budgets and an elimination of Tier 3 pricing " since June 1 , 2015 . Moving to Stage 4b is an additional 20-percent cut for a total of 30 percent . <p> All customers are encouraged to stay within their new water budgets . Those customers who exceed their water budgets will be subjected to higher price points . Customers who remain within their new budget will see no increase in pricing on their monthly bills . <p> August 13 , 2015 : While approximately 70 percent of our customers are now consistently using less than 50 percent of their outdoor water budgets , many customers are still falling short of the target . As a result , we received a notice of violation from the SWRCB with direction to take additional steps necessary to further reduce our customers ' water usage . <p> What could happen next ? In order to avoid penalties being imposed on our customers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4b drought status in September . This action will depend on additional water use reduction through the end of August . Moving to Stage 4b drought status would reduce customers ' outdoor water budgets up to 50 percent . <p> July 9 , 2015 : The County of Riverside adopted Ordinance No. 859.3 , an update of the Water Efficient Landscape Requirements . Adoption of this Ordinance will significantly reduce the amount of water usage by new development by imposing strict conservation standards on landscaping . <p> June 2015 : EMWD reduced water use by 15 percent in comparison to June 2013 . The SWRCB is using 2013 as the baseline to measure water savings . So we need to continue to save more water wherever and whenever possible ! <p> May 8 , 2015 : In response to the Governor 's Order , the SWRCB regulations , and the exceptional drought conditions , EMWD 's Board of Directors voted to move into Stage 4 of the Water Shortage Contingency Plan ( WSCP ) , effective immediately . <p> The Tier 3 ( Excessive ) water use category is eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water used above the amount provided for indoor and outdoor water use will be charged at the highest , Tier 4 ( Wasteful ) water use rate . <p> All outdoor water budgets are reduced by 10 percent as of June 1 , 2015 . <p> April 7 , 2015 : The SWRCB issued its draft enforcement regulations based solely on each agency 's reported gallons per day per person estimate from September 2014 and categorized EMWD as needing to reduce water use by 25 percent by February 2016 . Failure to meet that target could result in fines of up to $10,000 per day . <p> EMWD pointed out to the SWRCB that , among other things , their enforcement regulations did not provide credit to agencies who already achieved significant conservation prior to 2013 . In addition , the gallons per person , per day figures were not adjusted for climate differences or housing density variations within the state . EMWD also , in partnership with several other water agencies , delivered an alternate enforcement model to the SWRCB that considered climate , housing density , etc. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Governor issued an Executive Order to implement statewide mandatory water reductions for the first time in California 's history , tasking the SWRCB with enforcement of those reductions .

IT 'S FOR LIFE ! <p> Fall 2016 Drought Update <p> The Fall season officially begins on September 22 , 2016 , and we 'd like to provide a few reminders : <p> Please remember that cooler overnight temperatures mean water budgets are lower . So reduce your outdoor watering to make sure you stay within your water budget . All water used in excess of water budgets will be charged at the highest water use rate . <p> Please eliminate all water waste . <p> If customers maintain water budgets and eliminate water waste , EMWD expects to reduce overall water use by 20 percent as compared to 2013 . <p> Fall is the perfect time to plant water-wise landscapes .

EMWD had been in Stage 4b , the Mandatory Outdoor Reduction stage since April 2016 , which included a 30-percent cut in outdoor water budgets . <p> Stage 3c fully restores water budgets , but still prohibits runoff and water waste , in alignment with the Governor 's permanent restrictions on water waste and EMWD 's water waste prohibitions . All water used in excess of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . These on-going requirements for customers to avoid water waste are in recognition that four of the last five years have been exceptionally dry , and this year 's improvement in rainfall and snowpack was primarily concentrated in the northern portion of the state . <p> May 18 , 2016 : The State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ) significantly altered its regulatory framework regarding emergency water conservation measures , as put forth by the Governor through a series of Executive Orders . The new SWRCB regulations are based on a supplier 's actual water supply sources . EMWD has advocated for such an approach , as the approach supports its customers ' investments in a diverse water supply portfolio . <p> Under the revised regulations , EMWD anticipates it will be able to self-certify its new reduction target . It is anticipated that the relief will be significant . <p> On June 1 , 2016 , EMWD 's Board of Directors will review EMWD 's current drought stage and it is anticipated that the Board will take action on behalf of its customers to modify the drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our service area and California are still experiencing drought conditions and that conservation is still crucial toward ensuring long-term water supply management . Water waste restrictions will continue to be in effect and customers are encouraged to remain efficient with their water use . <p> April 7 , 2016 : The State Water Resources Board ( SWRCB ) lowered the water savings target for EMWD to 20 percent . <p> April 6 , 2016 : EMWD 's Board of Directors approved moving the District into Stage 4b of its Water Shortage Contingency Plan , effective immediately , based on improving statewide water supply conditions and pending adjustments to the conservation mandate imposed on EMWD by the SWRCB . Outdoor water budgets are now reduced by 30 percent compared to non-drought conditions ; they had previously been reduced by 70 percent in Stage 4c . <p> February 3 , 2016 : On February 2 , 2016 the State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ) extended the Emergency Drought regulations until October 2016 . In addition , the SWRCB approved adjustments could be made based on growth , climate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . EMWD is applying for the maximum adjustments possible . <p> Please check back often for additional updates . <p> January 27 , 2016 : On February 2 , 2016 , the SWRCB is likely to extend the Emergency Regulations and will consider proposed adjustments to the water savings targets based on the following categories : <p> If the SWRCB decides to allow for adjustments to water savings targets based on the categories above , EMWD will apply for the maximum credit possible . Please check back after February 2 , 2016 for updated information . <p> January 20 , 2016 : EMWD 's Board of Directors approved a change to the Administrative Code which prohibits all Commercial , Industrial and Institutional customers from irrigating non-functional ( decorative ) turf while EMWD is in Stage 4c of its Water Shortage Contingency Plan . <p> January 6 , 2016 : El Ni+o conditions and predictions in early January , combined with cooler temperatures and shorter days in winter , means outdoor watering could actually be unnecessary over the next few months . Plus , if customers stop watering outdoors this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water savings target ordered by the SWRCB . <p> As of January 1 , 2016 , EMWD had achieved a cumulative water savings of 19 percent toward the 28 percent water reduction goal set by the SWRCB . If EMWD customers can come closer to the 28 percent water savings target , we could avoid possible fines or other penalties from the SWRCB . <p> Therefore , EMWD 's Board of Directors voted to move into Stage 4c of the Water Shortage Contingency Plan . Stage 4c became immediately effective , and will be reflected on bills beginning February 1 , 2016 . <p> In Stage 4c , all outdoor water budgets are reduced 70 percent from what they would be under non-drought conditions . Outdoor water budgets were previously reduced by 30 percent in September 2015 , so Stage 4c reduces outdoor water budgets an additional 40 percent . <p> EMWD 's rate structure provides a direct financial incentive for customers to conserve and those who reduce use may see their bills go down . EMWD has also not placed drought surcharges on customers , as some neighboring agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial and Institutional customers to make further water use reductions , as we believe there is significant savings to be achieved by these larger landscape customers . <p> December 8 , 2015 : In the months of October and November , EMWD once again fell short of the State-mandated conservation target of 28 percent as compared to 2013 . We have not been able to achieve the target water savings since mandatory conservation reporting was implemented in June 2015 : <p> June 2015 - 15 percent reduction <p> July 2015 - 27 percent reduction <p> August 2015 - 18 percent reduction <p> September 2015 - 24 percent reduction <p> October 2015 - 17 percent reduction <p> November 2015 - 8 percent reduction <p> EMWD 's cumulative water savings is currently at 20 percent . <p> October 20 , 2015 : Through the first three weeks of October and projections for the remainder of the month , EMWD anticipates a roughly 15-percent reduction in water use compared to 2013 's baseline figures . EMWD has been instructed by the State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ) to reduce use by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , but increased temperatures in October " this year has averaged 10 degrees warmer than October 2013 " have led to a smaller reduction in water use . <p> Failure to meet the state-mandated reductions could result in fines of $10,000 per day . EMWD has been proactive in communicating with the SWRCB about its efforts to reduce usage in an effort to avoid a Conservation Order . <p> As a result , EMWD is asking customers to take extra steps to reduce water usage in the coming weeks in an effort to help bring EMWD closer to reaching its state-mandated reduction in water usage . <p> Customers can reduce water use by limiting outdoor irrigation , taking shorter showers and ensuring that they only do full loads of laundry and dishes . Because outdoor water budgets are significantly reduced in the fall , customers should reduce their irrigation schedules in order to remain within budget . <p> Customers are also encouraged to report any water waste " including run-off " by clicking here or calling EMWD 's Water Waste Hotline at 951-928-3777 , ext. 3306 , or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available for all smart phone devices . <p> September 16 , 2015 : EMWD is currently in Stage 4b of its Water Shortage Contingency Plan ( WSCP ) . This reduces outdoor water budgets by 30 percent , which will be reflected on bills dated after September 30 , 2015 . <p> All customers are encouraged to stay within their new water budgets . Those customers who exceed their water budgets will be subjected to higher price points . Customers who remain within their new budget will see no increase in pricing on their monthly bills . <p> September 2 , 2015 : EMWD 's Board of Directors voted unanimously to move into Stage 4b of the District 's WSCP , which reduces outdoor water budgets by 30 percent . Stage 4b allows for reductions of up to 50 percent in outdoor ( Tier 2 ) water budgets as a response to California 's ongoing drought . <p> The changes will be effective no sooner than September 16 , 2015 . EMWD 's Board delegated to staff the determination on the effective date based on the outcome of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in outdoor water budgets is from the baseline figure for each individualized customer account . EMWD has been in Stage 4a " which includes a 10-percent reduction in outdoor budgets and an elimination of Tier 3 pricing " since June 1 , 2015 . Moving to Stage 4b is an additional 20-percent cut for a total of 30 percent . <p> All customers are encouraged to stay within their new water budgets . Those customers who exceed their water budgets will be subjected to higher price points . Customers who remain within their new budget will see no increase in pricing on their monthly bills . <p> August 13 , 2015 : While approximately 70 percent of our customers are now consistently using less than 50 percent of their outdoor water budgets , many customers are still falling short of the target . As a result , we received a notice of violation from the SWRCB with direction to take additional steps necessary to further reduce our customers ' water usage . <p> What could happen next ? In order to avoid penalties being imposed on our customers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4b drought status in September . This action will depend on additional water use reduction through the end of August . Moving to Stage 4b drought status would reduce customers ' outdoor water budgets up to 50 percent . <p> July 9 , 2015 : The County of Riverside adopted Ordinance No. 859.3 , an update of the Water Efficient Landscape Requirements . Adoption of this Ordinance will significantly reduce the amount of water usage by new development by imposing strict conservation standards on landscaping . <p> June 2015 : EMWD reduced water use by 15 percent in comparison to June 2013 . The SWRCB is using 2013 as the baseline to measure water savings . So we need to continue to save more water wherever and whenever possible ! <p> May 8 , 2015 : In response to the Governor 's Order , the SWRCB regulations , and the exceptional drought conditions , EMWD 's Board of Directors voted to move into Stage 4 of the Water Shortage Contingency Plan ( WSCP ) , effective immediately . <p> The Tier 3 ( Excessive ) water use category is eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water used above the amount provided for indoor and outdoor water use will be charged at the highest , Tier 4 ( Wasteful ) water use rate . <p> All outdoor water budgets are reduced by 10 percent as of June 1 , 2015 . <p> April 7 , 2015 : The SWRCB issued its draft enforcement regulations based solely on each agency 's reported gallons per day per person estimate from September 2014 and categorized EMWD as needing to reduce water use by 25 percent by February 2016 . Failure to meet that target could result in fines of up to $10,000 per day . <p> EMWD pointed out to the SWRCB that , among other things , their enforcement regulations did not provide credit to agencies who already achieved significant conservation prior to 2013 . In addition , the gallons per person , per day figures were not adjusted for climate differences or housing density variations within the state . EMWD also , in partnership with several other water agencies , delivered an alternate enforcement model to the SWRCB that considered climate , housing density , etc. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Governor issued an Executive Order to implement statewide mandatory water reductions for the first time in California 's history , tasking the SWRCB with enforcement of those reductions .

@@118040853 @7040853/ <h> Wetlands Research and Findings <p> Research has been conducted by the US Bureau of Reclamation , the National Biologic Service , the US Geologic Survey - Biological Resources Division and Water Resources Division , the University of California - Riverside and Davis , the University of Colorado , Boulder , and California State Polytechnic University - Pomona . Research topics at the wetlands include : <p> Water/soil quality and chemistry <p> Modeling and hydrodynamics <p> Mosquitoes , flies , and vector control <p> Vegetation and vegetation management <p> Birds and wildlife <p> Weather monitoring <p> Major Findings <p> Bird and Wildlife Studies demonstrate the success and value of recycled water for use in habitat development and environmental enhancement ; contribute to public acceptance of recycled water ; and promote the use of recycled water over potable water for " green " uses . Nearly 120 species of birds have visited and utilized the H/SJ wetlands . <p> Tricolored Blackbirds In 1994 , the world population of tricolored blackbirds totaled 370,000 and by 1997 it had been reduced to 240,000 , primarily due to loss of habitat . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While conducting a census for US Fish &amp; Wildlife , for the purpose of possibly listing the tricolored blackbird , it was discovered that approximately one tenth of the entire world population of these birds was at the H/SJ Multipurpose Constructed Wetlands and that these wetlands were ideal habitat for this species . As a result , listing was not recommended and the H/SJ wetlands is serving as a model of habitat creation for the tricolored blackbird . <p> Diptera Populations ( Flies , Midges , and Mosquitoes ) The vegetation management practices were not detrimental to any of the taxa examined ; chironomid midges benefited from the addition of hummocks , the secondary effluent supports a diverse dipteran community ; the shoe fly community ( 28 species ) is comparable to the species richness of natural marshes ; and the design of wetlands supporting more ecotonal areas ( i.e. , mud flats and other semi-aquatic areas ) will promote further production of insects important to ecosystem establishment and function . <p> Use of Native Fish for Mosquito Control Using fish for mosquito control is effective , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event proactive control measures are required during unusual outbreaks . Gambusia ( mosquito fish ) were hardier and more successful than the stickleback ( native fish species . ) Screens to prevent fish from entering the distribution system may need to be installed . <p> Effectiveness of Mosquito Abatement Measures Use of bacterial larvicides against mosquitoes at the wetlands , as well as review of other studies , suggest that some degree of mosquito control was provided . However , future control programs must incorporate application strategies that reduce the likelihood of evolved resistance to the mosquitocidal toxins . <p> Influence of Three Vegetation Management Practices on Mosquito Populations in Constructed Treatment Wetlands The hummocks showed considerable promise as a method for slowing proliferation of bulrush growth and significantly reducing mosquito production during the two years after vegetation management practices were carried out . Mosquito production increased concomitantly with vegetation growth during year two . By year two , populations of potential predators of larval mosquitoes were most abundant in the open water , particularly the deep ponds . Even though larval abundance and adult production per square meter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during 1999 , the hummock cells maintained comparatively more open water than did the other treatments and produced fewer mosquitoes . Larvivorous fish were not added to the cells in this study , but would be expected to reduce mosquito populations in the comparatively open hummock cells to an extent greater than was observed in the fishless wetlands during 1999 . <p> Modeling Wetland Nutrient Dynamics The resulting program simulates the water quality in surface flow wetlands . The input can be created in files and read by the program and some of the input can be changed or entered by the user during the run . The main output of the program included concentrations of algae , organic nitrogen , ammonia nitrogen , nitrate nitrogen , organic phosphorus , dissolved phosphorus , carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand , and oxygen . In addition to water quality , water evaporation and evapotranspiration are calculated . <p> Effects of vegetation management strategies on vegetation establishment and water quality in the Hemet research cells A habitat-driven approach to constructed wastewater treatment wetlands design is the basis for this study to determine whether habitat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the end of the 1998 growing season , there were marked differences in the vegetation regrowth and the wildlife use within the vegetated portions of the cells . During the same time , ammonia-nitrogen removal was more than 60% across the cells . The following year as the vegetation became increasingly more dense , the removal efficiencies declined and the mosquito populations increased . The cells that restricted vegetation coverage to 58% of the shallow areas ( those with hummocks ) consistently maintained higher removal efficiencies than the controls ( with 95% vegetation coverage of shallow areas ) and the mechanically thinned cells ( with 93% vegetation coverage of shallow areas ) . These data confirmed the hypothesis that many of the same design features that enhance habitat quality also improve water treatment functions . <p> Fate and Transport of Indicator Microorganisms in a Constructed Wetland One objective of the study was to determine the removal efficiency of coliphage within a constructed wetland . MS2 coliphage removal from wetland inlets to outlets averaged 97.1% . <p> Nitrogen Removal Analysis by EMWD showed total inorganic nitrogen removal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single-phase cells . <p> Investigation of nitrogen transformations in a southern California constructed wastewater treatment wetland During May 1996 , the relatively low external loading , the 36% open water surface area , and only a moderate coverage of vegetation biomass allowed for a wide range of potential nitrogen transformations . The potential transformations included : 1 ) nitrification and the possibility of subsequent denitrification ; 2 ) biomass assimilation into both algae and the emergent vegetation ; 3 ) sedimentation of vegetation and algal biomass releasing organic nitrogen ; and 4 ) ammonification of the organic nitrogen and anoxic areas . During September 1997 , the combination of heavy external loading of the un-nitrified , anoxic RWRF effluent , plus the abundant mature plant material , resulted in a limitation of nitrogen transformations . The abundant vegetation created less open water areas and a build-up of senescent material causing internal organic matter loading and subsequent release of ammonia . This loading combination limited the potential nitrogen transformations to include only : <p> rapid denitrification of any incoming NO2-N and NO3-N ; <p> biomass assimilation of NH4-N ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Algal biomass assimilation and sedimentation were probably the main mechanisms for nitrogen removal . <p> Transformation of Dissolved Organic Matter ( DOM ) The purpose of the study was to develop a better understanding of the nature and transformation dynamics of DOM in treatment wetlands . Many factors , including operating conditions and climate , play a role in transformation . In the climates such as that found in the Hemet/San Jacinto area , evapotranspiration and water loss result in an increase of DOM . Further research is necessary to understand the relation between DOM transformation in treatment wetlands and wetland operational conditions . Data does not give an indication whether wetlands reduce THM precursors . <p> Demo Wetlands Toxicity Characterization Tests showed toxicity at the wetlands inlets to all species tested ; no toxicity to any organism exposed in the outlets . <p> Amoxicillin in Waste Water Man and animals contribute antibiotics into the water stream leading to eco-system disruption and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria . This study attempted to trace amoxicillin in wastewater . Concentration levels were found to be in parts per billion or less ; concentration methods need to be devised .

However , there are a number of things you can do to have an attractive water-efficient landscape that should pass inspection . <p> Please check out our Use Water Wisely section for more information on landscape design , plants , irrigation practices , and devices as well as rebates for smart controllers , spray nozzles , and more . Or request a free indoor/outdoor residential water survey to identify water saving options . <p> Important ! The Governor signed AB 2100 into law on July 21 , 2014 .

When water flows onto the sidewalk or curb after the sprinklers turn off , but then stops after a few minutes , is due to a phenomena called " low head drainage " . This occurs when the sprinkler system is installed on a sloped area . The slope does not need to be very high , a change of elevation of less than a foot will often create low head drainage . After the sprinklers are turned off , the water in the pipes drains out through the lowest sprinkler heads and is replaced with air . Obviously the water that drains out of the pipes is wasted . The spewing and spitting of air every time you turn on the sprinklers also puts a lot of stress on the pipe and sprinklers . <p> To fix low head drainage you need to have special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check valves prevent the water from draining out of the pipes through the lowest sprinklers . In most cases these check valves are built into the sprinkler head . This check-valve option is available on all major brands of sprinklers . The anti-drain check-valve closes and holds the water in the pipes when the sprinkler system is off . These built-in check-valves do n't cause any drop in performance of the sprinklers , so they do n't have any impact on your sprinkler system design . Most pros simply buy a new head with the check valve feature and replace the old sprinkler with the new one . You can also buy separate check valves that can be installed on the pipe under existing sprinkler heads . Where do you buy sprinklers with check valves or retrofit check valve ? Check valves and sprinklers with built-in check valves are often not available at discount stores or big box hardware stores . You will probably need to get them from a local irrigation specialty store or online . <h> I have a slope , how do I avoid runoff ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot part of the season . This is primarily due to water running off the lawn before it has a chance to saturate . Deep saturation is a key to a healthy lawn . Water that runs off or just barely breaks the surface , does the lawn very little good . So how do you give a lawn on a slope better saturation ? <p> Use the Cycle &amp; Soak Method : Split the water cycle duration into two or three short cycles . If your water cycle is 10 minutes , you might split the cycle into three , 3 minute cycles . To determine the exact amount of time needed , turn on the lawn sprinkler and watch for how long it takes for runoff to begin . This is how long each cycle should run . So on watering days , you 'll run the system for the specified amount of time , let it soak for a few hours , then repeat this for the number of times needed . <p> Landscaping and plants on a hillside will also benefit from this cycle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with good soil that absorbs water easily . Also , dams and water wells should be built on the downhill side of the plant . This will help give the water time to soak straight down to the root zone before it runs off . <h> What is considered runoff ? <p> The result of water runoff may occur from a soggy lawn , runoff of water into streets , and/or obvious signs of systematic water waste . <h> Are we able to report a neighbor who is wasting water ? <p> Yes , the following information would be required : exact street address of where the water waste is occurring , a photo ( if possible ) , your name and phone number .

@@118040902 @7040902/ <h> About California Water Rights <p> In California , water rights involve the right to use water , not the right to own water . While the Water Code implies the existence of groundwater rights , their doctrinal bases and characteristics are essentially the product of the decisions of the courts . There is no comprehensive law in California that determines the right to groundwater . If disputes arise , the courts decide priorities in individual cases considering types of water rights and judicial decisions that have set precedent . <p> Types of Groundwater Rights <p> Overlying Rights - All property owners above a common aquifer possess a mutual right to the reasonable and beneficial use of a groundwater resource on land overlying the aquifer from which the water is taken . Overlying rights are correlative ( related to each other ) and overlying users of a common water source must share the resource on a pro rata basis in times of shortage . A proper overlying use takes precedence over all non-overlying uses . <p> Appropriative Rights - Non-overlying uses and public uses , such as municipal uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " first in time , first in right " priority system applies . Appropriative users are entitled to use the surplus water available after the overlying user 's rights are satisfied . <p> Prescriptive Rights - Prescriptive rights are gained by trespass or unauthorized taking that can yield a title because it was allowed to continue longer than the five year statute of limitations . Prescriptive rights can only be obtained against private entities . Claim of a prescriptive water right to non-surplus water by an appropriator must be supported by many specific conditions which include a showing that the pumping was actual , open and notorious , hostile , adverse to the overlying user , continuous and uninterrupted for five years , and under a claim of right . <p> Other Types of Water Rights <p> Pueblo Right - A water right possessed by a municipality which , as a successor of a Spanish or Mexican pueblo , is entitled to the beneficial use of all needed , naturally-occurring surface and groundwater of the original pueblo watershed . Water use under a pueblo right must occur within the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the city . <p> Riparian - Pertaining to the bank of a river , or any area where water naturally touches land . Riparian Rights are a matter of land ownership . To possess a riparian right it is necessary to own property which physically touches a river , stream , pond , lake or well-defined underground channel . Riparian rights refer to surface water , not groundwater . Riparian rights are lost if the land is severed from the water source so it is no longer contiguous .

@@118040914 @7040914/ <h> About California Water Rights <p> In California , water rights involve the right to use water , not the right to own water . While the Water Code implies the existence of groundwater rights , their doctrinal bases and characteristics are essentially the product of the decisions of the courts . There is no comprehensive law in California that determines the right to groundwater . If disputes arise , the courts decide priorities in individual cases considering types of water rights and judicial decisions that have set precedent . <p> Types of Groundwater Rights <p> Overlying Rights - All property owners above a common aquifer possess a mutual right to the reasonable and beneficial use of a groundwater resource on land overlying the aquifer from which the water is taken . Overlying rights are correlative ( related to each other ) and overlying users of a common water source must share the resource on a pro rata basis in times of shortage . A proper overlying use takes precedence over all non-overlying uses . <p> Appropriative Rights - Non-overlying uses and public uses , such as municipal uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " first in time , first in right " priority system applies . Appropriative users are entitled to use the surplus water available after the overlying user 's rights are satisfied . <p> Prescriptive Rights - Prescriptive rights are gained by trespass or unauthorized taking that can yield a title because it was allowed to continue longer than the five year statute of limitations . Prescriptive rights can only be obtained against private entities . Claim of a prescriptive water right to non-surplus water by an appropriator must be supported by many specific conditions which include a showing that the pumping was actual , open and notorious , hostile , adverse to the overlying user , continuous and uninterrupted for five years , and under a claim of right . <p> Other Types of Water Rights <p> Pueblo Right - A water right possessed by a municipality which , as a successor of a Spanish or Mexican pueblo , is entitled to the beneficial use of all needed , naturally-occurring surface and groundwater of the original pueblo watershed . Water use under a pueblo right must occur within the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the city . <p> Riparian - Pertaining to the bank of a river , or any area where water naturally touches land . Riparian Rights are a matter of land ownership . To possess a riparian right it is necessary to own property which physically touches a river , stream , pond , lake or well-defined underground channel . Riparian rights refer to surface water , not groundwater . Riparian rights are lost if the land is severed from the water source so it is no longer contiguous .

@@118040969 @7040969/ <h> What is EMWD doing to reduce levels of perchlorate in the local water supply ? <p> EMWD strives to remain an industry leader in environmental consciousness by using blending treatment techniques that result in water that complies with all environmental , health and safety regulations . <p> EMWD is closely monitoring the blended water from affected well systems to ensure that perchlorate is not entering the water system above the current MCL of 6 ppb . <p> EMWD 's desalter wells are treated by reverse osmosis to less than 4 ppb . <h> Is there perchlorate contamination in the EMWD service area ? <p> Eastern Municipal Water District has some water wells that contain perchlorate . Three of these wells are blended with State Project water from the Mills Filtration Plant until the perchlorate level is below the detection limit of 4 ppb . All blending is done at each of the well sites and before the first customer service . At no time has EMWD served undiluted well water containing perchlorate to customers . <p> SOURCE <p> AVERAGE RANGE ( parts per billion ) <p> AFTER BLENDING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 <p> 5.2 - 7.0 <p> &lt; 4 <p> WELL 49 <p> 11 - 12 <p> &lt; 4 <p> WELL 57 <p> &lt;4 - 4.3 <p> &lt; 4 <p> These wells represent approximately 1.7 % of the total water served by Eastern Municipal Water District . <h> What is the State of California doing to remedy this problem ? <p> California Department of Public Health has adopted an MCL and public health goal of 6 ppb for drinking water . A well that exceeds the current perchlorate MCL ( 6 ppb ) can be treated by blending to dilute down to legal levels . <h> What are the sources of perchlorate contamination ? <p> The Colorado River has been a main source of perchlorate contamination in Southern California . This is a serious problem since roughly a third of Southern California 's drinking water comes from the Colorado River . Experts point to a former ammonium perchlorate manufacturing facility in Nevada as the origin of the contamination . <p> Most of the perchlorate contamination appears to be the result of past activities in the aerospace industry . Kerr-McGee Chemical LLC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perchlorate and began a clean-up effort in 1999 . Clean up efforts have significantly reduced the amount of perchlorate that enters the Colorado River . <p> The perchlorate detected in the EMWD wells is coming from the groundwater basins . The source of contamination has not been determined . Potential sources include Colorado River Water as it has been used in the valley for many years or use of fertilizers containing perchlorate as the area is primarily agricultural . <h> How does perchlorate impact public health ? <p> The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ( OEHHA ) links perchlorate consumption to impairing thyroid function . At some level , EPA advises perchlorate interferes with the ability of the thyroid to utilize iodine to produce thyroid hormones . It is important to note that perchlorate was used as a medicine for years to tame hyperactive thyroids . <p> The California Department of Public Health ( CDPH ) does not believe any health effects would result from a perchlorate level of 6 parts per billion ( ppb ) . OEHHA has set California 's current perchlorate Public Health Goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion is roughly equivalent to one drop of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool . <p> CDPH has set the Maximum Contaminant Level ( MCL ) for perchlorate at 6 ppb to be in line with OEHHA 's PHG . <h> When was perchlorate contamination discovered in California ? <p> Perchlorate water contamination first gained statewide attention as a drinking-water concern in 1985 after the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) detected perchlorate in wells servicing households in the San Gabriel Valley ( Aerojet 's original facility , near Los Angeles ) . <p> Since then , perchlorate has been found throughout Northern and Southern California . <h> What is perchlorate ? <p> Perchlorate is a salt used in rocket fuel , munitions , fireworks and explosives . It is also a component of air bag inflators , an additive in lubricating oils , tanning and finishing leather , fabrics and dyes , electroplating , aluminum refining , fertilizers and in production of paints and enamels . <p> Perchlorate helped build Cold War-era weapons .
