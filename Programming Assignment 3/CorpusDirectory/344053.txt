Alcohol arises naturally from carbohydrates when certain micro-organisms metabolize them in the absence of oxygen , called fermentation . <p> Beer , wine and other liquor contain different amounts of alcohol . The amount of alcohol in distilled liquor is known as ? proof ? . Proof refers to the amount of alcohol in the liquor ; for example , 100 proof liquor contains 50% alcohol , 40 proof liquor contains 20% alcohol , and so on . Traditional wine has approximately 8-14% alcohol , while regular beer has 4-6% alcohol . <p> Recent studies show that moderate use of alcohol may have a beneficial effect on the coronary system . In general , for healthy people , one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men would be considered the maximum amount of alcohol consumption to be considered moderate use . ( By ? healthy ? people , we are referring to non-pregnant women , individuals not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among others ) . However , the amount of alcohol that a person can drink safely is highly individual , depending on genetics , age , sex , weight and family history , etc . A ? drink ? is considered to be : <p> Alcohol is metabolized extremely quickly by the body . Unlike foods , which require time for digestion , alcohol needs no digestion and is quickly absorbed . Alcohol gets ? VIP ? treatment in the body ? absorbing and metabolizing before most other nutrients . About 20 percent is absorbed directly across the walls of an empty stomach and can reach the brain within one minute . <p> Once alcohol reaches the stomach , it begins to break down with the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme . This process reduces the amount of alcohol entering the blood by approximately 20% . ( Women produce less of this enzyme , which may help to partially explain why women become more intoxicated on less alcohol than men . ) . In addition , about 10% of the alcohol is expelled in the breath and urine . <p> Alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intestine . The alcohol-laden blood then travels to the liver via the veins and capillaries of the digestive tract , which affects nearly every liver cell . The liver cells are the only cells in our body that can produce enough of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize alcohol at an appreciable rate . <p> Though alcohol affects every organ of the body , it ? s most dramatic impact is upon the liver . The liver cells normally prefer fatty acids as fuel , and package excess fatty acids as triglycerides , which they then route to other tissues of the body . However , when alcohol is present , the liver cells are forced to first metabolize the alcohol , letting the fatty acids accumulate , sometimes in huge amounts . Alcohol metabolism permanently changes liver cell structure , which impairs the liver ? s ability to metabolize fats . This explains why heavy drinkers tend to develop fatty livers . <p> The liver is able to metabolize about + ounce of ethanol per hour ( approximately one drink , depending on a person ? s body size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol arrives in the liver than the enzymes can handle , the excess alcohol travels to all parts of the body , circulating until the liver enzymes are finally able to process it . ( Which is another good reason not to consume more than one drink per hour . ) . <p> How the Liver Breaks Down Alcohol <p> The alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme breaks down alcohol by removing hydrogen in two steps : <p> 1 . Alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes alcohol to acetaldehyde <p> 2 . Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizes the acetaldehyde to acetyl CoA . These reactions produce hydrogen ions ( acid ) . The B vitamin niacin ( in its role as the coenzyme NAD ) picks up these hydrogen ions ( becoming NADH ) . Thus when alcohol is metabolized , NAD diminishes and NADH increases . <p> During alcohol metabolism , NAD becomes unavailable for the many other vital body processes for which it is needed , including glycolysis , the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain . Without NAD , the energy pathway is blocked , and alternative routes are taken , with serious physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle , resulting in a build up of pyruvate and acetyl CoA . Excess acetyl CoA results in fatty acid synthesis and fat begins to clog the liver . ( An accumulation of fat in the liver can be observed after only a single night of heavy drinking ) . <p> Fatty Liver and Liver Disease <p> With moderate drinking , the liver can process alcohol fairly safely . However , heavy drinking overtaxes the liver resulting in serious consequences . A liver clogged with fat causes liver cells to become less efficient at performing their necessary tasks , resulting in impairment of a person ? s nutritional health . Fatty liver is the first stage of liver deterioration in heavy drinkers , and interferes with the distribution of oxygen and nutrients to the liver ? s cells . If the condition persists long enough , the liver cells will die , forming fibrous scar tissue ( the second stage of liver deterioration , or fibrosis ) . Some liver cells can regenerate with good nutrition and abstinence , however in the last stage of deterioration , or cirrhosis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alcohol and Malnutrition <p> For moderate drinkers , alcohol does not suppress food intake , and may actually increase appetite . Chronic alcohol consumption appears to have the opposite effect . Alcohol causes euphoria , which depresses appetite , so that heavy drinkers tend to eat poorly and become malnourished . <p> Alcohol is very rich in energy , packing 7 calories per gram . But like pure sugar or fat , the calories are void of nutrients . The more calories an individual consumes in alcohol , the less likely it is that they will eat enough food to obtain adequate nutrients . To make matters worse , chronic alcohol abuse not only displaces calories from needed nutrients , but also interferes with the body ? s metabolism of nutrients , leading to damage of the liver , digestive system , and nearly every bodily organ . <p> Health Effects of Alcohol Consumption <p> Arthritis <p> Increases risk of gouty arthritis <p> Cancer <p> Increases the risk of cancer in the liver , pancreas , rectum , breast , mouth , pharynx , larynx and esophagus <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fetus <p> Heart Disease <p> Raises blood pressure , blood lipids and the risk of stroke and heart disease in heavy drinkers .

If you do choose to drink , sip each drink slowly , and always consume alcohol with food . Spaces drinks out to no more than one drink per hour , and consume plenty of water in between drinks .

@@58366984 @7366984/ <p> What are free radicals ? Why are they damaging to the human body ? And how does vitamin E and the other antioxidant nutrients help protect the body against free radical damage ? We ? ll attempt to answer these questions and help you understand why eating 5-8 servings per day of anti-oxidant rich fruits and vegetables can benefit your health . But first , a little background ? <h> Background : A Brief Look at Chemical Bonding <p> To understand the way that free radicals and antioxidants interact , you must first understand a bit about cells and molecules . So here 's a ( very ) brief refresher course in Physiology/Chemistry 101 : The human body is composed of many different types of cells . Cells are composed of many different types of molecules . Molecules consist of one or more atoms of one or more elements joined by chemical bonds . <p> As you probably remember from your old high school days , atoms consist of a nucleus , neutrons , protons and electrons . The number of protons ( positively charged particles ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( negatively charged particles ) surrounding the atom . Electrons are involved in chemical reactions and are the substance that bonds atoms together to form molecules . Electrons surround , or " orbit " an atom in one or more shells . The innermost shell is full when it has two electrons . When the first shell is full , electrons begin to fill the second shell . When the second shell has eight electrons , it is full , and so on . <p> The most important structural feature of an atom for determining its chemical behavior is the number of electrons in its outer shell . A substance that has a full outer shell tends not to enter in chemical reactions ( an inert substance ) . Because atoms seek to reach a state of maximum stability , an atom will try to fill it ? s outer shell by : <p> Gaining or losing electrons to either fill or empty its outer shell <p> Sharing its electrons by bonding together with other atoms in order to complete its outer shell <p> Atoms often complete their outer shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the atoms are bound together and satisfy the conditions of maximum stability for the molecule . <h> How Free Radicals are Formed <p> Normally , bonds don ? t split in a way that leaves a molecule with an odd , unpaired electron . But when weak bonds split , free radicals are formed . Free radicals are very unstable and react quickly with other compounds , trying to capture the needed electron to gain stability . Generally , free radicals attack the nearest stable molecule , " stealing " its electron . When the " attacked " molecule loses its electron , it becomes a free radical itself , beginning a chain reaction . Once the process is started , it can cascade , finally resulting in the disruption of a living cell . <p> Some free radicals arise normally during metabolism . Sometimes the body ? s immune system ? s cells purposefully create them to neutralize viruses and bacteria . However , environmental factors such as pollution , radiation , cigarette smoke and herbicides can also spawn free radicals . <p> Normally , the body can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if the free-radical production becomes excessive , damage can occur . Of particular importance is that free radical damage accumulates with age . <h> How Antioxidants May Prevent Against Free Radical Damage <p> The vitamins C and E , are thought to protect the body against the destructive effects of free radicals . Antioxidants neutralize free radicals by donating one of their own electrons , ending the electron- " stealing " reaction . The antioxidant nutrients themselves don ? t become free radicals by donating an electron because they are stable in either form They act as scavengers , helping to prevent cell and tissue damage that could lead to cellular damage and disease . <p> Vitamin E ? The most abundant fat-soluble antioxidant in the body . One of the most efficient chain-breaking antioxidants available . Primary defender against oxidation . Primary defender against lipid peroxidation ( creation of unstable molecules containing more oxygen than is usual ) . <h> The Antioxidants and Disease Prevention <p> Cancer ? Many studies have correlated high vitamin C intakes with low rates of cancer , particularly cancers of the mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fruits and Vegetables ! <p> The antioxidants are believed to help protect the body from free-radical damage . But before you go out and stock your pantry with mega-doses of these vitamins , be warned : more is not always better . The long-term effect of large doses of these nutrients has not been proven . Other chemicals and substances found in natural sources of antioxidants may also be responsible for the beneficial effects . So for now , the best way to ensure adequate intake of the antioxidant nutrients is through a balanced diet consisting of 5-8 servings of fruits and vegetables per day .

Triglycerides provide us with energy , insulates , cushions and protects internal organs and helps our bodies use carbohydrates and proteins more efficiently . Triglycerides can be further divided into the following categories : <p> Saturated fats - Usually solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydrogen atoms ( saturated with hydrogen ) . Saturated fats are considered the most detrimental to health . <p> Hydrogenated fats - This fat results from a process where hydrogen atoms are added back to polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats to protect against rancidity . This procedure effectively causes hydrogenated fats to become saturated fats . Thus , if a food lists partially hydrogenated oils among its first three ingredients , it usually contains alot of trans-fatty acids and saturated fats . <p> Essential fatty acids - Essential fatty acids must be supplied by the diet . The body uses essential fatty acids to maintain the structural parts of cell membranes . They are also used as a component in the production of hormone-like substances ( eicosanoids ) that help regulate blood pressure , clot formation , and maintain the immune response . <p> Linoleic Acid - The Omega-6 family . Common sources for these essential fatty acids are vegetable oils and meats . Most individuals can ensure an adequate intake of Omega-6 fatty acids by including grains , seeds , leafy vegetables , and small amounts of vegetable oils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Omega-3 family . Linolenic acid is a major component of the communicating membranes of the brain , and is active in the eye 's retina . It is essential for growth and development . Fish , in particular , is abundant in both Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids . <p> Phospholipids - ( eg. lecithin ) Phospholipids help transport fat-soluble vitamins , hormones and other substances through cell membranes . Because they can dissolve in both water and fat , they act as an emulsifier , helping to keep fats suspended in body fluids and blood . The liver can produce all the body 's phospholipids from scratch , therefore it is not an essential nutrient . <p> Sterols - Sterols include cholesterol , vitamin D and sex hormones . The are a component of bile , sex hormones ( testosterone ) , adrenal hormones ( cortisol ) and are a structural component of cell membranes . 9/10 of the body 's cholesterol is stored in cells . <p> Cholesterol - The liver manufacturers about 800-1500 mg. of cholesterol per day , which contributes much more to total body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol from carbohydrates , proteins or fat . Only animal foods contain cholesterol . Excess cholesterol harms the body when it forms deposits on artery walls , leading to atherosclerosis and heart disease . Cholesterol can be further divided into HDLs and LDLs : <p> Low-Density Lipoproteins ( LDL ) - Considered " bad " cholesterol . It is produced in the liver and circulates through the body , transporting fat to the muscles , heart , fat stores and other tissues . <p> High-Density Lipoproteins ( HDL ) - Considered " good " cholesterol . It is produced by the liver to carry cholesterol and phospholipids from the cells back to the liver for recycling and/or excretion . Because HDLs represent cholesterol removal from arteries and blood to the liver for breakdown and disposal , it is considered " good " cholesterol . Therefore , high levels of HDL cholesterol is considered a negative risk factor for heart disease . <h> Approximate Cholesterol Amounts in Foods : <p> Food <p> mg/chol <p> Grains , vegetables , fruits <p> 0 <p> Whole Milk , 1 cup <p> 30-35 <p> Nonfat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounce <p> 25-30 <p> Butter , 1 tablespoon <p> 10 <p> Beef , chicken , or pork , 3 ounces <p> 70-85 <p> Liver , 3 ounces <p> 410 <p> Egg yolk <p> 213 <p> Egg white <p> 0 <p> Shrimp , 3 ounces <p> 165 <p> Fish , lobster , clams , 3 ounces <p> 50-60 <p> The table above shows the approximate amounts of cholesterol that can be found in common foods . <p> Note that current research indicates that food cholesterol does not appear to increase blood cholesterol as dramatically as does saturated fats .

@@58367002 @7367002/ <p> Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose and either insufficient or ineffective insulin. 5.9% of the population in the United States has diabetes , and diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in our country . Diabetes is a chronic disease without a cure , however , with proper management and treatment , diabetics can live a normal , healthy lives . <h> Insulin <p> Insulin is a hormone secreted by specialized cells in the pancreas in response to ( among other things ) , increased blood glucose concentration . The primary role of insulin is to control the transport of glucose from the bloodstream into the cells . After consuming a meal , insulin enhances the uptake of the energy nutrients ( amino acids , glucose , and fatty acids ) . Insulin helps maintain blood glucose within normal limits and stimulates protein synthesis , glucose synthesis in the liver and muscle , and fat synthesis . <p> Without insulin , or when insulin is ineffective , glucose regulation falters and the metabolism of energy-yielding nutrients changes . In diabetes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glucose builds in the blood instead of going into the cells , it can cause two problems : <p> Insulin-dependant is caused by damage to the pancreas . The pancreas contains beta cells , which make insulin . With Type I diabetes , the deficiency of insulin is due to a decline in the number of beta cells the pancreas contains . It appears that certain genes make Type I diabetics more susceptible , but a triggering factor ( usually a viral infection ) sets it off . In most people with Type I diabetes , the immune system makes a mistake , attacking the beta cells and causing them to die . Without the beta cells , you can not produce insulin . Glucose then builds up in the blood and causes diabetes . <p> Type I diabetes exhibits the following warning signs : <p> Losing weight without trying <p> An increased need to urinate <p> Increased hunger <p> Increased thirst <p> Trouble seeing <p> Feeling tired and/or <p> Going into a coma <p> For Type I diabetics , treatment usually consists of a healthy diet , exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer produces . Most insulin-dependent diabetics test their blood at least four times per day to monitor their blood ? s glucose level . This is necessary to keep their blood glucose within certain limits . If blood glucose is not monitored , and if insulin levels are not kept in check , three things may happen : <p> 1 . Ketoacidosis ? occurs when your blood glucose levels are highly elevated , by either eating too much or taking too little insulin , by stress or illness . In this case , there is too little insulin in the blood . Your body then begins breaking down fat for energy , producing chemicals called ketones . Ketones can make you throw up , have difficulty breathing , cause excessive thirst , cause dry , itchy skin , or even cause coma . <p> 2 . Hypoglycemia ? occurs when blood glucose levels become too low . It can be cause by taking too much insulin , eating too little , skipping meals , eating at the wrong time , exercising too intensely or for too long , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood glucose is too low you may feel hungry , confused , tired , shaky or nervous . <p> 3 . Complications ? elevated glucose levels in the blood over time can hurt your organs . Diabetes can damage kidneys , eyes and nerves , and makes heart and blood vessel disease more likely . Diabetics can defend themselves from complications by keeping their glucose levels under control . <p> Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes , with about 90% of diabetes falling into the Type II category . With Type II diabetes , glucose builds up in the blood ? not because not enough insulin is present , but probably because cells lose their insulin receptors and become less sensitive to insulin . Type II diabetes usually ( though not always ) occurs in individuals who are over 40 years of age who are overweight . <p> Type II diabetes produces mild symptoms , and can be controlled with a healthy diet , exercise and weight loss . Type II diabetics should also monitor their glucose levels to be sure they are maintaining healthy levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise are not enough to control the glucose levels .

High blood sugar can cause you to have a headache , blurry vision , excessive thirst and an increased need to urinate , and cause dry , itchy skin . Though less of a problem with Type II diabetes , ketones can build up in the blood when Type II diabetics have symptoms of high blood sugar , or when they are sick . <p> Low Blood Sugar ?

Although this fear is addressed by other movement monitors on the market , most are the under-mattress type and are not convenient for use away from the baby 's permanent cot or crib . A Snuza monitor is a small ( 35g ) device which clips directly onto a baby 's diaper , is cordless and wireless and can travel with the baby to ensure protection wherever it goes " around the house , in the room where the parent may be , on holiday , travelling , to friends , in a carrycot , in a campcot , to granny 's or babysitter 's house , etc .

This condition is also present in the case of babies co-sleeping with parents , and both conditions are addressed by the use of individual Snuza 's for each baby . <p> The flexible sensor tip , which must be in contact with the baby 's skin at all times , detects the slightest movement , and as long as it is detecting any movement at all , Snuza will remain inactive . However , if Snuza does not detect any movement for a period of 20 seconds , it emits an audible alarm , alerting the parent or caregiver to act . On the Halo/Hero model , this is preceded by a vibratory stimulus which is activated after a period of 15 seconds of no movement . However , if another 5 second period passes with no further movement , the alarm is activated . <p> Snuza Go Price : $89.99In Stock <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you re good to go .

It is the only topical nipple cream endorsed in the US by La Leche League International* , considered the foremost experts on breastfeeding . <p> A new independent 2010 study concludes that HPA- Lanolin , combined with breastfeeding education , is more effective than expressed breastmilk , combined with breastfeeding education , in reducing nipple pain and promoting healing of nipple trauma ( Abou-Dakn et al ) . The full study can be viewed free online . <p> This informative booklet describes in detail the special qualities of lanolin and the principles of moist wound healing as well as the special qualities and differences between Lansinoh HPA Lanolin and other generic lanolin ointments . <p> Note* The endorsement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breastfeeding Mothers " is not an endorsement of any other product or entity , including but not limited to any parent , affiliate or subsidiary of Lansinoh . <h> FAQ <p> How is Lansinoh HPA Lanolin different from other lanolin ? There are many refinements of lanolin from a crude industrial grade to our ultra pure medical grade . Lansinoh HPA Lanolin has been refined by a patented process to remove all allergenic components ( identified as the free lanolin alcohols in combination with detergent residues left over from the wool scouring process ) and to bring to the lowest level possible any environmental impurities ( including pesticide residues ) . Because of the purity of Lansinoh HPA Lanolin , it does not have to be removed prior to breastfeeding . <p> How can you guarantee Lansinoh HPA Lanolin is the purest ? We routinely test our lanolin to make certain that it conforms to Lansinohs specifications with regard to allergenic components and environmental impurities . Our specifications far exceed those set by the United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) . Additionally , we are the only company providing lanolin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identified allergenic component ) left over from the wool scouring process . We have never seen documentation from another lanolin provider that approaches our level of purity . We can provide you with the Certificate of Analysis if you are interested in more details . <p> Do I have to remove it prior to breastfeeding ? Lansinoh HPA Lanolin does not need to be removed prior to breastfeeding because of the intensive purification process that is used . We do recommend applying it after breastfeeding instead of before so that it has some time to absorb into your skin . <p> How does Lansinoh HPA Lanolin work ? Lansinoh HPA Lanolin provides a moist healing environment , which allows the skin to repair itself from within by slowing down the evaporation of moisture naturally present in the skin . It is partially occlusive ( unlike Vaseline , a hydrocarbon , which is completely occlusive ) and allows for the exchange of air ( respiration ) and moisture ( transpiration ) so that the skin does not become over hydrated . The consistency of Lansinoh HPA Lanolin is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innervated and by coating the free nerve endings and placing them in a more normal environment , many mothers report instant pain relief . <p> What if Lansinoh HPA Lanolin is ingested by my pet ? If your pet has ingested Lansinoh HPA Lanolin , there is no cause for concern . Lansinoh HPA Lanolin is not listed with the Poison Control enter because there are no contraindications for ingestion . It will pass through the gut harmlessly and the only problem your pet may have is a loose stool . <p> I am allergic to lanolin/wool , can I use Lansinoh HPA Lanolin ? How is that possible ? That is a logical question as there is some confusion about this issue . What is often considered an allergy to wool is actually a contact dermatitis that results from irritation from the wool fiber itself or dyes in the wool as they interact with the skin . Lanolin , on the other hand , is a by-product of wool washing - the wool is washed and the raw wool grease undergoes a series of refinements that results in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than wool . Lansinoh HPA Lanolin was developed especially for breastfeeding mothers , and is refined by a patented process to remove impurities . There are many refinements of lanolin in the market and only Lansinoh HPA Lanolin is safe for use by mother and baby . It is the only lanolin available that has had environmental impurities ( including pesticide residues ) and allergenic components ( including detergent residues ) filtered to an extremely low level or removed . Additionally , Lansinoh HPA Lanolin does not contain preservatives or additives of any kind ( including BHT ) . People , who consider themselves allergic to wool and may have avoided Lanolin in the past , will be happy to know that they can use Lansinoh HPA Lanolin with confidence . In the over 20 years that Lansinoh has been available , the company is not aware of a single documented case of an allergic reaction to Lansinoh HPA Lanolin . However , that does not mean that someone somewhere could have a possible reaction . We would suggest that you apply Lansinoh HPA Lanolin on the inside of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . After that time , check and see if there is any redness or itching . Obviously , if you have an unpleasant reaction before the 24 hours , discontinue any use of Lansinoh HPA Lanolin immediately . Obviously , if you have an unpleasant reaction before the 24 hours , discontinue any use of Lansinoh HPA Lanolin immediately . <p> Where does lanolin come from ? Lanolin comes from the fleece of sheep after shearing . The sheep is shorn , the wool is washed and the raw wool grease remains . This material undergoes a series of refinements that results in our ultra pure lanolin . One hundred pounds of wool will yield about two to four pounds of lanolin . It is a natural and renewable raw material not a processed synthetic compound . The term lanolin comes from the Latin lana for wool and oleum for oil , although chemically it is a wax rather than oil . It is the secretions from the sebaceous glands of sheep , which is deposited onto the wool fiber and is natures way of protecting the fleece from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic ester and as such is similar to the oil our own skin produces ( sebum ) . This is the reason it is so beneficial when applied to the skin . <p> Are any animals hurt when lanolin is produced ? No harm comes to the sheep when extracting lanolin . As stated above , it is a byproduct of wool washing after the wool has been shorn from the sheep . Unlike sheep that are raised for their meat , sheep that produce high volumes of lanolin are shorn and then returned to the fields to grown another fleece , which will be shorn again for the retrieval of more lanolin . <p> My Lansinoh HPA Lanolin expired , can I still use it ? If your tube has expired , we do not recommend using it for breastfeeding . If you have used it before you noticed that it had expired , do not worry , it is ok . Lansinoh HPA Lanolin , because it is ultra purified and bacteriostatic , will inhibit growth of bacteria . If your tube has been opened and expired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new tube . <p> Where is the expiration date on the tube ? The expiration date can be found at the end of the tube , on the back , where the crimp is . It will say EXP followed by the month and then the year . <p> What type of plastic is used in your Lansinoh HPA Lanolin tube ? The plastic that is used to make our lanolin tube is low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene plastic which are free from plasticizers including BPA and phthalates . <p> Why is the Lansinoh HPA Lanolin in one of my tubes yellow and the other one white ? Lansinoh HPA Lanolin , , the leading topical in its category is made with the same formula as the original , but with an improved refining process for smoother application . With the improved refining process , Lansinoh HPA Lanolin maintains its integrity as the purest , safest nipple ointment available by selectively filtering out any remaining color and odor-forming impurities . The original Lansinoh Lanolin is still good for use as long as it is used prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or efficacious than the newer version . Lansinoh HPA Lanolin provides the same efficacy to soothe , heal , and protect dry , cracked skin as the original but with an enhanced purity , which gives the product a clearer appearance and is virtually odorless . It still contains no preservatives , additives , water , chemicals or perfume .

The fetal heart doppler is a non-invasive diagnostic instrument used to detect and measure the fetal heart rate . A fetal heart doppler measures the fetal heart rate by emitting and receiving continuous ultrasonic sound waves and emitting the change or shift in pitch frequency of these sound waves . This is called the Doppler Effect and was discovered by Austrian mathematician and physicist , Christian Doppler ( 1803-53 ) . Each fetal heart monitor uses a transducer or probe of varying MGHZ ( millions of cycles per second ) , usually 2 or 3 , containing piezoelectric crystals which send short sound pulses into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sound waves is sent the transducer ( probe ) pauses briefly and listens for the returning echo at which time the fetal heart doppler determines the depth and direction of each returning sound wave and converts the signal into the fetal heartbeat you hear . This heartbeat is not your baby 's actual heartbeat but a reproduction . Other Types of Fetal Heart Monitoring <p> Fetoscope This is a special type of stethoscope used for listening to a baby . There are many types of fetoscopes available , and a regular stethoscope works as well . This can usually be used after about 30 weeks . <p> Fetal Heart Doppler This is a handheld ultrasound device that transmits the sounds of the baby 's heartbeat either through a speaker or into ear pieces that are attached . Fetal heart dopplers can usually pick up the fetal heartbeat after 8 weeks gestation . <p> Electronic Fetal Monitoring This is an ultrasound device used during labor and birth , or during certain testing ( non-stress test , contraction stress test , etc. ) to record the baby 's heart rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermittently or continuously . <p> Internal Fetal Monitoring It is an internal monitoring with an electrode attached to the baby 's head to record heart tones , and a pressure catheter to record contractions . This is also used during labor and birth , however , it is not used intermittently . <p> Telemetry Monitoring It is a lot like the regular Electronic Fetal Monitoring , however , one can maintain mobility <p> A galloping horse is what your baby 's heartbeat will sound like and will be about twice as fast as the mother 's heart rate . An average normal fetal heart rate is between 120-180 BPM ( Beats Per Minute ) . Where as an average adult heart rate at rest is between 60-100 BPM . <p> Maternal Sounds You may also hear sounds of your own heart or blood flow . A major artery runs through your abdomen and the swish of your blood through it is sometimes picked up by the fetal doppler . This sound is heard by the baby later in pregnancy and has been recorded and used to calm upset babies after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it flows through the placenta and has a distinctive sound like wind blowing through the trees . <p> Instrument Noise The fetal doppler itself may have some background noise , static , popping etc . When the fetal doppler probe is moved on the abdomen , louder popping noises may result . Sometimes , the movements of your baby in later pregnancy also produce louder noises . Ultrasound gel use is integral on cutting down on much of the static produced when positioning the fetal dopplers trasducer during an exam <p> How do I use my fetal doppler ? The best way to begin an exam is to be lying down exposing the abdomen , although it may be possible to find the heart rate in a sitting or standing position . Apply a generous amount of ultrasound gel to the fetal doppler probe . Early in pregnancy the best technique is to begin with the transducer ( probe ) on the midline of the abdomen ( above the pubic line ) aiming downward behind the pubic bone . The probe should then be angled slowly in search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy the size of the fetal heart is so small and the sound so faint it can be very easy to pass over and miss the sounds . A 2mghz probe is best for early detection , standard on Huntleigh FD1+ and D920 . A full bladder can make it easier to find the heartbeat . Try to keep from dragging the probe around as it will only increase static and make it more difficult to find the heartbeat FAQ Main <p> How often can I use my fetal doppler ? The Food and Drug Administration regulates ultrasound in the United States and has cleared it for " continuous use " . As there is no consensus on what this means or how often you should use your fetal doppler it is commonly recommended that like everything in life prudence is the best policy . When using your fetal doppler it is suggested that you use it in short intervals , infrequently , and following the first trimester .

The easiest and most conclusive way to decipher your heartbeat from your baby 's is by the heart rate or BPM ( beats per minute ) . Your baby 's heart rate will be between 120 &amp; 180 BPM . This is considered the normal range of a fetal heart rate . Conversely , your heart rate will be much less 60-100 BPM . Early in pregnancy its normal for the fetal heart rate to vary within a reasonable range . As your pregnancy progresses and your baby grows the heart rate will become more static . Also be aware that like adults your baby 's heart rate will vary depending on activity level . If you have further questions or concerns about your baby 's heart rate contact your health care provider . FAQ Main <p> Why do I need ultrasound gel ?

Use only ultrasound gel FAQ Main <p> What 's the difference between a 2MHz and 3MHz fetal doppler probe ? All baby heart monitors designed for fetal heartbeat monitoring is equipped with either a 2 or 3mghz probe . With a 2mghz probe the beam is narrow and direct which helps it penetrate deeper ( 3-5cm compared to 1-2cm ) and find the fetal heartbeat earlier than 3mghz dopplers . <p> The higher the frequency , the shorter in duration is the period and the shorter is the wavelength <p> The lower the frequency , the longer in duration is the period and the longer is the wavelength <p> There is a lot of information available stating that the 3mghz fetal doppler probe actually allows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We disagree . In our tests and review we found that a 2mghz doppler probe picked up the fetal heart rate at 8 weeks 80% more of the time than a 3mghz probe . Part of the argument for the 3mghz probe enabling easier detection of the heartbeat comes from the belief that because the higher frequency probe has a wider beam the heartbeat is easier to find . When in fact after 12 weeks gestation either probe is easy to find the heartbeat with . This and the fact that a 2mghz probe is much more useful for overweight woman is why we recommend the 2mghz probe and feel it 's a better all around probe FAQ Main

@@58367077 @7367077/ <p> There is growing evidence that clearly links body composition with health risks and the development of certain diseases . New research indicates that fat loss , not weight loss , can extend human longevity . <p> Adding further to the acceptance of this practice is the importance of body composition in athletic performance and its move from being a laboratory-only procedure to one used in ordinary medical practice and now health clubs or at home . By measuring body composition , a person 's health status can be more accurately assessed and the effects of both dietary and physical activity programs better directed . <p> Most people do n't realize that there is only one " direct " method of measuring body composition that is close to 100% accurate , and that an autopsy - performed Post Mortem . All other current methods for measuring body composition rely on " indirect " measurement techniques and are called In Vivo methods - meaning they are performed on a living body . <p> In Vivo methods give estimates of percentage of body fat , fat-free mass , muscle , bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method uses one or more measurable body component ( such as Skin fold thickness , resistance , etc. ) to make educated predictions about the other components . These predictions are based on years of research that define statistical relationships between different body components . <p> According to the National Institutes of Health , no trial data exist to indicate that one method of measuring body fat is better than any other for following overweight and obese patients during treatment . Good results depend upon accurately taken measurements and an adequate , scientifically derived database . Every measurement method has strengths as well as defined sources of error . Most research studies employ several methods used in combination . <p> Body composition equipment manufacturers should have scientific studies available to support accuracy claims , but often companies fail to explain the problems encountered in day-to-day use outside the controlled environment of a research lab . Tanita feels it is very important for people to fully understand the benefits - and limitations - of body composition analysis . This information will enable people to make better decisions about which method is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Body Composition Models <p> The more traditional methods are based on a two-compartment model that simply divides the body into fat and fat-free mass . Hydrodensitometry ( underwater weighing ) is based on the two-compartment model . <p> Newer , more sophisticated techniques , such as Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , measure the body as multiple compartments . This approach improves the accuracy of the calculation for determining the real density of fat free mass . <h> Reference Models <p> Often referred to as " gold standards " , these are clinical techniques that have been validated through repeated scientific studies and against which other clinical and field method results are evaluated . The two main reference models today are Hydrodensitometry and DEXA . <h> Prediction Equations <p> In Vivo methods use equations to predict percentage of body fat , fat-free mass , muscle , hydration , etc . Using a form of statistics known as multiple regressional analysis , this allows an unmeasurable component , such as body fat , to be predicted from one or more measured variable , where studies have proved there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skin fold measurements ( a method that estimates fat found just under the skin ) to calculate total body fat . BIA measures the body 's impedance ( resistance ) to an electrical signal to estimate total body fat . <p> Equations can be population-specific ( developed for specific types of people , including such categories as gender , age , ethnicity , fitness level , disease , etc. ) or generalized to cover a wide range of people types . A given equation is validated according to how well the results match the results of the reference method . <p> It is important to note that results of reference methods themselves do not agree 100 percent . Therefore , when comparing different methods or products , you should consider which reference method was used and the appropriateness of both the method and particular product for the body type being analyzed . <p> Weight - refers to the total weight of the body including bones , muscle , fat , water , etc . <p> Overweight - is defined as a body weight that exceeds the acceptable weight for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Standards are usually determined solely on the basis of population averages that can and do change over time . Standards may also vary with gender and ethnicity . An overweight person does not necessarily have too much fat nor increased health risks if the excess weight is due to an above-average amount of muscle . <p> Obesity ( Over fat ) - is the condition where the individual has an excessive amount of body fat . Over 30 specific diseases have been linked to obesity . <p> Percentage Body Fat - is the percentage of total body weight that is fat <p> Fat Mass - means the actual fat mass ( in pounds or kilos ) in the body <p> Body Fat - functions as insulation , protection and energy reserve . When the percentage is too high , fat increases a person 's risk of high blood pressure , elevated cholesterol , diabetes , heart disease , and some forms of cancer . It can also interfere with the immune system , prevent heat loss , stress the musculoskeletal system , cause sleep problems , and may affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the rate at which the body burns calories to maintain normal body functions while at rest . It is affected by the amount of muscle you have . Body weight remains constant when you burn up the same number of calories you eat . a 3,500 calorie difference between dietary intake and energy expenditure is necessary to gain or lose one pound of fat . Weight loss by diet alone may result in a loss of muscle , and this will slow the metaboloic rate , making it more difficult to keep the weight off . Exercise , however , increases your metabolic rate for hours even after exercise , and can increase the amount of muscle you have . <p> Weight versus Body Fat - Weight measurement alone can not always accurately determine the body fat status of a person because it does not differentiate between the fat-free mass and fat mass in the body . The relationship between three categories of body weight and body fat can be described according to five different people categories . <p> Weight <p> Under <p> 2 Underweight and Lean ( eg. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly ) <p> Average <p> 3 Average , healthy weight and body fat <p> Over <p> 1 Overweight but not Obese ( eg. bodybuilders ) <p> 4 Overweight and Obese <p> Lean <p> Medium <p> Obese <p> Body Fat <p> 1 . Athletic or muscular body types ( bodybuilders ) who have normal or low body fat even though they are overweight according to standard charts . <p> 2 . Lean , thin or linear body types with low amounts of fat-free mass ( endurance athletes ) who can be underweight according to the weight charts and extremely low in body fat yet physically very healthy <p> 3 . People of average weight and average body fat mass . <p> 4 . Big , heavy and soft body types who are overweight and obese from large amounts of fat mass and body weight . <p> 5 . People ( often the elderly ) who have too much fat mass and are obese but not overweight due to inactive and sedentary lifestyles . <p> Height-Weight Tables - were originally developed by insurance companies to establish recommended weight ranges for men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lowest mortality among large population studies of insured people . Unfortunately , these studies do not accurately represent a cross-section of the entire American population . <p> Body Mass Index ( BMI ) - is a simple calculation that determines height to weight ratio . This index correlates a person 's physical stature with mortality ratios based on actuarial studies . According to the National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization , overweight is defined as a BMI or 25-29.9 , and obesity as a BMI equal to or greater than 30 . A person with a BMI of 30 is about 30 pounds overweight/Over fat A BMI or 18 or lower indicates that a person is underweight/l <p> While BMI is widely accepted , it can be misleading . Current guidelines do not differentiate for gender , ethnicity or age , and do not distinguish obesity or leanness for individuals who are extremely muscular . It is , however , more precise than height/weight tables and allows comparisons of population groups . Studies have confirmed that obesity-related health risks start in the BMI range of 25-30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in dependant risk factor and can be used in conjunction with any other method . It reflects growing evidence that excess visceral fat - surrounding the abdominal organs - on its own increases the chance of heart disease or diabetes . <p> Research indicates that visceral fat ( waist size ) is more important in the disease process than subcutaneous fat which is just under the skin. ( " love handles " , " pinchable inches " ) . Abdominal fat cells appear to produce certain compounds that may influence cholesterol and glucose metabolism . A waist size of 35 inches or more is deemed a risk for people who have a BMI over 25 . <p> Using hand-held calipers that exert a standard pressure , the Skin fold thickness is measured at various body locations ( 3-7 test sites are common ) . Then a calculation is used to derive a body fat percentage based on the sum of the measurements . Different prediction equations are needed for children and specific ethnic groups ( over 3500 equations have been validated ) . This approach uses underwater weighing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assumption that the thickness of the subcutaneous fat ( found just under the skin ) reflects a constant proportion of the total body fat ( contained in the body cavities ) , and that the sites selected for measurement represent the average thickness of the subcutaneous fat . <p> Skin fold measurements are made by grasping the skin and underlying tissue , shaking it to exclude any muscle and pinching it between the jaws of the caliper . Duplicate readings are often made at each site to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements . Often to save time in large population studies , a single Skin fold site measurement is made to reduce the time involved . Such a test should be used only for a rough estimate of obesity . <p> Generally speaking , Skin fold measurements are easy to do , inexpensive and the method is portable . Overall , results can be very subjective as precision ultimately depends on the skill of the technician and the site measured . The quality of the calipers is also a factor ; they should be accurately calibrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the home are usually less accurate than those used by an accredited caliper technician . The more obese the subject , the more difficult to " pinch " the Skin fold correctly , requiring even more skill to obtain an accurate measurement . <p> This method measures whole body density by determining body volume . There is a variety of equipment available to do underwater weighing ranging in sophistication from the standard stainless steel take with a chair or cot mounted on underwater scales , to a chair and scale suspended from a diving board over a pool or hot tub . <p> This technique first requires weighing a person outside the tank , then immersing them totally in water and weighing them again . The densities of bone and muscles are higher than water , and fat is less dense than water . So a person with more bone and muscle will weigh more in water than a person with less bone and muscle , meaning they have a higher body density and lower percentage of body fat . <p> The volume of the body is calculated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulas . Then Body Fat Percentage is calculated from body density using standard equations ( either Siri or Brozek ) . <p> The underlying assumption with this method is than densities of fat mass and fat-free mass are constant . However , underwater weighing may not be the appropriate gold standard for everyone . For example , athletes tend to have denser bones and muscles than non-athletes , which may lead to an underestimation of body fat percentage . While the body fat of elderly patients suffering from osteoporosis may be overestimated . To date , specific equations have not been developed to accommodate these different population groups . <p> An important consideration in this method is the amount of air left in a person 's lungs after breathing out . This residual lung volume can be estimated or measured , but it is established that a direct measure is desirable and it should be taken in the tank whenever possible . Another consideration is that the water in the tank must be completely still , there can be no wind or movement . <p> Although this method has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people find it difficult , cumbersome and uncomfortable , and others are afraid of total submersion or can not expel all the air in their lungs . Clinical studies often require subjects to be measured three to five times and an average taken of the results . <p> Body impedance is measured when a small , safe electrical signal is passed through the body , carried by water and fluids . Impedance is greatest in fat tissue , which contains only 10-20% water , while fat-free mass , which conations 70-75% water , allows the signal to pass much more easily . By using the impedance measurements along with a person 's height , weight and body type ( gender , age , fitness level ) , it is possible to calculate the percentage of body fat , fat-free mass , hydration level , and other body composition values . Conventional BIA normally uses underwater weighing as its method of reference . <p> Using BIA to estimate a person 's body fat assumes that the body is within normal hydration ranges . When a person is dehydrated , the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect hydration include not drinking enough fluids , drinking too much caffeine or alcohol , exercising or eating just before measuring , certain prescription drugs or diuretics , illness , or a woman 's menstrual cycle . Measuring under consistent conditions ( proper hydration and same time of day ) will yield best results with this method . <p> Because BIA can be affected by body hydration , many professionals may use this method as a means of tracking the hydration status of their patients . This is especially important for athletes who are training or performing , as well as for the chronically i 'll . <p> In the traditional BIA method , a person lies on a cot and spot electrodes are placed on the hands or bare feet . Electrolyte gel is applied first , and then a current of 50 kHz is introduced . BIA has emerged as a promising technique because of its simplicity , low cost , high reproducibility and non-invasiveness . BIA prediction equations can be either generalized or population-specific , allowing this method to be potentially very accurate . Selecting the appropriate equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To minimize variables caused by a person 's hydration level , measurements should always be taken under constant and controlled conditions . <p> For clinical purposes , scientists are developing a multi-frequency BIA method that may further improve the method 's ability to predict a person 's hydration level . New segmental BIA equipment that uses more electrodes may lead to more precise measurements of specific parts of the body . <p> Tanita has developed a simplified version of BIA that uses leg-to-leg bioimpedance analysis . In this system , two footpad electrodes ( pressure contact ) are incorporated to the platform of a precision electronic scale . A person 's measurements are taken while in a standing position with the electrodes in contact with bare feet . The body fat monitor/analyzer automatically measures weight and then impedance . Computer software ( a microprocessor ) imbedded in the product uses the measured impedance , the subject 's gender , height , fitness level and in some cases age , ( which have been pre-programmed ) , and the weight to determine body fat percentage based on equation formulas . Tanita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has all the advantages of traditional BIA as well as greater ease of use , speed , and portability . Professional versions of the product can be found in hospitals , health clubs and research labs and include computer printouts of comprehensive data such as BMI , fat percent , fat weight , total body water , fat-free mass , and BMR . The concept has been adapted for use as an affordable home monitoring device . Now ordinary people along with fitness enthusiasts and patients with health risks can measure body fat as part of a regular healthy lifestyle . The same variables apply with regard to hydration levels , and measuring should be done under consistent conditions . <p> A fiber optic probe is connected to a digital analyzer that indirectly measures the tissue composition ( fat and water ) at various sites on the body . This method is based on studies that show optical densities are linearly related to subcutaneous and total body fat . The biceps is the most often used single site for estimating body fat using the NIR method . The NIR light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the detector . The NIR data is entered into a prediction equation with the person 's height , weight , frame size and level of activity to estimate the percent body fat . <p> This method has become popular outside of the laboratory because it is simple , fast , noninvasive and the equipment is relatively inexpensive . However the amount of pressure applied to the fibre optic probe during measurement may affect the values of optical densities , and skin color and hydration level may be potential sources of error . To date , studies conducted with this method have produced mixed results ; a high degree of error has occurred with very lean and very obese people ; and the validity of a single-site measurement at the biceps is questionable . Numerous sources report that more research is needed to substantiate the validity , accuracy and applicability of this method . <p> A relatively new technology that is very accurate and precise , DEXA is based on a three-compartment model that divides the body into total body mineral , fat-free soft ( lean ) mass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption that bone mineral content is directly proportional to the amount of photon energy absorbed by the bone being studied . <p> DEXA uses a whole body scanner that has two low-dose x-rays at different sources that read bone and soft tissue mass simultaneously . The sources are mounted beneath a table with a detector overhead . The scanner passes across a person 's reclining body with data collected at 0.5 cm intervals . A scan takes between 10-20 minutes . It is safe and non-invasive with little burden to the individual , although a person must lie still throughout the procedure . <p> DEXA is fast becoming the new " gold " standard " because it provides a higher degree of precision in only one measurement and has the ability to show exactly where fat is distributed throughout the body . It is very reliable and its results extremely repeatable ; in addition , the method is safe and presents little burden to the subject . Although this method is not as accurate in measuring the extremely obese and the cost of equipment is high , DEXA is quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) - An x-ray based method in which a magnetic field " excites " water and fat molecules in the body , producing a measurable signal . A person lies within the magnet as a computer scans the body . High-quality images show the amount of fat and where it is distributed . <p> MRI takes about 30 minutes and is very safe as it uses no ionizing radiation , but use is limited due to the high cost of equipment and analysis . <p> Total Body Electrical Conductivity ( TOBEC ) - This method is based on lean tissue being a better conductor of electricity than fat . A person lies in a cylinder that generates a very weak electromagnetic field . The strength of the field depends on the electrolytes found in the person 's body water . In about 10 seconds , TOBEC makes 10 conductivity readings that estimate lean body mass . Although very accurate , its use is limited due to the high cost of the equipment . <p> Computed Tomography ( CT ) - CT produces cross-sectional scans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photons toward a detector . As the beam rotates around a person , data is collected , stored , and applied to complex algorithms to build images that determine body composition . CT is particularly useful in giving a ratio of intra-abdominal fat to extra-abdominal fat . It is noninvasive , but potential is limited by exposure to radiation and high equipment cost . <p> BOD POD ( Air Displacement ) - Based on the same principle as underwater weighing , the BOD POD uses computerized sensors to measure how much air is displaced while a person sits for 20 seconds in a capsule . It uses a calculation to determine body density , then estimates body fat . The equipment is very expensive and limited in availability . <p> *excerpted from the pamphlet " Understanding Body Fat Analysis " , produced by the Tanita Corporation of America , c1999

Learn about our history and where we 're heading <p> In the Beginning In 1942 , Russell Gray and Robert Cone formed Graco Metal Products , in Philadelphia , PA .

Cone decided to manufacture his own line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of David Saint , an engineer , tinkerer , and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco . Saint , himself a father of 9 , was inspired when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing . Building from this idea , he went to the drawing board . <p> A Star is Born 18 months of hard work later , the world 's first wind-up infant swing , the Graco Swyngomatic , was born . Graco was in the baby-products business . Everyone knew they had a hit on their hands , and an enthusiastic Graco salesman predicted that 10,000 of the swings would sell . But no one predicted that Graco would sell not 10,000 , but millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years , becoming one of the world 's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process . <p> From then on , whatever category it entered , Graco set the standard : the firm 's Pack N ' Play Portable Playards , designed by Nate Saint , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 , and achieved the same kind of success as Graco 's wind-up swings .

Graco raised the bar further when it introduced the Travel System , the first product that allowed you to quickly click a car seat into and out of a stroller , making life easier for mom and dad by allowing them to move a sleeping infant from house to automobile to stroller without waking the little one up . <p> Just Look at Us Now !

@@58367085 @7367085/ <h> Practical Implications : <p> Weight loss may extend longevity only if sufficient loss is from fat loss . <p> Weight loss that is related to increases in mortality may be a result of lean body mass <h> ABSTRACT <p> Objective : <p> Obesity is associated with increased all-cause mortality . Moreover , modest reductions in obesity are associated with reduced obesity-related comorbidities . This has lead to the speculation that weight loss itself might strongly be associated with reduced all-cause mortality rate . However , there has been counter-intuitive evidence that the weight loss is associated with increased mortality . This issue remains controversial . To see how weight loss operates in mortality analyses , we tried to separate the effects of weight loss ( WL ) from those of fat loss ( FL ) . Specifically , WL and FL were hypothesized to have increasing and decreasing effects , respectively , on all-cause mortality rate . <p> Design : <p> Using Data from the Tecumseh Heart Study ( THS ; n-1890 ) and the Framingham Heart Study ( FHS ; n-2734 ) we investigated how WL and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methods : <p> For both studies , fatness was measured by skin fold thickness and the losses in kg ( WL and FL ) were calculated as the measurements taken at time 1 minus those at time 2 , this being later than time 1 and earlier than end of the follow-up . <p> Results : <p> Results from logistic regression analyses in both data bases , adjusted for age , sex , and smoking status , supported the hypotheses . That is , WL and FL were positively and negatively associated with all-cause mortality , respectively ( OR for one unit change in WL=1.02 ( p&lt;0.001 ) for FHS and 1.06 ( p=0.002 ) for THS ; OR for one unit change in FL=0.97 ( p=0.049 ) for FHS 0.83 ( p=0.022 ) for THS ) . Therefore , the positive association of weight loss with mortality might have resulted from lean body mass loss . In addition , these results underscore the importance of more accurate and precise body composition measurements for better understanding of measurements for better understanding of mechanisms of their effects on all-cause mortality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that fat loss extends longevity among humans . These results suggest that weight loss may only extend longevity if a sufficient proportion of the weight loss is lost as fat . 
@@58367086 @7367086/ <p> Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by chest tightness , shortness of breath , coughing and wheezing . With asthma , a blockage of airflow in and out of the lungs occurs from muscle squeezing , swelling and excess mucous . Between 12-15 million people in the United States have asthma , including up to 5 million children . <p> Physicians who are not specialists in this disease may mistake its symptoms for an infection , unaware that the underlying problem is asthma . Asthma is characterized by three airway problems : obstruction , inflammation and hyper responsiveness . Asthma patients respond to environmental factors differently than non-asthmatics .

That 's why at the beginning of the 21st century , the Swedish Consumer Agency encouraged BabyBj+rn to develop a safe high chair that would prevent children from standing up ( and falling out ) . Creating just the right product was no easy task . <p> What did we do ? We started by studying both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children sitting in them during mealtime . From our findings , we developed a prototype to test with families and pediatricians . The first prototype was for children who could sit unaided ( from 6 months to around 2 years ) , and came without a table . With safety , user-friendliness and our Swedish roots in mind , we chose to design the chair using plastic , which is strong , durable and easy to clean . We created the chair to take up minimal space , and made it easy to collapse when putting it away or taking it on the road . <p> After much testing , we were n't satisfied . So , we created a new prototype . To keep children from standing and falling out of the high chair , we added a foldout , adjustable table . The table works as a safety lock that holds the child securely in place together with a safety harness .

We made sure it would protect against spills by making the table adjustable to fit snugly against the child 's body . <p> Because children are naturally curious and eager to learn , the high chair was designed to allow the child to sit at the table with everyone else . This encourages social and linguistic development , and makes it easier and more enjoyable for the child to learn to eat and drink for him or herself . <p> BABYBJ+RN High Chair The entire process from concept to finished product took about eight years .

It does not directly activate the muscles , but activates them through neuro-musucular connections just as the brain would . <p> Electric Stimulation units are about the size of a hand-held Game Boy and has four leads , each split into positive ( + ) and negative ( - ) connectors . Reusable adhesive pads are placed at strategic points on the muscles you want to engage in a particular workout . Connect the leads to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your EMS work out . <p> Electrostimulation uses electrical impulses acting on motoneurons and nerve terminals to promote muscle contraction in a manner similar to voluntary contraction . Electrostimulation can be used in two different ways : Muscular stimulation ( for the development of force ) , and Nerve terminal stimulation ( for treatments to alleviate pain ) . <p> Types of muscle <p> There are three types of muscle : striated ( or voluntary ) muscles , cardiac muscle , and smooth ( or involuntary ) muscle . Voluntary muscles include skeletal muscles , which allow the skeleton to move , and cutaneous muscles , which generate facial expressions for example . Cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are not voluntarily controlled . <p> The majority of human muscle is striated , or voluntary . There are approximately 200 different muscles on each side of the body ( for a total of 400 ) . Skeletal muscles are the target of electrical muscle stimulation ( EMS ) . <p> Mechanism of muscular contraction <p> Skeletal muscles function through the mechanism of contraction . Muscular contractions cause the relative movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeleton . <p> Muscles contract in the following way : when a person decides to make a movement , there is a change of the electric potential in the motor center of the brain and an electric impulse is transmitted to the muscle that has to move . The electrical signal is transmitted as a change of potential ( voltage ) , an electrical impulse that travels through the motor nerve to the muscle to be stimulated . After receiving the impulse , calcium ions are freed from neural stores , which in turn causes two components of muscular fibers , actin and myosin , to approach each other . This results in a shortening of certain areas of the fiber , the so-called Z bands , leading to muscular contraction . <p> The energy needed for contraction is supplied by sugars and fats stored in the body . In other words , electrical stimulation is not a direct energy resource but it works as a trigger of this energy , which results in a muscular contraction . The same type of mechanism is activated when muscular contraction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes the same role as a natural impulse transmitted by the nervous system . At the end of contraction muscles relax and return to their original state . <p> How Conductivity Gel Works <p> Conductivity gel works by filling in pores with a conductive emulsion that has the same pH as the skin . This re-establishes conductivity for pads that have lost their original conductive , adhesive-gel layer , and enhances the contact area for the pads to transmit the electrical signal through the skin to the muscles below . It also protects pads so that the adhesive is not affected as much by oils and dirt on the skin . Use conductivity gel for each EMS session . Put 1/4 tsp blobs on each small pad , and two tsp blobs on each large pad . Spread with your fingertips . If doing two muscle groups ( i.e. hams and glutes ) in a session for the hams , then move the pads to the glutes without adding more . One could add a bit to the skin on the glutes for additional comfort and pad life .

Chicco recommends replacing a car seat after any crash . The base is included in this recommendation ( if the base was in the vehicle when the crash occurred ) . There is no way of knowing what , if any , damage has occurred that would affect the car seat ? s performance in a crash . The only way to determine this would be to test the car seat . Therefore , Chicco can not guarantee a car seat involved in a crash will perform the way it was designed in any subsequent crash . Chicco recommends contacting your insurance company about replacement of your car seat . <p> Can I use any additional coverings/products in my Chicco car seat ? Chicco does not allow use of any accessories , pads , or products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Chicco . Doing so will void the warranty of the Child Restraint . Add-on products can interfere with the proper performance of the car seat . It is critical for your child ? s safety that add-on products manufactured by other companies not be used without approval from Chicco . To keep your baby warm and safe when in an infant car seat , Chicco , and child passenger safety experts , recommend putting your child in lightweight , yet warm , clothing with legs ( fleece products are great for this ) . Once the baby is properly buckled in the harness , blankets may be placed over the baby for additional warmth . <p> Can I take my car seat on an airplane ? The Chicco KeyFit and KeyFit 30 car seats are certified for use in commercial aircraft . Please consult your User Guide for proper installation . Our product manuals are also available on our website . <p> What is the difference between the KeyFit and KeyFit 30 car seat ?

The maximum height of the child for both car seats is 30 inches , or if there is less than inch between the top of your child ? s head and the top of the car seat . You should move your child to a larger car seat once either the maximum weight or height limit is met . We suggest keeping your child rear facing as long as possible . Rear facing is the safest position for crash protection . There are many convertible car seats available that face the rear until 30-40 lbs and then face forward .

Exerlopers- are registered in The American Heritage Dictionary as a new way to run .. <p> The elliptical spring on the Exerlopers- delays the shock you experience when your foot hits the ground . It is a known fact that muscles can not be exercised by shock because muscles can not act quickly enough to absorb all the kinetic energy of running . Up to 75% of this energy is transferred to our skeletal structure leading to the gradual wearing out of the bones and joints <p> Exerlopers- absorb and store the energy that would otherwise be wasted in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually towards the exercised muscles of the runner giving them a safer and healthier workout . <p> Because Exerlopers- use a heel-to-toe motion , just like walking , you are able to run as comfortably as you walk , with your body in an upright position . The advantage is that you have a longer stride , can go faster , and burn more calories , thus having a more efficient workout. ( 10 minutes on Exerlopers- is equivalent to 30 minutes of jogging ) . <p> The springs are compressed by up to the 3 times of your body weight due to the kinetic energy of your running motion . The kinetic energy is converted by the spring into potential energy . That energy is re-applied to the runner and provides a kick-back thus increasing the running speed with less effort .

To receive maximum benefit while using the Compex Fitness , please read and follow all instructions completely . <h> How Does it Work ? <p> When you exercise , the brain sends the order in the form of electrical currents that travel at high speed along the nerve fibers . These electrical currents excite the motor nerve , which then passes the information to the immediate surroundings of the muscle , triggering a muscle contraction . <p> With electrostimulation , the excitation is directly produced at the motor nerve , rather than by the brain . Compex Muscle Stimulator produces powerful muscle contractions through " optimal " , safe and comfortable electrical impulses delivered at the motor nerves . A unique training planner on CD-ROM guides athletes in customizing these electrical impulses to target their workouts for power , endurance , speed or resistance .

The CD features over 75 different sport alternatives so no matter what your sport , the Compex Training Planner helps you optimize your workouts and training regimen . <h> Numerous Criteria Are Brought Into Play : <p> Choice Of The Muscle To Be Stimulated The muscles that work hardest in the specific sport should be stimulated first . For example , in Alpine skiing and cycling , the quadriceps are the primary muscles to be developed because they are used most intensely in these sports . However , Compex Fitness also provides intensive work of the ancillary muscles that are often neglected in conventional training . By selecting your sport on the CD-ROM , you will see the muscles that will be worked and the order of priority . <p> Choice Of The Levels : There are five different working levels for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Active Recovery .

Your muscles have to be stimulated at different rates depending on whether you are in a rest mode , in a maintenance mode , in a resumption of training mode or training during competition . <p> Cycles Duration &amp; Session Planning : The Training Planner helps you determine the number of weeks of muscle stimulation necessary to reach your goal .

@@58367421 @7367421/ <p> RespisenseG is the pioneer in absolutely portable movement monitoring , and no other monitor can lay claim to its unique combination of freedom of movement , safety in design , proactive response and proven track record . RespisenseG can be used practically anywhere baby may fall asleep - in a cot , on a picnic blanket or in grandmothers lap . Co-sleeping babies , be they multiples in one cot or babies in need of special care , can now be monitored safely while sharing a bed or sleeping next to mother . RespisenseG can also easily be used in a hammock-style sleeper , where traditional monitors can not work . It is simply the safest , most portable and convenient instrument for monitoring babys tummy movements and has , since 2005 , proved itself in thousands of homes . <h> About Respisense <p> Who needs Respisense monitors ? <p> Because many risky situations that can befall infants are totally unpredictable , RespisenseG is recommended as a parenting aid for all babies under age one and especially during their most vulnerable first eight months . <p> What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a baby , including breathing efforts . If movements cease , slow down too much or become too shallow the built-in tactile stimulator ( on the Buzz model ) will act as babys " wake-up call " , and if movement does not resume a loud alarm will alert the nearest caregiver . <p> Sound and video monitors are most suitable to know when baby becomes restless or cries for attention , i.e. when baby becomes too excited . The RespisenseG monitor provides helpful assistance on the other , arguably more important end of babys activity scale - when baby becomes silent and motionless . By monitoring tummy movements directly it provides the comfort of knowing you 'll be alerted should baby become dangerously inactive , and in addition the Respisense Buzz models will provide proactive , gentle tactile stimulation even before human intervention . Designed as a highly specialised , intelligent and feature-rich movement monitoring instrument that is exceptionally easy to use , Respisense leaves parents free to choose the best sound monitor available to complement the nursery should they wish . <p> Some movement monitors generate audible alarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Respisense alarm is loud and piercing and can be heard quite far , but at a safe level below 86dB . Adding a simple sound monitor to your nursery will enable you to relay the Respisense alarm sound to where you are without potentially damaging babys hearing . <p> Parents with a need to relay the alarm sound to other parts or outside areas of their properties can select a sound monitor most suitable to their needs and particular circumstances from the extensive range of baby sound monitors ( " baby phones " ) that are available on the market . You can select from simple sound monitors , sound-and-video monitors or sound- and temperature monitors , using digital or analogue technology , with single , dual or multiple-channels , in rechargeable or mains operated versions and with or without channel hopping . The choice is yours ! <p> Co-sleeping <p> Mothers who are concerned about falling asleep while breastfeeding can use a Respisense to keep their babies monitored if they should doze off . Parents with a need to co-sleep can also benefit greatly from the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we concur with leading professionals that babies should ideally sleep on their backs some mothers find that their babies insist on sleeping in other positions . Feedback from actual parents who have used our monitors with babies sleeping on their sides or tummies prove that Respisense can be relied upon even under these circumstances , giving added assurance to parents of adamant tummy-sleepers . <p> Is Respisense safe ? <p> RespisenseG was designed by a doting father and extensively tested on his own triplets for more than 2 years . By eliminating the hazards inherent in other designs , these unique monitors were designed to be the worlds safest : they have no cables that can strangle a baby , no straps that can constrict blood circulation to hands or feet , and no mains connections that could wear and cause electrocution or start fires . It is made of hypo-allergenic and fracture-resistant materials , does n't  require silicon or latex parts to be in constant contact with your babys skin and has no soft protrusions that can be chewed off and choked upon . The monitors use no radioactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The monitors carry the CE mark of safety , conform to 2001/95/EC and 89/336/EEC requirements as certified by TUV Rheinland Quality Services , and are manufactured to ISO9001:2000 quality management processes . <p> How often do I need to replace batteries ? <p> The special high-capacity , feather-light batteries used by the Respisense allow about a years use , and would therefore not even need to be replaced during the first 6 to 8 months that babies are most at risk . The safety of the monitors is further enhanced by sealing the batteries inside the units , protected from inquisitive explorers and preventing babies from chewing or choking on spent batteries . These eco-friendly power sources can be replaced by the manufacturer at a very reasonable fee for parents wishing to pass their monitors on or use them for subsequent children . <p> What about false alarms ? <p> Most false alarms in traditional movement monitors are caused by loose wires , improper installation or the need for hard bases and specific mattresses . RespisenseG monitors need not be tuned to their installation environment , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time . The reasons for most false alarms in traditional monitors have therefore been eliminated in the patented Respisense design . <p> The comprehensive and informative instructions that accompany each monitor provide useful tips on how to use the monitors , and if used correctly no Respisense user should ever have to endure false alarms , even if baby should roll to the far corners of the cot . <p> What if the monitor falls off the diaper ? <p> If a RespisenseG monitor should become dislodged , which is unlikely , it will fail to detect babys movements and alert you to the situation . <p> What mattress can I use with RespisenseG monitors ? <p> RespisenseG is designed to work anywhere baby may fall asleep - on bedding of any type or thickness , on a picnic blanket or in grandmothers lap . It can be used in Moses baskets , hammock-style sleepers , carry cots , travel cots and slatted cots . Unlike traditional designs Respisense also works perfectly well with specialised bedding systems . RespisenseG was designed to travel and be used practically anywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Is a baby monitor like the Respisense necessary ? <p> Just like safety belts make travelling safer , RespisenseG can help to make babies first year safer by alerting someone when baby becomes dangerously inactive . In addition , the TummyTickleG vibrating mechanism imitates the tactile stimulation often used by nurses in hospitals Intensive Care Units on babies whove become motionless .

Track your personal cycle data for a lifetime , if you wish , and graph it to your heart 's content . <p> In brief , the user plots a numeric reading on a Cue chart each day . About a week before ovulation , electrolytes such as sodium and potassium appear in elevated amounts in the saliva .

As LH reaches its peak in the blood , there is a definite change in the reproductive tract which can be measured by the Cue vaginal sensor . Mucus secretion increases , and the electrolyte content of the mucus changes . This change causes a sharp , clear drop and increase in these readings . It is this nadir that the Cue uses to confirm ovulation . <h> How does the OvaCue System work ? <h> The OvaCue Fertility Monitor uses Zetek 's exclusive Electrolyte Method , the best method available for ovulation prediction and detection . <p> OvaCue measures the mix of electrolytes in your saliva . It stores and processes this information to precisely define your time of peak fertility . <p> The OvaCue is essentially a handheld ovulation computer . A press of a button tells you your fertility status for the day and on what day you can expect to be most fertile . <h> Ovulation prediction basics <p> Your body prepares for ovulation with complex changes in the output of hormones . About a week before ovulation , a threshold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one ovum is selected from among the many available in either of the two ovaries . This one ovum begins to grow and the uterus begins to be prepared to receive a possibly fertilized egg . <p> At the same time , other hormones are changing the amounts of minerals like sodium and potassium ( electrolytes ) that are kept or discarded by the body . This is what produces the Cue Peak , a high point in the salivary readings of electrolytes . <p> The OvaCue stores this information about your body and uses the patterns to accurately predict your time of ovulation . <h> Optional vaginal sensor to confirm ovulation <p> Most of our customers also purchase the optional vaginal sensor , which measures similar electrolytic changes in the reproductive system . While not required for predicting ovulation , the vaginal sensor allows you to confirm the onset and end of ovulation . <h> Tested and proven <p> The OvaCue is a patented device that has been proven , in a National Institutes of Health funded study , to accurately predict ovulation in 98% of cycles tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of couples conceive . The OvaCue is safe , reliable , and portable and has been approved for use as an aid to conception by the FDA and the Vatican . <h> OvaCue Fertility Monitor is the only practical method that both predicts and confirms ovulation . <h> Timing and accuracy are linked <h> Practicality and value <p> You have probably studied various methods of increasing your chances of conception . Perhaps you have tried many of them . If so , here is what you 've found : <p> Ultrasound : Nothing beats ultrasound for precisely determining the time of release of the ovum . The problem is that ultrasound can not predict ovulation , only confirm it . Therefore , unless you are being scanned several times a day , you are unlikely to receive confirmation in time to do anything about it . While useful in a medical context to establish whether you are indeed ovulating , ultrasound is expensive and impractical for planning conception . <p> Blood serum LH : Measuring LH in the blood is an excellent method for predicting ovulation in a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing a reasonable amount of time for deposition of semen . However , the necessity of frequent blood sampling makes it expensive and inappropriate for home use . <p> Urine LH sticks : After LH has peaked in the blood , it eventually makes its way into the urine and can be measured by a urine LH stick . The problem is , that by the time LH makes it to the urine , it is usually too late for sperm to be deposited in time to reach the egg while it is still viable , even if intercourse or AI occurs immediately . Not only does this method often provide insufficient advance notice , but frequent urine samples are required and stick color changes are not always easily interpreted . In addition , in Zetek 's NIH Phase II study , using various urine LH tests , a positive reading was not reached at all in 24% of the cycles we tested . <p> Temperature : You ca n't beat the price , but measuring basal body temperature ( BBT ) is useful only for confirming that ovulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At best , you can establish a pattern to your cycles and hope to guess correctly next month . <p> Ferning microscopes : Makers of these tools have picked up on the fact that salivary characteristics can indicate the onset of ovulation . However , the accuracy of these products is dependent on the user 's ability to interpret the results . In addition , extraneous factors such as stress ? and even the process of collecting saliva itself ? can distort the results . <h> OvaCue vs ClearPlan . <p> Simply speaking , OvaCue 's Electrolyte Method ? is more accurate , and therefore provides better guidance for timing conception . According to the ClearPlan Physician 's Manual , its positive signal falls outside the fertile period in over a quarter of the cycles tested . <p> In addition , many women find the daily handling of urine samples to be undesirable . And then there are those test sticks to buy . And buy . And buy ... <h> Ovulation Science , the Electrolyte Method and Ovacue <h> Patented method -- Proven results <p> In studies overseen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patented Electrolyte Method ? have been shown to predict ovulation with 98% accuracy . <h> You need advance notice <p> Release of the ovum or egg is called ovulation . Once the egg is released from the ovary and matures in the fallopian tubes , it will survive and be able to be fertilized for a very short time , at most about 24 hours and as a little as 8 hours . The other half of the conception process is the spermatozoa ( sperm ) . Healthy sperm can fertilize an egg for about 48 hours or more after their deposit in the woman . Sperm requires up to 24 hours to reach the egg . <p> It takes a woman 's body several days to prepare for ovulation . This process is managed by complex interaction of hormones . About a week before ovulation , a threshold of increasing amounts of the hormone estrogen is reached . At this time , one ovum is selected from among the many available in either of the two ovaries . This one ovum begins to grow and the uterus begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the same time , other hormones are changing the amounts of minerals like sodium and potassium ( electrolytes ) that are kept or discarded by the body . This is what produces the Cue Peak , a high point in the Cue salivary readings of electrolytes . <h> Why salivary electrolyte readings are better than urine LH <p> A few days after the Cue Peak , the luteinizing hormone ( LH ) in the blood increases and decreases very sharply over a period of 24 hours ( the LH peak ) . LH is the hormone that triggers the release of the ovum from the ovary . The egg is released within 24 hours after the LH is at its highest in the blood . <p> Some time ( as much as 12 hours ) after the peak of LH in the blood , LH is also present in the urine . It is this increasing concentration of urine LH that can be detected by the different brands of urine-based ovulation predictors . Prediction using this method depends on the exact relationships between the time of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the LH , and the time of the measurement . At best , the time between the urine signal and actual ovulation can not be more than 24 hours in advance . At worst , it is seen only after ovulation has already occurred , offering no chance of conception for the current cycle .
