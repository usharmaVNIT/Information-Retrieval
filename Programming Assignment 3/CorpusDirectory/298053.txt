However , little research has been done on Canadian news media representations of homelessness and their reflection of or influence on social norms and values . In this paper the authors review the literature exploring news media depictions of homelessness from the perspectives of news framing , media influence on social norms and values , and the construction of news . Examples from Canadian newspapers are provided to demonstrate the media 's framing and portrayal of people who are homeless or their issues and circumstances . In relation to the framing of the homeless and their situations , the authors describe four primary factors that influence the media in their selection of frames . The paper concludes with targeted analysis about the importance of understanding how and why the media frame their stories about the homeless as they do , and what further research is needed .

The plan calls for engaging key stakeholders in a collaborative community-response model , with critical attention given to meet the needs of diverse communities including Aboriginal people , youth with disabilities , newcomers and LGBTQ2S youth . <p> There is a focus on increasing supports , awareness and services dedicated to Aboriginal young people at risk of or experiencing homelessness in Calgary , including : <p> Conducting further research about the pathways into Aboriginal youth homelessness to help ensure services dedicated to Aboriginal young people ( at risk of or experiencing homelessness ) will be carried out in consideration of structural factors . <p> Recognizing the overrepresentation of Aboriginal young people that are at risk of or experiencing homelessness , the youth plan adopts the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will not be overrepresented in the homeless population .

This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , but will also help you distil your goals . <p> Your research and consultation may have told you new housing and supports were needed , but how much of what program/housing ? How much would this cost and to what effect ? These are basic questions decision makers will ask , but so too will the public . Releasing a youth plan without an indication of the resources required to execute it will pose a legitimacy risk . You may be able to mitigate this by noting you will work on such questions in implementation , but there is no reason why you ca n't consider including this piece of analysis during plan development . <p> Though other plans make it look easy , with infographics and simple dollar figures , the analysis that goes behind such business cases is no easy feat . <p> Here is what you need to know to get started : <p> First , know your limits . You and/or your team may not have the technical background to develop the necessary analysis . You may need to bring in an external expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can learn for future needs . You may also not have the necessary data to complete the modelling " in such a case , you may want to suggest such analysis is done during plan implementation . <p> Know however , that without a solid articulation of the impact that the proposed measures will have and the cost of these , it is going to be more difficult to credibly approach decision makers to support and invest in the plan . Budgeting and impact assessment , along with scenario building , are to a large degree interconnected and are in many ways different ways of interpreting the same information , building on one another as you go . <h> 1 . Prevalence of homelessness &amp; youth homelessness in your community <p> First , figure out local homelessness prevalence rates and calculate the youth prevalence from this general figure . The prevalence rate refers to the total number of sheltered and unsheltered homelessness person in your community during the course of one year . Cities usually represent this rate as a percentage of their general population " in Calgary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.8% . <p> Note that you are estimating the number of rough sleepers who would otherwise not be captured at any point during the year in the shelter data used . Ensure you account for possible duplication among diverse facilities as well . <p> You will also have to estimate how many of these individuals are youth ( up to 24 years old ) . It is best to use actual shelter and rough sleeper demographics from your HMIS or HIFIS for this and if these are unavailable at least general population demographics to generate an estimate . <p> Below is an example of what the results of this exercise can look like . <p> Table 26 : Estimating Youth Homelessness <p> Shelter <p> All Unique Individuals <p> Unique Youth <p> Singles Emergency Shelter <p> 468 <p> 20% <p> 94 <p> Women 's Emergency Shelter <p> 403 <p> 3% <p> 133 <p> Youth Emergency Shelter <p> 40 <p> 100% <p> 40 <p> Sub-total Shelter <p> 911 <p> 29% <p> 267 <p> Estimated Duplication <p> 13% <p> 13% <p> 35 <p> Re-calculated Shelter <p> 791 <p> 29% <p> 231 <p> Rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experiencing Homelessness <p> 831 <p> 28% <p> 235 <p> Estimated Prevalence Rate ( 2015 General Pop . 100,000 total ) <p> 0.8% <p> 25.0% <p> 0.2% <h> 2 . Estimate of the at-risk population <p> Calculate an estimate of the total number of youth at risk of homelessness in your community . You can do this through an analysis of extreme core housing need using Census data to determine the number of individuals renting and paying more than 50% of income on shelter with low incomes ( under $20,000 ) . Break this figure out by age groups to gain a sense of the youth component . <p> You may also be able to complement this data with available information from public systems on youth discharges into homelessness from corrections , child protection , health , treatment , etc . <p> Note that because Census data is dated ( 2011 ) , you will need to project current totals based on historic population growth . You can also estimate the total number of individuals from the household data by looking at census information on average household size . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Homelessness type and acuity among at-risk groups estimates <p> Using the available data , you can develop an analysis of the at-risk and homeless youth population to estimate the breakout of level of acuity . <p> You can use HMIS or HIFIS information to generate this estimated acuity breakout based on the most recent annual data or provide a placeholder until you have actual data from community input and service provider reports . Ensure you project population growth for the entire implementation time period to ensure adequate resources are allocated . <p> Looking at both calculations , we can see that we have a total of about 1,242 youth at risk of experiencing homelessness and/or who experience transitional homelessness and 53 youth who use shelters or sleep rough for a total of 1,295 total youth who may need an intervention by 2018 . <p> Table 28 : Projecting Needs <p> Homeless Population <p> 2015 <p> 2016 <p> 2017 <p> 2018 <p> Rough Sleepers <p> 20 <p> 20 <p> 21 <p> 21 <p> Youth Rough Sleepers ( 10% ) <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 3 <p> Shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youth Shelter Users ( 20% ) <p> 47 <p> 48 <p> 49 <p> 50 <p> At-risk Homeless Population <p> Year <p> 2011 <p> 2012 <p> 2013 <p> 2014 <p> 2015 <p> 2016 <p> 2017 <p> 2018 <p> Total Individuals <p> 4,236 <p> 4,333 <p> 4,433 <p> 4,535 <p> 4,639 <p> 4,746 <p> 4,855 <p> 4,967 <p> Total Youth Individuals ( 25% ) <p> 1,059 <p> 1,083 <p> 1,108 <p> 1,134 <p> 1,160 <p> 1,187 <p> 1,214 <p> 1,242 <p> Growth Rate : 2.3% <p> After we split out the acuity levels by homeless/at-risk groups , we have a good sense of what capacity would be needed to serve projected demand by 2018 .

System capacity and performance analysis <p> Provide a breakdown of current homeless services and housing youth access per program type or specifically target youth and their most current performance indicators where possible . This includes such indicators as turnover rates annually , caseload capacities , bed/unit inventory , negative exits , length of stay and cost per program/housing space . Note any eligibility requirements that have an impact on youth . <p> To classify programs , you can use local definitions , or look to the Performance Management Toolkit for consistent definitions and benchmark indicators of performance . The turnover rate reflects how many new clients in any given year went through the program as a percentage of the total caseload capacity of the program . Negative exits represent total clients who exited to homelessness ( rough sleeping , shelter , jail , etc. ) as a percent of total exits in a particular year . The program space cost is calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the example below , you can see , by comparing the youth caseload to the total caseload , not all programs serve youth exclusively . In fact , average caseload for youth of all programs is 29% . You will need to consider if this level of access is proportional to the estimated need , but try to dig even deeper to determine how outcomes for youth compare to those of adults . Are there subgroups of youth ( Indigenous , immigrants , etc. ) that differ in access and outcomes ? How does this play out from a cost analysis perspective ? <h> 5 . Modelling solutions <p> Based on the previous steps , you will need to evaluate what type of interventions are best suited to ending homelessness in your community in your particular timeframe ( ex . Two , five , 10 years ) , as well as the associated costs and capacity needs . <p> Surprisingly , you may find that you have adequate capacity to meet the needs of certain groups , but have performance issues that need addressing in other areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalized recommendations , without a solid sense of cost and impact . <p> From the example below , you can see there will be a total of 113 youth served by 2018 if the system continues as is . We know higher acuity youth with longer homelessness histories will likely benefit from supportive housing and intensive case management ( ICM ) . Conversely , youth who experience transitional homelessness or are at-risk of homelessness are more likely to benefit from rapid rehousing and prevention services . As a result , we can estimate that lower acuity youth at-risk/experiencing transitional homelessness will remain underserved with the current performance and capacity in the system . <p> By playing with the numbers , we can estimate what it would take to eliminate youth homelessness in terms of new program capacity , but also what impact enhanced performance might have on turnover and negative exits . The turnover in the model , for instance , assumes that current negative exits and turnover rates remain consistent , but what if these improved ? We can model what impact enhanced performance would have . Improvements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same level of funding . <p> Once you work out some scenarios , you can also model costs for maximum impact . Capital solutions will likely be the costliest , though may be critical for particular groups of youth . You can also play with program costs to potentially create efficiencies in some cases . In the scenario below , new ICM spaces are modelled to estimate the costs of the enhancement over the set time period . This can be done with all program types , depending on need . <p> Once you 've completed the analysis , develop a summary with a proposed course of action but also outline at least three scenarios for the consideration of the broader planning group . Ensure you provide a full assessment of risks and record all your assumptions so future work can build on your calculations in implementation .

Individuals and families who wind up homeless may not share much in common with each other , aside from the fact that they are extremely vulnerable , and lack adequate housing and income and the necessary supports to ensure they stay housed . The causes of homelessness reflect an intricate interplay between structural factors , systems failures and individual circumstances . Homelessness is usually the result of the cumulative impact of a number of factors , rather than a single cause . <p> Structural factors are economic and societal issues that affect opportunities and social environments for individuals .

The millions of Canadian families and individuals living in " core need " ( paying more than 50% of their income on housing ) are at serious risk of homelessness , as are families and individuals spending more than 30% of their income on housing. - Arguably , the most impactful factor is the lack of affordable housing nationwide however ; discrimination can impede access to employment , housing , justice and helpful services . Racial and sexual minorities are at greater risk of such discrimination . <p> Systems failures occur when other systems of care and support fail , requiring vulnerable people to turn to the homelessness sector , when other mainstream services could have prevented this need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare , inadequate discharge planning for people leaving hospitals , corrections and mental health and addictions facilities and a lack of support for immigrants and refugees . <p> Individual and relational factors apply to the personal circumstances of a homeless person , and may include : traumatic events ( e.g. house fire or job loss ) , personal crisis ( e.g. family break-up or domestic violence ) , mental health and addictions challenges ( including brain injury and fetal alcohol syndrome ) , which can be both a cause and consequence of homelessness and physical health problems or disabilities . Relational problems can include family violence and abuse , addictions , and mental health problems of other family members and extreme poverty . <p> There is an undeniable connection between domestic violence and homelessness .

If federal investment in affordable housing increases to just $106 annually per Canadian , an increase of only 88 cents per person weekly , we can see an end to chronic homelessness and help others who are on the brink of becoming homeless . <p> The Canadian Observatory on Homelessness is a non-profit , non-partisan research institute that is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homelessness .

Discrimination occurs when an individual is treated differently than another solely on the basis of some characteristic or indeed an interplay of characteristics such as race , sexual orientation , religion , physical disability , mental illness , age , citizenship status , gender , and/or socioeconomic status . Discrimination significantly impacts the options and choices of individuals when it comes to all sorts of things in life such as employment , housing and access to services that all contribute to an increased risk of experiencing homelessness . In addition , people experiencing homelessness often face restricted access to many of the spaces and places that domiciled individuals typically enjoy , including both public ( parks , streets , etc. ) and private spaces ( restaurants , stores and malls , for instance ) .

Commonly reoccurring discriminatory practices include : <p> In particular , single mothers experience discrimination from landlords based on their age , family size , low income , receiving welfare , race , language proficiency and a lack of references . <p> Research demonstrates that immigrant populations of Jamaican and Somali origin cited experiencing discrimination in Toronto based on multiple factors in addition to race , including income level , citizenship status , religion and family size when compared to their Polish immigrant counterparts . <p> Many individuals are denied housing based on their low socioeconomic status , if they are recipients of social assistance , or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individuals have stated this being a direct precursor to needing to seek emergency shelter accommodation . <p> One study found- that G " of individuals seeking housing will face discrimination and be denied housing based on their mental illness . <p> Often times , minimum income or affordability requirements- will be imposed upon prospective tenants , to which those who are more likely to be of lower socioeconomic status ( youth , people with disabilities , single mothers , newcomers ) will be unlikely to meet . <p> A study by- CMHC- found that in Winnipeg , - Indigenous Peoples are commonly denied housing . One in three individuals surveyed scoping out a potential listing were told it had already been rented , thus pushing the individual to seek housing in uninhabitable regions . <p> From these findings , it is clear that individuals who find themselves subjected to discrimination based on singular or variously intersected elements of their identity consistently face barriers to obtaining housing .

Factors that deny individuals housing also work to impede employment and educational opportunities , and can lead to an increased risk of homelessness via a lack of stable income . For instance : <p> Racialized youth often face discrimination- that is found to impact schooling- and thus educational attainment , restricting opportunities for upward mobility and breaking free from non-precarious , entry-level employment . <p> Employment discrimination based on disability is a widely prevalent issue. - Research demonstrates- that working-age persons with physical and/or mental health disabilities are less likely to hold paid jobs than other Canadians due to discrimination based on an applicant 's disability and/or a lack of supports and accommodations in the workplace . <p> Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation commonly impacts LGBTQ2S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found- that in the U.S. , employment discrimination costs $64 billion annually in expenses related to individuals who leave their jobs due to a toxic , discriminatory workplace environment . <p> Across OECD countries , employment discrimination based on race is consistently demonstrated. - Researchers have found- that applications with white-sounding names are 50% more likely to receive a call back for a job when compared to their counterparts with racially or religiously distinctive names . <p> Single mothers often face discriminatory employment practices , as potential employers- may be hesitant- to hire single parent applicants conscious of the demands of parenting and possible conflicts with availability and scheduling , facilitating a greater risk of poverty for this demographic . <p> Additionally , due to the stigma associated with homelessness , - employers are commonly cited- to be apprehensive in hiring individuals who have experienced homelessness . <p> From this , discrimination as a barrier to employment as well as housing is inextricably linked with homelessness , as it impacts one 's ability to obtain housing , work or an education thus contributing to a cycle of poverty that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canada 's national housing strategy we have an opportunity to implement an- anti-discrimination framework- that works to identify and combat the role discrimination plays for many Canadians in obtaining safe , secure and affordable housing .

After tracing the history of neoliberal politics globally and in Ontario , I consider two examples of women 's attempts to shape poverty policy drawn from ethnographic research in the legislature . The first centers on a social assistance recipient who was unexpectedly thrust into the media spotlight , thus given a chance to speak publicly about Ontario 's welfare policies . The second focuses on a consciously planned challenge to policy by a coalition of feminist researchers and front-line workers .

Approximately 25-40% of youth experiencing homelessness in North America identify as LGBTQ2S ( Abramovich , 2012 ; Ray , 2006 ; Cochran et al. , 2002 ) . However , it is difficult to know exactly how many LGBTQ2S youth are experiencing homelessness at any given point in time , for a variety of reasons . For example , support services , shelters , and street needs assessments often do not include questions about LGBTQ2S identity , and if they do , many queer and trans youth may not feel safe disclosing their gender or sexual identities , due to safety concerns . Hidden homelessness is also a significant concern for LGBTQ2S youth , especially those living in rural communities , making it highly unlikely that they would be included in statistics and key reports on youth homelessness. - <p> Identity-based family conflict resulting from a young person coming out as LGBTQ2S is a major contributing factor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al. , 2010 ; Ray , 2006 ) . LGBTQ2S youth are particularly vulnerable to mental health concerns , and face increased risk of physical &amp; sexual exploitation , substance use &amp; suicide ( Denomme-Welch et al. , 2008 ; Ray 2006 ) . Transgender youth have needs that are distinct from those of lesbian , gay , and bisexual youth . For example , they may need transition related health care , including access to hormones or surgery , or help getting I 'd and legal name change sorted out . Shelter workers tend to struggle most with issues regarding access to services for trans and gender non-conforming youth . <p> Through my research , I have found that factors such as institutional erasure , homophobic and transphobic violence that is rarely dealt with , and discrimination make it difficult for LGBTQ2 youth experiencing homelessness to access shelters , resulting in queer and trans youth feeling safer on the streets than in shelters and support services . <p> Family rejection , inadequate social services , and discrimination in housing , employment , and education make it difficult for LGBTQ2S youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homophobic and transphobic discrimination and violence in shelters and housing programs have resulted in an underrepresentation of LGBTQ2S youth accessing such programs .

@@37764525 @6764525/ <p> The population of seniors in Atlantic Canada differs from that in other Canadian provinces in three main respects . First , the proportion of the region 's senior population is higher and growing faster than in other provinces , resulting in a greater demand for a wider variety of housing options . With the exception of Newfoundland at 14.4% , the Atlantic Provinces have the highest percentages of seniors in the country . For example , the total population of Nova Scotia is expected to decline by approximately four and a half percent ( 4.69% ) between 2007 and 2033 . The 55 " 64 age group will decline similarly ( 4.86% ) between 2007 and 2033 . In contrast , the seniors ' population ( 65+ ) is projected to increase 86.3% between 2007 and 2033 to 257,874 .

Finally , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic Provinces ' population , including seniors , live in rural areas .

@@37764543 @6764543/ <h> Homelessness Questions &amp; Answers <p> Answers to many of the questions surrounding homelessness and poverty issues . <p> 1 ) What is homelessness ? Homelessness is an extreme form of poverty characterized by the instability of housing and the inadequacy of income , health care supports and social supports . This definition includes people who are absolutely homeless ( those living on the streets , sometimes referred to as " rough sleepers " ) ; shelter dwellers ( people staying temporarily in emergency shelters or hostels ) ; the " hidden homeless " ( people staying temporarily with friends or family ) , and others who are described as under housed or " at risk " of homelessness . <p> When people lose their housing , they often move in temporarily with friends or family , a practice known as " couch surfing " . If the option of moving in with friends and/or family is not ( or is no longer ) available because of weak social capital or a lack of steady income , many people will stay in temporary emergency shelters , or end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban centres , but are not generally available in rural areas and small towns . <p> If they are able to generate money , people who experience homelessness may rent motel rooms , move into rooming houses , or with friends , temporarily . Others will sleep " rough " in parks , along alleyways , on rooftops , or under bridges . Most people who are homeless move through a variety of temporary and unstable living situations , which makes generating income , maintaining health , keeping safe , nurturing healthy relationships and obtaining permanent housing extremely challenging . <p> Homelessness , then , is not defined strictly by an absolute lack of shelter ( though this is the most obvious manifestation of it ) , but rather by the intersection of a range of social exclusionary factors that exacerbate poverty , limit opportunities and create barriers to full participation in Canadian society . Real political solutions to homelessness rest not only in addressing the inadequate supply of affordable housing in Canada , but also in improving income security , equitable access to health care supports ( including mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 ) Different types of homelessness Homeless or " houseless people " fall into three very clear categories : the absolute homeless , the concealed homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless . <p> Absolute Homelessness Homeless persons are defined as people " sleeping rough " or using public or private shelters . People sleeping rough , which means in the street , in public places are those forming the core population of the " homeless " . Those sleeping in shelters provided by welfare or other institutions are considered part of this population . Persons or households living under these circumstances will furthermore be defined as " homeless " . <p> Concealed Homelessness People who are homeless , but temporarily housed with friends or family form another category of the " homeless " - referred to as " concealed homelessness . " Another , not obvious side of the problem is " concealed homelessness . " Under this category falls all people living with family members or friends because they can not afford shelter themselves . Without this privately offered housing opportunity , they would be living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare system . The extent of this phenomenon is extremely difficult to calculate . <p> At risk of Homelessness In addition to absolute and concealed homelessness , some people are at risk of losing their housing and can be categorized as people at " risk of homelessness . " <p> Another group living under the threat of " homelessness " are those facing the risk of losing their shelter either by eviction or lease expiry , with no other possibility of shelter in view . Prisoners or people living in other institutions facing their release and having no place to go to , are considered part of this population . <p> Finally , we need to recognize that there are many Canadians who are inadequately housed . While being inadequately housed is not the same as being homeless , it can lead to being at risk of homelessness . Most of the people who become homeless started off being inadequately housed . <p> Before becoming homeless , many people have been living in " substandard housing " situations . Households with feeble and perhaps insecure income are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of economic difficulties . Their situation is somehow comparable with those without shelter , as they are all deprived of the human right of a housing situation without health hazards , allowing the full development of the individuals ' capacities . Therefore , the population living in substandard houses should be included in the study of homelessness . From www.raisingtheroof.org <p> 3 ) Why does homelessness generate so much debate and confusion ? While there should be no difficulty in understanding the nature of the problem , there is indeed a great deal of confusion and debate . Service providers , policy makers , researchers , citizens and politicians tend to use the term in many different ways . The confusion is due to conceptual imprecision , fuzzy boundaries , the influence of political agendas , the heterogeneity of the homeless population , and the assumptions and attitudes of the housed population . <p> This confusion is caused by two factors- one political and one practical . Defining homelessness for policy and program purposes ( i.e. , taking action ) requires compromises between concerns for social injustice , economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of authorities - levels of government , in partnership with agencies and charities - to take responsibility . Taking responsibility means allocating resources and imposing regulations and changes in those institutions and practices which are producing homelessness , and which stand in the way of addressing existing and preventing further homelessness . <p> The confusion and inaction is also attributable to the fact that homelessness is the outcome of a very complex set of social processes . These processes include : Global economic restructuring ( including deindustrialization and labour market changes ) ; Restructuring of the welfare state ( national , provincial and local welfare and income maintenance policy and programs ) ; Demographic change ( more single person and single parent households ) ; Change in social attitudes and lifestyles ; A housing system in crisis ( gentrification , conversions , low vacancy rates , cuts in social housing supply and general housing assistance , etc. ) ; and An inadequate system of supports for vulnerable groups , including people who require assistance with mental illness and substance abuse problems . <p> These major contextual issues are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are difficult to grasp and sort out . From www.raisingtheroof.org <p> 4 ) Is n't homelessness a mental health and substance use problem ? Substance Use The relationship between substance use and homelessness is complex . While rates of substance use are disproportionately high among the homeless population , homelessness can not be explained by substance use alone . The use of substances alone does not necessarily signal addiction , nor a harmful or problematic lifestyle . In addition , many people who are addicted to substances never become homeless , but an individual that is experiencing housing instability , often due to low income , has an increased risk of losing their housing if they use substances . Once on the streets , an individual with substance use issues has little chance of getting housing as they face insurmountable barriers to obtaining health care , including substance use treatment services and recovery supports . <p> The term " substance use " refers to all types of drug and alcohol use . It is used in place of the traditional label of " drug abuse " which perpetuates social stigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports they need . The term " use " signals a push to reduce the harms for all users - from the person who uses drugs or alcohol occasionally , to someone who has a serious addiction . The term " substance " , rather than drugs , better reflects the full range of psychoactive substances including alcohol , cigarettes , illegal drugs , prescription drugs , solvents , and inhalants that are habit-forming . <p> The potential harms associated with the use of substances are many . This includes pharmacological effects of the substance itself that may impair a person 's ability to safely and competently make decisions and carry out tasks that they engage in . Problematic substance use may lead to deteriorating health ; accidental death ; and increased chances of risky sexual behaviours . Other harms that may result from problematic use of substances include : the inability to work or stay in school , ruptured relations with family , friends and community members , and problems with the law . <p> Responses to substance use are varied . They include : prevention ( which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , treatment ( for those whose substance use is considered problematic ) , harm reduction ( programs that seek to reduce the risk of substance use ) and enforcement . The latter point is important . In Canada , as elsewhere , the use of substances is highly politicized , meaning that some potentially harmful substances are legal ( cigarettes and alcohol , prescription drugs ) , while others are not . As a result , a potential " harm " of substance use is getting arrested . <p> People who live on the streets and engage in substance use face many risks , one of which is difficulty obtaining and maintaining employment and housing . The frequency of such problems suggests the potential viability of harm reduction programs that provide a safe environment for stabilization to clients who are unable to maintain abstinence . As well , stable supportive housing is needed to give people an environment in which they are better able to deal with their substance use problems . <p> Transitional housing is frequently recognized as an approach to addressing substance use problems , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often though , these housing options require abstinence in order to accept clients . The result is that many people fail to qualify , and remain on the streets or in environments that are not conducive to addressing their substance use problems . And even if they do complete treatment , because of a lack of supported housing options , once they are discharged from hospital or treatment center , many people with substance use issues have no place to live , a situation which puts their recovery in jeopardy . <p> Mental Health People with poor mental health are more susceptible to the three main factors that can lead to homelessness : poverty , disaffiliation , and personal vulnerability . Because they often lack the capacity to sustain employment , they have little income . Delusional thinking may lead them to withdraw from friends , family and other people . This loss of support leaves them fewer coping resources in times of trouble . Mental illness can also impair a person 's ability to be resilient and resourceful ; it can cloud thinking and impair judgment . For all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of becoming homeless . <p> Homelessness , in turn , amplifies poor mental health . The stress of being homeless may exacerbate previous mental illness and encourage anxiety , fear , depression , sleeplessness and substance use .

When providing care to people who are homeless , it is essential to create a non-threatening and supportive atmosphere , address basic needs ( e.g. food and shelter ) , and provide accessible care . <p> People with mental illness remain homeless for longer periods of time and have less contact with family and friends . 30-35 percent of homeless people , in general , and up to 75 percent of homeless women specifically , have a mental illness . 20-25 percent of homeless people suffer from concurrent disorders ( severe mental illness and addictions ) . People who have a severe mental illness are over-represented in the homeless population , as they are often released from hospitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health services play an important role . Homelessness could be drastically reduced if people with severe mental illness were able to access supportive housing , as well as other necessary community supports . They encounter more barriers to employment and tend to be in poorer health than other homeless people . Housing outreach services that provide a safe place to live are a vital component of stabilizing the illness and helping individuals on their journey to recovery . <p> 5 ) Who are people who are homeless ? No one is safe from experiencing homelessness . No one chooses to be homeless and it can happen to anyone . In most cases , it is the intersection of structural factors , personal histories and individual characteristics that lead to homelessness . Structural factors include : the growing gap between the rich and the poor , the decrease in affordable housing supply ; the decrease in services , supports and social assistance ; and , discrimination and racism . Personal histories and individual characteristics include : catastrophic events ; loss of employment ; family break up ; onset of mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members ; a history of physical , sexual or emotional abuse ; and , involvement in the child welfare system . Every community in Canada has homeless people , even if you do n't see them on the street . Most homeless people do n't live on the street . <p> Working poor and single-parent families with children often live in crowded housing . They are unable to afford a decent place to live while feeding and clothing their children . About one-in-seven users of shelters across Canada is a child . Women are vulnerable to becoming homeless as they are often victims of family violence and generally earn less than men . Newcomers to the rental housing market - especially young people , immigrants and refugees - are required to rent housing that they can not afford and are one cheque away from eviction . Many seniors face eviction and homelessness due to fixed incomes , increased rents and taxes and a decline in physical and mental health . Many homeless youth , particularly gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender youth , are living in shelters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities are often at risk of homelessness due to racial prejudice and employment disparities . Aboriginal people experience many of these contributing factors as well as migration ; third world housing conditions ( on-reserve ) ; loss of cultural identity ; and , the residential school system . <p> Understanding the factors that lead to homelessness is not easy considering the heterogeneity of the population , and the fact that there are many pathways to homelessness . More and more , researchers are recognizing that any analysis of homelessness must take account of the distinct challenges that specific sub-populations face . More and more community organizations are beginning to recognize the value of good demographic data for rationalizing their local service programs for homeless people . By using such tools as a database to track demographics and characteristics of their clients , they can better focus on specific approaches and services that match the people they are serving . While collecting data can not resolve all of their priorities or make all of their decisions it helps to provide clarity and a starting point for planning appropriate programs and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeless ? Government benefits can in some cases be preventative of and responsive to causes and impacts of homelessness . Federally , such government benefits include : Employment Insurance and Regular Benefits ; a Skills Development Program ; Self-Employment Benefits ; Maternity , Parental or Sickness Benefits ; An Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities ; Canada Pension Plan , Old Age Security , and rent allowances . Additionally , there are provincial government benefits that differ from province to province . They may offer all or some of the following : income support/social assistance , employment supplements ; programs for persons with barriers to employment ; or vocational rehabilitation programs . <p> Contrary to popular opinion , very few homeless people receive government benefits . Because of this , they need to generate income in other ways , such as through panhandling , squeegeeing and the sex trade . In many cases , homeless people are entitled to various government benefits - including social assistance , disability and pension benefits " but experience barriers ( e.g. administrative processes , timeline constraints , a lack of I 'd or personal address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called welfare ) is the income program of last resort in Canada . It provides money to individuals and families whose resources are inadequate to meet their needs . Although people talk about welfare as a single entity , there are 13 welfare systems in Canada : one in each province and territory . <p> Most people living on social assistance were poorer ( in inflation-adjusted terms ) in the 1990s than the people living on welfare in the 1980s , according to the National Council of Welfare , a federal government appointed advisory and research group reporting to the Minister of Human Resources . People on welfare are invariably poor , but the depth of poverty is getting worse , according to the National Council . Single employable people on welfare fare the worst , with incomes as low as one-fifth of the poverty line . The incomes of all welfare households in all provinces were well below the poverty line , as measured by Statistics Canada 's low-income cut-offs . <p> The Ontario government 's 21.6 percent cut in social assistance payments in October 1995 was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , together with other social assistance cuts , resulted in a net decrease of nearly 24 percent between 1994 and 1996 for Ontario 's social assistance recipients . How many low- or even moderate-income households can sustain a loss of about a quarter of their cash income without facing serious difficulties ? <p> The federal government also cut its transfer payments to the provinces for social assistance during the mid-1990s . From 1966 until March 1996 , the federal government paid a share of the cost of welfare and social services under the terms of the Canada Assistance Plan ( CAP ) . On April 1 , 1996 , the federal government replaced CAP with the Canada Health and Social Transfer ( CHST ) . The CHST is a " block fund " covering Medicare and post-secondary education as well as welfare and social services . Ottawa 's support for these important programs decreased by 16 percent between 1996 and 1998 - a cut in transfer payments to provinces that some provinces simply passed on to low-income households . Thus , both senior levels of government have contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for adequate food and housing . <p> The housing portion of social assistance payments was never enough to cover the actual rent payment . The gap is much larger now . Benefits have decreased across the country , yet rents do not decrease . From www.raisingtheroof.org <p> 7 ) What is the health status of people who do not have housing ? The health of populations - individuals , their families and communities - is determined by the complex interaction of many factors - social , political , economic , legal , cultural , historical and biomedical . Of these determinants of health , income has long been recognized as one of the most important . People with higher incomes and higher socio-economic statuses tend to live longer , have lower rates of illness and injury , and are more likely to report that they have good or excellent health . People living in poverty have a lower life expectancy and higher rates of illness across a wide spectrum of diseases . Poor health predisposes individuals and families to homelessness and homelessness exposes individuals and families to particular health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect their overall short- and long-term health and contribute to an increased mortality rate . Although deaths among the homeless are occasionally due to freezing , they are mainly the result of injury , and the rigors of street life . Climatic conditions , psychological strain and exposure to communicable disease create and lead to a range of chronic and acute health problems , including injury from cold , tuberculosis , skin diseases , cardio-respiratory disease , nutritional deficiencies , sleep deprivation , musculoskeletal pain and dental trouble . <p> Being homeless makes it difficult , and in some cases impossible , to access general health care services . The homeless are unable to : obtain medical treatment without a health card ( applicants require an address ) ; pay for items not covered by provincial medical or drug insurance plans ; receive adequate treatment in cases where their personal appearance alarms health providers ; make a health appointment ( lack of an address and telephone ) ; and receive coordinated care when comprehensive medical records are not kept in one location with one provider . <p> Following treatment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow-up healthcare . People who are homeless have no place to recuperate and no consistent caregiver . As a result , health care delivery to homeless individuals is concentrated in emergency departments , in the core of large urban centers and in the institutions set up to address their lack of shelter and social supports . There is a need to respond to the acute and chronic health problems of this population and to redirect attention to preventive health . <p> Whether as a cause or a consequence of i 'll health , homelessness has emerged as a fundamental health issue for Canadians . Homelessness affects a significant number of Canadians of all ages and is associated with a high burden of illness , yet the health care system may not adequately meet the needs of homeless people . The main barriers to good health , among the homeless , include a lack of adequate , safe , accessible and affordable housing that is linked to employability , community support , personal health care and access to health services . <p> 8 ) Do n't some people choose to be homeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the street and into stable adequate housing . A homeless existence is characterized by demeaning environments , numerous threats to survival , and the most abject poverty affecting every aspect of daily existence . <p> Some people who find themselves without housing do choose to avoid using some or all of the emergency shelters because of the rules , the potential for violence , theft and so on . When the range of choices is limited to an emergency shelter or making do elsewhere , it is difficult to call this " choosing to be on the streets . " <p> Among the general population , many people make bad choices at some time in their lives . For those on the economic margin , a bad choice can result in becoming unhoused . The alienation and deprivations that accompany life on the streets do not help people learn new and better choices . Sometimes , the effect is just the opposite . <p> Most people will never know what it is like to try to survive without housing .

@@37764549 @6764549/ <p> Young people who are homeless face considerable barriers to obtaining and maintaining employment . These barriers are best understood through the concept of social exclusion , or the degree to which individual experiences and histories overlap with certain social , political and economic conditions such as poverty , unemployment , inadequate housing , sexism , racism and homophobia . These factors can restrict young people 's access to spaces , institutions , and practices that increase opportunities and reduce risk .

While rates of substance use are disproportionately high among those experiencing homelessness , homelessness can not be explained by substance use alone . The use of substances alone does not necessarily signal addiction or a harmful/problematic lifestyle . In addition , many people who are addicted to substances never experience homelessness , but an individual that is experiencing housing instability , often due to low income , has an increased risk of losing their housing if they use substances . Once on the streets , an individual with substance use issues has little chance of getting housing as they face insurmountable barriers to obtaining health care , including substance use treatment services and recovery supports. - <p> The term " substance use " refers to all types of drug and alcohol use .

The research comes from my recently defended PhD thesis . <p> Neighbourhoods can play an important role in the lives of homeless and vulnerably housed individuals . People might receive support from different places throughout their neighbourhoods , such as drop-in centres and community health centres . Accessing services is particularly important for homeless individuals , as it has been linked to successfully exiting homelessness . However , changes in the neighbourhood can have negative impacts on homeless and vulnerably housed individuals . For example , when low-income properties are purchased by individuals with higher incomes , this gentrification can make the neighbourhood unaffordable for low-income individuals , leading them to move to new neighbourhoods . As well , the low-income individuals who are able to stay may feel less of a connection with their changing neighbourhood . <p> My research recognized the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community integration among a group of homeless and vulnerably housed adults in Ottawa .

I used both quantitative ( numerical data ) and qualitative ( the participants ' own words ) methods to help me address my research goals .

Several other factors were related to psychological integration . Older individuals , individuals living in high quality housing ( including those living in shelters ) , and individuals residing in neighbourhoods perceived as having positive impacts on them all reported higher levels of psychological integration . <p> Results from my qualitative study found that individuals with higher levels of integration were more likely to have the kind of housing they wanted and were generally satisfied with their housing .

Therefore , community agencies should continue to recognize the importance of social support when developing rehousing plans . The results also highlight the importance of age , and housing and neighbourhood quality in developing bonds to one 's neighbourhood . It may be important to reach out to younger individuals to promote community integration , since an older age was related to higher psychological integration .

We researched two main aspects : access to health care and the status of some key social determinants of health .

The current study is a phenomenological inquiry into the experiences of environmental justice and injustice in a community of people who are experiencing homelessness . To understand how people who experience homelessness in the Waterloo Region , Ontario , community conceptualize and experience their environment in terms of cleanliness , healthfulness , safety , and justice , 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted with people experiencing absolute homelessness in Kitchener and Cambridge , Ontario . Analysis shows that although knowledge of systemic environmental injustices is all but absent in this community , particular phenomena do stand out as critical issues , such as substandard rooming houses , drugs and alcohol , litter and pollution , and the behavior of police officers and city officials . Analysis also unveiled a significant dissatisfaction with municipal decision-making processes .

Methods : The mortality was studied in a cohort comprising 1,757 men and 526 women compared with the general population and persons with inpatient treatment for alcohol- and drug-related disorders . The follow-up period was from 1995 to 1997 until the end of 2005 . The causes of death were analyzed . Results : 421 deaths occurred during the follow-up period . The relative risk of death was 3.1 , with no difference in mortality between homeless men and homeless women . Previous treatment for alcohol and drug abuse disorders was related to excess mortality and previous treatment for mental disease to lower mortality .
