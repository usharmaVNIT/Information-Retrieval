While cells , tissues , and organs may perform very different functions , all the cells in the body are similar in their metabolic needs . Maintaining a constant internal environment by providing the cells with what they need to survive ( oxygen , nutrients , and removal of waste ) is necessary for the well-being of individual cells and of the entire body . The many processes by which the body controls its internal environment are collectively called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeostasis . <h> Homeostasis <p> Homeostasis refers to stability , balance , or equilibrium within a cell or the body . It is an organism 's ability to keep a constant internal environment . Homeostasis is an important characteristic of living things . Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell . The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation . Because the internal and external environments of a cell are constantly changing , adjustments must be made continuously to stay at or near the set point ( the normal level or range ) . Homeostasis can be thought of as a dynamic equilibrium rather than a constant , unchanging state . <p> Feedback Regulation Loops <p> The endocrine system plays an important role in homeostasis because hormones regulate the activity of body cells . The release of hormones into the blood is controlled by a stimulus . For example , the stimulus either causes an increase or a decrease in the amount of hormone secreted . Then , the response to a stimulus changes the internal conditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called feedback regulation . <p> Feedback regulation occurs when the response to a stimulus has an effect of some kind on the original stimulus . The type of response determines what the feedback is called . Negative feedback occurs when the response to a stimulus reduces the original stimulus . Positive feedback occurs when the response to a stimulus increases the original stimulus . <p> Thermoregulation : A Negative Feedback Loop <p> Negative feedback is the most common feedback loop in biological systems . The system acts to reverse the direction of change . Since this tends to keep things constant , it allows the maintenance of homeostatic balance . For instance , when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the human body increases , the lungs are signaled to increase their activity and exhale more carbon dioxide , ( your breathing rate increases ) . Thermoregulation is another example of negative feedback . When body temperature rises , receptors in the skin and the hypothalamus sense the temperature change . The temperature change ( stimulus ) triggers a command from the brain . This command , causes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin surface dilate ) , which helps decrease body temperature . Figure 1 shows how the response to a stimulus reduces the original stimulus in another of the body 's negative feedback mechanisms . <p> Figure 1 : Control of blood glucose level is an example of negative feedback . Blood glucose concentration rises after a meal ( the stimulus ) . The hormone insulin is released by the pancreas , and it speeds up the transport of glucose from the blood and into selected tissues ( the response ) . Blood glucose concentrations then decrease , which then decreases the original stimulus . The secretion of insulin into the blood is then decreased . <p> Positive feedback is less common in biological systems . Positive feedback acts to speed up the direction of change . An example of positive feedback is lactation ( milk production ) . As the baby suckles , nerve messages from the mammary glands cause the hormone prolactin , to be secreted by the pituitary gland . The more the baby suckles , the more prolactin is released , which stimulates further milk production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on positive feedback . Positive feedback speeds up the direction of change , which leads to increasing hormone concentration , a state that moves further away from homeostasis . <h> System Interactions <p> Each body system contributes to the homeostasis of other systems and of the entire organism . No system of the body works in isolation and the well-being of the person depends upon the well-being of all the interacting body systems . A disruption within one system generally has consequences for several additional body systems . Most of these organ systems are controlled by hormones secreted from the pituitary gland , a part of the endocrine system . Table 1 summarizes how various body systems work together to maintain homeostasis . <p> Main examples of homeostasis in mammals are as follows : <p> The regulation of the amounts of water and minerals in the body . This is known as osmoregulation . This happens primarily in the kidneys . The removal of metabolic waste . This is known as excretion . This is done by the excretory organs such as the kidneys and lungs . The regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . The regulation of blood glucose level . This is mainly done by the liver and the insulin and glucagon secreted by the pancreas in the body . <p> Release of insulin and glucagon into the blood in response to rising and falling blood glucose levels , respectively ; increase in breathing rate in response to increases carbon dioxide levels in the blood , and release of carbon dioxide into exhaled air from lungs , secretion of erythropoietin by kidneys to stimulate formation of red blood cells <h> Endocrine System <p> The endocrine system , shown in Figure 2 , includes glands which secrete hormones into the bloodstream . Hormones are chemical messenger molecules that are made by cells in one part of the body and cause changes in cells in another part of the body . The endocrine system regulates the metabolism and development of most body cells and body systems through feedback mechanisms . For example , Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone ( TRH ) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) are controlled by a number of negative feedback mechanisms . The endocrine glands also release hormones that affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of males and females . <p> Figure 2 : The endocrine system controls almost every other body system through feedback mechanisms . Most of the mechanisms of the endocrine system are negative feedback . <p> The endocrine system has a regulatory effect on other organ systems in the human body . In the muscular system , hormones adjust muscle metabolism , energy production , and growth . In the nervous system , hormones affect neural metabolism , regulate fluid and ion concentration and help with reproductive hormones that influence brain development . <h> Urinary System <p> Toxic wastes build up in the blood as proteins and nucleic acids are broken down and used by the body . The urinary system rids the body of these wastes . The urinary system is also directly involved in maintaining proper blood volume . The kidneys also play an important role in maintaining the correct salt and water content of the body . External changes , such as a warm weather , that lead to excess fluid loss trigger feedback mechanisms that act to maintain the body 's fluid content by inhibiting fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also known as EPO , which stimulates red blood cell production . <h> Reproductive System <p> The reproductive system does little for the homeostasis of the organism . The reproductive system relates instead to the maintenance of the species . However , sex hormones do have an effect on other body systems , and an imbalance in sex hormones can lead to various disorders . For example , a woman whose ovaries are removed early in life is at higher risk of developing osteoporosis , a disorder in which bones are thin and break easily . The hormone estrogen , produced by the ovaries , is important for bone growth . Therefore , a woman who does not produce estrogen will have impaired bone development . <h> Disruption of Homeostasis <p> Many homeostatic mechanisms keep the internal environment within certain limits ( or set points ) . When the cells in your body do not work correctly , homeostatic balance is disrupted . Homeostatic imbalance may lead to a state of disease . Disease and cellular malfunction can be caused in two basic ways : by deficiency ( cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being poisoned by things they do not need ) . When homeostasis is interrupted , your body can correct or worsen the problem , based on certain influences . In addition to inherited ( genetic ) influences , there are external influences that are based on lifestyle choices and environmental exposure . These factors together influence the body 's ability to maintain homeostatic balance . The endocrine system of a person with diabetes has difficulty maintaining the correct blood glucose level . A diabetic needs to check their blood glucose levels many times during the day , as shown in Figure 3 , and monitor daily sugar intake . <p> Figure 3 : A person with diabetes has to monitor their blood glucose carefully . This glucose meter analyses only a small drop of blood . <p> Internal Influences : Heredity <p> Genetics : Genes are sometimes turned off or on due to external factors which we have some control over . Other times , little can be done to prevent the development of certain genetic diseases and disorders . In such cases , medicines can help a person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Type 1 diabetes , which is a disorder where the pancreas is no longer producing adequate amounts of insulin to respond to changes in a person 's blood glucose level . Insulin replacement therapy , in conjunction with carbohydrate counting and careful monitoring of blood glucose concentration , is a way to bring the body 's handling of glucose back into balance . Cancer can be genetically inherited or be due to a mutation caused by exposure to toxin such as radiation or harmful drugs . A person may also inherit a predisposition to develop a disease such as heart disease . Such diseases can be delayed or prevented if the person eats nutritious food , has regular physical activity , and does not smoke . <p> External Influences : Lifestyle <p> Nutrition : If your diet lacks certain vitamins or minerals your cells will function poorly , and you may be at risk to develop a disease . For example , a menstruating woman with inadequate dietary intake of iron will become anemic . Hemoglobin , the molecule that enables red blood cells to transport oxygen , requires iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reduced oxygen-carrying capacity . In mild cases symptoms may be vague ( e.g. fatigue ) , but if the anemia is severe the body will try to compensate by increasing cardiac output , leading to weakness , irregular heartbeats and in serious cases , heart failure . <p> Physical Activity : Physical activity is essential for proper functioning of our cells and bodies . Adequate rest and regular physical activity are examples of activities that influence homeostasis . Lack of sleep is related to a number of health problems such as irregular heartbeat , fatigue , anxiety , and headaches . Being overweight and obesity , two conditions that are related to poor nutrition and lack of physical activity greatly affect many organ systems and their homeostatic mechanisms . Being overweight or obese increases a person 's risk of developing heart disease , Type 2 diabetes , and certain forms of cancer . Staying fit by regularly taking part in aerobic activities such as walking , shown in Figure 4 , has been shown to help prevent many of these diseases . <p> Figure 4 : Adding physical activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 60 minutes a day , five times a week . <p> Mental Health : Your physical health and mental health are inseparable . Our emotions cause chemical changes in our bodies that have various effects on our thoughts and feelings . Negative stress ( also called distress ) can negatively affect mental health . Regular physical activity has been shown to improve mental and physical well-being , and helps people to cope with distress . Among other things , regular physical activity increases the ability of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen to body cells , including the brain cells . Medications that may help balance the amount of certain mood-altering chemicals within the brain are often prescribed to people who have mental and mood disorders . This is an example of medical help in stabilizing a disruption in homeostasis . <p> Environmental Exposure <p> Any substance that interferes with cellular function and causes cellular malfunction is a cellular toxin . There are many different sources of toxins , for example , natural or synthetic drugs , plants , and animal bites . Air pollution , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . A commonly seen example of an exposure to cellular toxins is by a drug overdose . When a person takes too much of a drug that affects the central nervous system , basic life functions such as breathing and heartbeat are disrupted . Such disruptions can results in coma , brain damage , and even death . <p> Figure 5 : Air pollution can cause environmental exposure to cellular toxins such as mercury . <p> The six factors described above have their effects at the cellular level . A deficiency or lack of beneficial pathways , whether caused by an internal or external influence , will almost always result in a harmful change in homeostasis . Too much toxicity also causes homeostatic imbalance , resulting in cellular malfunction . By removing negative health influences and providing adequate positive health influences , your body is better able to self-regulate and self-repair , which maintains homeostasis.

Since then , scientists have repeatedly revised the Linnaean system . They have added several new kingdoms and other taxa . These changes were necessary as scientists learned more about life on Earth . <h> New Kingdoms <p> Between 1866 and 1977 , a total of four new kingdoms were added to the original plant and animal kingdoms identified by Linnaeus . The new kingdoms include Protista ( protists ) , Fungi , Monera ( eubacteria ) , and Archaea ( archaebacteria ) . Table 1 identifies the scientists who introduced the kingdoms and the dates the kingdoms were introduced . The table starts with the two-kingdom system introduced by Linnaeus in 1735 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Number of Kingdoms <p> Two <p> Three <p> Four <p> Five <p> Six <p> Scientist <p> Linnaeus <p> Haeckel <p> Copeland <p> Whittaker <p> Woese <p> Date <p> 1735 <p> 1866 <p> 1956 <p> 1969 <p> 1977 <p> Names of Kingdoms <p> Plantae , Animalia <p> Plantae , Animalia , Protista <p> Plantae , Animalia , Protista , Monera <p> Plantae , Animalia , Protista , Fungi , Monera <p> Plantae , Animalia , Protista , Fungi , Monera , Archaea <p> The Protist Kingdom <p> When Linnaeus created his taxonomy , microorganisms were almost unknown . As scientists began studying single-celled organisms under the microscope , they generally classified them as either plants and or animals . For example , bacteria are single-celled organisms , some of which make their own food . They were classified as plants , which also make their own food . Protozoa are single-celled organisms that can move on their own . They were classified as animals , which are organisms that have independent movement . <p> As more single-celled organisms were identified , many did n't seem to fit in either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists could not agree on how to classify them . To address this problem , in 1866 , biologist Ernst Haeckel created a third kingdom for all single-celled organisms . He called this kingdom Protista . Figure 1 shows drawings that Haeckel made of several different types of protists as they looked under a microscope . The drawings show some of the diversity of microorganisms . <p> Figure 1 : Diversity of Protists . Biologist Ernst Haeckel made these drawings of various types of single-celled organisms as viewed under a microscope . Based on his extensive knowledge of the diversity of microorganisms , Haeckel introduced a new kingdom just for single-celled life forms , called the protist kingdom . This was the first major change in the original Linnaean taxonomy . <p> The Bacteria Kingdom Haeckel 's protist kingdom represented all known single-celled organisms , including both bacteria and protozoa . In the early 1900s , scientists discovered that bacterial cells are very different not only from plant and animal cells but also from the cells of protists , such as protozoa . Figure 2 shows a bacterial cell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you compare the three cells , what differences do you see ? The major difference is that , unlike the protozoan and animal cells , the bacterial cell does not contain a nucleus surrounded by a nuclear membrane . Instead , its DNA is found in the cytoplasm of the cell . Organelles in the bacterial cell also lack surrounding membranes . <p> Figure 2 : Prokaryote and Eukaryote Cells . Prokaryote and eukaryote cells differ significantly in their structure . Unlike prokaryote cells ( upper figure ) , eukaryote cells ( middle figure , protist cell ; lower figure , animal cell ) have a nucleus , which is separated by membranes from the cytoplasm of the cell . Their organelles also have membranes . Herbert Copeland thought that these and other differences were significant enough to place prokaryote and eukaryote organisms in different superkingdoms . <p> In the 1920s , microbiologist Edouard Chatton gave bacteria the name prokaryotes . He defined prokaryote as an organism whose cells lack nuclei . He gave the name eukaryotes to all other organisms . He defined eukaryote as an organism whose cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new taxon above the kingdom , called the superkingdom . However , this idea did not catch on , and most biologists continued to place bacteria in the protist kingdom . <p> Over the next several decades , scientists learned more about the tremendous number and diversity of bacteria . They started to see a need for a separate bacteria kingdom . By 1956 , biologist Herbert Copeland proposed placing bacteria in a new kingdom called Monera . With the addition of the Monera kingdom , Linnaean taxonomy became a four-kingdom system ( See Table 1 ) . <p> Bacteria are the most numerous organisms on Earth . In a single gram of soil , there are typically 40 million bacterial cells . The human body also contains 10 times as many bacterial cells as human cells . Most of these bacteria are on the skin or in the digestive tract . <p> The Fungi Kingdom <p> In the late 1960s , ecologist Robert Whittaker proposed adding a fifth kingdom to Linnaean taxonomy to represent fungi . Fungi are eukaryote organisms such as mushrooms and molds . Up until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whittaker separated fungi from plants on the basis of differences in metabolism . Plants make their own food in the process of photosynthesis , whereas fungi obtain nutrients by breaking down dead organisms . Separating fungi from plants resulted in five kingdoms , which are illustrated in Figure 3 . The five-kingdom system soon became widely accepted . <p> Figure 3 : This five-kingdom system of classification was proposed by ecologist Robert Whittaker in the late 1960s . Whittaker added the Fungi kingdom to the earlier four-kingdom classification system . <p> Two Bacterial Kingdoms <p> By the 1970s , scientists had started to classify organisms in ways that reflected evolutionary relationships . They had also started using nucleic acid base sequences to identify these relationships . Nucleic acid sequence data are especially useful for studying bacteria . These organisms are so small that they have few physical traits . <p> Studies have bacterial nucleic acid sequences have yielded some surprising results . For example , in their research on ribosomal RNA base sequences , microbiologist Carl Woese and his colleagues discovered that bacteria actually include two very different groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archaebacteria . Examples of organisms from each group are shown in Figure 4 . Although the two types of organisms are similar in appearance , their ribosomal RNA sequences are very different . In 1977 , Woese and his colleagues suggested that the original bacteria kingdom should be divided into two new kingdoms , called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria . This resulted in a six-kingdom taxonomy that has been widely accepted for many years . <p> Figure 4 : Left , Eubacteria ( now called Bacteria ) , Right , Archaebacteria ( now called Archaea ) . Appearances can be deceiving ! These two microorganisms are very different from one another , despite their outward similarities . Both organisms used to be classified in the bacteria kingdom . Woese suggested placing them in different kingdoms , called the eubacteria and archaebacteria kingdoms . <h> Domains <p> Woese was n't completely happy with the six-kingdom system . It did n't show that all four eukaryote kingdoms are more closely related to each other than to the two bacteria kingdoms . It also did n't show that the two bacteria kingdoms are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdoms . To show these similarities and differences , Woese introduced a new taxon called the domain . He defined domain as a taxon higher than the kingdom . <p> The Three-Domain System <p> In 1990 , Woese and his colleagues proposed a new classification system containing three domains : Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya . As shown in Figure 5 , the Bacteria domain was formerly the Eubacteria kingdom , and the Archaea domain was formerly the Archaebacteria kingdom . The Eukarya domain includes all four eukaryote kingdoms : plants , animals , protists , and fungi . The three-domain system emphasizes the similarities among eukaryotes and the differences among eukaryotes , bacteria , and archaea . By using domains , Woese was able to show these relationships without replacing the popular six-kingdom system . <p> Figure 5 : This diagram shows how the three-domain system of classification is related to the six-kingdom system . Both Eubacteria and Archaebacteria kingdoms are raised to the level of domains ( Bacteria and Archaea domains , respectively ) in the three-domain system . The other four kingdoms make up the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in extreme environments . For example , they were found in the hot water geysers in Yellowstone National park . Archaea have since been found in all of Earth 's habitats . They are now known to be present everywhere in high numbers . They may contribute as much as 20 percent to Earth 's total biomass . <p> Woese 's three-domain system was quickly adopted by many other biologists . There were some critics , however , who argued that the system put too much emphasis on the uniqueness of Archaea . Later studies confirmed how different Archaea are from other organisms . For example , organisms belogning to Archaea were found to differ from both Eukarya and Bacteria in the composition of their cell membranes and the system they use for DNA replication . These differences convinced most critics that the three-domain system was justified . After its introduction in 1990 , the three-domain system became increasingly popular . Within a decade of its introduction , it had largely replaced earlier classifications . <p> How Are the Three Domains Related ? <p> Comparing ribosomal RNA base sequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Eukarya are more similar to Archaea than they are to Bacteria . Figure 6 is a phylogenetic tree based on their analysis . This tree places Archaea and Eukarya in the same clade . It represents the hypothesis that Archaea and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor with each other than with Bacteria . <p> The results of a study published in 2007 seem to conflict with this hypothesis . Comparing DNA base sequences , the 2007 study suggested that the domain Archaea may be older than either Bacteria or Eukarya . That would make Archaea the most ancient group of organisms on Earth . It is not yet known , which , if either , hypothesis is correct . Scientists need to learn more about Archaea and their relationships with other organisms to resolve these questions . <p> Figure 6 : This phylogenetic tree is based on comparisons of ribosomal RNA base sequences among living organisms . The tree divides all organisms into three domains : Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya . Humans and other animals belong to the Eukarya domain . From this tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared a more recent common ancestor with Archaea than Bacteria . <h> The Future of Classification <p> The three-domain system is unlikely to be the final word on classification . The system is based on the current state of knowledge . As knowledge increases , the three-domain system may need revision . For example , the number of domains may change as scientists learn more about those life forms we currently know least about . <p> A recent discovery illustrates this point . In 2003 , scientists identified a new virus called mimivirus . It resembles bacteria in size and number of genes . However , the virus can not respond to stimuli or grow by cell division , both of which are traits of bacteria and other living organisms . Mimivirus ' unique combination of traits seems to place it at the boundary between living and nonliving things . Some scientists think mimivirus might represent a new domain of life .

The most noticeable difference between various tonal sounds is that some sound higher or lower than others . These differences in the pitch of the sound are caused by different spacing in the waves ; the closer together the waves are , the higher the tone sounds . The spacing of the waves - the distance from the high point of one wave to the next one - is the wavelength . <p> All sound waves are travelling at about the same speed - the speed of sound . So waves with a longer wavelength do n't arrive ( at your ear , for example ) as often ( frequently ) as the shorter waves . This aspect of a sound - how often a wave peak goes by , is called frequency by scientists and engineers . They measure it in hertz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . People can hear sounds that range from about 20 to about 17,000 hertz . <p> The word that musicians use for frequency is pitch . The shorter the wavelength , the higher the frequency , and the higher the pitch , of the sound . In other words , short waves sound high ; long waves sound low . Instead of measuring frequencies , musicians name the pitches that they use most often . They might call a note " middle C " or " 2 line G " or " the F sharp in the bass clef " . These notes do have definite frequencies ( Have you heard of the " A 440 " that is used as a tuning note ? ) , but musicians usually find it easier just to use the note names . <p> Figure 1 : Since the sounds are travelling at about the same speed , the one with the shorter wavelength will go by more frequently ; it has a higher frequency , or pitch .

Instead , they are recycled repeatedly . All chemical elements that are needed by living things are recycled in ecosystems , including carbon , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus , and sulfur . Water is also recycled . <h> Biogeochemical Cycles <p> A biogeochemical cycle is a closed loop through which a chemical element or water moves through ecosystems . In the term biogeochemical , bio- refers to biotic components and geo- to geological and other abiotic components . Chemicals cycle through both biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems . For example , an element might move from the atmosphere to ocean water , from ocean water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat the cycle . <p> Elements or water may be held for various lengths of time by different components of a biogeochemical cycle . Components that hold elements or water for a relatively short period of time are called exchange pools . For example , the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water . It holds water for several days at the longest . This is a very short time compared with the thousands of years the deep ocean can hold water . The ocean is an example of a reservoir for water . Reservoirs are components of a geochemical cycle that hold elements or water for a relatively long period of time . <h> Water Cycles <p> Earth 's water is constantly in motion . Although the water on Earth is billions of years old , individual water molecules are always moving through the water cycle . The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water molecules on , above , and below Earth 's surface . It is shown in Figure 1 . Like other biogeochemical cycles , there is no beginning or end to the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water occurs in its three different states : gas ( water vapor ) , liquid ( water ) , and solid ( ice ) . Processes involved in changes of state in the water cycle include evaporation , sublimation , and transpiration . <p> Figure 1 : This diagram of the water cycle shows where water is stored and the processes by which water moves through the cycle , including evaporation , condensation , and precipitation . <p> Evaporation , Sublimation , and Transpiration <p> The sun is the driving force behind the water cycle . It heats oceans , lakes , and other bodies of water , causing water to evaporate from the surface and enter the atmosphere as water vapor . Water in soil also evaporates easily . In addition , the sun heats ice and snow , causing it to turn directly into water vapor in the process of sublimation . Water also evaporates from the above-ground parts of plants . Transpiration is another process by which plants lose water . Transpiration occurs when stomata in leaves open to take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water cycle plays an important role in climate . For molecules of liquid water to change to water vapor , kinetic energy is required , or the energy of movement . As faster-moving molecules evaporate , the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy , and the temperature of ocean water thus decreases . The primary way that oceans slow global warming is by heat uptake which warms ocean water and removes some energy from the atmosphere . <p> Condensation and Precipitation <p> Rising air currents carry water vapor from all these sources into the atmosphere . As the water vapor rises higher into the atmosphere or is carried toward the poles by winds , the air becomes cooler . Cooler air can not hold as much water vapor , so the water vapor condenses into tiny water droplets around particles in the air . The tiny water droplets form clouds . <p> Air currents cause the tiny water droplets in clouds to collide and merge into larger droplets . When water droplets in clouds become large enough to fall , they become precipitation . Most precipitation falls back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or near the poles can accumulate as ice caps and glaciers . These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or longer . <p> Infiltration and Runoff <p> Rain that falls on land may either soak into the ground , which is called infiltration , or flow over the land as runoff . Snow that falls on land eventually melts , with the exception of snow that accumulates at high altitudes or near the poles . Like rain water , snowmelt can either infiltrate the ground or run off . <p> Water that infiltrates the ground is called groundwater . Groundwater close to the surface can be taken up by plants . Alternatively , it may flow out of the ground as a spring or slowly seep from the ground into bodies of water such as ponds , lakes , or the ocean . Groundwater can also flow deeper underground . It may eventually reach an aquifer . An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing , permeable rock . Groundwater may be stored in an aquifer for thousands of years . Wells drilled into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface for human use . <p> Runoff water from rain or snowmelt eventually flows into streams and rivers . The water is then carried to ponds , lakes , or the ocean . From these bodies of water , water molecules can evaporate to form water vapor and continue the cycle . <h> Carbon Cycle <p> Runoff , streams , and rivers can gradually dissolve carbon in rocks and carry it to the ocean . The ocean is a major reservoir for stored carbon . It is just one of four major reservoirs . The other three are the atmosphere , the biosphere , and organic sediments such as fossil fuels . Fossil fuels , including petroleum and coal , form from the remains of dead organisms . All of these reservoirs of carbon are interconnected by pathways of exchange in the carbon cycle , which is shown in Figure 2 . <p> Figure 2 : This drawing of the carbon cycle shows the amounts of carbon stored in and exchanged between carbon reservoirs on land and in water . Another 70 million GtC of carbon may be stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make sedimentary rock the greatest reservoir of carbon on Earth . <p> Carbon occurs in a various forms in different parts of the carbon cycle . Some of the different forms in which carbon appears are described in Table 1 . Refer to the table as you read how carbon moves between reservoirs of the cycle . <p> In the atmosphere , carbon exists primarily as carbon dioxide ( ( CO2 ) ) . Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere from several different sources , including those listed below . Most of the sources are also represented in Figure 2 , and some are described in detail . <p> Living organisms release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration . Carbon dioxide is given off when dead organisms and other organic materials decompose . Burning organic material , such as fossil fuels , releases carbon dioxide . When volcanoes erupt , they give off carbon dioxide that is stored in the mantle . Carbon dioxide is released when limestone is heated during the production of cement . Ocean water releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when water temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere is present as methane gas ( ( CH4 ) ) . Methane is released into the atmosphere when dead organisms and other organic matter decay in the absence of oxygen . It is produced by landfills , the mining of fossil fuels , and some types of agriculture . <p> There are also several different ways that carbon leaves the atmosphere . Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere when plants and other autotrophs take in carbon dioxide to make organic compounds during photosynthesis or chemosynthesis . Carbon dioxide is also removed when ocean water cools and dissolves more carbon dioxide from the air . These processes are also represented in Figure 2 . <p> Because of human activities , there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years . Burning fossil fuels and producing concrete has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was previously stored in autotrophs . <p> Carbon in Ocean Water <p> Most carbon enters the ocean when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in ocean water . When carbon dioxide dissolves in water ( ( H2 O ) ) , it forms an acid called carbonic acid ( ( H2 CO3 ) ) . The reaction is given by the equation : <p> $$CO2 + H2 O leftrightarrow H2 CO3$$ <p> The double-headed arrow indicates that the reaction can occur in either direction , depending on the conditions and the amount of carbon dioxide present . For example , the reaction occurs more readily in the left-to-right direction in cold water . As a result , near the poles , where ocean water is cooler , more carbon dioxide is dissolved and there is more carbonic acid in the water . Although carbonic acid is a weak acid , it is an important regulator of the acid-base ( pH ) balance of ocean water . <p> Carbonic acid , in turn , readily separates into hydrogen ions ( ( H+ ) ) and bicarbonate ions ( ( HCO3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> $$H2 CO3 longrightarrow H+ + HCO3 G$$ <p> Due to these two reactions , most dissolved carbon dioxide in the ocean is in the form of bicarbonate ions . Another source of bicarbonate ions in ocean water is runoff . Flowing water erodes rocks containing carbon compounds such as calcium carbonate . This forms bicarbonate ions , which the runoff carries to streams , rivers , and eventually the ocean . Many of the bicarbonate ions in ocean water are moved by ocean currents into the deep ocean . Carbon can be held in this deep ocean reservoir as bicarbonate ions for thousands of years or more . <p> Carbon in the Biosphere <p> Bicarbonate ions near the surface of the ocean may be taken up by photosynthetic algae and bacteria that live near the surface . These and other autotrophic organisms use bicarbonate ions or other forms of carbon to synthesize organic compounds . Carbon is essential for life because it is the main ingredient of every type of organic compound . Organic compounds make up the cells and tissues of all organisms and keep organisms alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aquatic , through autotrophs such as plants or algae . Autotrophs use carbon dioxide from the air , or bicarbonate ions from the water , to make organic compounds such as glucose . Heterotrophs consume the organic molecules and pass the carbon through food chains and webs . <p> How does carbon cycle back to the atmosphere or ocean ? All organisms release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration . Cellular respiration is the process by which cells oxidize glucose and produce carbon dioxide , water , and energy . Decomposers also release carbon dioxide when they break down dead organisms and other organic waste . <p> In a balanced ecosystem , the amount of carbon used in photosynthesis and passed through the ecosystem is about the same as the amount given off in respiration and decomposition . This cycling of carbon between the atmosphere and organisms forms an organic pathway in the carbon cycle . Carbon can cycle quickly through this organic pathway , especially in aquatic ecosystems . In fact , during a given period of time , much more carbon is recycled through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about next . <p> Carbon in Rocks and Sediments <p> The geological pathway of the carbon cycle takes much longer than the organic pathway described above . In fact , it usually takes millions of years for carbon to cycle through the geological pathway . It involves processes such as rock formation , subduction , and volcanism . <p> As stated previously , most carbon in ocean water is in the form of bicarbonate ions . Bicarbonate ions may bind with other ions , such as calcium ions ( ( Ca+ ) ) or magnesium ions ( ( Mg+ ) ) , and form insoluble compounds . Because the compounds are insoluble , they precipitate out of water and gradually form sedimentary rock , such as limestone ( calcium carbonate , ( CaCO3 ) ) or dolomite calcium magnesium carbonate ( CaMg ( CO3 ) 2 ) . <p> Dead organisms also settle to the bottom of the ocean . Many of them have shells containing calcium carbonate . Over millions of years , the pressure of additional layers of sediments gradually changes their calcium carbonate and other remaining organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Earth 's history , very rich organic sediments were deposited . These deposits formed pockets of hydrocarbons . Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen . The hydrocarbons found in sediments are fossil fuels such as natural gas . The hydrocarbon methane is the chief component of natural gas . <p> Carbon-containing rocks and sediments on the ocean floor gradually move toward the edges of the ocean due to a process called seafloor spreading . The rocks eventually reach cracks in the crust , where they are pulled down into the mantle . This process , called subduction , occurs at subduction zones . In the mantle , the rocks melt and their carbon is stored . When volcanoes erupt , they return some of the stored carbon in the mantle to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide , a process known as volcanism . This brings the geological pathway of the carbon cycle full circle . <h> Nitrogen Cycle <p> The atmosphere is the largest reservoir of nitrogen on Earth . It consists of 78 percent nitrogen gas ( ( N2 ) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components of ecosystems . Figure 3 shows how nitrogen cycles through a terrestrial ecosystem . Nitrogen passes from the atmosphere into soil . Then it moves through several different organisms before returning to the atmosphere to complete the cycle . In aquatic ecosystems , nitrogen passes through a similar cycle . <p> Figure 3 : In a terrestrial ecosystem , the nitrogen cycle may include plants and consumers as well as several types of bacteria . <p> Absorption of Nitrogen <p> Plants and other producers use nitrogen to synthesize nitrogen-containing organic compounds . These include chlorophyll , proteins , and nucleic acids . Other organisms that consume producers make use of the nitrogen in these organic compounds . Plants absorb substances such as nitrogen from the soil through their root hairs . However , they can not absorb nitrogen gas directly . They can absorb nitrogen only in the form of nitrogen containing ions , such as nitrate ions ( ( NO3 G ) ) . <p> Nitrogen Fixation <p> The process of converting nitrogen gas to nitrate ions that plants can absorb is called nitrogen fixation . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed for the process . Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in soil . Others live in the root nodules of legumes such as peas and beans . In aquatic ecosystems , some cyanobacteria are nitrogen fixing . They convert nitrogen gas to nitrate ions that algae and other aquatic producers can use . <p> Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere can be converted to nitrates by several other means . One way is by the energy in lightning . Nitrogen is also converted to nitrates as a result of certain human activities . These include the production of fertilizers and explosives and the burning of fossil fuels . These human activities also create the gas nitrous oxide ( ( N2 O ) ) . The concentration of this gas in the atmosphere has tripled over the past hundred years as a result . Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and other environmental problems . <p> Ammonification and Nitrification <p> After being used by plants and animals , nitrogen is released back into the environment . When decomposers break down organic remains and wastes , they release nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This is called ammonification . It occurs in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems . In terrestrial ecosystems , some nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soil and root nodules also convert nitrogen gas directly into ammonium ions . <p> Although some plants can absorb nitrogen in the form of ammonium ions , others can not . In fact , ammonium ions may be toxic to some plants and other organisms . Certain soil bacteria , called nitrifying bacteria , convert ammonium ions to nitrites ( ( NO2 G ) ) . Other nitrifying bacteria convert the nitrites to nitrates , which plants can absorb . The process of converting ammonium ions to nitrites or nitrates is called nitrification . <p> Denitrification and the Anammox Reaction <p> Still other bacteria , called denitrifying bacteria , convert some of the nitrates in soil back into nitrogen gas in a process called denitrification . The process is the opposite of nitrogen fixation . Denitrification returns nitrogen gas back to the atmosphere , where it can continue the nitrogen cycle . <p> In the ocean , another reaction occurs to cycle nitrogen back to nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anammox reaction , is enabled by certain bacteria in the water . In the reaction , ammonium and nitrite ions combine to form water and nitrogen gas . This is shown by the equation : <p> $$NH4 + + NO2 - longrightarrow N2 + 2H2 O$$ <p> The anammox reaction may contribute up to half of the nitrogen gas released into the atmosphere by the ocean . The reaction may also significantly limit production in ocean ecosystems by removing nitrogen compounds that are needed by aquatic producers and other organisms .

@@119688655 @8688655/ <h> Polyprotic Acids and Bases 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> This article introduces how to classify acids and bases as polyprotic , as well as the properties of polyprotic acids and bases . 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Acids and bases can be classified as either monoprotic or polyprotic . Monoprotic acids and bases only release/accept one ( H+ ) ion , while polyprotic acids and bases release/accept more than one . This article will focus on polyprotic acids and bases , including reactions between polyprotic acids and bases , and how properties of polyprotic acids and bases affect pH . <h> Polyprotic Acids <p> Polyprotic acids will release multiple hydrogen ions . As a result , every molecule of all polyprotic acids must have at least two hydrogen ions . The stability of the structure of the molecule sometimes plays a role in how many hydrogen ions a polyprotic acid molecule will release . Many polyprotic acids will turn into common polyatomic anions after releasing between two and four hydrogen ions . The following is a list of pairs of these acids and the anions they form : <p> As a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will typically decompose into water and carbon dioxide instead of two hydrogen ions and a carbonate ion , but the shown transformation is still theoretically possible . <p> Example 1 : Show the steps that a molecule of sulfuric acid will undergo to become a sulfate ion by means of chemical equations . <p> Solution : Sulfuric acid is ( H2SO4 ) . The table above suggests that <p> $$H2SO4 rightarrow 2H+ + SO42-$$ <p> As a result , sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid , and there will be two hydrogen ion releases , each one constituting a step in the overall reaction . Thus we get these chemical equations : <p> Example 2 : Show the steps that a molecule of silicious acid will undergo to become a silicite ion , with the use of a series of chemical equations . <p> Solution : The silicious acid molecule has the chemical formula ( H4SiO3 ) , and according to the chart , can turn into ( SiO34- ) . With the possible removal of up to four hydrogen ions , silicious acid is a tetraprotic acid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hydrogen ion is removed from the silicious acid molecule in each one : <p> The next example involves a bit of stoichiometry , and thus is a quantitative problem , quite different from Examples 1 and 2 . <p> Example 3 : Phosphorous acid , ( H3PO4 ) , is a triprotic acid , releasing up to three hydrogen ions per molecule . Given this information , how many hydrogen ions can be formed by a sample of 2.5 moles of phosphorous acid molecules ? <p> Solution : A mole refers to ( 6.02 times 1023 ) of something ( this is called Avogadro 's Number ) . Therefore , we can get rid of the mole , by converting from moles of phosphorous acid molecules to number of phosphorous acid molecules . We use this conversion : <p> Now , in every molecule , there are three hydrogen atoms . Since phosphorous acid is a triprotic acid , there will be up to three hydrogen ions for every molecule . Thus our second and final conversion let 's us change our units to hydrogen ions : <h> Polyprotic Hydroxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion . Often , these bases are hydroxides , ionic compounds with a hydroxide anion . Hydroxide ions prefer accepting hydrogen ions because the oxygen in hydroxide only has one bond , whereas it prefers to have two . <p> $$OH- + H+ rightarrow H2O$$ <p> A water molecule has two bonds on oxygen , making it more stable than the hydroxide ion . Polyprotic bases that are hydroxides will have more than one hydroxide ion . Some common hydroxides that are polyprotic bases are ionic compounds with the alkaline earth metals : <p> Some transition metals such as zinc and copper , also commonly form hydroxides . These compounds all take at least two hydrogen ions from another source ( such as an acid ) to turn all the hydroxide ions into water . <p> Example 4 : Calcium hydroxide , ( Ca(OH)2 ) , is a common base . Add as many hydrogen ions as you need to turn all the hydroxide ions in one molecule into water . Give a chemical equation for each step . <p> Solution : There are two hydroxide ions per molecule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require two hydrogen ions to turn all the hydroxide ions in a molecule of calcium hydroxide into water . Add the hydrogen ions one at a time : <p> Example 5 : Aluminum hydroxide has three hydroxide ions per molecule and is thus a triprotic base . Let ( X ) be a polyatomic ion such that the following acid-base reaction occurs : <p> $$H3X + Al(OH)3 rightarrow H2O + AlX$$ <p> Given that this equation is balanced and the charge of every reactant and product is ( 0 ) , give two possibilities of what polyatomic ion ( X ) could be . <p> Solution : The key step is to identify the charge of the polyatomic ion . The compound ( AlX ) is our hint ; it implies that ( Al3+ ) and ( X ) are in a 1:1 ratio in this chemical reaction . ( X ) is a polyatomic ion with charge ( -3 ) , because then ( AlX ) is neutral . As default for acid-base reactions , an ionic compound is one of the products , and it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as neutrally charged . <p> The table of polyatomic anions that form from polyprotic acids releasing hydrogen ions gives two possibilities for the mystery anion : ( PO33- ) and ( PO43- ) . <p> As a check , we can substitute each of these anions into the equation to ensure it is balanced : <h> Polyprotic Carbonate Bases <p> A carbonate is an ionic compound with a carbonate anion , ( CO32- ) . Carbonates are slightly more tricky to analyze in acid-base chemistry than hydroxides , because every carbonate ion will accept up to two hydrogen ions . That procedure is shown in Example 6 . <p> Example 6 : Carbonate ions are diprotic bases , accepting up to two hydrogen ions per molecule : <p> $$CO32- + H+ rightarrow HCO3-$$ <p> This ion is known as the bicarbonate ion and will be studied more closely later . The second part of the reaction is <p> $$HCO3- + H+ rightarrow H2CO3$$ <p> The reason why carbonate ions will generally accept two hydrogen ions per molecule is because carbonic acid decomposes into carbon dioxide and water . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2H+ rightarrow CO2 + H2O$$ <p> This explains why every acid-base reaction involving a carbonate produces carbon dioxide in addition to water and an ionic compound . Here is one more example involving a carbonate : <p> Solution : There are three carbonate ions per molecule , and each carbonate ion requires two hydrogen ions to be neutralized . So six hydrogen ions are necessary , and the base is hexaprotic . Here is the overall reaction : <p> $$Al2(CO3)3 + 6H+ rightarrow 2Al + 3CO2 + 3H2O$$ <h> Polyprotic Bicarbonate Bases <p> A bicarbonate is an ionic compound with a bicarbonate ion . The bicarbonate ion is ( HCO3- ) . Notice what happens if you add a hydrogen ion : <p> $$HCO3- + H+ rightarrow H2CO3 rightarrow CO2 + H2O$$ <p> As a result , carbonate and bicarbonate ions are closely related , but a bicarbonate ion only requires one hydrogen ion to neutralize . As a result , some bicarbonates are monoprotic . <p> Example 8 : ( Mg(HCO3)2 ) requires how many hydrogen ions to neutralize ? Write out the reaction . <p> Solution : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hydrogen ions . The reaction : <p> $$Mg(HCO3)2 + 2H+ rightarrow Mg2+ + CO2 + H2O$$ <h> pH of Polyprotic Acids and Bases <p> Brackets denote a concentration of an ion or molecule . With that in mind , the pH of a solution is defined as <p> $$pH = -log10H+$$ <p> The pH of a solution is influenced by whether the molecules are monoprotic or polyprotic . A polyprotic acid or base will have more than one hydrogen or hydroxide ion per molecule . This means that the ( H+ ) or ( OH- ) ( depending on whether the solution is acidic or basic ) will be higher than the molarity . <p> If a molecule of an acid can release up to ( n ) hydrogen ions , then <p> $$H+ = nM$$ <p> ( M ) denotes the molarity . If the solute of the solution is a base that can accept up to ( n ) hydrogen ions per molecule , then <p> $$OH- = nM$$ <p> Trying to find the pH or pOH will not be any more difficult , once you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the solute . Also , notice all of this only applies to strong acids and bases where the hydrogen/hydroxide ions entirely separate from the molecules of the acid/base . <p> Example 8 : What is the pH of a ( .054 ) molar aqueous solution of sulfuric acid ? <p> Solution : The chemical formula of sulfuric acid is ( H2SO4 ) . After removing two hydrogen ions , it becomes one of the common polyatomic ions , sulfate , so it is a diprotic acid , and <p> $$H+ = 2m = 2 cdot .054 ; M = .108 ; M$$ <p> With the hydrogen ion concentration , we can find the pH : <p> $$pH = -log10 ( .108 ; M ) = .97$$ <p> Just as a side note , be aware that the capital M is used to denote molarity as well as label a magnitude with the molarity unit . <p> Example 9 : What is the pH of a ( .0915 ) molar solution of calcium hydroxide ? <p> Solution : Calcium hydroxide 's chemical formula is ( Ca(OH)2 ) . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ions to neutralize each molecule . Therefore , <p> $$OH- = 2m$$ <p> With this formula , we can find the hydroxide ion concentration : <p> $$OH- = 2 cdot .0915 ; M = .183 ; M$$ <p> Now we can find the pH with the formula <p> $$pH = 14 + log10OH-$$ <p> The calculations proceed : <p> $$pH = 14 + log10 ( .183 ; M ) = 13.26$$ <p> Polyprotic acids and bases have different properties than monoprotic acids and bases . More hydrogen ion transfer is required to neutralize an acid or a base , and the concentrations of key ions will be different than a monoprotic acidic/basic aqueous solution of the same molarity . Therefore it is important to know the difference between monoprotic and polyprotic.

Before proving this , we need to review some elementary geometry . <p> A central angle of a circle is an angle whose vertex is the center O of the circle and whose sides ( called radii ) are line segments from O to two points on the circle . In Figure 1 , ( angle ) O is a central angle and we say that it intercepts the arc- BC . <p> An inscribed angle of a circle is an angle whose vertex is a point A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called chords ) from A to two other points on the circle . In Figure 2 , ( angle ) A is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc -BC . We state here without proof a useful relation between inscribed and central angles : <p> Theorem 1 . If an inscribed angle ( angle ) A and a central angle ( angle ) O intercept the same arc , then ( angle ) A = ( frac1 2 angle ) O. Thus , inscribed angles which intercept the same arc are equal . <p> Figure 3 shows two inscribed angles , ( angle ) A and ( angle ) D , which intercept the same arc- BC as the central angle ( angle ) O , and hence ( angle ) A = ( angle ) D = ( frac12 ) ( angle ) O ( so ( angle ) O = 2 ( angle ) A = 2 ( angle ) D ) . We will now prove our assertion about the common ratio in the Law of Sines : <p> To prove this , let O be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then O can be either inside , outside , or on the triangle , as in Figures 4 , 5 &amp; 6 below . In the first two cases , draw a perpendicular line segment from O to ( overlineAB ) at the point D. <p> The radii ( overlineOAtext and overlineOB ) have the same length R , so GAOB is an isosceles triangle . Thus , from elementary geometry we know that ( overlineOD ) bisects both the angle ( angle ) AOB and the side ( overlineAB ) . So ( angle ) AOD = ( frac1 2 angle ) AOB and AD = ( fracc 2 ) . But since the inscribed angle ( angle ) ACB and the central angle ( angle ) AOB intercept the same arc- AB , we know from Theorem 1 that ( angle ) ACB = ( frac1 2 angleAOB ) . Hence , ( angle ) ACB = ( angle ) AOD . So since C = ( angle ) ACB , we have <p> so by the Law of Sines the result follows if O is inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GABC , say , on the side AB , as in Figure 6 . Then AB is a diameter of the circle , so C = 90- by Thales ' Theorem . Hence , sin C = 1 , and so 2R = AB = c = ( fracc 1 = fracc sin C ) , and the result again follows by the Law of Sines . <p> Example 1 <p> Find the radius R of the circumscribed circle for the triangle GABC whose sides are a = 3 , b = 4 , and c = 5 . <p> Note that since R = 2.5 , the diameter of the circle is 5 , which is the same as AB . Thus , AB must be a diameter of the circle , and so the center O of the circle is the midpoint of AB . <p> Corollary 1 For any right triangle , the hypotenuse is a diameter of the circumscribed circle , i.e. the center of the circle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse . <p> For the right triangle in the above example , the circumscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found by measuring a distance of 2.5 units from A along ( overlineAB ) . We need a different procedure for acute and obtuse triangles , since for an acute triangle the center of the circumscribed circle will be inside the triangle , and it will be outside for an obtuse triangle . Notice from the proof of Theorem 2 that the center O was on the perpendicular bisector of one of the sides ( overlineAB ) ) . Similar arguments for the other sides would show that O is on the perpendicular bisectors for those sides : <p> Corollary 2 . For any triangle , the center of its circumscribed circle is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides . <p> Recall from geometry how to create the perpendicular bisector of a line segment : at each endpoint use a compass to draw an arc with the same radius . Pick the radius large enough so that the arcs intersect at two points , as in Figure 8 . The line through those two points is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment . For the circumscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only two of the sides ; their intersection will be the center of the circle . <p> Example 2 <p> Find the radius R of the circumscribed circle for the triangle GABC where a = 2 , b = 3 , and c = 4 . Then draw the triangle and the circle . <p> Solution : Using the Law of Cosines , we can find that A = 28.9- , so 2R = a sin A = 2 sin 28.9- = 4.14 , so ( boxedR = 2.07 ) . <p> In Figure 10 we show how to draw GABC : use a ruler to draw the longest side ( overlineAB ) of length c = 4 , then use a compass to draw arcs of radius 3 and 2 centered at A and B , respectively . The intersection of the arcs is the vertex C. <p> In Figure 11 we show how to draw the circumscribed circle : draw the perpendicular bisectors of ( overlineAB ) and ( overlineAC ) ; their intersection is the center O of the circle . Use a compass to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theorem 2 can be used to derive another formula for the area of a triangle : <p> Theorem 3 . For a triangle GABC , let K be its area and let R be the radius of its circumscribed circle . Then $$K = fracabc4R ( textand hence R = fracabc4K ) . $$ <p> In addition to a circumscribed circle , every triangle has an inscribed circle , i.e. a circle to which the sides of the triangle are tangent , as in Figure 12 . <p> Let r be the radius of the inscribed circle , and let D , E , and F be the points on ( overlineAB , overlineBC ) , and ( overlineAC ) , respectively , at which the circle is tangent . Then ( overlineOD ) G ( overlineAB ) , ( overlineOE ) G ( overlineBC ) , and ( overlineOF ) G ( overlineAC ) . Thus , GOAD and GOAF are equivalent triangles , since they are right triangles with the same hypotenuse ( overlineOA ) and with corresponding legs ( overlineOD ) and ( overlineOF ) of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = ( angle ) OAF , which means that ( overlineOA ) bisects the angle A. Similarly , ( overlineOB ) bisects B and ( overlineOC ) bisects C. We have thus shown : <p> For any triangle , the center of its inscribed circle is the intersection of the bisectors of the angles . <p> We will use Figure 12 to find the radius r of the inscribed circle . Since ( overlineOA ) bisects A , we see that tan ( frac1 2 A = fracr AD ) , and so r = AD tan ( frac1 2 ) A. Now , GOAD and GOAF are equivalent triangles , so AD = AF . Similarly , DB = EB and FC = CE . Thus , if we let s = ( frac1 2 ) ( a+b+ c ) , we see that <p> Recall from geometry how to bisect an angle : use a compass centered at the vertex to draw an arc that intersects the sides of the angle at two points . At those two points use a compass to draw an arc with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersect at a point , as in Figure 13 . The line through that point and the vertex is the bisector of the angle . For the inscribed circle of a triangle , you need only two angle bisectors ; their intersection will be the center of the circle . <p> Example 3 <p> Find the radius r of the inscribed circle for the triangle GABC where a = 2 , b = 3 , and c = 4 .

In sexual reproduction , meiosis produces haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization to produce a diploid zygote ( Figure 1 and Figure 3 ) . <p> Figure 1 : Fertilization of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haploid gametes fuse to produce a diploid zygote . <h> Asexual Reproduction <p> Are there male and female bacteria ? How could you tell ? Remember , bacteria have just one chromosome ; they do not have an X or Y chromosome . So they probably have a very simplified form of reproduction . Asexual reproduction , the simplest and most primitive method of reproduction , produces a clone , an organism that is genetically identical to its parent . Haploid gametes are not involved in asexual reproduction . A parent passes all of its genetic material to the next generation . All prokaryotic and many eukaryotic organisms reproduce asexually . <p> There are a number of types of asexual reproduction including fission , fragmentation and budding . In fission , a parent separates into two or more individuals of about equal size . In fragmentation , the body breaks into several fragments , which later develop into complete adults . In budding , new individuals split off from existing ones . The bud may stay attached or break free from the parent . Eukaryotic organisms , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Figure 2 ) . <p> Figure 2 : Magnification of a budding yeast . <h> Sexual Reproduction and Meiosis <p> Why do you look similar to your parents , but not identical ? First , it is because you have two parents . Second , it is because of sexual reproduction . <p> Whereas asexual reproduction produces genetically identical clones , sexual reproduction produces genetically diverse individuals . As both parents contribute half of the new organism 's genetic material , the offspring will have traits of both parents , but will not be exactly like either parent . <p> Organisms that reproduce sexually by joining gametes , a process known as fertilization , must have a mechanism to produce haploid gametes . This mechanism is meiosis , a type of cell division that halves the number of chromosomes . During meiosis the pairs of chromosomes separate and segregate randomly to produce gametes with one chromosome from each pair . Meiosis involves two nuclear and cell divisions without an interphase in between , starting with one diploid cell and generating four haploid cells ( Figure 3 ) . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four stages : prophase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase . These stages are similar to those of mitosis , but there are distinct and important differences . <p> Prior to meiosis , the cell 's DNA is replicated , generating chromosomes with two sister chromatids . A human cell prior to meiosis will have 46 chromosomes , 22 pairs of homologous autosomes , and 1 pair of sex chromosomes . Homologous chromosomes are similar in size , shape , and genetic content . You inherit one chromosome of each pair from your mother and the other one from your father . <p> The 8 stages of meiosis are summarized below . The stages will be described for a human cell , starting with 46 chromosomes . <p> Figure 3 : During meiosis the number of chromosomes is reduced from a diploid number ( 2n ) to a haploid number ( n ) . During fertilization , haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes ( 2n ) is restored . <p> Prophase I : prophase I is very similar to prophase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Prophase I , the nuclear envelope breaks down , the chromosomes condense , and the centrioles begin to migrate to opposite poles of the cell , with the spindle fibers growing between them . During this time , the homologous chromosomes form pairs . These homologous chromosomes line up gene-for-gene down their entire length , allowing crossingover to occur . This is an important step in creating genetic variation . <p> Metaphase I : In metaphase I , the 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell . During mitosis , 46 individual chromosomes line up during metaphase . Some chromosomes inherited from the father are facing one side of the cell , and some are facing the other side . <p> Anaphase I : During anaphase I the spindle fibers shorten , and the homologous chromosome pairs are separated from each other . One chromosome from each pair moves toward one pole , with the other moving toward the other pole , resulting in a cell with 23 chromosomes at one pole and the other 23 at the other pole . The sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 23 pairs of chromosomes , this independent assortment of chromosomes produces ( 223 ) , or 8,388,608 possible configurations . <p> Telophase I : The spindle fiber disassembles and the nucleus reforms . This is quickly followed by cytokinesis and the formation of two haploid cells , each with a unique combination of chromosomes , some from the father and the rest from the mother . After cytokinesis , both cells immediately enter meiosis II ; the DNA is not copied in between . Meiosis II is essentially the same as mitosis , separating the sister chromatids from each other . <p> Prophase II : Once again the nucleus breaks down , and the spindle begins to reform as the centrioles move to opposite sides of the cell . <p> Metaphase II : The spindle fibers align the 23 chromosomes , each made out of two sister chromatids , along the equator of the cell . <p> Anaphase II : The sister chromatids are separated and move to opposite poles of the cell . As the chromatids separate , each is known as a chromosome . Anaphase II results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cell ; each chromosome contains half as much genetic material as at the start of anaphase II . <p> Telophase II : The nucleus reforms and the spindle fibers break down . Each cell undergoes cytokinesis , producing four haploid cells , each with a unique combination of genes and chromosomes . <p> Figure 4 : Meiosis is a process in which a diploid cell divides itself into four haploid cells . c represents the number of chromosomes , n represents a haploid cell , 2n represents a diploid cell . <h> Meiosis and Genetic Variation <p> Sexual reproduction results in infinite possibilities of genetic variation . This occurs through a number of mechanisms , including crossing-over , the independent assortment of chromosomes during anaphase I , and random fertilization . <p> Crossing-over occurs during prophase I. Crossing-over is the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes . Recall during prophase I , homologous chromosomes line up in pairs , gene-for-gene down their entire length , forming a configuration with four chromatids , known as a tetrad . At this point , the chromatids are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch chromosomes , that is , the material breaks off and reattaches at the same position on the homologous chromosome ( Figure 5 ) . This exchange of genetic material can happen many times within the same pair of homologous chromosomes , creating unique combinations of genes . This process is also known as recombination . <p> Figure 5 : Crossing-over . A maternal strand of DNA is shown in red . Paternal strand of DNA is shown in blue . Crossing over produces two chromosomes that have not previously existed . The process of recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of parental chromosomes ( M , F ) . This results in the generation of novel chromosomes ( C1 , C2 ) that share DNA from both parents . <p> As mentioned above , in humans there are over 8 million configurations in which the chromosomes can line up during metaphase I. It is the specific processes of meiosis , resulting in four unique haploid cells , that results in these many combinations . Figure 6 compares mitosis and meiosis . This independent assortment , in which the chromosome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any gamete , produces the potential for tremendous genetic variation . Together with random fertilization , more possibilities for genetic variation exist between any two people than individuals alive today . Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male . In humans , over 8 million ( ( 223 ) ) chromosome combinations exist in the production of gametes in both the male and female . A sperm cell , with over 8 million chromosome combinations , fertilizes an egg cell , which also has over 8 million chromosome combinations . That is over 64 trillion unique combinations , not counting the unique combinations produced by crossing-over . In other words , each human couple could produce a child with over 64 trillion unique chromosome combinations . <h> Gametogenesis <p> At the end of meiosis , haploid cells are produced . These cells need to further develop into mature gametes capable of fertilization , a process called gametogenesis ( Figure 7 ) . Gametogenesis differs between the sexes . In the male , the production of mature sperm cells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the female , the production of a mature egg cell , oogenesis , results in just one mature gamete . <p> Figure 7 : Analogies in the process of maturation of the ovum and the development of the spermatids . Four haploid spermatids form during meiosis from the primary spermatocyte , whereas only 1 mature ovum , or egg forms during meiosis from the primary oocyte . Three polar bodies may form during oogenesis . These polar bodies will not form mature gametes . <p> During spermatogenesis , primary spermatocytes go through the first cell division of meiosis to produce secondary spermatocytes . These are haploid cells . Secondary spermatocytes then quickly complete the meiotic division to become spermatids , which are also haploid cells . The four haploid cells produced from meiosis develop a flagellum tail and compact head piece to become mature sperm cells , capable of swimming and fertilizing an egg . The compact head , which has lost most of its cytoplasm , is key in the formation of a streamlined shape . The middle piece of the sperm , connecting the head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cell . The sperm cell essentially contributes only DNA to the zygote . <p> On the other hand , the egg provides the other half of the DNA , but also organelles , building blocks for compounds such as proteins and nucleic acids , and other necessary materials . The egg , being much larger than a sperm cell , contains almost all of the cytoplasm a developing embryo will have during its first few days of life . Therefore , oogenesis is a much more complicated process than spermatogenesis . <p> Oogenesis begins before birth and is not completed until after fertilization . Oogenesis begins when an oogonia ( singular , oogonium ) , which are the immature eggs that form in the ovaries before birth , with the diploid number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis to form primary oocytes , also with the diploid number . It proceeds as a primary oocyte undergoes the first cell division of meiosis to form secondary oocytes with the haploid number of chromosomes . A secondary oocyte undergoes the second meiotic cell division to form a haploid ovum if it is fertilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from meiosis contains most of the cytoplasm , nutrients , and organelles . This unequal distribution of materials produces one large cell , and one cell with little more than DNA . This other cell , known as a polar body , eventually breaks down . The larger cell undergoes meiosis II , once again producing a large cell and a polar body . The large cell develops into the mature gamete , called an ovum . <h> Sexual Life Cycles <p> Eukaryotes have three different versions of the sexual life cycle : a haploid life cycle , a diploid life cycle , and a life cycle known as the alternation of generations ( Figure 8 ) . A life cycle is the span in the life of an organism from one generation to the next . All species that reproduce sexually follow a basic pattern , alternating between haploid and diploid chromosome numbers . The sexual life cycle depends on when meiosis occurs and the type of cell that undergoes meiosis . <p> Figure 8 : Sexual Life Cycles . <p> Haploid Life Cycles <p> The haploid life cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle , such as many protists and some fungi and algae , spend the majority of their life cycle as a haploid cell . In fact , the zygote is the only diploid cell . The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis , producing four haploid cells , which grow into haploid multicellular organisms . These organisms produce gametes by mitosis . The gametes fuse through a process called fusion to produce diploid zygotes which undergo meiosis , continuing the life cycle . <p> Diploid Life Cycles <p> Organisms that have a diploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as diploid adults . All diploid adults inherit half of their DNA from each parent . When they are ready to reproduce , diploid reproductive cells undergo meiosis and produce haploid gametes . These gametes then fuse through fertilization and produce a diploid zygote , which immediately enters ( G1 ) of the cell cycle . Next , the zygote 's DNA is replicated . Finally , the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells . Through repeated rounds of growth and division , this organism becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Generations <p> Plants , algae , and some protists have a life cycle that alternates between diploid and haploid phases , known as alternation of generations . In plants , the life cycle alternates between the diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte . Spore forming cells in the diploid sporophyte undergo meiosis to produce spores , a haploid reproductive cell . Spores can develop into an adult without fusing with another cell . The spores give rise to a multicellular haploid gametophyte , which produce gametes by mitosis . The gametes fuse , producing a diploid zygote , which grow into the diploid sporophyte.

@@119688692 @8688692/ <h> Introduction to Chemical Stoichiometry 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> The objective of this article is to teach readers about the basics of chemical stoichiometry. 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Chemical stoichiometry is known as the math of chemical reactions . In general , stoichiometry let 's you determine the quantity of a product or reactant generated or needed under given circumstances . Stoichiometry can be done with any reaction , and many things can be done to complicate the calculations further . This article will focus on the basics , but it will also show how the problems can be more difficult . <h> Mole Ratio <p> This is where the chemical equation comes into play . The equation must be balanced to find a mole ratio . A mole ratio is the ratio of moles of one chemical to moles of another chemical . The two chemicals involved can be two products , two reactants , or one of each . The mole ratio is also the easiest and by far the most common way to convert between units of two different chemicals in problems . <p> Example 1 : When 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon dioxide are created ? <p> Solution : We must first write out the equation and balance it . As you should know , carbonic acid will decompose into carbon dioxide and water : <p> $$H2CO3 rightarrow H2O + CO2$$ <p> This equation is balanced as is , and therefore all mole ratios will be 1:1 . In particular , 1 mole of carbon dioxide will be created for every 1 mole of carbonic acid that is decomposed : <p> Although this is a lot of work , it only scratches the surface of what chemical stoichiometry does . At its core , it involves mole ratios , but it is not uncommon for the conversions to involve much more . As a rule of thumb , a stoichiometry problem will always involve a conversion between chemicals , so if you are not converting from one chemical to another , typically in the form of a mole ratio , you have made a mistake . <h> Stoichiometry with Molar Mass Conversions <p> One additional conversion that may be necessary in stoichiometry problems is a molar mass conversion . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals involved with a periodic table to perform all necessary conversions . While this step is not too difficult , it unarguably adds to the complexity of the entire problem , and it gives you another opportunity to make a mistake . <p> Example 3 : Consider this double-replacement reaction : <p> $$Pb(BrO4)2 + Al2O3 rightarrow Al(BrO4)3 + PbO$$ <p> 56.5 grams of Lead ( II ) Perbromate are reacted with an excess of Aluminum Oxide . How many moles of Lead ( II ) Oxide are created ? <p> Solution : Balance the equation first , in order to get the mole ratio : <p> $$3Pb(BrO4)2 + Al2O3 rightarrow 2Al(BrO4)3 + 3PbO$$ <p> Lead ( II ) Perbromate 's chemical formula is ( Pb(BrO4)2 ) . Use this to find its molar mass , a necessary step to make a molar mass conversion : <p> $$207.20 + 2(79.90) + 8(16.00) = 495.00 ; g/mol$$ <p> We have 56.5 grams of Lead ( II ) Perbromate , and we need to find the number of moles of Lead ( II ) Oxide created . Therefore , the conversion has two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio : <p> If 65.4 grams of water were produced , how many grams of ( H2CO42- ) were there to begin with ? <p> Solution : What makes this more complicated than the previous problem is that two molar mass conversions are necessary , as opposed to one . Luckily , the equation is balanced as is , with coefficients of 1 for all chemicals in the equation . Use a periodic table to find the molar masses of both chemicals involved in the problem : <p> ( H2O ) : $$2(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02 ; g/mol$$ <p> ( H2CO42- ) : $$2(1.01) + 12.01 + 4(16.00) = 80.04 ; g/mol$$ <p> The series of conversions will be as follows : one molar mass conversion , the mole ratio ( which is 1:1 ) , and then the other molar mass conversion , to find the mass of ( H2CO42- ) : <h> Limiting Reactants <p> It is very rare for both reactants in a chemical reaction to be used up at the same time , so one of them will usually be exhausted first . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left over is known as the excess reactant . In many cases it is necessary to determine the limiting reactant . Otherwise you run the risk of calculating a nonexistent and/or incorrect quantity . <p> For a chemical to be a limiting reactant , you must need more of it than you have . Therefore , the key is to find how much of each reactant you need to react with the entirety of the other reactant . These answers should be in moles for optimal comparison . <p> Part I : How many moles of Chromium ( III ) Nitrate do you need to react with all the Calcium metal ? <p> Our Calcium is in grams , so a molar mass conversion will be necessary . According to the periodic table , the molar mass of Calcium is 40.08 grams per mole . <p> However , our quantity of Calcium that we have is in grams , so convert it to moles : <p> $$502 ; g ; Ca times frac1 ; mol ; Ca40.08 ; g ; Ca = 12.5 ; mol ; Ca$$ <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chromium ( III ) Nitrate ( here it is really important to understand the rationale behind this ) . Therefore , the Calcium will be reacted with first , and by definition , it is the limiting reactant . <p> The limiting reactant has now been determined . The second part of this example will illustrate how knowledge of the limiting reactant is useful . <p> Example 5b : In the reaction above , how many moles of solid Chromium will be made ? <p> Solution : We know that we have 12.5 moles of Calcium , and that Calcium is the limiting reactant . Therefore , we must base our calculations on the amount of Calcium we have , because once it is gone , no more of either product can be made ( again , look at the reasoning carefully ; it is necessary with every limiting reactant problem ) . From the balanced chemical equation , we know that the Calcium-to-Chromium mole ratio is 3:2 . Use this to find the number of moles of Chromium that are made : <p> We need more oxygen gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the oxygen gas is the limiting reactant . Therefore , once the 3.9169 moles of oxygen gas are exhausted , no more water can be made . Since the oxygen gas is the limiting reactant , we base our calculations for the mass of water produced on the oxygen gas . From before , the molar mass of water is 18.02 grams per mole . Convert our quantity of oxygen to moles of water with a mole ratio and a molar mass conversion : <h> Further Complications <p> Although Example 6 was very complicated , there are a few other ways to complicate the procedure of solving a stoichiometry problem . Two more examples will illustrate some of these possibilities . <p> Example 7 : Consider the following synthesis reaction : <p> $$Cr2O3 + O2 rightarrow Cr2(O2)3$$ <p> 22.3 grams of Chromium ( III ) Oxide and 55.7 moles of Oxygen are available for reaction . How many milligrams of Chromium ( III ) Peroxide will form ? <p> Solution : Not only is this a limiting reactant problem , but the unit of the final answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . As usual , begin by balancing the chemical equation : <p> $$2Cr2O3 + 3O2 rightarrow 2Cr2(O2)3$$ <p> The next step is to determine the limiting reactant . Since the starting quantity of Chromium ( III ) Oxide is in grams , find its molar mass in order to do a molar mass conversion . <p> At this point we can stop , because we know we have more oxygen than we need to react with all the Chromium ( III ) Oxide , so the oxygen gas is the excess reactant , and Chromium ( III ) Oxide is the limiting reactant . From here we must now work to find the mass of Chromium ( III ) Peroxide that is produced . In order to get a mass , we need a mole ratio and a molar mass conversion . Find the molar mass of Chromium ( III ) Peroxide : <p> $$2(52.00) + 3 ( 2 ( 16.00 ) ) = 200.00 ; g/mol$$ <p> Now convert our amount of the limiting reactant to the mass of our product : <p> A .042 cubic meter block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H2N4 ) . Given that the density of magnesium bicarbonate is 2.96 grams per cubic centimeter , how many moles of carbon dioxide are created ? <p> Solution : The curveball of this problem is that a density conversion is required , along with several other conversions . However , before doing that math , balance the equation , which should be pretty easy if you 've been understanding the article thus far : <p> $$H2N4 + Mg(HCO3)2 rightarrow MgN4 + 2H2O + 2CO2$$ <p> Now we have access to our required mole ratios . As with all stoichiometry problems , it is ideal to have the quantities of our reactants converted to moles . However , rather than a mole quantity or mass of magnesium bicarbonate , we have its volume and density . These can be multiplied to find the mass of the block :

For example , the element chlorine ( Cl ) is a poisonous gas , but when it combines with sodium ( Na ) to form sodium chloride ( NaCl ) , it is no longer toxic . You may even eat it on your food . Sodium chloride is just table salt . What process changes a toxic chemical like chlorine into a much different substance like table salt ? <h> What are Chemical Reactions <p> A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into other chemical substances . The substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants . The substances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . During the reaction , the reactants are used up to create the products . For example , when methane burns in oxygen , it releases carbon dioxide and water . In this reaction , the reactants are methane ( ( CH4 ) ) and oxygen ( ( O2 ) ) , and the products are carbon dioxide ( ( CO2 ) ) and water ( ( H2 O ) ) . <p> Chemical Equations <p> A chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation . Using the same example , the burning of methane gas can be represented by the equation : <p> $$CH4 + 2 O2 G CO2 + 2 H2 O$$ <p> The arrow in a chemical equation separates the reactants from the products and shows the direction in which the reaction occurs . If the reaction could also occur in the opposite direction , then two arrows , one pointing in each direction , would be used . On each side of the arrow , a mixture of chemicals is indicated by the chemical symbols joined by a plus sign ( + ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ( 2 O2 ) ) indicate how many molecules of the chemicals are involved in the reaction . ( If there is no number in front of a chemical symbol , it means that just one molecule is involved . ) <p> In a chemical reaction , the quantity of each element does not change . There is the same amount of each element at the end of the reaction as there was at the beginning . This is reflected in the chemical equation for the reaction . The equation should be balanced . In a balanced equation , the same number of atoms of a given element appear on each side of the arrow . For example , in the equation above , there are four hydrogen atoms on each side of the arrow . <p> Types of Chemical Reactions <p> In general , a chemical reaction involves the breaking and forming of chemical bonds . In the methane reaction above , bonds are broken in methane and oxygen , and bonds are formed in carbon dioxide and water . A reaction like this , in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustion reaction . This is just one of many possible types of chemical reactions . Other types of chemical reactions include synthesis , decomposition , and substitution reactions . <p> A synthesis reaction occurs when two or more chemical elements or compounds unite to form a more complex product . For example , nitrogen ( ( N2 ) ) and hydrogen ( ( H2 ) ) unite to form ammonia ( ( NH3 ) ) : <p> $$N2 + 3 H2 G 2 NH3$$ <p> A decomposition reaction occurs when a compound is broken down into smaller compounds or elements . For example , water ( ( H2 O ) ) breaks down into hydrogen ( ( H2 ) ) and oxygen ( ( O2 ) ) : <h> Chemical Reactions and Energy <p> Some chemical reactions consume energy , whereas other chemical reactions release energy . Each of the energy changes that occur during a reaction are graphed in Figure 1 . In the reaction on the left , energy is released . In the reaction on the right , energy is consumed . <p> Figure 1 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right consumes energy . <p> Exothermic Reactions <p> Chemical reactions that release energy are called exothermic reactions . An example is the combustion of methane described earlier . In organisms , exothermic reactions are called catabolic reactions . Catabolic reactions break down molecules into smaller units . An example is the breakdown of glucose molecules for energy . Exothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation : <p> Reactants G Products + Heat <p> Endothermic Reactions <p> Chemical reactions that consume energy are called endothermic reactions . An example is the synthesis of ammonia , described above . In organisms , endothermic reactions are called anabolic reactions . Anabolic reactions construct molecules from smaller units . An example is the synthesis of proteins from amino acids . Endothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation : <p> Reactants + Heat G Products <p> Activation Energy <p> Regardless of whether reactions are exothermic or endothermic , they all need energy to get started . This energy is called activation energy . Activation energy is like the push you need to start moving down a slide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you start , you keep moving without being pushed again . The concept of activation energy is illustrated in Figure 2 . <p> Figure 2 : To start this reaction , a certain amount of energy is required , called the activation energy . How much activation energy is required depends on the nature of the reaction and the conditions under which the reaction takes place . <p> Why do reactions need energy to get started ? In order for reactions to occur , three things must happen , and they all require energy : <p> Reactant molecules must collide . To collide , they must move , so they need kinetic energy . <p> Unless reactant molecules are positioned correctly , intermolecular forces may push them apart . To overcome these forces and move together requires more energy . <p> If reactant molecules collide and move together , there must be enough energy left for them to react . <h> Rates of Chemical Reactions <p> The rates at which chemical reactions take place in organisms are very important . Chemical reactions in organisms are involved in processes ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , when you wave goodbye , it requires repeated contractions of muscles in your arm over a period of a couple of seconds . A huge number of reactions must take place in that time , so each reaction can not take longer than a few milliseconds . If the reactions took much longer , you might not finish waving until sometime next year . Factors that help reactant molecules collide and react speed up chemical reactions . These factors include the concentration of reactants and the temperature at which the reactions occur . <p> Reactions are usually faster at higher concentrations of reactants . The more reactant molecules there are in a given space , the more likely they are to collide and react . <p> Reactions are usually faster at higher temperatures . Reactant molecules at higher temperatures have more energy to move , collide , and react . <h> Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions <p> Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells . For example , the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide . Therefore , the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst . A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions . In organisms , catalysts are called enzymes . <p> Like other catalysts , enzymes are not reactants in the reactions they control . They help the reactants interact but are not used up in the reactions . Instead , they may be used over and over again . Unlike other catalysts , enzymes are usually highly specific for particular chemical reactions . They generally catalyze only one or a few types of reactions . <p> Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up reactions . They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second . As a result , the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous . A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme but less than a second with the enzyme . <p> How Enzymes Work <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all catalysts , enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions . This is illustrated in Figure 3 . The biochemical reaction shown in the figure requires about three times as much activation energy without the enzyme as it does with the enzyme . <p> Figure 3 : The reaction represented by this graph is a combustion reaction involving the reactants glucose ( ( C6 H12 O6 ) ) and oxygen ( ( O2 ) ) . The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide ( ( CO2 ) ) and water ( ( H2 O ) ) . Energy is also released during the reaction . The enzyme speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to start . Compare the activation energy with and without the enzyme . <p> Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react . For example : <p> Enzymes bring reactants together so they do n't have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random . Enzymes bind both reactant molecules ( called substrate ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enzyme molecule called the active site ( Figure 4 ) . <p> By binding reactants at the active site , enzymes also position reactants correctly , so they do not have to overcome intermolecular forces that would otherwise push them apart . This allows the molecules to interact with less energy . <p> Enzymes may also allow reactions to occur by different pathways that have lower activation energy . <p> The activities of enzymes also depend on the temperature , ionic conditions , and the pH of the surroundings . <p> Figure 4 : This enzyme molecule binds reactant molecules " called substrate " at its active site , forming an enzyme-substrate complex . This brings the reactants together and positions them correctly so the reaction can occur . After the reaction , the products are released from the enzyme 's active site . This frees up the enzyme so it can catalyze additional reactions . <p> Some enzymes work best at acidic pHs , while others work best in neutral environments . <p> Digestive enzymes secreted in the acidic environment ( low pH ) of the stomach help break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stomach is pepsin , which works best at a pH of about 1.5 . These enzymes would not work optimally at other pHs . Trypsin is another enzyme in the digestive system which break protein chains in the food into smaller parts . Trypsin works in the small intestine , which is not an acidic environment . Trypsin 's optimum pH is about 8 . <p> Biochemical reactions are optimal at physiological temperatures . For example , most biochemical reactions work best at the normal body temperature of 98.6-F . Many enzymes lose function at lower and higher temperatures . At higher temperatures , an enzyme 's shape deteriorates and only when the temperature comes back to normal does the enzyme regain its shape and normal activity . <p> Importance of Enzymes <p> Enzymes are involved in most of the chemical reactions that take place in organisms . About 4,000 such reactions are known to be catalyzed by enzymes , but the number may be even higher . Needed for reactions that regulate cells , enzymes allow movement , transport materials around the body , and move substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another important function of enzymes is to help digest food . Digestive enzymes speed up reactions that break down large molecules of carbohydrates , proteins , and fats into smaller molecules the body can use . Without digestive enzymes , animals would not be able to break down food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they need to survive .

@@119688728 @8688728/ <p> The molar mass of any chemical can be computed with a periodic table , so whenever you need to compute molar masses , pull out a periodic table and a calculator . <h> Rounding Digits <p> Before jumping into any examples , let us clear one misconception . Periodic tables will almost always contain a molar mass for each element , but the number of digits after the decimal point that are included vary from table to table . As a rule of thumb , always use the value rounded to two digits after the decimal point . <p> Example 2 : One periodic table lists the molar mass of Chlorine to be ( 35.453 ) grams per mole . Round this to the correct number of digits . <p> Solution : Use only two digits after the decimal point , making the value that would be used in calculations ( 35.45 ) . <p> If by chance you find a periodic table that has less than two digits after the decimal point , you either have an element where the exact precision is unknown ( including many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lacks precision . In the former case , the real-world scenarios where the non-precise molar masses must be used will be uncommon . In the latter case , find another periodic table . <h> Molar Masses of Elements <p> The molar mass of an individual element is just a number on the periodic table . <p> The last example in this section involves the reverse process ; instead of using a chemical formula to find the molar mass , we use the molar mass to find the chemical . <p> Example 9 : A diatomic element is an element whose stable elemental form has two atoms of the element bonded together . What diatomic molecule has a molar mass of ( 32.00 ; g ) ? <p> Solution : Since two atoms of this element have a combined molar mass of ( 32.00 ; g ) , one atom of the element has half of that molar mass , ( 16.00 ; g ) . We search the periodic table to find an element with this molar mass , and notice that oxygen has a molar mass of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chemical formula of elemental oxygen is ( O2 ) . <h> Molar Mass Conversions <p> Okay , so now that you know how to find the molar mass of any chemical that exists , the question arises : what are molar mass conversions used for ? Since the unit is grams per mole , the molar mass can be used as a conversion factor . <p> In conversion problems , two different molar mass conversions can be used . <p> If ( M ) is the magnitude of the molar mass , use one of two conversions : <p> A. If converting from grams to moles , use the conversion ( frac1M ) moles per gram . <p> B. If converting from moles to grams , use the conversion ( fracM1 ) grams per mole . <p> Example 10 : How many moles of Rhenium metal are in 352 grams of it ? <p> Solution : From the periodic table , the molar mass of Rhenium is 101.07 grams per mole . Convert grams to moles as follows : <p> $$352 g Rh times frac1 mol Rh101.07 g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample of water has a mass of 34.0 kilograms . How many moles are present ? <p> Solution : This problem has an extra step . Since molar mass conversions involve grams and moles , the kilograms must first be converted to grams : <p> $$34.0 kg H2O times frac1000 g H2O1 kg H2O = 34000 g H2O$$ <p> Now find the molar mass of water ( this is something you may eventually have memorized , as it is a common substance in real-world applications ) : <p> $$2(1.01) + 16.00 = 18.02$$ <p> This is , as usual , in grams per mole . Now convert the mass of water to moles : <p> In the previous example , it would also have been perfectly valid to begin by finding the molar mass of water and converting that to kilograms per mole . Then you could use that to convert the mass of water in kilograms directly to moles . <p> The final example contains a real-world scenario , but the calculations still follow the same format . <p> Example 12 : A geologist unearths a large sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lab and measures its mass . His scale gives a reading of ( 12.4 ) kilograms . How many moles of cryolite did he unearth ? <p> Solution : A molar mass conversion converts from grams to moles , or moles to grams , but our mass is in kilograms , so in order to use a molar mass conversion , we must convert the mass to grams : 
@@119688730 @8688730/ <h> Rates of Change in pH <p> Many chemistry classes stop at analyzing pH change and what it means . However , there is another layer that requires calculus : related rates pertaining to pH change . The concepts of related rates taught in calculus classes can be expanded to pH as a solution evaporates , is diluted , or is titrated . This article explores problem-solving in this specific context . Note that the rate of change in pH is the slope of a pH/titration curve , the derivative of pH , which we will denote ( fracdpHdt ) . <p> ###Generic Calculations### <p> Example 1 : Prove that the pH and pOH of any solution change at rates with the same magnitude but in the opposite direction . <p> Solution : Mathematically speaking , we are referring to rates here . We want to prove that ( fracdpHdt = -fracdpOHdt ) for any solution . It 's actually quite simple once you recall that , for any solution , <p> $$pH + pOH = 14$$ <p> We can differentiate this equation . As ( pH ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $$fracdpHdt + fracdpOHdt = 0 Rightarrow$$ <p> $$fracdpHdt = -fracdpOHdt$$ <p> This is generally a good statement to know , but if you undertsand the chemistry behind pH change , this is probably obvious . The introduction of derivatives , however , puts the idea into a new light for many people . <p> Now we can find a general statement for the rate of change of the pH in terms of the rate of change of the hydrogen ion concentration . <p> Example 2 : By definition , <p> $$pH = -log10H+$$ <p> We can use a fancy differentiation technique . To keep the algebra clean , move the negative sign to the other side of the equation : <p> $$-pH = log10H+ Rightarrow$$ <p> Now take the base ( 10 ) exponent of both sides of the equation : <p> $$10-pH = H+$$ <p> Now **30;61;TOOLONG exponents is easier than differentiating logarithms besides the natural logarithm . The left side requires the Chain Rule . Recall that ( fracddxax = ln(a) cdot ax ) , and combine this with the Chain Rule on the left-hand side : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molarity changes . This introduces a new set of complications in the realm of related rates as you may know the rate of change of volume and must use that to find the rate of change of the molarity . As we said before : <p> $$K = fracmV$$ <p> where ( K ) is the concentration of the solute , ( m ) is the mole quantity of the solute , and ( V ) is the volume of the solution . If the solution either evaporates or is diluted , then the volume changes , but the mole quantity is constant , so ( fracdmdt = 0 ) . To find the rate of change of the concentration as the volume changes , we can use the quotient rule on the above equation to differentiate it . Again , the Chain Rule must be used on the functions of time ( concentration and volume ) : <p> This formula is used frequently in this subtopic but sufficiently infrequently that you may be better off remembering how to rederive this formula than you are trying to memorize it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are evaporations . In an evaporation , the volume of the solution decreases , but the mole amount of the solute remains the same , so its concentration increases . In an acidic solution , evaporation decreases the pH . However , in a basic solution , evaporation increases the pH . The related rates in these situations become even more complicated if you do n't initially know the rate of pH change , but only the rate of volume change . <p> Example 3 : A 50-liter solution of 0.5-molar hydrochloric acid is evaporating at a rate of .0005 Liters per second . At what rate is the pH changing when half of the solution has evaporated ? <p> Solution : We need to know how many moles of hydrochloric acid exist in the solution : <p> Now we can use the fact that all of the hydrogen ions in the solution not formed in the equilibrium of water self-ionization are from the hydrochloric acid , so we let ( H+ = HCl ) . This substitution is always done in aqueous solutions--the ions formed from the water always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will use this step from now on without explicitly mentioning it . <p> Now , we need the pH of the solution at the exact moment in time we are analyzing . The initial concentration of hydrogen ions is ( 0.50 ; M ) , but the volume of the solution is halved due to evaporation , so the concentration doubles to ( 1.00 ; M ) . Then we find the pH : <p> Example 4 : A solution of sodium hydroxide has 22.5 moles of sodium hydroxide and has a starting pH of ( 11.5 ) . The pH decreases at a constant rate of ( .025 ) units per second as the solution evaporates . At what rate is the solution evaporating in liters per second when the pH of the solution is ( 10.5 ) ? <p> Solution : In this case we are given the molar quantity of sodium hydroxide , the starting pH , and the rate of change of the pH . Thus we must work in the reverse direction relative to Example 3 . We know that <p> We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 10.5 ) . That , however , requires finding the molarity of the solution , which in turn requires finding the ( pOH ) ( as the solution is basic ) . The ( pOH ) is <p> $$pOH = 14 - pH = 14 - 10.5 = 3.5$$ <p> Then we can find the molarity of the solution : <p> $$pOH = -log10OH- Rightarrow$$ <p> $$3.5 = -log10OH- Rightarrow$$ <p> $$OH- = 3.16 times 10-4$$ <p> This is important for finding the volume due to the definition of molarity : <p> Now we can solve the rate of pH change equation for ( fracdVdt ) and prepare to plug in all the variables . Just divide both sides of the equation by ( frac-m cdot 10pHln(10) cdot V2 ) : <p> That means the solution is evaporating at a rate of ( .004 ; fracLs ) . Do not worry about the negative sign ; it is only present because the volume is decreasing . <p> ###Dilutions### <p> A *dilution* is where the concentration of a solute is decreased by adding more solvent--typically water . Since the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for an acidic solution , the pH will increase , whereas for a basic solution , the pH will decrease . Thus in these problems , ( fracdVdt ) will always be positive . The sign of ( fracdpHdt ) depends on whether the solution is acidic or basic . <p> Example 5 : A solution of barium hydroxide has a starting pH of ( 12.00 ) and contains ( .005000 ) moles of ( Ba(OH)2(aq) ) . Water is added to the solution at a rate of ( 1.5 times 10-9 ) liters per second . When the pH of the solution has decreased to ( 11.50 ) , at what rate is the pH decreasing ? <p> Solution : Our target variable in this case is ( fracdpHdt ) . <p> First note that there are two hydroxide ions in every formula unit for barium hydroxide , so ( m = .010000 ) moles , not ( .005000 ) moles . We then center the calculations around the equation <p> This means that when the pH of the solution is 11.50 , it is decreasing at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ###Titrations### <p> The titration rate of change problems are the most complicated of the bunch , because you have the volume and the number of hydrogen/hydroxide ions changing . For this section we let ( fracdmdt ) equal the number of moles of either hydrogen or hydroxide ions in the solution being titrated . <p> This problem analyzes a strong acid-strong base titration . <p> Example 6 : 1200.0 milliliters of aqueous 0.10 molar hydrochloric acid are being titrated by 600.0 milliliters of aqueous 0.20 molar sodium hydroxide . When half of the basic solution has been titrated , at what rate is the pH of the solution changing ? The base is being titrated at a rate of 10.0 milliliters per second . <p> Solution : First note that the solution will be getting increasingly basic , so ( fracdpHdt ) will be positive . We also need to find the number of moles of hydrogen ions that will be present in the solution ( apart from those formed in equilibrium with the water itself ) . To do this , we must find and understand the balanced chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The reactants are used up in a ( 1:1 ) ratio . To find the number of moles of hydrogen ions in the solution ( which is the same as the number of hydrochloric acid molecules ) at the given point in time , we must find the amount of each reactant that is involved : the acid in the initial solution and the base in the part of the solution titrated up to this point .

@@119688797 @8688797/ <p> Yesterday , the US Department of Education launched the #GoOpen campaign to advocate and encourage use of openly licensed educational materials by educators and educational institutions . This is nothing short of , to quote Donald Trump out-of-context , HUGE . This is a landmark achievement in more than a decades ' worth of work of hundreds of leaders in education and technology in this space . This also marks the beginning of a new era of educational publishing , one where textbook publishers and textbooks are not the centerpiece of our narrative . It is not going to be long before these ideas permeate education systems around the world , especially in places where cost of educational resources can have significant implications in access to K-12 education and beyond . <p> As we reflect on our journey so far and celebrate this success with DoE-branded cupcakes , we must take some time to reflect on the bigger challenges that lie ahead of us , primarily as they relate to K-12 education . We might want to consider resisting the urge to look at the product announcements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions to all our problems are around the corner . Many of these have existed in the past in some form or another . <p> We have highlighted 5 key priority areas that we believe need to be addressed within the near future to magnify the implications of this policy advancement . <p> Interoperability One of the biggest challenges that remains to be solved well is interoperability . Despite the existence of hundreds of thousands of well-indexed open educational resources ( OERs ) out there , it is still very difficult for teachers to make two resources in different formats made by different publishers work together . It is also difficult for education " remixers " and curriculum developers to bring these resources together and build consistent experiences for teachers . Interoperability goes well beyond simply formatting , although format and formatting are large glaring problems . The more complex problem is one of coherence . The question that we need to answer sooner rather than later is : how can we make resources built in different contexts for different audiences coherently serve a teacher who is using them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 5-7 years , a number of different online repositories have made it easy to find and sift through hundreds of open resources that a user might find useful based on a keyword search or topic / concept drilldown . However , talk to the teacher who you are closest to and you will likely hear complaints of " not being able to find what I am looking for " . This is a serious problem - one which we have experienced consistently . It remains very hard for teachers to find relevant resources in the context they teach in : the values of the school and classroom environments , the student demographic , the ELL needs , the sequence they are teaching , the instructional strategies , etc . Our priority must shift from mere shallow discovery of content to a more deeper context-based one , if we are to make lives of teachers and instructional coaches easier . <p> Quality and rigor If our room is full of teachers fighting the good fight in classrooms day-in-and-out , and the speaker is an OER advocate , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , alongwith rigor as it relates to alignment to standards and career and college-readiness testing . A large number of resources in the above-mentioned open repositories have not been vetted in very good ways , and completely fail to comply with proficiency expectations . Additionally , a large % of the resources in these libraries were created before states started adopting Common Core or NGSS or reformed state frameworks . Anyone who has a detailed understanding of Common Core knows that it requires a fundamentally new thinking towards development of instructional materials , and it is difficult to easily modify resources made for state standards of the past . So while " millions " of resources are accessible , are they really ones we want to see teachers use ? <p> Rethinking processes and curriculum planning A shift in the choice and nature of the physical resource artefacts schools , school districts and teachers will use in the classrooms requires a shift in processes around procurement , alignment and planning . In the past and for large parts today , textbook vendors sell perfectly coherent bundled programs with thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paced activities , and rich student workbooks . In our new world of open remixability , early adopters are devoid of this luxury atleast in the near future , which many would argue is for good reason . Nevertheless , this requires districts to beef up their instructional teams and fundamentally shift their processes around planning and mapping curriculum to content , skills and assessment , and tying all of them back to the standards . All that while preserving teacher autonomy and putting student achievement at the center . There are no easy solutions or obvious pathways to doing this , at the moment . <p> Participation Our story in the world of OER so far was driven by foundation or state-funded educational materials publishing with a goal to fill gaps of lack of open materials in different subject areas and grade levels .

Then , for the next several hours , you may notice that you do not pass urine as often as normal and that your urine is darker than usual . Do you know why this happens ? Your body is low on water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine . How does the body know when it is low on water ? How does it control the amount of water lost in urine ? The answers to both questions are the kidneys and the glands that control them . <h> Homeostasis and Excretion <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excretion . Homeostasis is the body 's attempt to maintain a constant internal environment . One of the major ways the body achieves homeostasis is through excretion . Excretion is the process of removing wastes and excess water from the body . <p> Homeostasis <p> Homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of all living things . Internal body conditions must be kept within certain limits for the normal functioning of cells . Homeostasis involves keeping many internal factors at more or less constant levels . The factors include body temperature and properties of the blood . For example , the blood must have certain levels of acidity , salts , and nutrients in order for cells to function normally . <p> A variety of homeostatic mechanisms help maintain stability of the internal environment . Each mechanism involves the interaction of at last three components : a receptor , a control center , and an effector . <p> The receptor senses changes in the internal environment and sends the information to the control center . The control center processes the information , determines the appropriate action , and sends a command to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes conditions in the internal environment . <p> An example of a homeostatic mechanism in humans is the regulation of body temperature . This is represented by the diagram in Figure 1 . Temperature receptors in the skin send information about skin temperature to the brain . The brain is the control center . It determines whether the temperature is too high or too low and sends appropriate commands to effectors that control body temperature . Effectors include blood vessels near the surface of the body . If the temperature is too high , the brain commands the blood vessels to dilate , which helps the body lose heat . If the temperature is too low , the brain commands the blood vessels to constrict , which helps the body retain heat . These actions help return body temperature to normal . <p> Figure 1 : Regulation of body temperature is an example of negative feedback . When body temperature deviates from normal , this information feeds back to the brain and sets in motion changes that return body temperature to normal . <p> Negative Feedback and Body Temperature <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback . Negative feedback is a type of homeostatic mechanism in which change in one direction results in a counteractive change in the opposite direction . Negative feedback reverses the direction of change to bring conditions back to normal . Most of the mechanisms that control homeostasis in the human body involve negative feedback . <p> Positive feedback mechanisms also exist , but they are not common in the human body . Positive feedback accelerates or amplifies a change and pushes levels farther away from normal . One example of a positive feedback mechanism in the body is blood clotting . <p> If homeostasis is disturbed , a homeostatic imbalance results . This may result in cells getting too much or not enough of certain substances . Many diseases are caused by homeostatic imbalances . For example , diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the blood contains too much glucose . This can have serious consequences for cells throughout the body . It may lead to damaged blood vessels , heart disease , blindness , and kidney failure . <p> Excretion <p> Excretion is an essential process in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down " nutrients , waste products are produced . For example , when cells metabolize proteins and nucleic acids , nitrogen wastes such as ammonia , urea and uric acid are produced . Ammonia is a toxic substance and must be removed from the blood and excreted from the body . Urea is removed through urine , which is produced in the kidney . Excretion is also necessary to remove excess water , salts , and many other substances from the body . Although the kidneys are the main organs of excretion of wastes from the blood , several other organs are also involved in excretion , including the large intestine , liver , skin , and lungs . <p> The large intestine eliminates solid wastes that remain after the digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract . The liver breaks down excess amino acids in the blood to form ammonia , and then converts the ammonia to urea , a less toxic substance . The liver also breaks down other toxic substances in the blood , including alcohol and drugs . The skin eliminates water and salts in sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Kidneys and Excretion <p> The kidneys are part of the urinary system . The kidneys work together with other urinary system organs in the function of excretion . The urinary system is shown in Figure 2 . <p> Figure 2 : The urinary system . <p> Urinary System <p> In addition to the kidneys , the urinary system includes the ureters , bladder , and urethra . The main function of the urinary system is to filter waste products and excess water from the blood and remove them from the body . The two kidneys , which are described in detail below , filter the blood and form urine . Urine is the liquid waste product of the body that is excreted by the urinary system . <p> From the kidneys , urine enters the ureters , which carry it to the bladder . Each ureter is a muscular tube about 25 centimeters long . Peristaltic movements of the muscles of the ureter send urine to the bladder in small spurts . <p> The bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine . It can stretch to hold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , the stretching of the bladder sends a nerve impulse to the sphincter that controls the opening to the urethra . In response to the impulse , the sphincter relaxes and let 's urine flow into the urethra . <p> The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body . Urine leaves the body through another sphincter in the process of urination . This sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control . <p> Kidneys <p> The kidneys participate in whole-body homeostasis . As mentioned above , one of the promary roles of the kidney is to remove nitrogenous wastes . The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped , reddish brown organs about the size of a fist . They are located just above the waist at the back of the abdominal cavity , on either side of the spine . As shown in Figure 2 , the kidneys are protected by the ribcage . They are also protected by a covering of tough connective tissues and two layers of fat , which help cushion them . <p> Located on top of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . The two adrenal glands secrete several hormones . Hormones are chemical messengers in the body that regulate many body functions . The adrenal hormone aldosterone helps regulate kidney functions . <p> Figure 3 : The human kidney . <p> In Figure 3 , you can see that the kidney has three layers . The outer layer is the renal cortex , and the middle layer is the renal medulla . The inner layer , the renal pelvis , is where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein exits the kidney . The renal artery carries blood to the kidney to be filtered , and the renal vein carries the filtered blood away from the kidney . Structures in the kidney called nephrons are also seen in Figure 3 . Each nephron extends from the cortex down into the medulla . <p> Nephrons <p> Nephrons are the structural and functional units of the kidneys . A single kidney may have more than a million nephrons . The diagram in Figure 4 represents an individual nephron and shows its main structures and functions . The structures include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Figure 4 : Nephron structures and functions . <p> The glomerulus is a cluster of arteries that filters substances out of the blood . Bowman 's capsule is a cup-shaped structure around the glomerulus that collects the filtered substances . The renal tubule is a long , narrow tube surrounded by capillaries that reabsorbs many of the filtered substances and secretes other substances . <p> Filtration , Reabsorption , and Secretion <p> The renal arteries , which carry blood into the kidneys , branch into the capillaries of the glomerulus of each nephron . The pressure of blood moving through these capillaries forces some of the water and dissolved substances in the blood through the capillary walls and into Bowman 's capsule . Bowman 's capsule is composed of layers . The space between the layers , called Bowman 's space , fills with the filtered substances . <p> The process of filtering substances from blood in the glomerulus is called filtration . The fluid that collects in Bowman 's space is called filtrate . It is composed of water , salts , glucose , amino acids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein molecules , blood cells , and platelets " do not pass into Bowman 's space . Instead , they return to the main circulation . <p> From Bowman 's space , the filtrate passes into the renal tubule . The main function of the renal tubule is reabsorption . Reabsorption is the return of needed substances in the filtrate back to the bloodstream . It is necessary because some of the substances removed from the blood by filtration " including water , salts , glucose , and amino acids " are needed by the body . About 75 percent of these substances are reabsorbed in the renal tubule . <p> As shown in Figure 5 , the renal tubule is divided into three parts : the proximal tubule , the Loop of Henle , and the distal tubule . <p> Figure 5 : Parts of the renal tubule and other nephron structures . <p> Filtrate first enters the proximal tubule . This is where that most reabsorption takes place . Tiny projections called microvilli line the proximal tubule and increase the surface area for reabsorption . From the proximal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The loop of Henle carries the filtrate from the cortex down into the medulla and then back up to the cortex again . Its primary purpose is to reabsorb water and salt from the fluid . The remaining fluid enters the distal tubule . The distal tubule carries the fluid , now called tubular fluid , from the loop of Henle to a collecting duct . As it transports the fluid , the distal tubule also reabsorbs or secretes substances such as calcium and sodium . The process of secreting substances into the tubular fluid is called secretion . <p> Urine Formation <p> The collecting ducts are the site of urine formation . This process is crucial for water conservation in the body . The collecting ducts reabsorb water from tubular fluid and return it to the blood . The remaining fluid , called urine , has a smaller volume and a greater concentration than tubular fluid . From the collecting ducts , urine enters a ureter and is eventually excreted from the body . <p> The reabsorption of water by the collecting ducts is controlled by a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pituitary gland , called antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) . ADH makes the collecting ducts more permeable to water , allowing more water to be reabsorbed from tubular fluid . When there is not enough water in the blood , more ADH is secreted , more water is reabsorbed from tubular fluid , and less water is excreted in urine . The opposite happens when there is too much water in the blood . <h> Kidneys and Homeostasis <p> The kidneys play many vital roles in homeostasis . As you have already read , the kidneys filter blood and excrete liquid waste . In fact , the kidneys filter all the blood in the body about 16 times a day , producing approximately 180 liters of filtrate and about 1.5 liters of urine . The kidneys also control the amount of water in the blood by excreting more or less water in urine . <p> Balancing the Blood <p> The kidneys are responsible for maintaining balance in the blood in other ways , as well . For example , they control the acid-base balance in the blood , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ions from tubular fluid as needed . The kidneys also regulate blood concentrations of many other ions " including sodium , potassium , calcium , and magnesium " by the controlling the amounts that are excreted in urine . <p> Secreting Hormone <p> The kidneys also secrete various hormones to help maintain homeostasis . Hormones secreted by the kidneys include erythropoietin and rennin . Erythropoietin is secreted when the blood does not have enough red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen . The hormone stimulates the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow . Rennin is secreted when blood pressure falls . The hormone stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal gland . Aldosterone , in turn , stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb more sodium ions and water . This increases the volume of the blood , which causes an increase in blood pressure . <h> Kidney Disease and Dialysis <p> A person can live a normal , healthy life with just one kidney . However , at least one kidney must function properly to maintain life . Diseases that threaten the health and functioning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kidney Stones <p> Kidney stones are crystals of dissolved minerals that form in urine inside the kidneys . They may start out as small as a grain of salt and grow to be as large as a grapefruit . There may be one large stone or many small ones . Small kidney stones often pass undetected through the urinary tract and out of the body in urine . However , kidney stones may grow large enough before passing to block a ureter . This can cause a buildup of urine above the blockage and severe pain . Large kidney stones can sometimes be broken into smaller pieces that wash out of the urinary tract in urine . The stones are shattered by high-intensity sound waves focused on them from outside the body . Another alternative is to remove kidney stones surgically . <p> Infections <p> Bacterial infections of the urinary tract are very common . In fact , urinary tract infections ( UTI ) are the second most common type of bacterial infections seen by health care providers . Typical organisms that cause UTIs include Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urinary tract . <p> The most common type of UTIs are bladder infections . They can be treated with antibiotics prescribed by a doctor . However , if a bladder infection is not treated , it may spread to the kidney and cause a kidney infection , or pyelonephritis . This is the most serious type of UTI . It can damage the kidney and interfere with normal kidney function . Kidney infections can also be treated with antibiotics but may require other treatments as well . <p> Diabetes <p> Two different types of diabetes can involve the kidneys : diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus . Diabetes insipidus is a disease characterized by the inability to concentrate urine . A person with this disease typically produces many liters of very dilute urine each day . Diabetes insipidus can be caused by a deficiency of ADH ( antidiuretic hormone ) or by the kidneys failing to respond to ADH . If the cause of diabetes insipidus can be treated , it may cure the disease . <p> In diabetes mellitus , the kidneys try to reduce the high glucose level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes frequent urination and increased thirst . If blood glucose levels are not controlled by medication or diet , they may damage capillaries of the glomerulus and interfere with the kidney 's ability to filter blood . Eventually , high glucose levels may lead to kidney failure , in which kidney function is greatly reduced . Kidney failure leads to high levels of urea and other wastes in the blood and may require treatment with dialysis . <p> Dialysis and Transplantation <p> Dialysis is a medical procedure in which blood is filtered with the help of a machine . One type of dialysis treatment is shown in Figure 6 . Blood from the patient 's vein enters the dialysis machine through a tube . Inside the machine , excess water , wastes , and other unneeded substances are filtered from the blood . The filtered blood is then returned to the patient 's vein through another tube . A dialysis treatment usually lasts three to four hours and must be repeated three times a week . Dialysis is generally performed on patients who have kidney failure . Dialysis helps them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Figure 6 : Patient receiving dialysis treatment . <p> The only cure for most people with kidney failure is a kidney transplant . To be suitable for transplantation , the donated kidney must come from a donor who has the same blood and tissue types as the recipient . Even then , the recipient must take medication to suppress the immune system so it does not reject the new kidney .

@@119688878 @8688878/ <h> Chemical Properties of Nitrogen 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Nitrogen is one of the most common elements on Earth , and it is one of many nonmetals . It has an atomic number of seven , meaning a nitrogen atom has seven protons ( and seven electrons ) . Nitrogen is a gas at room temperature . In certain scenarios , it can be very dangerous , but it has some fascinating chemical properties we will explore in this article . The article is a good review of many broader topics in chemistry , but here they are applied to chemicals with nitrogen . We will not go into much depth of how those concepts work , but will focus on what they help us to understand about nitrogen . <h> Valence Shell Electrons <p> The outer orbital of a nitrogen atom , the ( p2 ) orbital , can carry up to six electrons , just like all other ( p ) orbitals . However , a nitrogen atom will only have three of these slots filled . When reacting with other chemicals , it will often try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , the ( N3- ) ion ( called the nitride ion ) is the most common ion formed from a single nitrogen atom . <p> However , depending on the surroundings , the nitrogen atom may interact with another atom that is less stable without three or even five additional electrons that nitrogen has . So , although it is much rarer than a nitrogen atom gaining three electrons and becoming ( N3- ) , it can also lose three or five electrons to form one of two cations : ( N3+ ) or ( N5+ ) . Chances are , if you are a student , your teacher will only expect you to know that the ( N3- ) ion exists , but trying to explain why the other two nitrogen ions can form is a good review of how orbitals work . <p> Example 1 : If ( CaxNy ) is an ionic compound , what are the most likely values of ( x ) and ( y ) ? <p> Solution : Calcium does not generally form any ions besides ( +2 ) cations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the ( -3 ) ion to give the compound a neutral charge . It takes three calcium cations to balance the charge of two nitride anions , so the chemical formula is ( Ca3N2 ) . In this compound , called calcium nitride , ( x = 3 ) and ( y = 2 ) . <h> Nitrogen as a Diatmoic Element <p> Nitrogen is one of a few elements that exists in a diatomic form . That is , its natural elemental form is two atoms bonded together . The Lewis Structure for elemental nitrogen , ( N2 ) , is below : <p> This molecule shows some very important patterns concerning nitrogen in chemical bonding : in perfectly stable molecules , every nitrogen atom will have three bonding pairs of electrons and one lone pair . Nitrogen behaves in this way in order to claim a full outer valence shell of electrons . With two electrons it keeps for itself and six that it shares with another atom , that makes eight electrons total . Thus this form of nitrogen is more stable than a single atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must react with another chemical to become stable . <p> In either case , however , the oxidation number of the nitrogen atom is ( 0 ) . <h> Nitrogen Oxyanions <p> Nitrogen also has a family of oxyanions . The two in this group are the nitrate ion , ( NO3- ) , and the nitrite ion , ( NO2- ) . Either of these can form acids or ionic compounds , much like nitride ions . <p> Example 2a : Calcium Nitrate has a chemical formula of ( Ca(NO3)2 ) . Similarly , Calcium Nitrite has a chemical formula of ( Ca(NO2)2 ) . <p> Example 2b : Either oxyanion of nitrogen can covalently bond with one hydrogen cation to form an acid . <p> Formation of nitric acid : <p> $$H+ + NO3- rightarrow HNO3$$ <p> Formation of nitrous acid : <p> $$H+ + NO2- rightarrow HNO2$$ <h> Other Chemicals with Nitrogen <p> There are a couple major chemicals with nitrogen that have not already been mentioned . <p> The first is azide , ( N3- ) : <p> Some of the nitrogen atoms have negative formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total charge of the molecule is negative . <p> Example 3a : Being an anion , azide sometimes joins up with cations to form ionic compounds . One example is sodium azide , ( NaN3 ) . <p> Example 3b : Azide anions can also combine with hydrogen cations to form ( HN3 ) , known as azidic acid : <p> There are also three other related anions that contain carbon and nitrogen : cyanide ( ( CN- ) ) , cyanate ( ( CNO- ) ) , and thiocyanate ( ( CNS- ) ) . The Lewis Structure for cyanide is shown below . <p> All three of these can form ionic compounds and acids as well . Moving down the group of the periodic table containing oxygen and sulfur , we can say , in theory , that if ( CNSe- ) and ( CNTe- ) exist , they would essentially have the same valence-shell electron orientation as cyanate and thiocyanate . In other words , there Lewis Structures are almost identical . However , the existence of these two latter chemicals is unknown .

@@119688881 @8688881/ <h> G-MG Tilt of earth 's axis and the four seasons <p> The geometry of the earth-sun interaction plays a very prominent role in many aspects of our lives that we take for granted , like the variable length of days throughout the year and the four seasons . This problem will explore the role geometry plays in these experiences . The picture below shows the sun and the earth in four different positions of its annual orbit : <p> The small blue arrows show the direction of the earth 's orbit ( counterclockwise ) around the sun . The red line is perpendicular to the plane of the earth 's orbit and the ( blue ) axis of rotation is tilted approximately ( 23.5circ ) . The tilt is directly toward the sun when the earth is in the position marked ( A ) and directly away from the sun when the earth is in the position marked ( C ) . Here is a close up of how the sun 's rays hit the earth in position ( C ) : <p> In positions ( B ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's axis is neither toward the sun nor away from the sun . <p> In addition to orbiting around the sun once each year , the earth spins on its axis , making one complete revolution each day : it makes a little more than ( 365 ) of these revolution in each year . <p> At which point in the earth 's orbit are the days in the United States shortest ? At which point in the earth 's orbit are the days in the United States the longest ? Explain . <p> Indicate in the picture which sections of the orbit correspond to the four seasons ( winter , spring , summer , fall ) in the Unitied States . Justify your choices . <p> The tropics are the region of the earth where the sun 's rays meet the earth perpendicularly at some point in the year . Explain why the tropics are the area between the lines of latitude of about ( 23.5circ ) in the northern and southern hemispheres . <h> Commentary <p> The four seasons are a familiar part of the lives of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seasons becomes accentuated the further one goes north . The source of the four seasons , as well as their characteristics at different latitudes , is the fact that the axis on which the earth rotates is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit . Because of this tilt , in the middle of the ( North American ) summer , the north pole is pointed toward the sun and so , in fact , the sun does not set at night at the north pole during this period . Similarly , in the middle of the ( North American ) winter , the north pole is pointed away from the sun and the sun never shines at the north pole in these months . <p> This task gives students a chance to relate their weather experiences with a simple geometric model which explains why the seasons occur . It would be good for the students to have ( or make ) a physical model to aid in this visualization . The orbit of the earth around the sun is not circular as depicted in the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If students use a flashlight for the sun , they can experiment to estimate the length of days , at the latitude where they live , at different points in the earth 's orbit around the sun . Perhaps unsurprisingly given its strongly " real world " nature , the task is very high in cognitive complexity , and would represent a rather significant time investment . The benefits of the time are an increased understanding of mathematical modeling , but also an illustration of nearly every Standard for Mathematical Practice ( in particular , those dealing with modeling and problem-solving ) . <p> The solution to the problem mentions the tropics ( the parts of the earth which the sun 's rays meet perpendicularly at some time during the year ) . Also important are the arctic and antarctic circles , the places on the earth where , at some time in the year , there is at least one day when the sun does not rise . More information is available at the following website : <p> The task can be taken much further . Students might measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shadow cast by some fixed object like a flagpole . They could plot this information and eventually think about how to determine what time of the year it is by studying the shadow . <p> Teachers may wish to refer students to the following video after they have worked on this activity : <p> This misconception that the seasons are created by the relative distance between the earth and sun during the earth 's orbit is a very widespread . <h> Solutions 212257 @qwx1072257 <p> In the picture , when the earth is in position ( A ) the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun and consequently the days will be longest and the rays of the sun will shine on the United States most directly . So this is the summer solstice ( Summer Solstice ) . This position also corresponds to the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere because the tilt of the earth toward the sun means that as little of the earth as possible is able to obstruct the sun 's rays . <p> So when the earth is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortest day in the northern hemisphere or the winter solstice ( Winter Solstice ) . This is the point in the earth 's orbit when tilt of the earth 's axis leaves the northern hemisphere pointed directly away from the sun . This means both that the sun 's rays reach the northern hemisphere more obliquely and that the days are the shortest because the largest portion of the earth is able to obstruct the sunshine . <p> First , using the information from part ( a ) we know which points in the orbit correspond to the summer and winter solstices in the northern hemisphere . The summer solstice is the beginning of summer while the winter solstice marks the beginning of winter . Since the full orbit represents one calendar year this means that summer in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the arc from position ( A ) to position ( B ) , fall is the arc from ( B ) to ( C ) , winter is the arc from ( C ) to ( D ) and spring is the arc from ( C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometrically , there will be a large difference in North America between the weather at position ( A ) and at position ( C ) since these represent the points when the northern hemisphere receives the most direct and least direct sunlight . On the other hand , thinking of the positions ( B ) and ( D ) in the picture , here the tilt of the earth plays no role and these two positions are identical as far as the directness and amount of sunlight received . If we imagine for a moment that the earth 's axis pointed directly out of the plane of its orbit about the sun , then at any point ( other than the north and south poles ) there will be equal daylight and night . Indeed , in this situation , the sun would illuminate , at any given moment , all points on the surface of the earth between ( xcirc ) longitude and ( ( 180 + x ) circ ) degrees longitude for some ( x ) between ( 0 ) and ( 180 ) degrees . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth has a fixed longitude and so would be illuminated during exactly half of the earth 's rotation so for ( 12 ) hours . <p> So the points in the diagram marked ( B ) and ( D ) are the points where we have very close to equal amounts of daylight and darkness . These are the autumnal and vernal equinoxes ( Equinox ) . Once all of this information has been gathered , we can again reconfirm that the position of ( A ) in the diagram is the beginning of summer ( in the northern hemisphere ) , ( B ) the beginning of fall , ( C ) the beginning of winter , and ( D ) the beginning of spring . <p> If we imagine the earth spinning for one full revolution in position ( A ) in the diagram , the places on the surface of the earth hit directly ( that is , at a right angle ) by the sun 's rays map out a circumference of the earth . If the axis of the earth were not tilted , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's orbit , then this circumference would be the earth 's equator . Because of the earth 's tilt , instead of sweeping out a regular equator , the points met perpendicularly by the sun map out a ' ' tilted ' ' equator which reaches ( 23.5circ ) north at its northerly most point and ( 23.5circ ) south at its southerly most point . Similarly , if the earth makes a full revolution at position ( C ) in the diagram , the places on the surface of the earth hit directly by the sun 's rays map out a ' ' tilted ' ' equator which is the reflection of the previous ' ' tilted ' ' equator about the plane of orbit of the earth around the sun . Since these ' ' tilted ' ' equators move smoothly as the position of the earth changes , for each point on the earth between ( 23.5circ ) south and ( 23.5circ ) north latitude , there will be exactly one time in each half year ( corresponding to the motion from ( A ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A ) ) when the sun is directly overhead . <p> The previous paragraph represents an idealized model . In practice , the spots on the earth which are actually hit perpendicularly by the sun 's rays would represent a fraction more than ( 365 ) ' ' tilted ' ' equators ( since there are 365 and a fraction days , or full rotations of the earth about its axis , during a year represented by one completion of the earth 's trajectory around the sun ) . This is because we assumed that the earth makes a full orbit at each individual point whereas in fact the earth is moving in its orbit as the days pass . Nonetheless , for any point on the earth in the tropics the sun will be very close to being directly overhead twice in the year .

However , some acids and bases accept/release one hydrogen ion , and some accept/release more than one . The former group of acids and bases are called monoprotic , and the latter group of acids and bases is called polyprotic . Here we will focus on the properties of monoprotic acids and bases , namely how hydrogen ions are transferred , and how concentrations of these ions in acidic and basic aqueous solutions are affected . <h> Transfer of Hydrogen Ions <p> A monoprotic acid will only transfer one hydrogen ion to a base . The charge of a monoprotic acid is always one higher before it gives away the hydrogen ion . The following key statement is common sense : <p> Any acid with only one hydrogen atom is monoprotic . <p> At the same time , some acids with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each scenario will be given . <p> Example 1 : ( HCl ) is an acid . Therefore it is a monoprotic acid because it only has one hydrogen atom : <p> $$HCl rightarrow H+ + Cl-$$ <p> Example 2 : ( CH5+ ) may have five hydrogen atoms , but it is a monoprotic acid . Consider what happens when we remove one hydrogen ion : <p> $$CH5+ rightarrow H+ + CH4$$ <p> We get methane , a very stable compound . ( CH5+ ) is not polyprotic because ( CH4 ) will generally not give away hydrogen atoms ; it is stable as is , because carbon atoms generally have four bonds . <p> Also , many positively-charged ions that have hydrogen atoms are acids , because the excess positive charge can be removed . Example 2 shows one of these ions . <p> Example 3 : The ion ( CH3- ) may appear to be an acid , but to see why it is not , consider the reaction for removing a hydrogen ion : <p> $$CH3- rightarrow H+ + CH22-$$ <p> This transformation makes the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occur . The resulting ion only has two bonds with carbon , rather than the usual four . We will revisit this ion in another section of the article . <h> Acceptance of Hydrogen Ions <p> A monoprotic base will accept a hydrogen ion from an acid , but only one hydrogen ion . If it commonly accepts multiple hydrogen ions , it is a polyprotic base . <p> Example 4 : The molecule ( CH3- ) is a monoprotic base . It will accept a hydrogen ion to give the molecule a neutral charge and a stable configuration : This configuration is stable because Carbon atoms tend to form four bonds , and this configuration allows it to do just that . <p> $$CH3- + H+ rightarrow CH4$$ <p> However adding another hydrogen ion gives a non-neutral charge and an unstable configuration . <p> Example 5 : The hydroxide ion is an exception to the usual principles of monoprotic and polyprotic bases . It will combine with a hydrogen ion to get <p> $$OH- + H+ rightarrow H2O$$ <p> However , even though oxygen atoms generally do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion to form the hydronium ion , which is very important in acid-base chemistry . <p> $$H2O + H+ rightarrow H3O+$$ <h> pH of Monoprotic Acids and Bases <p> The pH of a chemical is defined mathematically as <p> $$pH = -log10H+$$ <p> The brackets around the ion indicate a concentration , in molars , i.e. moles per liter . This type of concentration is called a molarity . If you need to find the pH of a base , use this formula : <p> $$pH = 14 + log10OH-$$ <p> Now , depending on the type of acid or base in the aqueous solution you are working with , the molarity and the hydrogen/hydroxide ion concentration will have a different relationship . <p> A monoprotic acid or base will only release/accept one hydrogen ion per molecule of the acid or base , so for a monoprotic acidic solution , <p> $$Molarity = H+$$ <p> And similarly , for a monoprotic basic solution : <p> $$Molarity = OH-$$ <p> This makes pH calculations for monoprotic acids and bases easier than pH calculations for polyprotic acids and bases . <p> Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrobromic acid . <p> Solution : The chemical formula of hydrobromic acid is ( HBr ) . There is only one hydrogen atom in this molecule , so this is a monoprotic acid , and <p> $$Molarity = H+$$ <p> We can go right to finding the pH : <p> $$pH = -log10 ( .433 ; M ) = .36$$ <p> Example 7 : What is the pH of a ( .0919 ) molar solution of lithium hydroxide ? <p> Solution : The chemical formula of lithium hydroxide is ( LiOH ) . Since there is only one hydroxide ion per molecule , this is a monoprotic base , and <p> $$OH- = .0919 ; M$$ <p> Now we can find the pH with one of the formulas provided : <p> $$pH = 14 + log10OH- = 14 + log10 ( .0919 ; M ) = 12.96$$ <p> Example 8 : Explain why a ( .0599 ) molar solution of barium hydroxide does not have a hydroxide ion concentration of ( .0599 ) molars . <p> Solution : Barium hydroxide 's chemical formula is ( Ba(OH)2 ) . For every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration of the hydroxide ions is twice as high as the concentration of barium hydroxide . <p> The transfer of hydrogen ions is very important in acid-base chemistry , as is how many hydrogen ions can be transferred in a particular scenario . Monoprotic acids and bases , as a pair , will only support the transfer of one hydrogen ion for a pair of the molecules . This has an interesting effect on many facets of acid-base chemistry . 
@@119688883 @8688883/ <h> Trigonometric Functions of Any Angle 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To determine angles using trigonometric functions in Cartesian coordinates . <p> To define the trigonometric functions of any angle - including angles less than 0- or greater than 360- - we need a more general definition of an angle . We say that an angle is formed by rotating a ray ( overrightarrowOA ) about the endpoint O ( called the vertex ) , so that the ray is in a new position , denoted by the ray ( overrightarrowOB ) . The ray ( overrightarrowOA ) is called the initial side of the angle , and ( overrightarrowOB ) is the terminal side of the angle ( see Figure 1 ) . <p> We denote the angle formed by this rotation as ( angle ) AOB , or simply ( angle ) O , or even just O. If the rotation is counter-clockwise then we say that the angle is positive , and the angle is negative if the rotation is clockwise ( see Figure 2 ) . One full counter-clockwise rotation of ( overrightarrowOA ) back onto itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side coincides with the initial side , is an angle of 360- ; in the clockwise direction this would be G360- . Not rotating ( overrightarrowOA ) constitutes an angle of 0- . More than one full rotation creates an angle greater than 360- . For example , notice that 30- and 390- have the same terminal side in Figure 3 , since 30+360 = 390 . <p> We can now define the trigonometric functions of any angle in terms of Cartesian coordinates . Recall that the xy-coordinate plane consists of points denoted by pairs ( x , y ) of real numbers . The first number , x , is the point 's x coordinate , and the second number , y , is its y coordinate . The x and y coordinates are measured by their positions along the x-axis and y-axis , respectively , which determine the point 's position in the plane . This divides the xy-coordinate plane into four quadrants ( denoted by QI , QII , QIII , QIV ) , based on the signs of x and y ( see Figure 4-6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that ++ is in standard position if its initial side is the positive x-axis and its vertex is the origin ( 0,0 ) . Pick any point ( x , y ) on the terminal side of ++ a distance r &gt; 0 from the origin ( see Figure 6 ) . ( Note that r = ( sqrtx2 + y2 ) Why ? ) We then define the trigonometric functions of ++ as follows : <p> $$sin++ = fracyr$$ <p> $$cos++ = fracxr$$ <p> $$tan++ = fracyx$$ <p> $$csc++ = fracry$$ <p> $$sec++ = fracrx$$ <p> $$cot++ = fracxy$$ <p> As in the acute case , by the use of similar triangles these definitions are well-defined ( i.e. they do not depend on which point ( x , y ) we choose on the terminal side of ++ ) . Also , notice that sin ++ G 1 and cos ++ G 1 , since y Gr and x G r in the above definitions . <p> Notice that in the case of an acute angle these definitions are equivalent to our earlier definitions in terms of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that x = adjacent side , y = opposite side , and r = hypotenuse . For example , this would give us sin ++ = ( fracy r = frac opposite hypotenuse ) and cos ++ = ( fracxr ) = ( fracadjacenthypotenuse ) , just as before ( see Figure 7 ) . <p> In Figure 8 we see in which quadrants or on which axes the terminal side of an angle 0- G ++ &lt; 360- may fall . From Figure 4 and formulas ( 1.2 ) and ( 1.3 ) , we see that we can get negative values for a trigonometric function . For example , sin ++ &lt; 0 when y &lt; 0 . Figure 9 summarizes the signs ( positive or negative ) for the trigonometric functions based on the angle 's quadrant : <p> Example 1 <p> Find the exact values of all six trigonometric functions of 120- . <p> Solution : We know 120- = 180- G60- . As we realize , we can use the point ( G1 , ( sqrt3 ) ) on the terminal side of the angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 60- angle has adjacent side of length 1 , opposite side of length ( sqrt3 ) , and hypotenuse of length 2 , as in the figure above . Drawing that triangle in QII so that the hypotenuse is on the terminal side of 120- makes r = 2 , x = G1 , and y = ( sqrt3 ) . Hence : <p> $$sin 120circ= fracyr = fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$cos 120circ= fracxr = frac-12$$ <p> $$tan 120circ= fracyx = fracsqrt3-1$$ <p> $$csc 120circ= fracry = frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$sec 120circ= fracrx = = frac2-1$$ <p> $$cot 120circ= fracxy = frac-1sqrt3$$ <p> Example 2 <p> Find the exact values of all six trigonometric functions of 225- . <p> Solution : We know that 225- = 180- +45- . As we know , we see that we can use the point ( G1 , G1 ) on the terminal side of the angle 225- in QIII , since a basic right triangle with a 45- angle has adjacent side of length 1 , opposite side of length 1 , and hypotenuse of length ( sqrt2 ) , as in the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotenuse is on the terminal side of 225- makes r = ( sqrt2 ) , x = G1 , and y = G1 .

We see that we can use the point ( ( sqrt3 ) , G1 ) on the terminal side of the angle 225- in QIV , since a basic right triangle with a 30- angle has adjacent side of length ( sqrt3 ) , opposite side of length 1 , and hypotenuse of length 2 , as in the figure above . Drawing that triangle in QIV so that the hypotenuse is on the terminal side of 330- makes r = 2 , x = ( sqrt3 ) , and y = G1 . Hence : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$tan 330circ= fracyx = frac-1sqrt3 = 1$$ <p> $$csc 330circ= fracry = - 2$$ <p> $$sec 330circ= fracrx = - frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$cot 330circ= fracxy = - sqrt3 $$ <p> Example 4 <p> Find the exact values of all six trigonometric functions of 0- , 90- , 180- , and 270- . <p> Solution : These angles are different from the angles we have considered so far , in that the terminal sides lie along either the x-axis or the y-axis . So unlike the previous examples , we do not have any right triangles to draw . However , the values of the trigonometric functions are easy to calculate by picking the simplest points on their terminal sides and then using the definitions in formulas ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . <p> For instance , for the angle 0- use the point ( 1,0 ) on its terminal side ( the positive x-axis ) , as in Figure 12 . You could think of the line segment from the origin to the point ( 1,0 ) as sort of a degenerate right triangle whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same length 1 . Regardless , in the formulas we would use r = 1 , x = 1 , and y = 0 . Hence : <p> $$sin 0circ= fracyr = frac01=0$$ <p> $$cos 0circ= fracxr = frac11 = 1 $$ <p> $$tan 0circ= fracyx = frac01 = 0$$ <p> $$csc 0circ= fracry = frac10 = text undefined $$ <p> $$sec 0circ= fracrx = frac11 = 1$$ <p> $$cot 0circ= fracxy = frac10 = text undefined $$ <p> Note that csc 0- and cot 0- are undefined , since division by 0 is not allowed . Similarly , from Figure 12 we see that for 90- the terminal side is the positive y-axis , so use the point ( 0,1 ) . Again , you could think of the line segment from the origin to ( 0,1 ) as a degenerate right triangle whose base has length 0 and whose height equals the length of the hypotenuse . We have r = 1 , x = 0 , and y = 1 , and hence : <p> $$sin 90circ= fracyr = frac11 = 1$$ <p> $$cos 90circ= fracxr = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = text undefined $$ <p> $$csc 90circ= fracry = frac11 = 1$$ <p> $$sec 90circ= fracrx = frac10 = text undefined $$ <p> $$cot 90circ= fracxy = frac01 = 0$$ <p> Likewise , for 180- use the point ( G1,0 ) so that r = 1 , x = G1 , and y = 0 . Hence : <p> $$sin 180circ= fracyr = frac01 = 0$$ <p> $$cos 180circ= fracxr = frac-11 = -1 $$ <p> $$tan 180circ= fracyx = frac0-1 = 0$$ <p> $$csc 180circ= fracry = frac10 = text undefined $$ <p> $$sec 180circ= fracrx = frac1-1 =-1$$ <p> $$cot 180circ= fracxy = frac-10 = text undefined $$ <p> Lastly , for 270- use the point ( 0 , G1 ) so that r = 1 , x = 0 , and y = G1 . Hence : <p> $$sin 270circ= fracyr = frac-11 = -1$$ <p> $$cos 270circ= fracxr = frac01 = 0 $$ <p> $$tan 270circ= fracyx = frac-10 = text undefined $$ <p> $$csc 270circ= fracry = frac1-1 = -1$$ <p> $$sec 270-= fracrx = frac10 = text undefined $$ <p> $$cot 270circ= fracxy = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trigonometric functions of angles between 0- and 360- which are integer multiples of 30- or 45- : <p> Table 1.3 Table of trigonometric function values <p> Angle <p> sin <p> cos <p> tan <p> csc <p> sec <p> cot <p> $$0circ$$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$1$$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$1$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$30circ$$ <p> $$frac12$$ <p> $$fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$2$$ <p> $$frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$sqrt3$$ <p> $$45circ$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt2$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt2$$ <p> $$1$$ <p> $$sqrt2$$ <p> $$sqrt2$$ <p> $$1$$ <p> $$60circ$$ <p> $$fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$frac12$$ <p> $$sqrt3$$ <p> $$frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$2$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$90circ$$ <p> $$1$$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$1$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$120circ$$ <p> $$fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$-frac12$$ <p> $$-sqrt3$$ <p> $$frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$-2$$ <p> $$-frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$135circ$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt2$$ <p> $$-frac1sqrt2$$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$sqrt2$$ <p> $$-sqrt2$$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$150circ$$ <p> $$frac12$$ <p> $$-fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$-frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$2$$ <p> $$-frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$-sqrt3$$ <p> $$180circ$$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$210circ$$ <p> $$-frac12$$ <p> $$-fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$-2$$ <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $$1$$ <p> $$-sqrt2$$ <p> $$-sqrt2$$ <p> $$1$$ <p> $$240circ$$ <p> $$-fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$-frac12$$ <p> $$sqrt3$$ <p> $$-frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$-2$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$270circ$$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$text undefined $$ <p> $$0$$ <p> $$300circ$$ <p> $$-fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$frac12$$ <p> $$sqrt3$$ <p> $$-frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$2$$ <p> $$-frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$315circ$$ <p> $$-frac1sqrt2$$ <p> $$frac1sqrt2$$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$-sqrt2$$ <p> $$sqrt2$$ <p> $$-1$$ <p> $$330circ$$ <p> $$-frac12$$ <p> $$fracsqrt32$$ <p> $$-frac1sqrt3$$ <p> $$-2$$ <p> $$frac2sqrt3$$ <p> $$-sqrt3$$ <p> Since 360- represents one full revolution , the trigonometric function values repeat every 360- . For example , sin 360- = sin 0- , cos 390- = cos 30- , tan 540- = tan 180- , sin ( G45- ) = sin 315- , etc . In general , if two angles differ by an integer multiple of 360- then each trigonometric function will have equal values at both angles . Angles such as these , which have the same initial and terminal sides , are called coterminal . <p> As you may have previously studied , the values of trigonometric functions of an angle ++ larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a right triangle . That acute angle has a special name : if ++ is a nonacute angle then we say that the reference angle for ++ is the acute angle formed by the terminal side of ++ and either the positive or negative x-axis . For example , 60- is the reference angle for the nonacute angle ++ = 120- ; and in a similar way , 45- is the reference angle for ++ = 225- ; and 30- is the reference angle for ++ = 330- . <p> Example 5 <p> Let ++ = 928-. ( a ) Which angle between 0- and 360- has the same terminal side ( and hence the same trigonometric function values ) as ++ ? ( b ) What is the reference angle for ++ ? <p> Solution : ( a ) Since 928- = 2+360- +208- , then ++ has the same terminal side as 208- , as in Figure 13. ( b ) 928- and 208- have the same terminal side in QIII , so the reference angle for ++ = 928- is 208- G180- = 28- . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ++ as the ratio adjacent hypotenuse of two of its sides . Since cos ++ = G4 5 , we can use 4 as the length of the adjacent side and 5 as the length of the hypotenuse . By the Pythagorean Theorem , the length of the opposite side must then be 3 . Since cos ++ is negative , we know from the Figure 9 that ++ must be in either QII or QIII . Thus , we have two possibilities , as shown in Figure 1.4.8 below : <p> When ++ is in QII , we see from Figure 1.4.8(a) that the point ( G4,3 ) is on the terminal side of ++ , and so we have x = G4 , y = 3 , and r = 5 . Thus , sin ++ = ( fracyr ) = ( frac35 ) and tan ++ = ( fracyx ) = ( frac3G4 ) . When ++ is in QIII , we see from Figure 1.4.8(b) that the point ( G4 , G3 ) is on the terminal side of ++ , and so we have x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Thus , sin ++ = ( fracyr ) = ( fracG35 ) and tan ++ = ( fracyx ) = ( fracG3G4 ) = ( frac34 ) . Thus , either sin ++ = ( frac35 ) and tan ++ = G(frac34) or sin ++ = ( fracG35 ) and tan ++ = ( frac34 ) . <p> Since reciprocals have the same sign , csc ++ and sin ++ have the same sign , sec ++ and cos ++ have the same sign , and cot ++ and tan ++ have the same sign . So it suffices to remember the signs of sin ++ , cos ++ , and tan ++ : <p> For an angle ++ in standard position and a point ( x , y ) on its terminal side : ( a ) sin ++ has the same sign as y ( b ) cos ++ has the same sign as x ( c ) tan ++ is positive when x and y have the same sign ( d ) tan ++ is negative when x and y have opposite signs

The major biomes cover large regions and are found on more than one continent . They are generally classified on the basis of climatic factors and the types of plants that are the primary producers . <h> Classification of Terrestrial Biomes <p> Scientists have created several different systems for classifying terrestrial biomes . Biomes in most classification systems include tundra , boreal forest , temperate forest , temperate grassland , chaparral , tropical forest , tropical grassland , and desert . The worldwide distribution of these biomes is shown in Figure 1 . <p> Figure 1 : Distribution of Earth 's major terrestrial biomes . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temperature and moisture . It also reflects conditions in earlier times . Many areas have been disturbed by human actions , some more so than others . For example , most tundra biomes have been changed very little by human actions , but many forests have been completely cleared . Some biomes , including tropical rainforests , can not be replaced once they have been destroyed . Figure 2 summarizes important features of most of the biomes shown in Figure 1 . <p> Figure 2 : These biomes are described more fully in the text . Refer to Figure 1 to see where each biome is found . <h> Arctic and Subarctic Biomes <p> Artic and subarctic biomes are found near the north and south poles or at high altitudes in other climate zones . The biomes include tundra and boreal forests . Both have cold , dry climates and poor soil . They can support only limited plant growth and have low biodiversity . <p> Tundra <p> Tundra is an arctic biome where it is too cold for trees to grow . Outside of the polar ice caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two types of tundra : arctic tundra , which is also found in Antarctica , and alpine tundra , which is found only at high altitudes . <p> Arctic tundra occurs north of the arctic circle and south of the antarctic circle . It covers much of Alaska and vast areas of northern Canada and Russia . It is also found along the northern coast of Antarctica . <p> Alpine tundra occurs in mountains around the world at any latitude , but only above the tree line . The tree line is the edge of the zone at which trees are able to survive . Alpine tundra is found in the Rocky Mountains in the United States and in several other mountain ranges around the world . <p> Both types of tundra receive very low precipitation , but little of it evaporates because of the cold . Arctic tundra has permafrost , which is soil that is frozen year-round . The top layer of soil thaws in the summer , but deeper layers do not . As a result , water can not soak into the ground . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and streams . Alpine tundra does not have permafrost , except at very high altitudes . Therefore , alpine tundra soil tends to be dry rather than soggy . <p> Global warming poses a serious threat to Arctic tundra biomes because it is causing the permafrost to melt . When permafrost melts , it not only changes the tundra . It also releases large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . Both are greenhouse gases , which contribute to greater global warming . <p> The most common vegetation in tundra is mosses and lichens . They can grow in very little soil and become dormant during the winter . Tundra is too cold for amphibians or reptiles , which can not regulate their own body heat . Insects such as mosquitoes can survive the winter as pupae and are very numerous in summer . In addition , many species of birds and large herds of caribou migrate to arctic tundra each summer . However , few birds and mammals live there year-round . Those that remain have adapted to the extreme cold . Polar bears are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from the cold . In alpine tundra , animals must adapt to rugged terrain as well as to cold . Alpine animals include mountain goats , which not only have wool to keep them warm but are also sure-footed and agile . <p> Boreal Forests <p> A boreal forest is a subarctic biome covered with conifers . Conifers are cone-bearing , needle-leaved evergreen trees such as spruces . Boreal forests are found only in the northern hemisphere . They occur just south of the arctic circle in Alaska , Canada , northern Europe , and Russia ( where they are called taiga ) . They also occur in extreme northern regions of Minnesota , New York State , New Hampshire , and Maine . <p> Boreal forests have harsh continental climates , with very cold winters and relatively warm summers . The growing season is also short . Precipitation is quite low , but there is little evaporation . Most of the precipitation falls in the summer when plants are growing , so there is enough moisture for dense plant growth . A thick carpet of evergreen needles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most other plants . <p> Conifers have adapted to the difficult conditions in several ways . They have shallow roots that suit them for the thin soil . They have needles instead of leaves , which reduce water loss during the long , dry winters . The needles are also very dark green in color , which maximizes absorption of sunlight for photosynthesis . Although boreal forests are dense with conifers , there are only a few different species of trees . Vegetation on the forest floor consists mostly of mosses and lichens . Animals found in boreal forests include insects , birds , and mammals such as rabbits , foxes , and brown bears . Caribou also spend their winters there . Like tundra , the boreal forest is too cold for amphibians or reptiles . <h> Temperate Biomes <p> Temperate biomes cover most of the continental United States and Europe . They also cover large parts of Asia . Types of temperate biomes include forests , grasslands , and chaparral . <p> Temperate Forests <p> There are two types of temperate forests : temperate deciduous forests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good soil . A temperate climate is a moderate climate that is neither extremely hot nor extremely cold . A temperate climate can be either continental or coastal . Continental temperate climates are found inland , and they tend to have cold winters , hot summers , and moderate precipitation . Coastal temperate climates are found near the ocean , and they tend to have mild winters , cool summers , and high precipitation . <p> Temperate deciduous forests are found in areas with continental temperate climates , such as the eastern United States and Canada and throughout much of Europe . These forests consist mainly of deciduous trees , such as maples and oaks , which lose their leaves in the fall . There are many other species of plants as well . Animals include insects , amphibians , reptiles , and birds . Mammals are also common , including rabbits and wolves . <p> Temperate rainforests are found in areas with coastal temperate climates , such as the northwestern coast of North America and certain coastal regions of other continents . These forests consist mainly of evergreen trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ferns grow on the forest floor . There are also many epiphytic plants . Animals include insects , amphibians , reptiles , and birds . There are also many mammals , such as squirrels and deer . <p> Epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants . They use the other plants for support , not nutrients , and generally do not harm the plants they grow on . They grow high in the branches of trees where there is more sunlight available for photosynthesis . <p> Temperate Grasslands <p> Temperate grasslands are temperate biomes that consist mainly of grasses . They are found in the midwestern region of North America and in inland areas of most other continents . The climate is continental , and precipitation is relatively low . However , the majority of the precipitation falls during the growing season when plants need it the most . <p> Biomes are often referred to by local names . For example , a temperate grassland biome is known as prairie in North America , outback in Australia , pampa in South America , and steppe in central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the map in Figure 1 ? <p> The soil of temperate grasslands is the richest , deepest soil on Earth . It is densely covered with thick grasses that decompose to add large amounts of organic matter and nutrients to the soil . Grasses also have thick mats of roots that hold the soil in place and prevent erosion . The low rainfall does not leach many nutrients from the soil , but it does lead to frequent fires . The fires help prevent woody vegetation from moving in if a grassland is disturbed . This is because grasses can grow back after a fire , whereas most woody plants can not . <p> The rich , deep soil supports high productivity . This is why the temperate grassland of the US midwest is known as the Breadbasket of America . Grass plants are closely spaced and can support many herbivore consumers . These range from grasshoppers to deer . Many worms and other invertebrates ( animals without a backbone ) consume organic matter in the soil . Grassland animals also include carnivores such as foxes and coyotes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by densely-growing evergreen shrubs or small trees , such as scrub oak . There are few other species of plants . Chaparral is found mainly in central and southern California and around the Mediterranean Sea . The climate , called a Mediterranean climate , has mild wet winters and hot dry summers . Fires are frequent because of the summer dryness , and the soil is relatively poor . <p> The majority of chaparral trees and plants are adapted to the dry summers . For example : <p> Trees are short , which reduces their need for water . Many plants are dormant during the dry season , which also reduces water needs . The leaves of some plants have waxy coatings , which reduce water loss . <p> Most chaparral plants are adapted to frequent fires , as well . For example : <p> Many plants can grow back quickly from the roots after burning to the ground . Some plants produce seeds that need fire in order to germinate . Many plants have thick underground stems that can survive fires . <p> The densely growing trees make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so most chaparral animals are small . They include insects , birds , reptiles , and rodents . The largest animals are deer , which browse on the leaves of chaparral trees . <h> Deserts <p> A desert is a biome that receives no more than 25 centimeters ( 10 inches ) of precipitation per year . Deserts are found in both temperate and tropical areas . The largest deserts are found at about 30- north or south latitude due to the dry air masses over these latitudes . Deserts also occur in rain shadows . A rain shadow is a dry region on the leeward side of a mountain range . Examples of rain shadow deserts include Death Valley and the Mojave Desert , both partly in California . The dry air in deserts leads to extreme temperature variations from day to night . Without water vapor in the air , there are no clouds to block sunlight during the day or hold in heat at night . <p> Desert soil is usually very poor . They tend to be sandy or rocky and lack organic content . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may become too concentrated for plants to tolerate . Plant cover is very sparse , so most of the soil is exposed and easily eroded by wind . The occasional rain tends to be brief but heavy , causing runoff and more erosion . <p> Most desert plants have evolved adaptations to the extreme dryness . For example : <p> Many plants have special water-storing tissues in leaves , stems , or roots . Some plants have very long taproots that can reach down to the water table . Some plants have wide-spreading roots that can absorb water over a large area . Plants may have small , spiny leaves that help reduce water loss . <p> Most desert animals have adaptations to the extreme heat and bright sunlight . For example : <p> Many small animals stay underground in burrows during the day and come out only at night . Most animals that are active in daytime spend as much time as possible in the shade of rocks or plants . Some animals have very large ears or other appendages , which help them lose heat to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in color , which helps them reflect sunlight and stay cooler . <h> Tropical Biomes <p> Tropical biomes receive more sunlight than any other biomes on Earth . They also have high temperatures year-round . In addition to deserts , tropical biomes include forests and grasslands . <p> Tropical Forests <p> There are two types of tropical forests : tropical rainforests and tropical dry forests . Both occur near the equator , so they have plenty of sunlight and warmth year-round . However , they differ in the amount and timing of the precipitation they receive . <p> Tropical rainforests receive more precipitation than any other biome . They are found near the equator in Central and South America and Africa . The soil is thin and poor , partly because the lush plant growth uses up nutrients before they can accumulate in the soil . Biodiversity of animals as well as plants is greater than in all other biomes combined . Most plants are tall , broadleaf evergreen trees . They form a dense canopy over the forest , so little sunlight reaches the forest floor . The many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numerous animal species also live in trees , including monkeys , sloths , and leopards . <p> Tropical dry forests occur in tropical areas where most of the precipitation falls during a single wet season . As a result , there is a pronounced dry season . Tropical dry forests are found in parts of Central and South America , Africa , and India . Trees and other plants are widely spaced because there is not enough water for denser growth . The plants also have adaptations to help them cope with seasonal drought . For example , many go dormant during the dry season , which reduces their need for water . Animals that live in tropical dry forests include arboreal animals such as monkeys and ground-dwelling animals such as rodents . <p> Tropical Grasslands <p> Tropical grasslands are tropical biomes with relatively low rainfall where the primary producers are grasses . Tropical grasslands are found mainly in Africa , where they are called savannas . They have high temperatures year-round , but relatively low precipitation . Moreover , most of the precipitation falls during a single wet season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soil is also poor . <p> In addition to grasses , there are scattered clumps of trees in most tropical grasslands . The trees are drought-adapted species such as acacia , which have narrow leaves that reduce water loss . Acacia trees also have thorns that discourage browsing by herbivores . Africa savannas are well known for their huge herds of herbivores , including zebra , giraffe , and wildebeest . They are also well known for their large carnivores " such as lions , cheetahs , and hyenas " that prey on the herbivores.

@@119688915 @8688915/ <h> Graphing the Trigonometric Functions 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To be able to graph trigonometric functions using radians as angles . <p> The first function we will graph is the sine function . We will describe a geometrical way to create the graph , using the unit circle . This is the circle of radius 1 in the xy-plane consisting of all points ( x , y ) which satisfy the equation x2 + y2 = 1 . <p> We see in Figure 1 that any point on the unit circle has coordinates ( x , y ) = ( cos ++ , sin ++ ) , where ++ is the angle that the line segment from the origin to ( x , y ) makes with the positive x-axis ( by definition of sine and cosine ) . So as the point ( x , y ) goes around the circle , its y-coordinate is sin ++ . <p> We thus get a correspondence between the y-coordinates of points on the unit circle and the values f(++) = sin ++ , as shown by the horizontal lines from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Figure 2 for the angles ++ = 0 , ( frac-6 ) , ( frac-3 ) , ( frac-2 ) . <p> We can extend the above picture to include angles from 0 to 2- radians , as in Figure 3 . This illustrates what is sometimes called the unit circle definition of the sine function . <p> Since the trigonometric functions repeat every 2- radians ( 360- ) , we get , for example , the following graph of the function y = sin x for x in the interval G2-,2- : <p> To graph the cosine function , we could again use the unit circle idea ( using the x-coordinate of a point that moves around the circle ) , but there is an easier way . Recall that cos x = sin ( x+90- ) for all x . So cos 0- has the same value as sin 90- , cos 90- has the same value as sin 180- , cos 180- has the same value as sin 270- , and so on . In other words , the graph of the cosine function is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 90- = -/2 radians , as in Figure 5 : <p> To graph the tangent function , use tan x = ( fracsin xcos x ) to get the following graph : <p> Recall that the tangent is positive for angles in QI and QIII , and is negative in QII and QIV , and that is indeed what the graph in Figure 6 shows . We know that tan x is not defined when cos x = 0 , i.e. at odd multiples of ( frac-2 ) : x = - ( frac-2 ) , - ( frac3-2 ) , - ( frac52 ) , etc . We can figure out what happens near those angles by looking at the sine and cosine functions . For example , for x in QI near ( frac-2 ) , sin x and cos x are both positive , with sin x very close to 1 and cos x very close to 0 , so the quotient tan x = ( fracsin xcos x ) is a positive number that is very large . And the closer x gets to ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , x = ( frac-2 ) is a vertical asymptote of the graph of y = tan x . <p> Likewise , for x in QII very close to ( frac-2 ) , sin x is very close to 1 and cos x is negative and very close to 0 , so the quotient tan x = ( fracsin xcos x ) is a negative number that is very large , and it gets larger in the negative direction the closer x gets to ( frac-2 ) . The graph shows this . Similarly , we get vertical asymptotes at x = G(frac-2) , x = ( frac3-2 ) , and x = G(frac3-2) , as in Figure 6 . Notice that the graph of the tangent function repeats every - radians , i.e. two times faster than the graphs of sine and cosine repeat . <p> The graphs of the remaining trigonometric functions can be determined by looking at the graphs of their reciprocal functions . For example , using csc x = ( frac1sin x ) we can just look at the graph of y = sin x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when sin x = 0 , namely at multiples of - : x = 0 , -- , -2- , etc . Figure 7 shows the graph of y = csc x , with the graph of y = sin x ( the dashed curve ) for reference . <p> Likewise , Figure 8 shows the graph of y = sec x , with the graph of y = cos x ( the dashed curve ) for reference . Note the vertical asymptotes at x = - ( frac-2 ) , - ( frac3-2 ) . Notice also that the graph is just the graph of the cosecant function shifted to the left by ( frac-2 ) radians . <p> The graph of y = cot x can also be determined by using cot x = ( frac1cot x ) . Alternatively , we can use the relation cot x = Gtan ( x+90- ) , so that the graph of the cotangent function is just the graph of the tangent function shifted to the left by ( frac-2 ) radians and then reflected about the x-axis , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of y = Gsin x for 0 G x G 2- . <p> Solution : Multiplying a function by G1 just reflects its graph around the x-axis . So reflecting the graph of y = sin x around the x-axis gives us the graph of y = Gsin x : <p> Note that this graph is the same as the graphs of y = sin ( x-- ) and y = cos ( x+ ( frac-2 ) ) . <p> It is worthwhile to remember the general shapes of the graphs of the six trigonometric functions , especially for sine , cosine , and tangent . In particular , the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are called sinusoidal curves . Many phenomena in nature exhibit sinusoidal behavior , so recognizing the general shape is important . <p> Example 2 <p> Draw the graph of y = 1+cos x for 0 G x G 2- . <p> Solution : Adding a constant to a function just moves its graph up or down by that amount , depending on whether the constant is positive or negative , respectively . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = cos x upward by 1 , giving us the graph of y = 1+cos x : 
@@119688920 @8688920/ <h> Science of Ecology 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To define ecosystem , niche , and habitat , and explain how the concepts are related . <p> To describe methods of ecology , such as field studies , sampling , statistical analysis , and modeling . <p> Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions of living things with each other and their relationships with the environment . Ecology is usually considered to be a major branch of biology . However , ecology has a more broad scope , because it includes both organisms and their environments . Examining the interactions between organisms and the environment can provide a basic understanding of the richness of life on earth and can help us understand how to protect that richness , which is increasingly threatened by human activity . Regardless of the challenges associated with conducting research in natural environments , ecologists often carry out field experiments to test their hypotheses . <h> Organisms and the Environment <p> Ecology is guided by a number of basic principles . One principle is that each living organism has a continual relationship with every other element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes both living and nonliving components . <p> Organisms <p> An organism is a life form consisting of one or more cells . All organisms have properties of life , including the ability to grow and reproduce . These properties of life require energy and materials from the environment . Therefore , an organism is not a closed system . Individual organisms depend on and are influenced by the environment . <p> The Environment <p> To the ecologist , the environment of an organism includes both physical aspects and other organisms . These two components of the environment are called abiotic and biotic components , respectively . <p> Abiotic components , or abiotic factors , are the non-living physical aspects of the environment . Examples include sunlight , soil , temperature , wind , water , and air . <p> Biotic components , or biotic factors , are the living organisms in the environment . They include organisms of the same and different species . <p> Biotic components can be very important environmental influences on organisms . For example , the first photosynthetic life forms on Earth produced oxygen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This change in Earth 's atmosphere , in turn , caused the extinction of many life forms for which oxygen was toxic and the evolution of many other life forms for which oxygen was necessary . <p> Levels of Organization <p> Ecologists study organisms and their environments at different levels . The most inclusive level is the biosphere . The biosphere consists of all the organisms on planet Earth and the areas where they live . It occurs in a very thin layer of the planet , extending from about 11,000 meters below sea level to 15,000 meters above sea level . An image of the biosphere is shown in Figure 1 . Different colors on the map indicate the numbers of food-producing organisms in different parts of the biosphere . Ecological issues that might be investigated at the biosphere level include ocean pollution , air pollution , and global climate change . <p> Ecologists also study organisms and their environments at the population level . A population consists of organisms of the same species that live in the same area and interact with one another . Important ecological issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human population , which has led to overpopulation and environmental damage ; <p> Rapid decline in populations of many nonhuman species , which has led to the extinction of numerous species . <p> Another level at which ecologists study organisms and their environments is the community level . A community consists of populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another . For example , populations of coyotes and rabbits might interact in a grassland community . Coyotes hunt down and eat rabbits for food , so the two species have a predator-prey relationship . Ecological issues at the community level include how changes in the size of one population affect other populations . <p> Figure 1 : This image of Earth 's surface shows the density of the chief life forms that produce food for other organisms in the biosphere . Plants are the chief food producers on land , and phytoplankton are the chief food producers in the ocean . The map shows the density of plants with a measure called the normalized difference vegetation index and the density of phytoplankton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be defined as the biotic component of an ecosystem . An ecosystem is a natural unit consisting of all the living organisms in an area functioning together with all the nonliving physical factors of the environment . The concept of an ecosystem can apply to units of different sizes . For example , a large body of fresh water could be considered an ecosystem , and so could a small piece of dead wood . Both contain a community of species that interact with one another and with the abiotic components of their environment . Another example of an ecosystem is a desert , like the one shown in Figure 2 . <p> Like most natural systems , ecosystems are not closed , at least not in terms of energy . Ecosystems depend on continuous inputs of energy from outside the system . Most ecosystems obtain energy from sunlight . Some obtain energy from chemical compounds . In contrast to energy , matter is recycled in ecosystems . Elements such as carbon and nitrogen , which are needed by living organisms , are used over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California has fewer species than most other types of ecosystems , but it is still home to a community of interacting species ( such as the cacti and grasses shown here ) and potent environmental factors such as extreme heat and dryness . <p> Niche <p> One of the most important ideas associated with ecosystems is the niche concept . A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem . It includes all the ways species ' members interact with the abiotic and biotic components of the ecosystem . <p> Two important aspects of a species ' niche include the food it eats and how it obtains the food . Figure 3 shows pictures of birds that occupy different niches . The various species eat different types of food and obtain the food in different ways . Notice how each species has evolved a beak that suits it for these aspects of its niche . <p> Figure 3 : Each of these 11 species of birds has a distinctive beak that suits it for its particular niche . For example , the long slender beak of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short sturdy beak of the Granivore allows it to crush hard , tough grains . <p> Habitat <p> Another aspect of a species ' niche is its habitat . A species ' habitat is the physical environment to which it has become adapted and in which it can survive . A habitat is generally described in terms of abiotic factors , such as the average amount of sunlight received each day , the range of annual temperatures , and average yearly rainfall . These and other factors in a habitat determine many of the traits of the organisms that can survive there . <p> Consider a habitat with very low temperatures . Mammals that live in the habitat must have insulation to help them stay warm . Otherwise , their body temperature will drop to a level that is too low for survival . Species that live in these habitats have evolved fur , blubber , and other traits that provide insulation in order for them to survive in the cold . <p> Human destruction of habitats is the major factor causing other species to decrease and become endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations of organisms . Small populations are more susceptible to being wiped out by catastrophic events from which a large population could bounce back . Habitat destruction caused the extinction of the dusky seaside sparrow shown in Figure 4 . Many other bird species are currently declining worldwide . More than 1,200 species face extinction during the next century due mostly to habitat loss and climate change . <p> Figure 4 : The dusky seaside sparrow , which used to live in marshy areas of southern Florida , was declared extinct in 1990 . <p> Competitive Exclusion Principle <p> A given habitat may contain many different species , each occupying a different niche . However , two different species can not occupy the same niche in the same geographic area for very long . This is known as the competitive exclusion principle . It is another basic principle of ecology . If two species were to occupy the same niche , they would compete with one another for the same food and other resources in the environment . Eventually , one species would outcompete and replace the other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already occupied by native species . This may occur intentionally or by accident . Consider the example of kudzu . Kudzu is a Japanese vine that was introduced intentionally to the southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil erosion . The southeastern United States turned out to be a perfect habitat for kudzu , because it has no natural enemies there . As a result , kudzu was able to outcompete native species of vines and take over their niches . The extent to which kudzu has invaded some habitats in the southeastern United States is shown in Figure 5 . <p> Figure 5 : Kudzu covers the trees in this habitat near Atlanta , Georgia , in the southeastern United States . Native species of vines can not compete with kudzu 's thriving growth and lack of natural enemies . <h> Methods of Ecology <p> Ecology is more holistic , or all-encompassing , than some other fields of biology . Ecologists study both biotic and abiotic factors and how they interact . Therefore , ecologists often use methods and data from other areas of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and physics . In addition , researchers in ecology are more likely than researchers in some other sciences to use field studies to collect data . <p> Field Studies <p> Ecological research often includes field studies because ecologists generally are interested in the natural world . Field studies involve the collection of data in real-world settings , rather than in controlled laboratory settings . The general aim of field studies is to collect observations in wild populations without impacting the environment or its organisms in any way . <p> Ecologists commonly undertake field studies to determine the numbers of organisms of particular species in a given geographic area . Such studies are useful for a variety of purposes . For example , the data might help an ecologist decide whether a given species is in danger of extinction . <p> Sampling <p> In field studies , it usually is not possible to investigate all the organisms in an area . Therefore , some type of sampling scheme is generally necessary . For example , assume an ecologist wants to find the number of insects of a particular species in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the species in the area . So , for practical reasons , the ecologist might count only a sample of the insects . In order to select the sample , the ecologist could divide the entire area into a grid of one-meter-square test plots . Then the ecologist might systematically select every tenth ( or other numbered ) test plot and count all the insects in the plot . <p> Statistical Analysis <p> Like other scientists , ecologists may use two different types of statistical analysis to interpret the data they collect : descriptive statistics and inferential statistics . Descriptive statistics are used to describe data . For example , the ecologist studying insects might calculate the mean number of insects per test plot and find that it is 24 . This descriptive statistic summarizes the counts from all the test plots in a single number . Other descriptive statistics , such as the range , describe variation in data . The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a sample . In the same example , if the numbers of insects per test plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 . <p> Scientists often want to make inferences about a population based on data from a sample . For example , the ecologist counting insects might want to estimate the number of insects in the entire area based on data for the test plots sampled . Drawing inferences about a population from a sample requires the use of inferential statistics . Inferential statistics can be used to determine the chances that a sample truly represents the population from which it was drawn . It tells the investigator how much confidence can be placed in inferences about the population that are based on the sample . <p> Modeling <p> Ecologists , like other scientists , often use models to help understand complex phenomena . Ecological systems are often modeled using computer simulations . Computer simulations can incorporate many different variables and their interactions . This is one reason they are useful for modeling ecological systems . Computer simulations are also working models , so they can show what may happen in a system over time . Simulations can be used to refine models , test hypotheses , and make predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to make predictions about future climates.

@@119688988 @8688988/ <h> G-MG Hexagonal Pattern of Beehives <p> Beehives are made of walls , each of the same size , enclosing small hexagonal cells where honey and pollen is stored and bees are raised . Below is a picture of some cells : <p> The only other regular polygons which can be used to tile the plane in this way are equilateral triangles and squares . This problem examines some of the mathematical advantages of the hexagonal tiling . <p> Suppose we let ( s ) denote the length of the walls in the hexagonal chambers . Below is an enlarged picture of a single hexagon : <p> Find the area of a regular hexagon ( H ) with side length ( s ) . <p> Is the ratio of area to perimeter for a regular hexagon greater than or smaller than the corresponding ratios for an equilateral triangle and a square ? <p> Based on your answer to ( b ) , why do you think it is advantageous for beehives to be built using hexagonal cells instead of triangular or square cells ? <h> Commentary <p> The goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beehives . Beehives have a tremendous simplicity as they are constructed entirely of small , equally sized walls . In order to as useful as possible for the hive , the goal should be to create the largest possible volume using the least amount of materials . In other words , the ratio of the volume of each cell to its surface area needs to be maximized . This then reduces to maximizing the ratio of the surface area of the cell shape to its perimeter . <p> The hexagonal pattern of beehives is a well documented phenomenon and many pictures can be found on-line . <p> One interesting question would be why the cells in the honeycomb are not circular as a circle has a better ratio , for the same perimeter , of perimeter to area than a hexagon . One explanation for this is that unlike regular hexagons which can be put side by side to fill up space with no gaps , with circles there would be much waste . To put this another way , in the hexagonal configuration each wall is a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be the case but the spaces between circles would be small and oddly shaped and perhaps not very useful . Hexagons are only compared with squares and equilateral triangles as these are the only three shapes which can be put together to tile the plane ( see ' ' Regular tessellations of the plane ' ' ) . The fact that the ratio of area to perimeter for hexagons is larger than for triangles or squares shows that of these three choices , the one which provides the most space with the least amount of materials is the hexagonal pattern . <p> Two different solutions are presented . The first divides the hexagon into a rectangle and two triangles . For this solution , the students will need to know that the measure of the interior angles of a regular hexagon are ( 120 ) degrees . They also need to know the sine and cosine of the benchmark angles ( 30circ ) and ( 60circ ) . The second solution breaks the hexagon into six equilateral triangles and this requires knowing that the regular hexagon has a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its six vertices : this fact should be taken for granted here . <p> The ratio of perimeter to area for an equilateral triangle can be deduced from the results of the task ' ' Perimeters and areas of geometric shapes . ' ' The same is true of the square for which this calculation is more straightforward . Alternatively students can establish these formulas here : depending how they calculate the area of the hexagon , they will already have the tools needed to find the ratio of side length to area for the equilateral triangle . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Decomposition of hexagon into triangles <p> We find the area of the hexagon by decomposing it into ( 6 ) congruent equilateral pictures as shown below : <p> From the picture we have that the area of the hexagon with side length ( s ) is ( 6 ) times the area of the equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) . <p> The area of an equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) is ( fracsqrt34s2 ) . An argument for this calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hexagon picture . In order to use the formula , Area = ( frac12 times ) Base ( times ) Height for a triangle , we need to choose a base and then determine the height of the triangle with this base : <p> Triangles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are congruent as we can see using using ( SSS ) : <p> ( AM ) is congruent to ( BM ) since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AB ) , <p> ( AC ) is congruent to ( BC ) because triangle ( ABC ) is equilaterial , <p> ( MC ) is congruent to ( MC ) . <p> We know that ( AB = s ) . To find ( MC ) note that since triangles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are congruent this means that angles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are congruent . Since angles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are supplementary , this means that they are both right angles . So we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ( AMC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM2 = AC2. $$ We know that ( AC = s ) since ( AC ) is congruent to ( AB ) . We also know that ( AM ) is congruent to ( BM ) and , since ( AM + BM = AB = s ) , this means that ( AM = fracs2 ) . Plugging into the formula above we get $$ MC2 + fracs24 = s2. $$ So ( MC2 = frac3s24 ) and $$ MC = fracsqrt3s2. $$ Now we have found the height of triangle ( ABC ) and so the area of triangle ( ABC ) is $$ frac12times s times fracsqrt3s2 = fracsqrt3s24. $$ <p> The area of the hexagon is ( 6 ) times the area of the equilateral triangle and so the area of the regular hexagon is ( frac3 sqrt3s22 ) . <p> The ratio of area to perimeter for a regular hexagon with side length ( s ) is ( **27;179;TOOLONG ) which is equivalent to $$ ERROR? $$ For an equilateral triangle , the corresponding ratio is ( **26;208;TOOLONG ) which is equivalent $$ **25;236;TOOLONG $$ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with side length ( s ) is ( 3 ) times as large as the ratio of side length of area for the equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) . Interestingly we could make this comparison of ratios of area to perimeter without calculating any areas . Once the side length ( s ) is fixed the area of the hexagon with side length ( s ) is ( 6 ) times the area of the equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) . The perimeter of the hexagon is twice the perimeter of the equilateral triangle so the ratio of area to perimeter to area is three times greater for the hexagon compared to the triangle . <p> For a square with side length ( s ) , the perimeter is ( 4s ) while the area is ( s2 ) so this gives a ratio of $$ left(fracs4:1right) $$ for the area to the perimeter . So the area to perimeter ratio of the regular hexagon is ( sqrt3 ) times as large as the corresponding ratio for squares . <p> There are several advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane with regular polygons . First , the walls in the construction are all simple and since the walls are all the same size the process of constructing the hive is repetitive and straightforward . Next , one big advantage to a tiling like this is that each wall serves as a wall to two distinct chambers , doubling the amount of useable space created with the given materials : this is the same for triangles , squares , and hexagons and does not privilege one over the others . As far as the choice between triangles , squares , and hexagons , the mathematical argument provided here shows that a hexagonal hive produces more useable space with the same amount of materials . Since it requires a lot of work to construct these hives , efficiency would dictate that the bees should make the most of their building materials . <p> Solution : 2 Decomposition of hexagon into a rectangle and two triangles ( for part ( a ) ) <p> Here an alternative method is given for finding the area of a regular hexagon with side length ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with segments ( AE ) and ( BD ) added . Also shown are the midpoint ( M ) of segment ( AE ) and the midpoint ( N ) of ( BD ) with segments ( FM ) and ( CN ) added . <p> Angles ( AMF ) and ( EMF ) are congruent and supplementary so they must both be right angles . Since the sum of the three angles in a triangle is ( 180 ) degrees we must have $$ m ( angle FEM ) = m ( angle FAM ) = 30. $$ We can apply the same arguments to conclude that $$ m ( angle DCN ) = m ( angle BCN ) = 60. $$ and $$ m ( angle CDN ) = m ( angle CBN ) = 30. $$ <p> Angles ( FED ) , ( EDC ) , ( CBA ) , and ( BAF ) are all interior angles of a regular hexagon so they all are ( 120circ ) angles . From this and the ( 30circ ) angles calculated above , we find that $$ m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = m ( angle EDB ) = m ( angle DBA ) = 90 $$ and so quadrilateral ( ABDE ) is rectangle . <p> We now find the lengths of segments ( AM ) and ( FM ) and will use this to find the area of the regular hexagon . Side ( AF ) has length ( s ) by hypothesis . We have $$ sinangle FAM = fracFMFA. $$ Since ( m ( angle FAM ) = 30 ) and ( sin30 = frac12 ) we conclude that ( FM = fracs2 ) .

@@119689005 @8689005/ <h> G-MG Hexagonal Pattern of Beehives <p> Beehives are made of walls , each of the same size , enclosing small hexagonal cells where honey and pollen is stored and bees are raised . Below is a picture of some cells : <p> The only other regular polygons which can be used to tile the plane in this way are equilateral triangles and squares . This problem examines some of the mathematical advantages of the hexagonal tiling . <p> Suppose we let ( s ) denote the length of the walls in the hexagonal chambers . Below is an enlarged picture of a single hexagon : <p> Find the area of a regular hexagon ( H ) with side length ( s ) . <p> Is the ratio of area to perimeter for a regular hexagon greater than or smaller than the corresponding ratios for an equilateral triangle and a square ? <p> Based on your answer to ( b ) , why do you think it is advantageous for beehives to be built using hexagonal cells instead of triangular or square cells ? <h> Commentary <p> The goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beehives . Beehives have a tremendous simplicity as they are constructed entirely of small , equally sized walls . In order to as useful as possible for the hive , the goal should be to create the largest possible volume using the least amount of materials . In other words , the ratio of the volume of each cell to its surface area needs to be maximized . This then reduces to maximizing the ratio of the surface area of the cell shape to its perimeter . <p> The hexagonal pattern of beehives is a well documented phenomenon and many pictures can be found on-line . <p> One interesting question would be why the cells in the honeycomb are not circular as a circle has a better ratio , for the same perimeter , of perimeter to area than a hexagon . One explanation for this is that unlike regular hexagons which can be put side by side to fill up space with no gaps , with circles there would be much waste . To put this another way , in the hexagonal configuration each wall is a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be the case but the spaces between circles would be small and oddly shaped and perhaps not very useful . Hexagons are only compared with squares and equilateral triangles as these are the only three shapes which can be put together to tile the plane ( see ' ' Regular tessellations of the plane ' ' ) . The fact that the ratio of area to perimeter for hexagons is larger than for triangles or squares shows that of these three choices , the one which provides the most space with the least amount of materials is the hexagonal pattern . <p> Two different solutions are presented . The first divides the hexagon into a rectangle and two triangles . For this solution , the students will need to know that the measure of the interior angles of a regular hexagon are ( 120 ) degrees . They also need to know the sine and cosine of the benchmark angles ( 30circ ) and ( 60circ ) . The second solution breaks the hexagon into six equilateral triangles and this requires knowing that the regular hexagon has a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its six vertices : this fact should be taken for granted here . <p> The ratio of perimeter to area for an equilateral triangle can be deduced from the results of the task ' ' Perimeters and areas of geometric shapes . ' ' The same is true of the square for which this calculation is more straightforward . Alternatively students can establish these formulas here : depending how they calculate the area of the hexagon , they will already have the tools needed to find the ratio of side length to area for the equilateral triangle . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Decomposition of hexagon into triangles <p> We find the area of the hexagon by decomposing it into ( 6 ) congruent equilateral pictures as shown below : <p> From the picture we have that the area of the hexagon with side length ( s ) is ( 6 ) times the area of the equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) . <p> The area of an equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) is ( fracsqrt34s2 ) . An argument for this calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hexagon picture . In order to use the formula , Area = ( frac12 times ) Base ( times ) Height for a triangle , we need to choose a base and then determine the height of the triangle with this base : <p> Triangles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are congruent as we can see using using ( SSS ) : <p> ( AM ) is congruent to ( BM ) since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AB ) , <p> ( AC ) is congruent to ( BC ) because triangle ( ABC ) is equilaterial , <p> ( MC ) is congruent to ( MC ) . <p> We know that ( AB = s ) . To find ( MC ) note that since triangles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are congruent this means that angles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are congruent . Since angles ( AMC ) and ( BMC ) are supplementary , this means that they are both right angles . So we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ( AMC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AM2 = AC2. $$ We know that ( AC = s ) since ( AC ) is congruent to ( AB ) . We also know that ( AM ) is congruent to ( BM ) and , since ( AM + BM = AB = s ) , this means that ( AM = fracs2 ) . Plugging into the formula above we get $$ MC2 + fracs24 = s2. $$ So ( MC2 = frac3s24 ) and $$ MC = fracsqrt3s2. $$ Now we have found the height of triangle ( ABC ) and so the area of triangle ( ABC ) is $$ frac12times s times fracsqrt3s2 = fracsqrt3s24. $$ <p> The area of the hexagon is ( 6 ) times the area of the equilateral triangle and so the area of the regular hexagon is ( frac3 sqrt3s22 ) . <p> The ratio of area to perimeter for a regular hexagon with side length ( s ) is ( **27;263;TOOLONG ) which is equivalent to $$ ERROR? $$ For an equilateral triangle , the corresponding ratio is ( **26;292;TOOLONG ) which is equivalent $$ **25;320;TOOLONG $$ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with side length ( s ) is ( 3 ) times as large as the ratio of side length of area for the equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) . Interestingly we could make this comparison of ratios of area to perimeter without calculating any areas . Once the side length ( s ) is fixed the area of the hexagon with side length ( s ) is ( 6 ) times the area of the equilateral triangle with side length ( s ) . The perimeter of the hexagon is twice the perimeter of the equilateral triangle so the ratio of area to perimeter to area is three times greater for the hexagon compared to the triangle . <p> For a square with side length ( s ) , the perimeter is ( 4s ) while the area is ( s2 ) so this gives a ratio of $$ left(fracs4:1right) $$ for the area to the perimeter . So the area to perimeter ratio of the regular hexagon is ( sqrt3 ) times as large as the corresponding ratio for squares . <p> There are several advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane with regular polygons . First , the walls in the construction are all simple and since the walls are all the same size the process of constructing the hive is repetitive and straightforward . Next , one big advantage to a tiling like this is that each wall serves as a wall to two distinct chambers , doubling the amount of useable space created with the given materials : this is the same for triangles , squares , and hexagons and does not privilege one over the others . As far as the choice between triangles , squares , and hexagons , the mathematical argument provided here shows that a hexagonal hive produces more useable space with the same amount of materials . Since it requires a lot of work to construct these hives , efficiency would dictate that the bees should make the most of their building materials . <p> Solution : 2 Decomposition of hexagon into a rectangle and two triangles ( for part ( a ) ) <p> Here an alternative method is given for finding the area of a regular hexagon with side length ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with segments ( AE ) and ( BD ) added . Also shown are the midpoint ( M ) of segment ( AE ) and the midpoint ( N ) of ( BD ) with segments ( FM ) and ( CN ) added . <p> Angles ( AMF ) and ( EMF ) are congruent and supplementary so they must both be right angles . Since the sum of the three angles in a triangle is ( 180 ) degrees we must have $$ m ( angle FEM ) = m ( angle FAM ) = 30. $$ We can apply the same arguments to conclude that $$ m ( angle DCN ) = m ( angle BCN ) = 60. $$ and $$ m ( angle CDN ) = m ( angle CBN ) = 30. $$ <p> Angles ( FED ) , ( EDC ) , ( CBA ) , and ( BAF ) are all interior angles of a regular hexagon so they all are ( 120circ ) angles . From this and the ( 30circ ) angles calculated above , we find that $$ m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = m ( angle EDB ) = m ( angle DBA ) = 90 $$ and so quadrilateral ( ABDE ) is rectangle . <p> We now find the lengths of segments ( AM ) and ( FM ) and will use this to find the area of the regular hexagon . Side ( AF ) has length ( s ) by hypothesis . We have $$ sinangle FAM = fracFMFA. $$ Since ( m ( angle FAM ) = 30 ) and ( sin30 = frac12 ) we conclude that ( FM = fracs2 ) . Similarly $$ cosangle FAM = fracAMFA. $$ Since ( m ( angle FAM ) = 30 ) and ( cos30 = fracsqrt32 ) we conclude that ( FM = fracsqrt3s2 ) .

So , for example , line ( overleftrightarrowDA ) is taken to ( overleftrightarrowDA ) but the notions of up and down on this vertical line are reversed . So point ( A ) , which is four units below ( D ) will be mapped to the point ( A ' ) which is four units above ( D ) . The points ( D ) and ( C ) , on the other hand , lie on a horizontal line through ( D ) . So rotation by ( 180circ ) about ( D ) has the effect of switching left and right on this line . Since ( C ) lies ( 8 ) units to the right of ( D ) , its image , ( C ' ) , after rotating ( 180circ ) about ( D ) will be the ( 8 ) units to the left of ( D ) . This is pictured below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation by ( 180circ ) about ( D ) maps any line through ( D ) to itself , exchanging the two rays through ( D ) which make up the line . This means that ( overleftrightarrowDA ' = overleftrightarrowDA ) since ( overleftrightarrowDA ' ) is the rotation of line ( overleftrightarrowDA ) by ( 180circ ) about ( D ) . Similarly , ( overleftrightarrowDC ' = overleftrightarrowDC ) . So ( overleftrightarrowDC ' ) is a horizontal line of the grid , as is ( overleftrightarrowAB ) , and so these two lines are parallel , remaining four units apart from one another . <p> To send ( D ) to ( B ) we need to translate by ( 8 ) units to the right and ( 4 ) units down . Translating by ( 8 ) units to the right and ( 4 ) units down also takes ( C ' ) to ( A ) and ( A ' ) to ( C ) as is seen in the picture below : <p> Since the vertices of triangle ( A'C 'D ) map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take line segments to line segments , this means that translation ( 8 ) units to the right and ( 4 ) units down takes triangle ( A'C 'D ) to triangle ( CAB ) . The combination of a ( 180circ ) rotation about ( D ) followed by a translation ( 8 ) units to the right and four units down establishes the congruence of triangles ( A'C 'D ) and ( CAB ) . <p> One of the most interesting ways to show the congruence of ( triangle ACD ) and ( triangle CAB ) is to rotate by ( 180circ ) about the intersection point of the diagonals ( overlineAC ) and ( overlineBD ) of rectangle ( ABCD ) . Using the coordinate grid , this is the point two boxes up and four boxes to the right of ( A ) , labelled ( O ) in the diagram below : <p> To see why rotation by ( 180circ ) about ( O ) maps ( triangle ACD ) to ( triangle CAB ) , note that we know from parts ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will map line ( overleftrightarrowAC ) to itself ( and similarly for line ( overleftrightarrowDB ) which also passes through ( O ) ) . Segments ( overlineOC ) and ( overlineOA ) are congruent : each is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) and so each has length ( sqrt20 ) by the Pythagorean theorem . Since rotation by ( 180circ ) fixes ( O ) and interchanges the two rays ( overrightarrowOA ) and ( overrightarrowOC ) this means that this rotations maps ( A ) to ( C ) and ( C ) to ( A ) . Similar reasoning applied to the rays ( overrightarrowOD ) and ( overrightarrowOB ) shows that rotation by ( 180circ ) maps ( B ) to ( D ) and ( B ) to ( D ) . Hence rotation by ( 180circ ) about ( O ) maps triangle ( ACD ) to triangle ( CAB ) and shows that they are congruent . <p> There are many other ways to show the congruence of ( triangle ACD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could use two reflections to move ( triangle ACD ) to the position of ( triangle PQD ) from part ( a ) : first a reflection about line ( overleftrightarrowDC ) and then a reflection about ( overleftrightarrowAD ) ( or first a reflection about ( overleftrightarrowAD ) and then a reflection about ( overleftrightarrowDC ) ) . This particular method gives an example of two reflections which commute , that is the order in which they are applied does not influence the resulting transformation of the plane . 
@@119689015 @8689015/ <h> Hydrogen and Helium : The Duet Rule 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Every rule has its exception , and that goes for the Octet Rule as well . While there are many scenarios where the Octet Rule does not apply , this relatively short article will only cover one of them . The Duet Rule applies to hydrogen and helium only , but the abundance of hydrogen is so prominent that the rule deserves its own article . For hydrogen and helium , unlike most other elements , a full valence shell consists of two electrons rather than eight . <h> Bonding with Helium <p> Helium atoms have two electrons and two protons . There is only one shell of electrons , the valence shell of two electrons . It is a noble gas and is thus relatively inert . If it needs to gain electrons as part of a bonding sequence , it will need to form a new valence shell further away from the nucleus than the old one . That said , bizarre bonding patterns with helium are not sufficiently practical or simple to be taught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helium can form a single bond with fluorine , but this is a very unstable configuration as the helium atom will then have one unpaired electron . <h> Ionic Bonding with Hydrogen <p> When hydrogen participates in ionic bonding , it wil always be the anion . This group of comounds are called metal hydrides . In them , hydrogen atoms gain one electron and become hydride ions , ( H- ) . <p> Example 1 : Sodium hydride is ( NaH ) . Sodium most easily gets a full octet by losing one valence electron , so the sodium ion is ( Na+ ) , so it bonds with hydride ions in a 1:1 ratio . <p> Example 2 : Magnesium hydride is ( MgH2 ) . Magnesium tends to form ( +2 ) cations most easily as this requries the transfer of the fewest electrons . As we discussed earlier , hydride ions have a ( -1 ) charge , so we need two of them to balance out the charge of one magnesium cation . Thus magnesium hydride is ( MgH2 ) . <h> Covalent Bonding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covalent bonds , but the two valence electrons that are used will always be shared with another atom through a covalent bond . A single bonding pair is all hydrogen needs to get its duet , so it typically does not form double or triple bonds . <p> Example 3 : Hydrogen monochloride , a.k.a. hydrochloric acid , is one hydrogen atom bonded with one chlorine atom . Recall that hydrogen atoms have one valence electron unbonded and chlorine has seven . Thus each atom can contribute one electron to a bonding pair , and now hydrogen has two shared valence electrons and chlorine has a full octet ! Thus this is a stable molecule . Its Lewis Structure is depicted below . <p> There are four hydrogen atoms here , and all of them have a full duet thanks to a single bonding pair shared between each of them and some other atom .

The two operations on which we will concentrate in this section are rotation and reflection . <p> To rotate an angle means to rotate its terminal side around the origin when the angle is in standard position . For example , suppose we rotate an angle ++ around the origin by 90- in the counterclockwise direction . In Figure 1 we see an angle ++ in QI which is rotated by 90- , resulting in the angle ++ +90- in QII . Notice that the complement of ++ in the right triangle in QI is the same as the supplement of the angle +++90- in QII , since the sum of ++ , its complement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle of the right triangle in QII to be ++ . <p> Thus , the right triangle in QI is similar to the right triangle in QII , since the triangles have the same angles . The rotation of ++ by 90- does not change the length r of its terminal side , so the hypotenuses of the similar right triangles are equal , and hence by similarity the remaining corresponding sides are also equal . Using Figure 1 to match up those corresponding sides shows that the point ( Gy , x ) is on the terminal side of +++90- when ( x , y ) is on the terminal side of ++ . Hence , by definition , <p> Recall that any nonvertical line in the xy-coordinate plane can be written as y = mx+b , where m is the slope of the line ( defined as m = ( fracriserun ) ) and b is the y-intercept , i.e. where the line crosses the y- axis ( see Figure 2 ) . We will show that the slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonhorizontal perpendicular lines , then m(2)= ( fracG 1m1 ) ( see Figure 3 ) . <p> First , suppose that a line y = mx+ b has nonzero slope . The line crosses the x-axis somewhere , so let ++ be the angle that the positive x-axis makes with the part of the line above the x-axis , as in Figure 4 &amp; 5 . For m&gt; 0 we see that ++ is acute and tan ++ = ( fractextrisetextrun ) =m . <p> If m &lt; 0 , then we see that ++ is obtuse and the rise is negative . Since the run is always positive , our definition of tan ++ means that tan ++ = ( fracGtextriseGtextrun ) = ( fractextrisetextrun ) = m ( just imagine in Figure 5 the entire line being shifted horizontally to go through the origin , so that ++ is unchanged and the point ( Grun , Grise ) is on the terminal side of ++ ) . Hence : <p> For a line y = mx+b with m ( neq ) 0 , the slope is given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the positive x-axis and the part of the line above the x-axis . <p> Now , in Figure 3 we see that if two lines y = m(1)x+ b(1) and y = m(2)x+ b(2) are perpendicular then rotating one line counterclockwise by 90- around the point of intersection gives us the second line . So if ++ is the angle that the line y = m(1)x+ b(1) makes with the positive x-axis , then ++ +90- is the angle that the line y = m(2)x+ b(2) makes with the positive x-axis . So by what we just showed , m(1) = tan ++ and m(2) = tan ( +++90- ) . But by formula ( 1.6 ) we know that tan ( +++90- ) = Gcot ++ . Hence , m(2) = Gcot ++ = - ( frac 1 tan ++ ) = ( fracG 1m1 ) . <p> Rotating an angle ++ by 90- in the clockwise direction results in the angle ++G90- . We could use another geometric argument to derive trigonometric relations involving ++G90- , but it is easier to use a simple trick : since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just replace ++ by ++G90- in each formula . Since ( ++G90- ) +90- = ++ , this gives us : <p> A reflection is simply the mirror image of an object . For example , in Figure 8 the original object is in QI , its reflection around the y-axis is in QII , and its reflection around the x-axis is in QIV . Notice that if we first reflect the object in QI around the y-axis and then follow that with a reflection around the x-axis , we get an image in QIII . That image is the reflection around the origin of the original object , and it is equivalent to a rotation of 180- around the origin . Notice also that a reflection around the y-axis is equivalent to a reflection around the x-axis followed by a rotation of 180- around the origin . <p> Applying this to angles , we see that the reflection of an angle ++ around the x-axis is the angle G++ , as in Figure 9 &amp; 10 . <p> So we see that reflecting a point ( x , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence : <p> Notice that the cosine function does not change in formula ( 1.14 ) because it depends on x , and not on y , for a point ( x , y ) on the terminal side of ++ . <p> In general , a function f ( x ) is an even function if f ( Gx ) = f ( x ) for all x , and it is called an odd function if f ( Gx ) = Gf ( x ) for all x . Thus , the cosine function is even , while the sine and tangent functions are odd . Replacing ++ by G++ in formulas ( 1.4 ) G(1.6) , then using formulas ( 1.13 ) G(1.15) , gives : <p> Notice that reflection around the y-axis is equivalent to reflection around the x-axis ( ++ G G++ ) followed by a rotation of 180- ( G++ G G+++180- = 180- G++ ) , as in Figure 11 . <p> It may seem that these geometrical operations and formulas are not necessary for evaluating the trigonometric functions , since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two reasons for why they are useful .

But 180- G++ = 180- G(G43-) = 223- ( see Figure 12 ) . Also , we know that G43- and G43-+360- = 317- have the same trigonometric function values . So since angles in QI and QII have positive sine values , we see that the only angles between 0- and 360- with a sine of G0.682 are ( fbox++ = 223- and 317- ) .

What is the ion ? <p> Solution : Here ( p = 87 ) and ( e = 86 ) , so <p> $$C = 87 - 86 = 1$$ <p> Therefore the charge of the ion is ( +1 ) . Since there are 87 protons , the atomic number is 87 . Referencing a periodic table identifies this element as Francium . Therefore this is a +1 Francium ion . <h> The Noble Gases <p> The noble gases are a special set of elements on the periodic table . They are all on the rightmost column on the table . In order , these elements are : Helium , Neon , Argon , Krypton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so special is that these atoms have a particular number of electrons readily available for most reactions ( known as an atom 's core electrons ) that makes it less likely for these atoms to react with other substances . As a result these atoms are called inert . Also , noble gases , besides Helium , all have eight core electrons . <p> At this point you , the reader , may be wondering what this has to do with charge . It means that the atoms are less likely to gain or lose electrons , and thus remain neutral substances . Therefore they are less likely to become ions ( either positively or negatively charged ) . <p> Example 5 : Why is it unusual for Argon to have 17 electrons ? <p> Solution : Argon is a noble gas , and as an atom it has 18 electrons . If an Argon has 17 electrons , it must be an ion , because Argon must have 18 protons ( 18 is Argon 's atomic number ) . As stated above , noble gases are unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@119689046 @8689046/ <h> What is an Expanded Valence Shell ? <p> An expanded valence shell is where more than eight of an atom 's electrons participate in covalent bonding . Eight of these electrons will always be valence shell electrons . The others will be electrons from another shell closer to the atom 's nucleus . Generally not more than sixteen electrons per atom participate in covalent bonding . Finally , note that an expanded valence shell is also called an expanded octet . <p> The most important note is to understand when an element can use an expanded octet based on its availability of electrons beyond the eight valence electrons . Memorizing the list of common molecules that use expanded octets is not important , and this is not the point that should be emphasized in teaching . <h> Phosphorus <p> Phosphorus is one element that commonly participates in expanded octets . Here are the most common molecules that fit under this category : <p> Note the pattern here : in each case , phosphorus has a single bond to five of the same atom , and that other atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Octet Rule , with three lone pairs and one bonding pair .

The most relevant molecule is here : <p> Sulfur uses a total of twelve electrons in bonding here , in the form of six single bonds . The fluroine atoms all obey the Octet Rule , while Sulfur uses four additional electrons beyond those in its valence shell to bond with as many as six fluorine atoms . <p> Of course , there are also polyatomic ions where this ability comes in handy : <p> Note that when an expanded octet is in an anion , one or more other atoms will have the improper number of lone pairs and bonding pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be that way . Selenium is in the same group on the periodic table as sulfur and thus follows the same pattern of expanded octets and number of bonding pairs : <p> The last ion here involves tellurium , another nonmetal that is directly below Selenium in the periodic table . <h> Chlorine and the Other Halogens <p> There is a subset of chlorine 's ions that use an expanded Octet . It is actually part of chlorine 's oxyanion series : <p> The last ion here does not violate the Octet Rule ; it is shown for the sake of helping to reveal a pattern . For each oxygen atom added after the first , chlorine uses two additional electrons to form its covalent bonds ! Also note that in each case , only one oxygen atom has an improper number of lone pairs . <p> Other Halogens can also form these oxyanions .

I do not recommend asking students to memorize the twenty structures shown here , especially as many of them are very uncommon in high school chemistry classes beyond demonstrating expanded octets . <p> That said , you can provide students an opportunity to identify patterns themselves and predict the structure of new molecules . <p> Example 1 : Draw the perchlorate ion on the board , ( ClO4- ) .

@@119689047 @8689047/ <h> Biomes 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To define biomes and climate , and their relationship <p> If you look at the two pictures in Figure 1 below , you will see very few similarities . The picture on the left shows a desert in Africa . The picture on the right shows a rainforest in Australia . What is the most obvious difference between the two places ? It could be that the desert does not have any visible plants , whereas the rainforest is densely packed with trees . What causes these two places to be so different ? The main reason is climate . <p> Biomes and Climate <p> The two pictures above represent two different types of biomes : deserts and rainforests . A biome is a group of similar ecosystems that cover a broad area . Biomes are major subdivisions of the biosphere . They can be classified into two major types : <p> It is important to understand how climate influences biomes . Climate is the most important abiotic ( non-living ) factor affecting the distribution of terrestrial biomes of different types . Climate determines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines what plants can grow there . Animals depend directly or indirectly on plants , so the type of animals that live in an area also depends on climate . <p> What Is Climate ? <p> Climate is the average weather in an area over a long period of time , whereas weather is a day to day explanation . Weather and climate are described in terms of factors such as temperature and precipitation . The climate of a particular location depends , in turn , on its latitude ( distance from the equator ) and altitude ( distance above sea level ) . Other factors that affect an area 's climate include its location relative to the ocean or mountain ranges . Temperature and moisture are the two climatic factors that most affect terrestrial biomes . <p> Temperature <p> In general , temperature on Earth 's surface falls from the equator to the poles . Based on temperature , climates can be classified as tropical , temperate , or arctic , as shown in Figure 2 . Temperature also falls from lower to higher altitudes , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This explains why the tops of high mountains in tropical climates may be snow-capped year-round . <p> The ocean may also play an important role in the temperature of an area . Coastal areas may have milder climates than areas farther inland at the same latitude . This is because the temperature of the ocean changes relatively little from season to season , and this affects the temperature on nearby coasts . As a result , many coastal areas have both warmer winters and cooler summers than inland areas . <p> Figure 2 : Major climate zones based on temperature include tropical , temperate , and arctic zones . The tropical zone extends from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer . The two temperate zones extend from the tropical zone to the arctic or antarctic circle . The two arctic zones extend from the arctic or antarctic circle to the north or south pole . <p> Moisture <p> Based on the amount of water available to plants , climates can be classified as arid ( dry ) , semi-arid , semi-humid , or humid ( wet ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitation and evaporation . Evaporation , in turn , depends on heat from the sun . Worldwide precipitation patterns result from global movements of air masses and winds , which are shown in Figure 3 . For example , warm , humid air masses rise over the equator and are moved north and south by global air currents . The air masses cool and can not hold as much water . As a result , they drop their moisture as precipitation . This explains why many tropical areas receive more precipitation than other areas of the world . <p> Figure 3 : This model of Earth shows the direction in which air masses typically move and winds usually blow at different latitudes . These movements explain why some latitudes receive more precipitation than others . <p> When the same air masses descend at about 30- north or south latitude ( see Figure 3 ) , they are much drier . This explains why dry climates are found at these latitudes . These latitudes are also warm and sunny , which increases evaporation and dryness . Dry climates are found near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold very little moisture , so precipitation is low in arctic zones . However , these climates also have little evaporation because of the extreme cold . As a result , cold climates with low precipitation may not be as dry as warm climates with the same amount of precipitation . <p> Distance from the ocean and mountain ranges also influences precipitation . For example , one side of a mountain range near the ocean may receive a lot of precipitation because warm , moist air masses regularly move in from the water . As air masses begin to rise up over the mountain range , they cool and drop their moisture as precipitation . This is illustrated in Figure 4 . <p> Figure 4 : The windward side of this mountain range has a humid climate , whereas the leeward side has an arid climate . On the windward side , warm moist air comes in from the ocean , rises and cools , and drops its moisture as rain or snow . On the leeward side , the cool dry air falls , warms , and picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth on the two sides of the mountain range ? <p> By the time the air masses reach the other side of the mountain range , they no longer contain moisture . As a result , land on this side of the mountain range receives little precipitation . This land is in the rain shadow of the mountain range . Many inland areas far away from the ocean or mountain ranges are also dry . Air masses that have passed over a wide expanse of land to reach the interior of a continent usually no longer carry much moisture . <p> Climate and Plant Growth <p> Plants are the major producers in terrestrial biomes . Almost all other terrestrial organisms depend on them either directly or indirectly for food . Plants need air , warmth , sunlight , water , and nutrients to grow . Climate is the major factor affecting the number and diversity of plants that can grow in a terrestrial biome . Climate determines the average temperature and precipitation , the length of the growing season , and the quality of the soil , including levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the period of time each year when it is warm enough for plants to grow . The timing and length of the growing season determine what types of plants can grow in an area . For example , near the poles the growing season is very short . The temperature may rise above freezing for only a couple of months each year . Because of the cold temperatures and short growing season , trees and other slow-growing plants are unable to survive . The growing season gets longer from the poles to the equator . Near the equator , plants can grow year-round if they have enough moisture . A huge diversity of plants can grow in hot , wet climates . <p> The timing of precipitation also affects the growing season . In some areas , most of the precipitation falls during a single wet season ( such as in California ) , rather than throughout the year ( such as in New England ) . In these areas , the growing season lasts only as long as there is enough moisture for plants to grow . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic matter . Nutrients and organic matter are added to soil when plant litter and dead organisms decompose . In cold climates , decomposition occurs very slowly . As a result , soil in cold climates is thin and poor in nutrients . Soil is also thin and poor in hot , wet climates because the heat and humidity cause such rapid decomposition that little organic matter accumulates in the soil . The frequent rains also leach nutrients from the soil . Thin , poor soil is shown in the left drawing of Figure 5 . The right drawing shows thick , rich soil . This type of soil is generally found in temperate climates and is best for most plants . <p> Figure 5 : The soil on the left has a thin layer of topsoil , the part of soil where most plant roots obtain moisture and nutrients . The topsoil is light in color , which means that it is poor in nutrients and organic matter . The soil on the right has a thicker layer of topsoil . Its dark color indicates that the topsoil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Adaptations <p> Because plants are the most important producers in terrestrial biomes , anything that affects their growth also influences the number and variety of other organisms that can be supported in a biome . Therefore , climate has a major impact on the biodiversity of biomes . <p> Biodiversity <p> Biodiversity refers to the number of different species of organisms in a biome ( or ecosystem or other ecological unit ) . Biodiversity is usually greater in warmer biomes . Therefore , biodiversity generally decreases from the equator to the poles . Biodiversity is usually greater in wetter biomes , as well . Remember the desert and rainforest pictured in Figure 1 ? The biodiversity of these two biomes is vastly different . Both biomes have warm climates , but the desert is very dry , and the rainforest is very wet . The desert has very few organisms , so it has low biodiversity . Some parts of the desert may have no organisms , and therefore zero biodiversity . In contrast , the rainforest has the highest biodiversity of any biome on Earth . <p> Adaptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit them to the abiotic factors in their biome . Abiotic factors to which they adapt include temperature , moisture , growing season , and soil . This is why the same type of biome in different parts of the world has organisms with similar adaptations . For example , biomes with dry climates worldwide have plants with similar adaptations to aridity , such as special tissues for storing water ( see Figure 6 ) . <p> Figure 6:The large hollow leaves of an African aloe plant store water and help the plant survive in its arid biome. ( right ) Cacti like these are found in arid biomes of North America . They store water in their thick , barrel-like stems . <p> In biomes with a severe cold or dry season , plants may become dormant during that season of the year . In dormant plants , cellular activities temporarily slow down , so the plants need less sunlight and water . For example , many trees shed their leaves and become dormant during very cold or dry seasons .

@@119689054 @8689054/ <h> The Va n't Hoff Factor 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> A chemical 's Va n't Hoff Factor is an important tool in solution chemistry because it helps you perform stoichiometric calculations concerning solutions . A Va n't Hoff Factor is a positive integer that represents the number of smaller components a formula unit/single molecule of a chemical decomposes into when placed into water and dissociated . <h> Va n't Hoff Factor for Covalent Compounds <p> Covalent compounds are generally nonelectrolytes and do not decompose further in aqueous solution . The Va n't Hoff Factor of a covalently bonded compound is thus usually ( 1 ) , because the result when the chemical is " dissociated " is one molecule , the one that was initially present . <p> Example 1 : The chemical 1-ethanol , with a structural formula ( CH2OHCH3 ) and molecular formula ( C2H6O ) , is a nonelectrolyte and does not dissociate in aqueous solution . Thus its Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 1 ) . <p> The one major exception to this rule , however , is acids . An acid will decompose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Va n't Hoff Factor for these Bronsted-Lowry Acids is equal to the number of ions that result when the original chemical dissociates in aqueous solution . <p> Example 2 : The chemical hydrochloric acid , ( HCl ) , dissociates into a single ( H+ ) and a single ( Cl- ) when placed in water . Since two ions result , the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) . <p> Example 3 : The chemical sulfuric acid , ( H2SO4 ) dissociates into two ( H+ ) and a single ( SO42- ) when placed in water . There are a total of three ions ( not two ! ) so the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 3 ) . <h> Va n't Hoff Factor for Ionic Compounds <p> Finding the Va n't Hoff Factor for an ionic compound is basically the same as finding the Va n't Hoff Factor for an acid , as described in the previous section . When dissociated , the ionic compound will break down into its component cation and anion . Since two different ions will form from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoff Factor of an ionic compound will always be at least ( 2 ) . However , sometimes more than one cation and/or anion will form from a formula unit , in which case each individual ion is counted separately , even if two or more of the ions are indistinguishable . <p> Note that all ionic compounds are written in the form ( AxBy ) , where ( A ) is the cation , ( B ) is the anion , and ( x ) and ( y ) are the respective coefficients . This indicates how many of each ion are used to create the final ionic compound . Once the ionic compound is dissociated , each cation and each anion will be counted when determining the Va n't Hoff Factor . Thus , ( x ) cations and ( y ) anions form per formula unit . A total of ( x + y ) ions result , so the Va n't Hoff Factor for an ionic compound is ( x + y ) . <p> Example 4 : Find the Va n't Hoff Factor of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coefficients are both ( 1 ) , so one cation and one anion will be isolated upon dissociation . Thus the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) . <p> Example 5 : Find the Va n't Hoff Factor of Aluminum Dichromate . <p> Solution : The chemical formula for Aluminum Phosphate is ( Al2(Cr2O7)3 ) ( do n't be thrown off by the anion containing a metal ) . The cation coefficient is ( 2 ) , and the anion coefficient is ( 3 ) . A total of five ions are isolated upon dissociation of one formula unit of this chemical , so the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 5 ) . <h> Stoichiometry with the Va n't Hoff Factor <p> Finding the Va n't Hoff Factor of a compound can be a helpful technique when performing certain types of stoichiometric calculations , generally where we want to find the number of one or more ions constituting a compound . <p> Example 6 : How many moles of ions are in a ( 30.0 ) -gram sample of sodium bicarbonate ? <p> Solution : The chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert from grams of sodium bicarbonate to moles of sodium bicarbonate , we need to find the molar mass of sodium bicarbonate : <p> We want to find the number of ions in the sample , however , so we must find the number of ions in one formula unit , the Va n't Hoff Factor . In every formula unit , there are two sodium ions and one carbonate ion . Remember that the negative charge comes from a carbonate ion , not a combination of one carbide ion and three oxide ions ! Thus , the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 3 ) --each formula unit dissociates into two sodium cations and one carbonate anion . That makes for a total of three ions per formula unit , and we can convert from formula units to ions : <p> Here is one more example that is more closely tied with another major concept in solution stoichiometry : molarity . <p> Example 7 : What is the combined number of sodium and chloride ions in ( 500.0 ; mL ) of a ( .2 ; M ) aqueous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem contains a molarity , it has the same basic end goal as Example 6 : count the ions . We would need to find the number of formula units of ( NaCl ) . We can " convert " the volume of solution to moles of solute , for starters . Convert the volume to dimensionally equivalent units to the molarity ( liters ) : <p> Every sodium chloride formula unit dissociates into one sodium ion and one chloride ion , a total of two ions . So , the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) ; there are two ions per formula unit--our last conversion factor ! <p> While calculating Va n't Hoff Factors is simple , its uses go well beyond memorizing a simple formula . It is a very powerful tool in stoichiometry problems , and hopefully you have familiarized yourself with when it is useful .

@@119689061 @8689061/ <h> Introduction to Chemical Reactions 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> The objective of this article is to explain the concept of chemical reactions and the types of chemical reactions . 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> One of the most fundamental concepts of chemistry is something known as the Law of Conservation of Matter , that states that atoms are never introduced or destroyed . This is what allows chemical reactions to work , where one or more chemicals react in such ways that one or more new chemicals are formed , via the moving of electrons between substances . The chemicals present before the reaction are called reactants ( for the obvious reason ) , and the chemicals present after the reaction are called products . No chemical reaction is a chemical reaction without both of these components . <h> Introduction to Chemical Equations <p> On paper , a chemical reaction can be written out in the form of a chemical equation , which shows the reaction taking place . Of course there is always a way to describe the reaction in words too . <p> Example 1 : Write a chemical equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to get Magnesium Sulfate and Water . <p> Solution : The reactants are written on the left , and the products are written on the right , with an arrow in between . <p> $$Mg(OH)2 + H2SO4 rightarrow H2O + MgSO4$$ <h> States of Matter <p> Often , it is a good idea to include states of matter in a chemical equation . A state of matter is the phase of the chemical , so either solid , liquid , or gas . In addition , in chemical equations the phrase aqueous is treated as a state of matter . This refers to a chemical being dissolved in a solution with water . <p> When placing states of matter in chemical equations , use the following symbols : <p> ( ( s ) ) for a solid <p> ( ( l ) ) for a liquid ( usually water ) <p> ( ( g ) ) for a gas <p> ( ( aq ) ) for an aqueous substance <p> Example 2 : Write an equation for a reaction between aqueous Gold Perchlorate and solid Titanium which form solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Solution : Use the information given about the chemicals to write the equation : <p> $$Au(ClO4)3 + Ti rightarrow Ti(ClO4)2 + Au$$ <p> Now add the states of matter . <p> $$Au(ClO4)3(aq) + Ti(s) rightarrow Ti(ClO4)2(aq) + Au(s)$$ <p> As a general rule of thumb , always include the states of matter if they are given . <h> Single Replacement Reactions <p> There are many different types of chemical reactions , and they are classified based on a combination of the identity of the reactants and products and how many substances/ions are directly involved in the reaction . A single replacement reaction is a reaction where one substance or ion is moved , and nothing else . <p> Example 3 : Based on the following chemical equation , is the reaction a single replacement reaction ? How can you tell ? The equation is <p> $$BaCO3 + Na rightarrow Na2CO3 + Ba$$ <p> Solution : This is a single replacement reaction . The way we can tell is that only the Carbonate ion ( ( CO32- ) ) is moving , and thus influencing the charges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chloride and solid Barium react in a single-replacement reaction . What are the products ? <p> Solution : In a single-replacement reaction , one chemical will be moved between substances . Since Magnesium Chloride is an ionic compound , it will likely be an ion . Seeing Magnesium and Barium in a compound together is uncommon because both of these elements are metals , but Barium Chloride is a perfectly plausible ionic compound , so we have the reaction <p> $$MgCl2+Ba rightarrow BaCl2+Mg$$ <p> So the products are solid Magnesium and Barium Chloride . <h> Double Replacement Reactions <p> The counterpart of single replacement reactions , a double replacement reaction is where two substances or ions are moved/inverted to create new substances . Generally double replacement reactions , at least in first-year courses , will have at least two products . <p> Solution : Only the Chlorine atoms are being moved , so by definition this can not be a double replacement reaction . It is actually a single replacement reaction . <p> Example 6 : What is one possible double replacement reaction that could theoretically occur between Aluminum Chromate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solution : Two components must be inverted to create a double-replacement reaction . It is perfectly valid to allow these substances to be the anions that are present . Therefore we get a chemical equation of <p> $$Al(CrO4)3 + MgO rightarrow Mg(CrO4)2 + Al2O3$$ <h> Synthesis Reactions <p> A synthesis reaction is where two or more chemicals are combined to create one chemical . Generally , if a reaction is known to be a synthesis reaction , predicting the product(s) are easier compared to single or double replacement reactions . <p> Example 7 : The products of a chemical reaction are Sodium Hydroxide and Acetone . Without knowing the products , how do you know that this is not a synthesis reaction ? <p> Solution : There would only be one product , so this must be a different type of reaction . <p> In the previous example , even though we could tell that it was not a synthesis reaction , we would need to know the reactants in order to determine what type of reaction it actually was . <p> Example 8 : If ( H2O2 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible product of the reaction ? <p> Solution : Of course there may be multiple answers , but they all must include Chromium , Hydrogen , and Oxygen . This solution creates an ionic compound ; the product ( Cr(OH)3 ) appears perfectly valid , as this is indeed a synthesis reaction by definition . For reference , the equation is shown below : <p> $$H2O2 + Cr rightarrow Cr(OH)3$$ <h> Decomposition Reaction <p> A decomposition reaction is a reaction that is in the reverse process of a synthesis reaction ; a chemical decomposes into two or more different chemicals . Sometimes the decomposition will be automatic , and other times a trigger such as heat will be necessary . <h> Oxidation-Reduction Reactions <p> An oxidation-reduction reaction is a reaction that meets one of two conditions : 1 . Elemental oxygen is a reactant . 2 . One substance is oxidized , or has electrons taken away from it , and one substance is reduced , where it gets additional electrons . <p> An oxidation-reduction reaction , or redox reaction , can at the same time be a single replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Example 10a : Classify the following chemical reaction in two ways : <p> $$Sn + O2 rightarrow SnO$$ <p> Solution : One of the reactants is elemental oxygen , so it is a redox reaction . In addition , two substances are combined to create one new one , so it is also a synthesis reaction . <p> The second half of the example generalizes this reaction . <p> Example 10b : In Example 10a , the Tin metal is being oxidized into Tin cations . All stable metals can undergo basically the same reaction . Here are some specific ones : <p> Lithium : <p> $$Li + O2 rightarrow Li2O$$ <p> Calcium : <p> $$Ca + O2 rightarrow CaO$$ <p> Aluminum : <p> $$Al + 3O2 rightarrow Al2O3$$ <p> In each of these redox reactions , the metal is oxidized and the oxygen is reduced . This property also applies to transition metals ( the stable ones ) : <p> $$Zr + O2 rightarrow ZrO2$$ <p> Another type of problem is to determine whether a reaction is a redox reaction . As a rule of thumb , check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Example 11 : Is this a redox reaction ? Explain why . <p> $$HNO3 + Cu(OH)2 rightarrow Cu(NO3)2 + H2O$$ <p> Solution : There is no elemental oxygen ( although substances with oxygen are abundant ; do n't let this make you think the reaction is redox ) . Also , there is nothing being oxidized or reduced . Therefore this is not a redox reaction . <p> Example 12 : In the following chemical equation , the element labeled with a question mark is unknown : <p> $$Mg ? + Na rightarrow Na ? + Mg$$ <p> What might this unknown element be if this reaction is a redox reaction ? <p> Solution : There is no room for elemental oxygen in this reaction . However , the " ? " can still be oxygen : <p> $$MgO + Na rightarrow Na2O + Mg$$ <p> Here 's why : in this reaction , the Magnesium is reduced and the Sodium is Oxidized . Therefore this is a redox reaction . <p> Basically any anion would work here . For example , if the question mark actually represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For the same reason , this is still a redox reaction . Even a polyatomic ion would allow this to be a redox reaction ( although polyatomic ions are not pure elements ) . For example , if the ion is Phosphite : <p> $$Mg3(PO3)2 + Na rightarrow Na3PO3 + Mg$$ <p> Example 13 : What type of reaction is this ? <p> $$Mn2 O7+Na2 SO3 rightarrow Mn2 ( SO3 ) 7+Na2O$$ <p> Solution : Two different ions , oxide and sulfite , are interchanged . Therefore this is a double-replacement reaction . <p> Despite being under " Oxidation-Reduction Reactions , " the above reaction is not a redox reaction . None of the charges change ( nothing is oxidized or reduced ) . The presence of oxygen may have made you identify the reaction as redox , but that is incorrect because the oxygen is not elemental ; it is the anion in the ionic compound Manganese ( VII ) Oxide . <h> Combustion Reactions <p> A combustion reaction is a subtype of redox reactions where a substance is burned with an oxygen flame . Therefore by definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always contain elemental oxygen . <p> Many combustion reactions include elemental oxygen and a hydrocarbon , a chemical comprising only of Carbon and Hydrogen atoms . By default , these reactions always have two products : carbon dioxide and water . The amounts produced are based on the type of hydrocarbon and how much of each reactant are available . <p> Example 14 : Octane is combusted as follows : <p> $$C8H18 + O2 rightarrow CO2 + H2O$$ <p> a . Is this reaction a redox reaction ? <p> b . Is this reaction a synthesis reaction ? <p> c . Would the previous answers change if a different hydrocarbon is used ? <p> Solution : <p> a . Elemental oxygen is a reactant , so this reaction is a redox reaction . <p> b . This is not a synthesis reaction , because there are the same number of products as reactants , so two reactants could not combine to form one product . <p> c . No ; regardless , elemental oxygen is still a reactant , and this does nothing to change the products ( only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction . <p> A carbohydrate is a chemical with only Carbon , Hydrogen , and Oxygen . Combustion of carbohydrates works the same way as the combustion of hydrocarbons . <p> Example 15 : What are the products when ( C9H16O2 ) is combusted ? <p> Solution : By inspection of the chemical formula ( C9H16O2 ) , it is obvious this is a carbohydrate . As usual , the products will be ( CO2 ) and ( H2O ) . Here is the chemical equation : <p> $$C9H16O2 + O2 rightarrow CO2 + H2O$$ <p> &lt;div class= " article-example " markdown= " 1 " &gt; <p> **Example 16 : ** Find and balance an equation for the combustion of ( C7H16O4 ) . <p> **Solution : ** " Combustion " implies the addition of elemental oxygen : <p> $$C7H16O4 + O2 rightarrow$$ <p> As with any other combustion reaction , the products are carbon dioxide and water : <p> $$C7H16O4 + O2 rightarrow CO2 + H2O$$ <p> Balance the hydrogen first : <p> $$C7H16O4 + O2 rightarrow CO2 + 8H2O$$ <p> Now balance carbon : <p> $$C7H16O4 + O2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon atoms on the right side , so we need the same number on the left side . With four oxygen atoms included in the carbohydrate , the remaining ( 18 ) must come from the elemental oxygen , so <p> $$C7H16O4 + 9O2 rightarrow 7CO2 + 8H2O$$ <p> &lt;/div&gt; <p> The Law of Conservation of Matter stated that new matter could not be introduced or removed from existence , but many of the equations in this article appeared to violate this concept because the amount of each chemical on both sides of the equation was not the same . However , there is a way to balance equations to make this rule followed yet again ; this will be discussed in a different article , as it is too big a concept to include here . 
@@119689066 @8689066/ <h> The Va n't Hoff Factor 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> A chemical 's Va n't Hoff Factor is an important tool in solution chemistry because it helps you perform stoichiometric calculations concerning solutions . A Va n't Hoff Factor is a positive integer that represents the number of smaller components a formula unit/single molecule of a chemical decomposes into when placed into water and dissociated . <h> Va n't Hoff Factor for Covalent Compounds <p> Covalent compounds are generally nonelectrolytes and do not decompose further in aqueous solution . The Va n't Hoff Factor of a covalently bonded compound is thus usually ( 1 ) , because the result when the chemical is " dissociated " is one molecule , the one that was initially present . <p> Example 1 : The chemical 1-ethanol , with a structural formula ( CH2OHCH3 ) and molecular formula ( C2H6O ) , is a nonelectrolyte and does not dissociate in aqueous solution . Thus its Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 1 ) . <p> The one major exception to this rule , however , is acids . An acid will decompose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Va n't Hoff Factor for these Bronsted-Lowry Acids is equal to the number of ions that result when the original chemical dissociates in aqueous solution . <p> Example 2 : The chemical hydrochloric acid , ( HCl ) , dissociates into a single ( H+ ) and a single ( Cl- ) when placed in water . Since two ions result , the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) . <p> Example 3 : The chemical sulfuric acid , ( H2SO4 ) dissociates into two ( H+ ) and a single ( SO42- ) when placed in water . There are a total of three ions ( not two ! ) so the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 3 ) . <h> Va n't Hoff Factor for Ionic Compounds <p> Finding the Va n't Hoff Factor for an ionic compound is basically the same as finding the Va n't Hoff Factor for an acid , as described in the previous section . When dissociated , the ionic compound will break down into its component cation and anion . Since two different ions will form from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoff Factor of an ionic compound will always be at least ( 2 ) . However , sometimes more than one cation and/or anion will form from a formula unit , in which case each individual ion is counted separately , even if two or more of the ions are indistinguishable . <p> Note that all ionic compounds are written in the form ( AxBy ) , where ( A ) is the cation , ( B ) is the anion , and ( x ) and ( y ) are the respective coefficients . This indicates how many of each ion are used to create the final ionic compound . Once the ionic compound is dissociated , each cation and each anion will be counted when determining the Va n't Hoff Factor . Thus , ( x ) cations and ( y ) anions form per formula unit . A total of ( x + y ) ions result , so the Va n't Hoff Factor for an ionic compound is ( x + y ) . <p> Example 4 : Find the Va n't Hoff Factor of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coefficients are both ( 1 ) , so one cation and one anion will be isolated upon dissociation . Thus the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) . <p> Example 5 : Find the Va n't Hoff Factor of Aluminum Dichromate . <p> Solution : The chemical formula for Aluminum Phosphate is ( Al2(Cr2O7)3 ) ( do n't be thrown off by the anion containing a metal ) . The cation coefficient is ( 2 ) , and the anion coefficient is ( 3 ) . A total of five ions are isolated upon dissociation of one formula unit of this chemical , so the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 5 ) . <h> Stoichiometry with the Va n't Hoff Factor <p> Finding the Va n't Hoff Factor of a compound can be a helpful technique when performing certain types of stoichiometric calculations , generally where we want to find the number of one or more ions constituting a compound . <p> Example 6 : How many moles of ions are in a ( 30.0 ) -gram sample of sodium bicarbonate ? <p> Solution : The chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert from grams of sodium bicarbonate to moles of sodium bicarbonate , we need to find the molar mass of sodium bicarbonate : <p> We want to find the number of ions in the sample , however , so we must find the number of ions in one formula unit , the Va n't Hoff Factor . In every formula unit , there are two sodium ions and one carbonate ion . Remember that the negative charge comes from a carbonate ion , not a combination of one carbide ion and three oxide ions ! Thus , the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 3 ) --each formula unit dissociates into two sodium cations and one carbonate anion . That makes for a total of three ions per formula unit , and we can convert from formula units to ions : <p> Here is one more example that is more closely tied with another major concept in solution stoichiometry : molarity . <p> Example 7 : What is the combined number of sodium and chloride ions in ( 500.0 ; mL ) of a ( .2 ; M ) aqueous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem contains a molarity , it has the same basic end goal as Example 6 : count the ions . We would need to find the number of formula units of ( NaCl ) . We can " convert " the volume of solution to moles of solute , for starters . Convert the volume to dimensionally equivalent units to the molarity ( liters ) : <p> Every sodium chloride formula unit dissociates into one sodium ion and one chloride ion , a total of two ions . So , the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) ; there are two ions per formula unit--our last conversion factor ! <p> While calculating Va n't Hoff Factors is simple , its uses go well beyond memorizing a simple formula . It is a very powerful tool in stoichiometry problems , and hopefully you have familiarized yourself with when it is useful . 
@@119689068 @8689068/ <h> What does the Octet Rule Mean ? 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> In chemical bonding , there are some trends that apply to the majority of chemical compounds . One of these is known as the Octet Rule . This rule states that an atom will always attempt to have a full set of eight valence electrons by bonding with other atoms either covalently or ionically . The way that the Octet Rule works varies for different types of compounds , so in this article we will explore the different possibilities in an organized fashion . Overall , the Octet Rule is one of the most important fundamentals of chemical bonding . <h> General Trends <p> The amount of electrons an element will tend to gain or lose depends on the number of electrons in the atom 's valence shell . An atom will always try to ionize to its stable state with the transfer of the fewest electrons possible . <p> Example 1 : A fluorine atom can get a full valence shell by either gaining one more electron , or by losing seven electrons . The former requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to gain one electron first . Therefore , ( F- ) ions are more common than ( F7+ ) ions . <p> Example 2 : A magnesium atom can get a full valence shell bt either losing two electrons , or by gaining six . The former requires the transfer of fewer electrons , so ( Mg2+ ) ions are more common than ( Mg6- ) ions . <p> Example 3 : Note that a carbon atom 's valence shell has ( 4 ) electrons . It can either lose four electrons or gain four electrons to get a full valence shell . Note that either transition requires the transfer of the same number of electrons , so which ion results depends on the other chemicals involved . Note that in an ionic compound comprised of a metal and carbon , carbon will form the ( -4 ) carbide ion and form compounds such as magnesium carbide ( Mg2C ) and sodium carbide ( Na4C ) . <p> Here is a table of the group that a chemical is in and its most common transaction of gaining or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group Electrons gained/lost <p> LONG ... <p> 1 Lose 1 electron <p> 2 Lose 2 electrons <p> 3 Lose 3 electrons <p> 4 Lose 4 electrons/gain 4 electrons , depends on situation <p> 5 Gain 3 electrons <p> 6 Gain 2 electrons <p> 7 Gain 1 electrons <p> 8 These chemicals , known as the noble gases , already have a full valence shell and thus tend to be unreactive ( inert ) . <h> Binary Ionic Compounds <p> In an ionic compound , electrons are not shared between ions . Each valence electron is designated to belong to a specific ion in the bond . In a binary ionic compound ( one with only two different types of ions ) , each valence electron belongs to either the cation or anion . When either the cation or anion is polyatomic , it becomes more complicated . We can say that the electron belongs to either the cation or anion , but then we need to determine how it is shared between atoms that comprise the polyatomic ion . We will worry about this special case later , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chloride , ( NaCl ) . Sodium atoms have one valence electron and chlorine atoms have seven . If a single electron is transferred from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom , then we get ( Na+ ) and ( Cl- ) , two ions in stable states . Thus we only need one of each atom to form this stable ionic compound , and both ions now satisfy the Octet Rule . <p> Example 5 : Consider Aluminum Bromide , ( AlBr3 ) . Aluminium is in Group III , and it tends to lose three electrons to form an ion with a full octet ( meaning it obeys the Octet Rule ) . Bromine atoms tend to gain just one electron to get to a full octet , as Bromine is in Group VII . A chemical consisting of an aluminum ion and a bromide ion in their stable states would be ( AlBr2+ ) , but it is not an ionic compound because it has a charge . Therefore , we need more negatively charged bromide ions to get an ionic compound . Each such ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need two more to get a neutral compound . Thus aluminum bromide is ( AlBr3 ) , with each ion being in its stable octet form . <p> Example 6 : Consider Magnesium Nitride , ( Mg3N2 ) . Magnesium is in Group II and has two electrons in its valence shell . Thus it tends to lose two electrons . In this case , the next set of electrons closer to the nucleus is the new valence shell , and it is full . Nitrogen , on the other hand , is in Group V and has five valence electrons , so it needs to gain three electrons to get a full valence shell . Thus the most stable state for nitrogen ions is the ( N3- ) ion . <h> Covalently Bonded Compounds <p> In covalently bonded compounds , electrons are shared between two atoms through the bonds between them . Every such single bond consists of two electrons , which count towards both atoms ' full set of eight valence electrons . Thus in a compound where two atoms have a single bond to each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six additional valence electrons . <p> Solution : Fluorine is in Group VII , and a single fluorine atom has seven valence electrons . However , by the Octet Rule it would like to gain one electron to get a full octet of valence electrons . Two fluorine atoms can each " sacrifice " one of their valence electrons to form a single bond between the atoms . Now each fluorine atom has six valence electrons to itself . However , the bond consists of two additional valence electrons for each fluorine atom ( as the electrons are shared ) , so both fluorine atoms now have a full octet . Thus fluorine is more stable as a diatomic molecule . <p> Below is a Lewis Structure for elemental fluorine for reference . Note that only valence shell electrons are included in the picture . This is a general convention for drawing Lewis Structures . <p> Now , recall that double bonds and triple bonds exist . These have slightly different advantages compared to single bonds . In particular , they allow even more electrons to be shared between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they share four valence electrons ; if there is a triple bond , the two atoms share six valence electrons . The Octet Rule still applies regardless of which type of covalent bond is involved . <p> Example 8 : Consider ( O2 ) , oxygen 's elemental form . Lone oxygen atoms have six valence electrons . However , oxygen is even more stable in groups of two atoms , because each oxygen atom can " sacrifice " two valence electrons , giving a total of four electrons used to bond the two atoms . Since there are four valence electrons to share , this is a double bond . Each oxygen atom has four valence electrons to itself and four that are shared through the double bond . Thus each oxygen atom now has a full octet . Below is the Lewis Structure . <p> Example 9 : Consider ( N2 ) , nitrogen 's elemental form . Unlike oxygen , nitrogen atoms have five valence electrons , so they need three more to get a full octet . This is where a triple bond comes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in return get three more that initially belonged to another nitrogen atom . Thus there are two valence electrons that belong solely to one of the nitrogen atoms , and there are six that are shared , so each nitrogen atom has eight valence electrons . Below is the Lewis Structure . <h> Ionic Compounds with a Polyatomic Ion <p> When a molecule has a nonzero charge , it becomes a polyatomic ion . One or more atoms in the molecule will have violated the Octet Rule , making them unstable unless they are in the presence of a different ion of the opposite charge . Most polyatomic ions are anions . In this case , one or more atoms will have one of the following : more lone pairs than they should , or an expanded octet , a set of more than eight valence electrons . This section is quite complicated and its treatment is often limited in high school chemistry classes . <p> Two of the oxygen atoms ( the left and bottom ones ) have an extra lone pair , but still have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms have a negative formal charge , meaning they hold some electrons longer than they would in the perfectly stable case ( two lone pairs , two bonding pairs ) . In lieu of a second bonding pair , these oxygen atoms have a third lone pair . These electrons are not shared with other atoms , so they further contribute to negative charge around the oxygen atom . <p> When assigning formal charges , we assume that the two atoms in a bond share bonding pair electrons equally , so each bonding pair electron essentially contributes ( frac12 ) the charge of an electron to each atom involved in the bond . Therefore , when two electrons go from being shared to being held only by the oxygen atom , their " charge contribution " to the oxygen atom increases by ( frac12 ) an electron 's charge each , increasing the charge around the oxygen atom by ( -1 ) . Thus the oxygen atom 's formal charge is ( +1 ) . <p> Next , note that the top and right oxygen atoms have two lone pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical ) and obey the Octet Rule . <p> Now , let 's talk about the Sulfur atom . It has an expanded octet , as it has twelve apparent valence shell electrons ( six single bonds ' worth ; count the bonds ) . However , in an expanded octet , some electrons from the shell of electrons inside the valence shell participate in bonding . That is why it APPEARS sulfur has twelve valence electrons in this case , but this is just an illusion . <p> This is a confusing subject and you likely have unanswered questions at this point , but do not worry ! It is suggested from here that you do further reading ( either through OpenCurriculum or another resource ) on Octet Rule exceptions and formal charges . The discussion gets even more technical and will be omitted here . <p> Now let 's talk about where the Octet Rule does apply : the ionic bond . The magnesium atom used to form this compound still wants a full octet , and as it is in Group II , it achieves this most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion a charge of ( +2 ) . The sum of the formal charges of the atoms of the sulfate ion is ( -2 ) , so the charge of the ion is ( -2 ) ( this will always be true for a polyatomic ion ) . Thus the magnesium cation and sulfate ion match up in a 1:1 ratio , giving ( MgSO4 ) . <p> Thanks to LONG ... for the Lewis Structure diagram pictures .

Believe it or not , the identities of exponents and logarithms are related , and this relationship can help you to understand the rules . First and foremost , since exponents and logarithms are inverse operations : <p> For ( a , b &gt; 0 ) : <p> $$aloga(b) = b$$ $$loga(ba) = b$$ <p> These two identities are very important for understanding the relationship between exponential and logarithmic identities , and we will see why over time . <p> Another very basic identity is as follows : <p> Where ( a , b &gt; 0 ) : <p> $$loga(frac1b) = -loga(b)$$ <p> This makes sense based on the graphs of logarithmic functions ( try plugging in values for certain logarithmic functions ) , and it can be proven algebraically . <p> Both logarithms have a base ( a ) , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exponent of both sides : <p> $$aloga(frac1b) = a-loga(b)$$ <p> The exponent and logarithm on the left side immediately cancel each other out : <p> $$frac1b = a-loga(b)$$ <p> The right-hand side has a negative sign in front of the exponent , so convert it to an exponent that omits this : <p> $$frac1b = frac1aloga(b)$$ <p> The exponent and logarithm now cancel each other out : <p> $$frac1b = frac1b$$ <p> Thus this identity is true . Of course we realize that ( b neq 0 ) . <p> Consider these identities as you work through the problems that will proceed in later sections . <h> Products Inside a Logarithm <p> One of the most common ways to manipulate an expression with a logarithm is to convert a product inside a logarithm into a sum of logarithms or vice-versa . This is done with the following identity : <p> If ( a , b , c &gt; 0 ) : <p> $$logc(a) + logc(b) = logc(ab)$$ <p> A proof of this identity will be shown . <p> All of the logarithms are of base ( c ) , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the equation ( yes this is a valid operation ; even if it looks strange , it is commonly done ) : <p> $$clogc(a) + logc(b) = clogc(ab)$$ <p> The right-hand side is easily simplified because the exponent and logarithm have the same base : <p> $$clogc(a) + logc(b) = ab$$ <p> Now , the left-hand side is more difficult to simplify . We need to use an exponent law to break the exponent into a product of two : <p> Example 2 also hints at another identity that will be introduced later . It is worth your time to guess what that identity may be . <p> Example 3 : We can simplify ( 3log3(2) cdot 9log3(4) ) as follows : begin by converting the exponent with a base of ( 9 ) to one of base ( 3 ) , to match the base of the logarithm within the superscript : <p> All of the exponents have the same base , so they can be combined via adding the superscripts together : <p> $$3log3(2) + log3(4) + log3(4)$$ <p> The logarithms now all have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of base ( 3 ) by multiplying the inputs into the logarithms ( also known as arguments ) : <p> $$3log3 ( 2 cdot 4 cdot 4 ) = 3log3(32)$$ <p> Now , the base of the exponent and logarithm are the same , so they cancel out : <p> $$3log3(32) = 32$$ <p> As a side note , this expression could also have been simplified by simplifying the first exponent first , then converting the base of the second to match the base of the logarithm . However , the solution above was chosen because it illustrates the logarithm sum identity . <h> Changing Bases <p> Often a logarithm is in an inconvenient base , but it is possible to convert it to a more desirable base with an identity . <p> If ( a , b , n &gt; 0 ) : <p> $$logan(bn) = loga(b)$$ <p> As with the other identities , this one will be proven , in the box below . <p> Take the ( an ) th exponent of both sides of the equation : <p> $$bn = ( an ) loga(b)$$ <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they cancel out , but the superscripts must be rearranged . To ensure that they can be rearranged , notice that the following two expressions are equivalent : <p> Solution : The argument of the first logarithm can be made to match the base of the second by squaring the first ' logarithm 's base and argument : <p> $$log36(144) cdot log144(14)$$ <p> Now use the identity to write this as one logarithm : <p> $$log36(14)$$ <p> Logarithmic identities are very powerful tools in the study of exponents and logarithms . These identities will be helpful in calculus and perhaps other math courses you will take later . It is also important to realize that in many problems , it takes more than one identity to simplify the expression given or otherwise solve the problem . That is why showing many different types of examples is important .

While these questions could be approached as separate tasks , here the idea is to sort out the appropriate operation in problems that are superficially alike but may differ mathematically . <p> This set of questions is designed to enhance a student 's understanding of when it is and is not appropriate to add fractions . Individual parts could be used separately but it would work well to generate a classroom discussion of the similarities and differences among these questions . <h> Solutions 212258 @qwx1072258 <p> In the problem the two fractions refer to the same whole ( namely the 40 acres of land ) . Adding the fractions is appropriate since none of the land is planted with both crops . We add and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planted in wheat or corn . <p> In this problem there are several aspects that make the addition of fractions wrong . First , the fractions given are of different bottles and they do n't need to have any relationship to one another . Second , the question asked how much water they drank and no information is given about the amount of water in either bottle , only the fraction of what was in each bottle . <p> In this problem , the two fractions are both parts of the same whole ( the number of eggs in the incubator ) and could be added together to find the fraction of the eggs that hatched in all . However , since the question asks for the number of eggs hatched , it can not be answered without more information . Adding the fractions might be part of the solution to the question of how many eggs hatched . <p> In this problem , the two fractions are related to the same whole , namely the total number of members of the team . Since no one arrived after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two fractions to determine that ( frac710 ) of the team arrived . <p> This problem may serve as a preview to a sixth grade standard relating to ratios . While Andy made ( frac25 ) of his free throws and Jose made ( frac310 ) of his free throws , the fractions are of a different number of throws and thus can not be added . For this problem , the total fraction of free throws is the sum of the number completed out the total number attempted . Thus the total is 5 out of 15 or ( frac515 ) of the total throws . <p> In this problem , both of the fractions refer to the same whole , namely the total number of students in the fifth grade . However , it is likely that some of the students want to play in both groups , so it is not appropriate to add the two fractions . <p> In this problem , the two fractions refer to the same whole , the number of students in the fifth grade . Since the rating is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only allowed to select one favorite sport so that there is no overlap between the two sets . Thus it is appropriate to add the fractions to find that ( frac710 ) like one of these two sports best . Note that the total number of students in the fifth grade is given and is not necessary to answer the question . It is useful for students to see some questions where not all of the information is necessary to solve the problem . <p> In this problem , the two fractions are not of the same whole ; rather each is a fraction of a different team . Thus it is not appropriate to add the fractions to find the fraction of the two teams that are girls . To answer the question of what fraction of the whole are girls , it would be necessary to know how many people are on each team . One would add together the number of players on the two teams to form the denominator of the new fraction . To find the number of girls on each team , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of members of the team and add together the total number of girls to get the numerator of the fraction that represents the total . <p> In this problem , both fractions are parts of the same whole , namely one mile , so it is appropriate to add them to find he ran a total of ( frac710 ) of a mile .

@@119689212 @8689212/ <h> Pythagoras 's Inequalities 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> This article aims to introduce the inequalities that are derived from the Pythagorean Theorem . 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> The Pythagorean Theorem for right triangles states a relationship between the three sides . Let ( a ) and ( b ) be the lengths of the two legs , and let ( c ) be the length of the hypotenuse . Then , <p> $$a2 + b2 = c2$$ <p> However , if a triangle is not a right triangle , then this equation is not true . There are certain inequalities that will hold for acute and obtuse triangles that are very similar to the Pythagorean Theorem . Those inequalities will be introduced here , along with how to use them . <p> Also make sure that the following inequalities are true : <p> $$a + b &gt; c$$ $$a + c &gt; b$$ $$b + c &gt; a$$ <p> Otherwise you have a degenerate triangle where the sides are not all connected . This is the statement provided by the Triangle Inequality and applies to all triangles . <h> The Pythagorean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right triangle with legs of lengths ( a ) and ( b ) and a hypotenuse of length ( c ) . Then <p> $$a2 + b2 = c2$$ <p> If you try to cut the length of the hypotenuse at one end of the hypotenuse , you will form a degenerate triangle unless you pull the two legs closer together , thus shrinking the angle in between them . Therefore the triangle now has three acute angles and is an acute triangle . Since only the original hypotenuse decreased in length , and the other two sides stayed the same length , <p> $$a2 + b2 &gt; c2$$ <p> This is the Pythagorean Theorem for Acute Triangles . <p> Be warned that there is no definitive hypotenuse for a triangle that is acute or obtuse . Therefore we can assign the side lengths of these triangles to the three variable slots in the formula ( ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ) in any configuration we wish . <p> Example 2 : Show that a triangle with sides of lengths ( 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acute triangle . <p> Solution : The sum of the squares of two of the sides must be greater than the square of the third . However , we must test all three distinct arrangements of the side lengths into the inequality for acute triangles . Plugging the side lengths into the formula in the three different configurations gives : <p> So all three conditions of the inequality are satisfied , and thus this triangle appears to be an acute triangle . Lastly we must check the conditions of the Triangle Inequality . Our side lengths are ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , and ( 8 ) , so we will rotate those values in for ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in the Triangle Inequality ( this is how we check to ensure a triangle is non-degenerate whenever we know all the side lengths ) : <p> $$6 + 7 &gt; 8$$ $$6 + 8 &gt; 7$$ $$7 + 8 &gt; 6$$ <p> Simplify these inequalities : <p> $$13 &gt; 8$$ $$14 &gt; 7$$ $$15 &gt; 6$$ <p> These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Example 3 : An acute non-degenerate triangle has two sides of lengths ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) . Use the Pythagorean Inequality for acute triangles to find a range of possible side lengths for the third side . <p> Solution : We know that <p> $$a2 + b2 &gt; c2$$ <p> for all three distinct combinations of setting up the inequality . Let the unknown side be in the slot of ( a ) in the formula in one case , ( b ) in the second , and ( c ) in the third . However we will call this unknown side ( c ) every time . Thus we get <p> We can ignore the second inequality because we can not take the square root of a negative number . Therefore , ( c ) fits these restrictions : <p> $$48 &lt; c2 &lt; 290$$ <p> Take the square root of this inequality : <p> $$sqrt48 &lt; c2 &lt; sqrt290$$ <p> We do not have to worry about the ( pm ) in front of the square roots because side lengths can not be negative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal ( sqrt290 ) , the other two sides combined would still be longer than it . Still , we do n't need to check all the Triangle Inequality conditions because the triangle is assumed to be non-degenerate . <h> The Pythagorean Theorem for Obtuse Triangles <p> The procedure for finding an inequality for obtuse triangles is similar to that for acute triangles . It is demonstrated in Example 4 below . <p> Example 4 : For a right triangle with sides of lengths ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) : <p> $$a2 + b2 = c2$$ <p> Obviously ( c ) is the longest side and is the hypotenuse . However , if we make it even longer while keeping the other two sides the same length , the angle between the two shorter sides will become larger as those two sides are separated . This angle between the two shorter sides was the right angle of the triangle , so it is now an obtuse angle , and we have an obtuse triangle . Since the length of ( c ) increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same : <p> $$a2 + b2 &lt; c2$$ <p> This applies only for obtuse triangles . You must be able to interchange the three side lengths in the different variable slots in this formula , and the inequality must be satisfied every time to identify a triangle as obtuse . <p> Example 5 : Show that the triangle with sides of lengths ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , and ( 17 ) is not an obtuse triangle . <p> Solution : For this triangle to not be obtuse , the inequality <p> $$a2 + b2 &lt; c2$$ <p> must not be satisfied for some placement of the side lengths into this inequality . First , let ( a = 14 ) , ( b = 15 ) , and ( c = 17 ) : <p> This inequality is not true . Despite the possibility of other arrangements of the side lengths into this inequality being true , this one false statement singlehandedly proves that the triangle is not an obtuse triangle . <p> Example 6 : Two sides of an obtuse triangle have lengths ( 11 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than both of these sides , what is the range of possible side lengths for the third side ? <p> Solution : Since this is an obtuse triangle , the following inequality must be satisfied : <p> $$112 + 172 &lt; c2$$ <p> Here , we let ( c ) equal the length of the third side . We can simplify this inequality : <p> $$121 + 289 &lt; c2 Rightarrow$$ $$410 &lt; c2$$ <p> Take the square root of both sides of this inequality : <p> $$sqrt410 &lt; c$$ <p> However , this third side can not be infinitely long . The Triangle Inequality comes into play . It states that for a triangle to not be degenerate , <p> $$a + b &gt; c$$ <p> Since the shorter sides have lengths of ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) , the third side 's length must be less than that of the shorter two combined , so ( c ) is less than ( 24 ) , giving a range of <p> $$sqrt410 &lt; c &lt; 24$$ <h> Classifying Triangles with Side Lengths <p> Here we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as right , acute , or obtuse . <p> Example 7 : In Example 5 , we showed that a triangle with sides of lengths ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , and ( 17 ) can not be obtuse . Determine whether the triangle is acute or right . <p> Solution : The triangle must be either a right triangle or an acute triangle . It is much easier to test if the triangle is a right triangle because we only need to plug variables in one time . If it is a right triangle , the side of length ( 17 ) is the hypotenuse , so in the Pythagorean Theorem ( c = 17 ) . It does not matter which variable we assign to which of the other two variables because the result will be the same . So just let ( a = 14 ) and ( b = 15 ) . If this is a right triangle , then by the Pythagorean Theorem this equation is true : <p> Solution : It is easiest to determine whether the triangle is a right triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of ( 7 ) . Therefore ( c = 7 ) . By the Pythagorean Theorem , this is a right triangle if <p> $$32 + 52 = 72$$ <p> Simplify this equation : <p> $$9 + 25 = 49 Rightarrow$$ $$34 = 49$$ <p> This is not true . So the triangle is not a right triangle . <p> However , this tells us something else . It also shows us that ( a2 + b2 &lt; c2 ) , so this can not be an acute triangle either . We conclude that this is an obtuse triangle . <p> However , we must use the Triangle Inequality to check that this triangle is not degenerate : <p> $$3 + 5 &gt; 7$$ $$3 + 7 &gt; 5$$ $$5 + 7 &gt; 3$$ <p> Simplify these inequalities to verify that they are all true : <p> $$8 &gt; 7$$ $$10 &gt; 5$$ $$12 &gt; 3$$ <p> These inequalities are all true , so the Triangle Inequality is satisfied . Therefore this triangle is not degenerate , and it is an obtuse triangle . <p> Example 9 : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 ) , and ( 25 ) . Show that this triangle is not degenerate , and then determine whether it is right , acute , or obtuse . <p> Solution : To show that this triangle is not degenerate , we must show that <p> $$a + b &gt; c$$ $$b + c &gt; a$$ $$a + c &gt; b$$ <p> In a right triangle , usually the hypotenuse is labeled ( c ) , so let 's just let ( a = 7 ) , ( b = 24 ) , and ( c = 25 ) . So plug those values into the three displayed conditions for the Triangle Inequality : <p> $$7 + 24 &gt; 25$$ $$24 + 25 &gt; 7$$ $$7 + 25 &gt; 24$$ <p> Simplify these inequalities : <p> $$31 &gt; 25$$ $$49 &gt; 7$$ $$32 &gt; 24$$ <p> These inequalities are all true , so the triangle is not degenerate . <p> We next determine if this is a right triangle . The hypotenuse would be the side with a length of ( 25 ) , so by the Pythagorean Theorem : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of a triangle to classify the triangle as acute , obtuse , or right . It is also important to be able to construct triangles with given restrictions ( i.e. it must be a certain type of triangle , etc . ) . Lastly , be sure to check that the triangle is not degenerate , because if it is , neither Pythagoras 's Inequalities nor the Pythagorean Theorem will apply .

@@119689237 @8689237/ <h> The Concept of Divergence 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> The objective of this article is to introduce the concept of divergence using infinity . 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Numbers are not always simple . If you are told to " count as far as you can , " how far can you go ? The truth is that you can go on forever . For every number , there is a bigger one . Infinity ( denoted ( infty ) ) is of a value greater than all numbers that is not itself a number . It basically refers to " the end of counting , " and has many applications that the finite world can not handle . Some of those applications will be looked at in this article . <h> Limits <p> A limit refers to the value that is approached for a certain value of an argument for a function . A limit can be finite or infinite ; in other words , it either converges or diverges . In many cases looking at graphs helps a lot . <p> We begin by analyzing a classic example from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is ( limx rightarrow fracpi2 tan x ) ? <p> Solution : Graphing ( tan x ) will make it clear that there is a vertical asymptote at ( x = fracpi2 ) . However , on one side of the asymptote the graph approaches negative infinity , and on the other side it approaches positive infinity . We can not determine what the true limit is , so we say that it does not exist ( saying that it diverges is also acceptable ) . <h> Asymptotes <p> Here is another example that is very common . It relies on something known as asymptotes , lines with special slopes that the graph of a function mimics . A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line with slope of ( 0 ) and an equation ( y = a ) , where ( a ) is a finite constant .. Generally a graph will approach horizontal asymptotes only as the argument approaches positive or negative infinity . A vertical asymptote is a vertical line with an undefined slope . A vertical asymptote will always be a line with the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a finite constant . The function is always undefined at the vertical asymptote . <p> Solution : Graphing this function will reveal that ( y = 0 ) is a horizontal asymptote for the function , and as ( n ) gets bigger , the value of the function approaches ( 0 ) . Therefore ( limn rightarrow infty frac12n = 0 ) . <p> Here is another example that focuses specifically on vertical asymptotes . <p> When taking limits of ( x ) , the constant term remains the same , and as ( x ) approaches either positive or negative infinity , the denominator of the fraction component grows towards infinity , and thus the fraction approaches zero . Therefore the only horizontal asymptote is ( y = 2 ) . <h> Series <p> In precalculus and calculus classes , a common scenario is to be given a series and to be asked whether it converges or diverges . There are far too many techniques ( known as convergence tests ) to go over in one article , but a common non-Calculus based one is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant factor . <p> The Geometric Series Test states that for a geometric series with a constant factor of ( r ) , the sum converges if ( r &lt; 1 ) and diverges otherwise . <p> Solution : Consecutive terms differ by a factor of ( frac76 ) , and since this is greater than 1 , the sum diverges by the Geometric Series test . <p> Example 6 : What is the smallest value of ( n ) such that the series ( 3 + frac92n + frac274n2 + frac818n3 + ... ) diverges ? <p> Solution : This is a geometric series with an initial term of ( 3 ) and a common ratio of ( frac32n ) . Since by the geometric series the sum converges if the common ratio is less than ( 1 ) and greater than ( -1 ) , the values of ( n ) that will make the series diverge are the solutions to the inequalities <p> $$frac32n geq 1 , frac32n leq -1$$ <p> We want the smallest solution , so solve this for ( n ) , first by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reversing its sign ) : <p> $$frac2n3 leq 1 , frac2n3 geq -1$$ <p> Now combine the two inequalities into one : <p> $$-1 leq frac2n3 leq 1$$ <p> Isolate ( n ) by multiplying all three parts of the inequality by ( frac32 ) : <p> $$-frac32 leq n leq frac32$$ <p> The value ( -frac32 ) is the smallest number in this interval , so it is the solution we are looking for . Notice that this solution makes the common ratio equivalent to ( -1 ) , so by the Geometric Series Test it diverges .

According to the USDA , it took 10 years and cost $1 million to eradicate them . <p> Assuming the snail population grows exponentially , write an expression for the population , ( P ) , in terms of the number , ( t ) , of years since their release . <p> How long does it take for the population to double ? <p> Assuming the cost of eradicating the snails is proportional to the population , how much would it have cost to eradicate them if <p> they had started the eradication program a year earlier ? <p> they had let the population grow unchecked for another year ? <h> Commentary <p> The purpose of this task is to give students experience modeling a real-world example of exponential growth , in a context that provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example the cost of inaction for a year . There is an opportunity for further discussion based on part ( c ) , since the ratio of costs from one year to the next is the same in each part . Although the task does n't point this out explicitly , the teacher can bring it out in discussion , and it illustrates a key property of exponential growth . <p> Students might choose to model exponential growth using either ( P(t)=aert ) or ( P(t)=abt ) . Each has its advantages and disadvantages . The base ( b ) is the factor by which the population increases each year , and so is useful in part ( c ) . And this interpretation of ( b ) yields directly the fact that ( 3b7 = 18 , ! 000 ) , so that it can be calculated without logarithms . On the other hand , students might be more confortable working with base ( e ) and fitting ( P(t) = a ert ) to two data points , without engaging initially in the reasoning above . Depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using this task , he or she might suggest using one form or the other , or might use the opportunity to compare results when different students use different methods . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Solution using base ( e ) <p> Since it is assumed that the growth is exponential , we write ( P(t)=aert ) for some constants ( a ) and ( r ) . We are given two data points , namely that ( P(0)=3 ) and ( P(7) =18,000 ) . ( This last value is only an approximation . ) From the first data point we get ( 3 = P(0) =ae0t=a ) , so we must have ( a=3 ) . Then ( P(7)=18,000 ) gives $$ 18,000=3er(7). $$ Dividing both sides by 3 and taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ( 7r=ln(6000) ) , so ( r=fracln(6000)7approx 1.24 ) . So ( P(t)=3e1.24t ) for ( 0 le t le 7 ) . We use this function to model the population , bearing in mind that it is based on approximate data . <p> The doubling time is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time for the population to double from 3 to 6 , then from 6 to 12 , and so on . We calculate the time for the population to double from 3 to 6 . So we want to find ( t ) such that $$ 6=3e1.24t. $$ Dividing both sides by 3 and taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ( ln(2)=1.24 t ) , so ( tapprox 0.56 ) . It takes just over half a year for the population to double . <p> After 6 years the population is $$ P(6) = 3e1.24(6)approx 5100. $$ If it costs $1 million to clean up 18,000 snails , then it would cost ( frac510018000times $1text millionapprox $ 280,000 ) to clean up 5100 snails . This makes sense since the number of snails doubles almost two times per year , so the population ( and the cost of dealing with it ) should be a little more than ( frac14 ) what it is in the 7th year . <p> After 8 years the population is $$ P(8) = 3e1.24(8)approx 61000. $$ So , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost ( frac6100018000times $1text millionapprox $ 3,400,000 ) to clean up 61,000 snails .

It was n't until 1928 , when Frederick Griffith identified the process of transformation , that individuals started to question this concept . Griffith demonstrated that transformation occurs , but what was the material that caused the transforming process ? <p> Griffith , Avery , Hershey and Chase <p> Griffith was studying Streptococcus pneumoniae , a bacterium that infects mammals . He used two strains , a virulent S ( smooth ) strain and a harmless R ( rough ) strain to demonstrate the transfer of genetic material . The S strain is surrounded by a polysaccharide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resulting in the death of the host , while the R strain , which does not have the protective capsule , is defeated by the hosts immune system . Hence , when mammalian cells are infected with the R strain bacteria , the host does not die ( Figure 1 ) . Griffith infected mice with heat-killed S strain bacteria . As expected , the heat-killed bacteria , as they were dead , had no effect on the mice ( Figure 1 ) . But then he tried something different . He mixed the remains of heat-killed S strain bacteria with live R strain bacteria and injected the mixture into mice . Remember , separately both of these bacteria are harmless to the mice . And yet the mice died ( Figure 1 ) . Why ? These mice had both live R and live S strain bacteria in their blood . How ? Griffith concluded that the R strain had changed , or transformed , into the lethal S strain . Something , such as the " instructions " from the remains of the S strain , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harmless R strain into the lethal S strain . This material that was transferred between strains had to be the heredity material . But the transforming material had yet to be identified . Transformation is now known as the change in genotype and phenotype due to the assimilation of external DNA ( heredity material ) by a cell . <p> Figure 1 : The transformation experiments of Griffith . The rough ( R ) strain has no effect on the mouse , whereas the smooth ( S ) strain is harmful to the mouse . Heat-killed S strain also has no effect on the mouse , but the mixture of heat-killed S strain and the R strain is harmful to the mouse . <p> Over the next decade , scientists , led by Oswald Avery , tried to identify the material involved in transformation . Avery , together with his colleagues Maclyn McCarty and Colin MacLeod , removed various organic compounds from bacteria and tested the remaining compounds for the ability to cause transformation . If the remaining material did not cause transformation , than that material could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with protease enzymes , which remove proteins from cells , and then mixed the remainder with R strain bacteria . The R strain bacteria transformed , meaning that proteins did not carry the genes for causing the disease . Then the remnants of the S strain bacteria were treated with deoxyribonuclease , an enzyme which degrades DNA . After this treatment , the R strain bacteria no longer transformed . This indicated that DNA was the heredity material . The year was 1944 . <p> However , this finding was not widely accepted , partly because so little was known about DNA . It was still thought that proteins were better candidates to be the heredity material . The structure of DNA was still unknown , and many scientists were not convinced that genes from bacteria and more complex organisms could be similar . <p> In 1952 , Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase put this skepticism to rest . They conclusively demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material . Hershey and Chase used the T2 bacteriophage , a virus that infects bacteria , to prove this point . A virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein coat ( Figure 2 ) . To reproduce , a virus must infect a cell and use that host cells machinery to make more viruses . The T2 bacteriophage can quickly turn an Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria into a T2 producing system . But to do that , the genetic material from T2 , which could only be protein or DNA , must be transferred to the bacteria . Which one was it ? <p> Figure 2 : Structural overview of T2 phage . A 2-dimensional representation is on the left , and a 3-dimensional representation is on the right . The phage is essentially nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat . <p> Hershey and Chase performed a series of classic experiments , taking advantage of the fact that T2 is essentially just DNA and protein . In the experiments , T2 phages with either radioactive ( 32 ) P-labeled DNA or radioactive ( 35 ) S-labeled protein were used to infect bacteria . Either the radioactive proteins or radioactive DNA would be transferred to the bacteria . Identifying which one is transferred would identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from the phage coats by blending , followed by centrifugation . Only the radioactively labeled DNA was found inside the bacteria , whereas the radioactive proteins stayed in the solution ( Figure 3 ) . These experiments demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material and that protein does not transmit genetic information . <p> Figure 3:The Hershey and Chase experiment . T2 virus with either radioactive DNA ( upper section ) or radioactive protein ( lower section ) were used to infect bacteria . A blender was used to remove the phage from the bacteria followed by centrifugation . The radioactive DNA was found inside the bacteria ( upper section ) , demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material . <p> Chargaffs Rules <p> It was known that DNA is composed of nucleotides , each of which contains a nitrogen-containing base , a five-carbon sugar ( deoxyribose ) , and a phosphate group . In these nucleotides , there is one of the four possible bases : adenine ( A ) , guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , or thymine ( T ) ( Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogenous bases in DNA . <p> Erwin Chargaff proposed two main rules that have been appropriately named Chargaffs rules . In 1947 he showed that the composition of DNA varied from one species to another . This molecular diversity added evidence that DNA could be the genetic material . Chargaff also determined that in DNA , the amount of one base always approximately equals the amount of a particular second base . For example , the number of guanines equals the number of cytosines , and the number of adenines equals the number of thymines . Human DNA is 30.9% A and 29.4% T , 19.9% G and 19.8% C. This finding , together with that of the DNA structure , led to the base-pairing rules of DNA . <p> The Double Helix <p> In the early 1950s , Rosalind Franklin started working on understanding the structure of DNA fibers . Franklin , together with Maurice Wilkins , used her expertise in x-ray diffraction photographic techniques to analyze the structure of DNA . In February 1953 , Francis Crick and James D. Watson of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crick indirectly obtained Franklins DNA X-ray diffraction data demonstrating crucial information into the DNA structure . Francis Crick and James Watson ( Figure 5 ) then published their double helical model of DNA in Nature on April 25th , 1953 . <p> Figure 5 : James Watson ( left ) and Francis Crick ( right ) . <p> DNA has the shape of a double helix , just like a spiral staircase ( Figure 6 ) . There are two sides , called the sugar-phosphate backbone , because they are made from alternating phosphate groups and deoxyribose sugars . The " steps " of the double helix are made from the base pairs formed between the nitrogenous bases . The DNA double helix is held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases attached to the two strands . <p> The double helical nature of DNA , together with the findings of Chargaff , demonstrated the base-pairing nature of the bases . Adenine always pairs with thymine , and guanine always pairs with cytosine ( Figure 7 ) . Because of this complementary nature of DNA , the bases on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These complementary base pairs explain why the amounts of guanine and cytosine are present in equal amounts , as are the amounts of adenine and thymine . Adenine and guanine are known as purines . These bases consist of two ring structures . Purines make up one of the two groups of nitrogenous bases . Thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines , which have just one ring structure . By having a purine always combine with a pyrimidine in the DNA double helix , the distance between the two sugar-phosphate backbones is constant , maintaining the uniform shape of the DNA molecule . <p> The two strands in the DNA backbone run in anti-parallel directions to each other . That is , one of the DNA strands is built in the 5 ? 3 direction , while the complementary strand is built in the 3 ? 5 direction . In the DNA backbone , the sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugars . In a double helix , the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 each mark one end of a strand . A strand running in the 5 ? 3 direction that has adenine will pair with base thymine on the complementary strand running in 3 ? 5 direction . <p> Figure 6 : The DNA double helix . The two sides are the sugar-phosphate backbones , composed of alternating phosphate groups and deoxyribose sugars . The nitrogenous bases face the center of the double helix . <p> Figure 7 : The base-pairing nature of DNA . Adenine always pairs with thymine , and they are held together with two hydrogen bonds . The guanine-cytosine base pair is held together with three hydrogen bonds . Note that one sugar-phosphate backbone is in the 5 ? 3 direction , with the other strand in the opposite 3 ? 5 orientation . <p> So it is this four letter code , made of just A , C , G , and T , that determines what the organism will become and what it will look like . How can these four bases carry so much information ? This information results from the order of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique genetic information for each species and each individual . Humans have about 3,000,000,000 bits of this information in each cell . A gorilla may also have close to that amount of information , but a slightly different sequence . For example , the sequence AGGTTTACCA will have different information than CAAGGGATTA . The closer the evolutionary relationship is between two species , the more similar their DNA sequences will be . For example , the DNA sequences between two species of reptiles will be more similar than between a reptile and an elm tree . <p> DNA sequences can be used for scientific , medical , and forensic purposes . DNA sequences can be used to establish evolutionary relationships between species , to determine a persons susceptibility to inherit or develop a certain disease , or to identify crime suspects or victims . Of course , DNA analysis can be used for other purposes as well . So why is DNA so useful for these purposes ? It is useful because every cell in an organism has the same DNA sequence . For this to occur , each cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can so much information be exactly copied in such a small amount of time ? <p> DNA Replication <p> DNA replication is the process in which a cells entire DNA is copied , or replicated . This process occurs during the Synthesis ( S ) phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle . As each DNA strand has the same genetic information , both strands of the double helix can serve as templates for the reproduction of a new strand . The two resulting double helices are identical to the initial double helix . <p> Helicase and Polymerase <p> DNA replication begins as an enzyme , DNA helicase , breaks the hydrogen bonds holding the two strands together and forms a replication fork . The resulting structure has two branching strands of DNA backbone with exposed bases . These exposed bases allow the DNA to be " read " by another enzyme , DNA polymerase , which then builds the complementary DNA strand . As DNA helicase continues to open the double helix , the replication fork grows . $$text5 ? 3$$ <p> The two new strands of DNA are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading strand or a lagging strand . The leading strand is the DNA strand that DNA polymerase constructs in the 5 ? 3 direction . This strand of DNA is made in a continuous manner , moving as the replication fork grows . The lagging strand is the DNA strand at the opposite side of the replication fork from the leading strand . It goes in the opposite direction , from 3 to 5 . DNA polymerase can not build a strand in the 3 ? 5 direction . Thus , this " lagging " strand is synthesized in short segments known as Okazaki fragments . On the lagging strand , an enzyme known as primase builds a short RNA primer . DNA polymerase is then able to use the free 3 OH group on the RNA primer to make DNA in the 5 ? 3 direction . The RNA fragments are then degraded and new DNA nucleotides are added to fill the gaps where the RNA was present . Another enzyme , DNA ligase , is then able to attach ( ligate ) the DNA nucleotides together , completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Figure 8 : DNA replication . The two DNA strands are opened by helicase . The strands are held open by a single strand of binding proteins , preventing premature reannealing . Topoisomerase solves the problem caused by tension generated by winding/unwinding of DNA . This enzyme wraps around DNA and makes a cut permitting the helix to spin and relax . Once DNA is relaxed , topoisomerase reconnects broken strands . DNA primase synthesizes a short RNA primer which initiates the Okazaki fragment . Okazaki fragments are attached by DNA ligase . <p> Many replication forks develop along a chromosome . This process continues until the replication forks meet , and the all of the DNA in a chromosome has been copied . Each new strand that has formed is complementary to the strand used as the template . Each resulting DNA molecule is identical to the original DNA molecule . During prophase of mitosis or prophase I of meiosis , these molecules of DNA condense into a chromosome made of two identical chromatids . This process ensures that cells that result from cell division have identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exact copy of the parent cells DNA . <p> RNA <p> $$textDNA ? RNA ? Protein$$ " DNA makes RNA makes protein . " So what exactly is RNA ? Ribonucleic acid , or RNA , is the other important nucleic acid in the three player act . When we say that " DNA makes RNA makes protein , " what do we mean ? We mean that the information in DNA is somehow transferred into RNA , and that the information in RNA is then used to make the protein . <p> To understand this , it helps to first understand RNA . A gene is a segment of DNA that contains the information necessary to encode an RNA molecule or a protein . Keep in mind that even though you have many thousands of genes , not all are used in every cell type . In fact , probably only a few thousand are used in a particular type of cell , with different cell types using different genes . However , while these genes are embedded in the large chromosomes that never leave the nucleus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information out of the nucleus . <p> RNA Structure <p> RNA structure differs from DNA in three specific ways . Both are nucleic acids and made out of nucleotides ; however , RNA is single stranded while DNA is double stranded . RNA contains the 5-carbon sugar ribose , whereas in DNA , the sugar is deoxyribose . Though both RNA and DNA contain the nitrogenous bases adenine , guanine and cytosine , RNA contains the nitrogenous base uracil instead of thymine . Uracil pairs with adenine in RNA , just as thymine pairs with adenine in DNA . A comparison of RNA and DNA is shown in Table 1 and Figure 9 . <p> Table 1 <p> $$textRNA$$ <p> $$textDNA$$ <p> single stranded <p> double stranded <p> Specific Base <p> contains uracil <p> contains thymine <p> Sugar <p> ribose <p> deoxyribose <p> Size <p> relatively small <p> big ( chromosomes ) <p> Location <p> moves to cytoplasm <p> stays in nucleus <p> Types <p> 3 types : mRNA , tRNA , rRNA <p> generally 1 type <p> Figure 9 : A comparison of RNA and DNA . RNA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thymine . <p> Three Types of RNAs <p> So what does RNA do ? There are three types of RNA : messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , transfer RNA ( tRNA ) , and ribisomal RNA ( rRNA ) . All three of these nucleic acids work together to produce a protein . The mRNA takes the instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , where the ribosomes are located . Ribosomes are where the proteins are made . The ribosomes themselves are made out of rRNA and other proteins . The mRNA binds to the ribosome , bringing the instructions to order the amino acids to the site of protein synthesis . Finally , the tRNA brings the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis ( Figure 10 and Figure 11 ) . In mRNA , the four nucleotides ( A , C , G , and U ) are arranged into codons of three bases each . Each codon encodes for a specific amino acid , except for the stop codons , which terminate protein synthesis . tRNA , which has a specific " 3-leaf clover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticodon , which can base pair to the corresponding three-base codon region on mRNA . More will be discussed on these processes during the lesson on translation that follows . <p> Remember , proteins are made out of amino acids , so how does the information get converted from the language of nucleotides to the language of amino acids ? The process is called translation . <p> Figure 10 : 2-Dimensional tRNA structure depicting the 3-leaf clover structure . The D arm ( D ) is one stem ending in a loop . The anticodon arm ( A ) is a second stem whose loop contains the anticodon on the bottom of the tRNA . The T arm ( T ) is the third stem opposite the D arm . <p> Figure 11 : 3-Dimensional representation of a tRNA . Coloring : CCA tail in orange , Acceptor stem in purple , D arm in red , Anticodon arm in blue with Anticodon in black , and T arm in green . The acceptor stem is made by the base pairing of the 5-terminal nucleotide with the 3-terminal nucleotide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the tRNA molecule , used to attach the amino acid . This sequence is important for the recognition of tRNA by enzymes critical in translation . <p> Small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , microRNA ( miRNA ) and small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ) : siRNA and miRNA are revolutionizing molecular biology , developmental biology , and even medicine . The 2006 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine was awarded to Dr. Andrew Fire and Dr. Craig Mello for their discovery of siRNA , which is a type of double-stranded RNA that inhibits gene expression at the mRNA level . Specifically , siRNA acts on homologous processed mRNA by targeting it for degradation . siRNA is responsible for RNA interference ( RNAi ) . RNAi has a natural role in that it is used by plants in defense against plant viral RNAs. miRNAs are also involved in the regulation of gene expression . They are transcribed but not translated into proteins. snRNAs are found within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells . They are involved in a variety of important processes such as RNA splicing ( removal of introns ) , and regulation of transcription factors .

In many cases , the techniques to solve systems of equations and the laws of exponents must be combined to solve exponential systems of equations . Treating the system like a basic linear system of equations is sometimes a helpful tool as well . <h> Solving by Substitution <p> By " solving by substitution , " we mean that these problems involve making a substitution to reduce an equation to one variable . It is basically the same method as substituting expressions in linear systems , except more algebra is usually required to fully solve the system . <p> Example 1 : Solve this system for ( x ) and ( y ) : <p> $$6y = 36x + 4$$ $$36y = 36x + 6$$ <p> Solution 1 : There are a few different substitutions we can make with a little manipulation .

While there are many scenarios where the Octet Rule does not apply , this relatively short article will only cover one of them . The Duet Rule applies to hydrogen and helium only , but the abundance of hydrogen is so prominent that the rule deserves its own article . For hydrogen and helium , unlike most other elements , a full valence shell consists of two electrons rather than eight . <h> Bonding with Helium <p> Helium atoms have two electrons and two protons . There is only one shell of electrons , the valence shell of two electrons . It is a noble gas and is ths relatively inert . If it needs to gain electrons as part of a bonding sequence , it will need to form a new valence shell further away from the nucleus than the old one . That said , any bizarre bonding patterns with helium are not sufficiently practical or simple to be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helium can form a single bond with fluorine , but this is a very unstable configuration as the helium atom will then have one unpaired electron . <h> Ionic Bonding with Hydrogen <p> When hydrogen participates in ionic bonding , it wil always be the anion . This group of comounds are called metal hydrides . In them , hydrogen atoms gain one electron and become hydride ions , ( H- ) . <p> Example 1 : Sodium hydride is ( NaH ) . Sodium most easily gets a full octet by losing one valence electron , so the sodium ion is ( Na+ ) , so it bonds with hydride ions in a 1:1 ratio . <p> Example 2 : Magnesium hydride is ( MgH2 ) . Magnesium tends to form ( +2 ) cations most easily as this requries the transfer of the fewest electrons .

Thus magnesium hydride is ( MgH2 ) . <h> Covalent Bonding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms covalent bonds , but the two valence electrons that are used will always be shared with another atom through a covalent bond .

Recall that hydrogen atoms have one valence electron unbonded and chlorine has seven . Thus each atom can contribute one electron to a bonding pair , and now hydrogen has two shared valence electrons and chlorine has a full octet ! Thus this is a stable molecule .

In most wind instruments , a vibration that the player makes at the mouthpiece is picked up and amplified and given a pleasant timbre by the air inside the tube-shaped body of the instrument . The shape and length of the inside of the tube give the sound wave its pitch as well as its timbre . <p> You will find below a discussion of what makes standing waves in a tube , wind instruments and the harmonic series , and the types of tubes that can be used in musical instruments . This is a simplified discussion to give you a basic idea of what 's going on inside a wind instrument . Mathematical equations are avoided , and all the complications - for example , what happens to the wave when there are closed finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually , the physics of what happens inside real wind instruments is so complex that physicists are still studying it , and still do n't have all the answers . If you want a more in-depth or more technical discussion , there are some recommendations below . <h> What Makes the Standing Waves in a Tube <p> Instruments produce musical tones by trapping waves of specific lengths in the instrument . It 's pretty easy to see why the standing waves on a string can only have certain lengths ; since the ends of the strings are held in place , there has to be a node in the wave at each end . But what is it that makes only certain standing waves possible in a tube of air ? <p> To understand that , you 'll have to understand a little bit about what makes waves in a tube different from waves on a string . Waves on a string are transverse waves . The string is stretched out in one direction ( call it " up and down " ) , but when it 's vibrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction ( call it " back and forth " ) . At the nodes ( each end , for example ) , there is no back and forth motion , but in between the nodes , the string is moving back and forth very rapidly . The term for this back-and-forth motion is displacement . There is no displacement at a node ; the most displacement happens at an antinode . <p> Figure 1 : Transverse Motion on a String <p> The standing waves of air in a tube are not transverse waves . Like all sound waves , they are longitudinal . So if the air in the tube is moving in a certain direction ( call it " left and right " ) , the vibrations in the air are going in that same direction ( in this case , they are rushing " left and right " ) . <p> But they are like the waves on a string in some important ways . Since they are standing waves , there are still nodes - in this case , places where the air is not rushing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in between the nodes there are antinodes , where the displacement is largest ( the air is moving back and forth the most ) . And when one antinode is going in one direction ( left ) , the antinodes nearest it will be going in the other direction ( right ) . So , even though what is happening is very different , the end result of standing waves " trapped " in a tube will be very much like the end result of standing waves " trapped " on a string : a harmonic series based on the tube length . <p> First , let 's talk about why only some standing waves will " fit " in a tube of a particular length . If the tube were closed on both ends , it 's easy to see that this would be a lot like the wave on the string . The air would not be able to rush back and forth at the ends , so any wave trapped inside this tube would have to have nodes at each end . <p> NOTE : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth in some places and standing still in other places , so most of the figures below use a common illustration method , showing the longitudinal waves as if they are simultaneously the two maximum positions of a transverse wave . <p> Figure 2 : The standing waves inside the tube represent back-and-forth motion of the air . Since the air ca n't move through the end of the tube , a closed tube must have a node at each end , just like a string held at both ends . <p> Now , a closed tube would n't make a very good musical instrument ; it would n't be very loud . Most of the sound you hear from an instrument is not the standing wave inside the tube ; the sound is made at the open ends where the standing waves manage to create other waves that can move away from the instrument . Physicists sometimes study the acoustics of a tube closed at both ends ( called a Kundt tube ) , but most wind instruments have at least one open end . An instrument that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just an open tube instrument . An instrument that is only open at one end may be called open-closed , or a closed tube or stopped tube instrument ( or sometimes semi-closed or half-closed ) . This is a little confusing , since such instruments ( trumpets , for example ) still obviously have one open end . <p> Now , there 's nothing stopping the air from rushing back and forth at the open end of the tube . In fact , the waves that " fit " the tube are the ones that have antinodes at the open end , so the air is in fact rushing back and forth there , causing waves ( at the same frequency as the standing wave ) that are not trapped in the instrument but can go out into the room . <p> Figure 3 : Open-Open and Open-Closed Tubes . There must be a ( displacement ) antinode at any open end of a tube . <p> What is it that requires the waves to have an antinode at an open end ? Look again at the animation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave . The air at the nodes is not moving back and forth , but it is piling up and spreading out again . So the air pressure is changing a lot at the nodes . But at the antinodes , the air is moving a lot , but it is moving back and forth , not piling up and spreading out . In fact , you can imagine that same wave to be an air pressure wave instead of an air displacement wave . It really is both at the same time , but the pressure wave nodes are at the same place as the displacement antinodes , and the pressure antinodes are at the same place as the displacement nodes . <p> Figure 4 : An air displacement wave is also an air pressure wave . The nodes of the displacement wave , where the air is not rushing back-and-forth but is doing the most **27;347;TOOLONG , are the antinodes of the pressure wave . The antinodes of the displacement wave , where the air is rushing back-and-forth the most , but is not piling up or spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave . Both waves must have exactly the same frequency , of course ; they are actually just two aspects of the same sound wave . <p> At an open end of the tube , there is nothing to stop the air rushing in and out , and so it does . What the air can not do at the open end is build up any pressure ; there is nothing for the air to build up against , and any drop in pressure will just bring air rushing in from outside the tube . So the air pressure at an open end must remain the same as the air pressure of the room . In other words , that end must have a pressure node ( where the air pressure does n't change ) and ( therefore ) a displacement antinode . <p> NOTE : Since being exposed to the air pressure outside the instrument is what is important , the " open end " of a wind instrument , as far as the sound waves are concerned , is the first place that they can escape - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the wave , and the pitch of the note . <h> Harmonic Series in Tubes <p> The standing waves in a tube must have a ( displacement ) node at a closed end and an antinode at an open end . In an open-open tube , this leads to a harmonic series very similar to a harmonic series produced on a string that 's held at both ends . The fundamental , the lowest note possible in the tube , is the note with a wavelength twice the length of the tube ( or string ) . The next possible note has twice the frequency ( half the wavelength ) of the fundamental , the next three times the frequency , the next four times , and so on . <p> Figure 5 : Allowed Waves in an Open Tube . These are the first four harmonics allowed in an open tube . Any standing wave with a displacement antinode at both ends is allowed , but the lower harmonics are usually the easiest to play and the strongest harmonics in the timbre . <p> But things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end and open at the other . The lowest note that you might be able to get on such a tube ( a fundamental that is unplayable on many instruments ) has a wavelength four times the length of the tube . ( You may notice that this means that a stopped tube will get a note half the frequency - an octave lower - than an open tube of the same length . ) The next note that is possible on the half-closed tube has three times the frequency of the fundamental , the next five times , and so on . In other words , a stopped tube can only play the odd-numbered harmonics . <p> Figure 6 : Allowed Wavelengths in a Stopped Tube . Again , these are the lowest ( lowest pitch and lowest frequency ) four harmonics allowed . Any wave with a displacement node at the closed end and antinode at the open end is allowed . Note that this means only the odd-numbered harmonics " fit " . <p> REMINDER : All of the transverse waves in Figure 2 , Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displacement waves , as shown in Figure 7 . All of the harmonics would be happening in the tube at the same time , and , for each harmonic , the displacement ( Figure 7 ) and pressure waves ( Figure 8 ) are just two different ways of representing the same wave . <p> Figure 7 : Displacement Waves . Here are the first three possible harmonics in a closed-open tube shown as longitudinal displacement waves . <p> Figure 8 : Pressure Waves . Here are those same three waves shown as pressure waves . <h> Basic Wind Instrument Tube Types <p> The previous section shows why only the odd-numbered harmonics " fit " in a cylinder-shaped tube , but that is not the whole story . There is one other tube shape that works well for wind instruments , and it abides by slightly different rules . <p> Just as on a string , the actual wave inside the instrument is a complex wave that includes all of those possible harmonics . A cylinder makes a good musical instrument because all the waves in the tube happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the player overblows in order to get more notes . As mentioned above , woodwind players get different notes out of their instruments by opening and closing finger holes , making the standing wave tube longer or shorter . Once the player has used all the holes , higher notes are played by overblowing , which causes the next higher harmonic of the tube to sound . In other words , the fundamental of the tube is not heard when the player " overblows " ; the note heard is the pitch of the next available harmonic ( either harmonic two or three ) . Brass players can get many different harmonics from their instruments , and so do not need as many fingerings . <p> For most possible tube shapes , a new set of holes would be needed to get notes that are in tune with the lower set of notes . But a couple of shapes , including the cylinder , give higher notes that are basically in tune with the lower notes using the same finger holes ( or valves ) . ( Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve is sometimes necessary for good tuning . ) One other possible shape is basically not used because it would be difficult to build precisely and unwieldy to play . ( Basically , it has to flare rapidly , at a very specific rate of flare . The resulting instrument would be unwieldy and impractical . ) <p> Figure 9 : The two shapes that are useful for real wind instruments are the cylinder and the cone . Most real wind instruments are a combination of cylindrical and conical sections , but most act as ( and can be classified as ) either cylindrical bore or conical bore instruments . <p> The other tube shape that is often used in wind instruments is the cone . In fact , most real wind instruments are tubes that are some sort of combination of cylindrical and conical tubes . But most can be classified as either cylindrical or conical instruments . <p> The really surprising thing is that stopped-tube instruments that are basically conical act as if they are open-tube cylindrical instruments , proven mathematically by others . <p> Compare , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar mouthpieces . Both instruments , like any basic woodwind , have enough finger holes and keys to play all the notes within an octave . To get more notes , a woodwind player overblows , blowing hard enough to sound the next harmonic of the instrument . For the saxophone , a very conical instrument , the next harmonic is the next octave ( two times the frequency of the fundamental ) , and the saxophonist can continue up this next octave by essentially repeating the fingerings for the first octave . Only a few extra keys are needed to help with tuning . <p> The clarinet player does n't have it so easy . Because the clarinet is a very cylindrical instrument , the next harmonic available is three times the frequency , or an octave and a fifth higher , than the fundamental . Extra holes and keys have to be added to the instrument to get the notes in that missing fifth , and then even more keys are added to help the clarinetist get around the awkward fingerings that can ensue . Many notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingerings based on tuning and ease of motion as they change notes . <p> So why bother with cylindrical instruments ? Remember that an actual note from any instrument is a very complex sound wave that includes lots of harmonics . The pitch that we hear when a wind instrument plays a note is ( usually ) the lowest harmonic that is being produced in the tube at the time . The higher harmonics produce the timbre , or sound color , of the instrument . A saxophone-shaped instrument simply ca n't get that odd-harmonics clarinet sound . <p> The shapes and sounds of the instruments that are popular today are the result of centuries of trial-and-error experimentation by instrument-makers . Some of them understood something of the physics involved , but the actual physics of real instruments - once you add sound holes , valves , keys , mouthpieces , and bells - are incredibly complex , and theoretical physicists are still studying the subject and making new discoveries .

@@119689287 @8689287/ <h> Classifying Musical Instruments 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To explain the different instruments and the classification system for all musical instruments 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> There are two common ways to classify musical instruments . One way is to group them as they are in a Western orchestra : strings , woodwinds , brass , and percussion . This method is more widely recognized , particularly among non-musicians , and it is very useful in its traditional setting , Western classical and art music . However , it is difficult or confusing to apply to the many non-orchestral instruments . <p> The other way , first published in 1914 by Erich von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs , is to group instruments according to how their sounds are produced . This method can be used to classify any instrument and is now preferred by most musicologists . The Hornbostel-Sachs method is more specific , more inclusive , and more accurate : <p> More specific - Categories are subdivided into smaller and smaller categories , making a sort of family tree of related instruments ( related by function , not by history ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> More accurate - Instruments are grouped according to how sounds are produced , not according to which instruments the composer is likely to group them with in the music or which orchestra member is likely to play them . <p> The major categories are chordophones , aerophones , membranophones , and idiophones . Some musicologists also include a separate category for electrophones . Here is an introduction to the major groups in each of these categories . Familiar instruments in each category are mentioned when possible ; some categories , while very popular around the world , will not have any specific instruments that are widely familiar . <h> Chordophones <p> In a chordophone , the sound is made by vibrating strings . The main groups of chordophones are classified according to the relationship between the strings and the resonator . ( Resonators pick up the original vibrations and vibrate sympathetically with them , amplifying the original sounds and altering them so that they sound more musical . ) Subcategories depend on how the string is played ( plucked or bowed for example ) , and types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a plucked lute chordophone . <p> Figure 2 : Harps are one of the main subcategories of chordophone . <p> Chordophone Categories <p> In zithers , the strings are stretched across , over , or inside a resonator , or between two resonators . The resonator can be a hollow tube , a gourd , a board , a hollow box , or even a pit in the ground . Some have fingerboards with or without frets ; some have a keyboard with a complex mechanism ; many are simply a multitude of strings strung from one end of the resonator to the other . The strings can be struck ( as in a piano or hammered dulcimer ) or plucked ( harpsichord or Appalachian dulcimer ) . <p> In lutes , the strings stretch across the resonator and up a neck . They may be plucked ( guitar , banjo ) or bowed ( violin , fiddle ) <p> In lyres , the strings leave the resonator at right angles to an edge and run to a cross bar that is held away from the resonator ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a symbol of music ) . <p> In harps ( like the orchestral harp and the Irish harp ) , the strings leave the resonator at a slant ( smaller than a right angle ) up to a neck connected to the resonator . <p> In a musical bow , the string or strings are stretched from one end of a wooden bow to the other . Some have resonators , but many do n't . They can be plucked or bowed ( with a second , smaller bow ) . <p> Figure 3 : Basic Chordophone Types . <h> Aerophones <p> In aerophones , the sound is produced by vibrating air ( usually inside the instrument ) . The instrument , or parts of the instrument , are shaped ( often into a tube or set of tubes ) so that the vibrations will be a particular length , and so a particular pitch . Aerophones are grouped according to what causes the air to begin vibrating . <p> Figure 4 : The melodeon , like its close relatives the accordion and the concertina , is a free-reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air is blown at a sharp edge in the instrument ( as in recorders as well as police whistles ) . <p> In blowhole instruments , the air is blown across the sharp edge at the blowhole . When the instrument is tube-shaped , the blowhole can be in the end ( " end-blown " , as in panpipes ) , or in the side of the instrument ( " side-blown " , as in a fife ) . <p> In reed instruments , the vibration of a reed or reeds begins the air vibration . In single reed ( saxophone , for example ) and double reed ( oboe ) instruments , the one or two reeds are part of the mouthpiece . In bagpipes and in free-reed instruments ( such as harmonica and accordion ) , the single or double reeds are mounted somewhere inside the instrument and there can be many of them - sometimes a different reed for every pitch . <p> In cup mouthpiece instruments , the player buzzes the lips against the mouthpiece , causing a sympathetic vibration in the air inside the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes of an organ have a sharp edge like a whistle , but the pipes are filled with air from something other than a mouth or nose , usually a bellows of some sort . <p> Free aerophones ( bull-roarers , toy spinning tops ) , cause vibrations in the air around them rather than inside them . <h> Membranophones <p> In membranophones , the sound begins with the vibration of a stretched membrane , or skin ( often an actual animal skin ) , but the skin is usually stretched across a resonator . Membranophones are usually classified according to the shape of the resonating body of the instrument . <p> Figure 5 : Membranophones are classified by their basic shape . <p> Figure 6 : A drum that is wider at top and bottom than in the middle is a waisted tubular drum . <p> Membranophone Categories <p> Tubular drums are divided into cylindrical , conical , barrel , long , waisted ( hourglass-shaped ) , goblet ( with a stem at the base ) , and footed ( with feet around the edge of the bottom ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In frame drums , the membrane is stretched over a frame , usually making a wide , shallow instrument . ( Tamborines are in this category . ) <p> Friction drums come in a variety of shapes . Instead of beating on the membrane , the player runs a stick through a hole in the membrane . <p> In mirlitons , the membrane is made to vibrate by blowing air across it . These are the only membranophones that are not drums . ( Kazoos are in this category . ) <h> Idiophones <p> In idiophones , it is the vibration of the instrument itself that is the main source of the musical sound . Idiophones are classified according to what you do to them to make them vibrate . <p> Figure 7 : Bells and steel drums are percussion idiophones . A bell is hit by the clapper inside the bell . <p> Concussion idiophones are played by clashing two of them together ( castanets , claves , spoons ) . <p> Friction idiophones are made to vibrate by rubbing them ( as when you make a wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiophones are played by scraping a stick across a set of notches or corrugations on the instrument ( guiro , washboard ) . <p> Stamping idiophones are stamped on the ground , floor , or hard surface . ( Tap shoes are in this category . ) <p> If the main sound is coming from the surface that is being stamped on , it is a stamped idiophone . <p> Plucked idiophones have a thin tongue of metal or bamboo that vibrates when plucked ( jew 's harp , mbira or thumb piano ) . <h> Electrophones <p> An instrument that is not amplified electrically is an acoustic instrument . There are instruments ( such as the electric-acoustic guitar , vibraphone , and electric saxophone ) that keep their acoustic resonators but are also amplified and altered electronically . Actually any instrument sound that has been through a microphone and amplifier , or even been saved as a recording , belongs in this category . These instruments are probably best categorized as they would be before being amplified . <p> There are also a large number of instruments that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are played by some mechanical mechanism instead of by a person . ( Music boxes , player pianos , and carillons are in this category . ) Electric instruments ( electric guitar , electric bass ) rely on electronics instead of a resonator to amplify and alter the sound . These hybrid instruments may be categorized as mechanical or electric instruments , or they may be classified according to how the sound is produced before it is amplified ( electric guitar is still a plucked lute chordophone , for example , or perhaps simply an electric chordophone ) or after the mechanism causes it to play ( carillons are percussion idiophones - bells ) . <p> But there are some instruments that are true electrophones ; their sound is both produced and amplified by electronic circuits . ( This group includes the electric organ , synthesizer , and theremin . ) <p> Figure 9 : The sound of an electric guitar begins with a string , but is modified and amplified electronically . Is it a chordophone , an electrophone , or both ? 
@@119689291 @8689291/ <h> Hydrogen and Helium : The Duet Rule 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Every rule has its exception , and that goes for the Octet Rule as well . While there are many scenarios where the Octet Rule does not apply , this relatively short article will only cover one of them . The Duet Rule applies to hydrogen and helium only , but the abundance of hydrogen is so prominent that the rule deserves its own article . For hydrogen and helium , unlike most other elements , a full valence shell consists of two electrons rather than eight . <h> Bonding with Helium <p> Helium atoms have two electrons and two protons . There is only one shell of electrons , the valence shell of two electrons . It is a noble gas and is ths relatively inert . If it needs to gain electrons as part of a bonding sequence , it will need to form a new valence shell further away from the nucleus than the old one . That said , any bizarre bonding patterns with helium are not sufficiently practical or simple to be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helium can form a single bond with fluorine , but this is a very unstable configuration as the helium atom will then have one unpaired electron . <h> Ionic Bonding with Hydrogen <p> When hydrogen participates in ionic bonding , it wil always be the anion . This group of comounds are called metal hydrides . In them , hydrogen atoms gain one electron and become hydride ions , ( H- ) . <p> Example 1 : Sodium hydride is ( NaH ) . Sodium most easily gets a full octet by losing one valence electron , so the sodium ion is ( Na+ ) , so it bonds with hydride ions in a 1:1 ratio . <p> Example 2 : Magnesium hydride is ( MgH2 ) . Magnesium tends to form ( +2 ) cations most easily as this requries the transfer of the fewest electrons . As we discussed earlier , hydride ions have a ( -1 ) charge , so we need two of them to balance out the charge of one magnesium cation . Thus magnesium hydride is ( MgH2 ) . <h> Covalent Bonding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms covalent bonds , but the two valence electrons that are used will always be shared with another atom through a covalent bond . A single bonding pair is all hydrogen needs to get its duet , so it typically does not form double or triple bonds . <p> Example 3 : Hydrogen monochloride , a.k.a. hydrochloric acid , is one hydrogen atom bonded with one chlorine atom . Recall that hydrogen atoms have one valence electron unbonded and chlorine has seven . Thus each atom can contribute one electron to a bonding pair , and now hydrogen has two shared valence electrons and chlorine has a full octet ! Thus this is a stable molecule . Its Lewis Structure is depicted below .

The second solution goes straight into graphing both functions on the same set of axes and comparing them visually . Either method can be used , though the second solution , using graphing , is by far the quicker of the two . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Algebraically <p> To determine the peak height of Brett 's baseball versus Andre 's baseball , we wish to compare the maximums of the two functions . Algebraically , there are several ways to approach finding the maximum ( ( h ) -coordinate of the vertex ) of Brett 's height function , ( h(t) ) . <p> So , we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and so Brett 's baseball reaches a maximum height of ( frac662564approx 103.52 ) , or approximately 104 feet from the ground . <p> Note that the vertex occurs at LONG ... which matches the known formula ( t=-fracb2a ) where ( b ) is the coefficient on ( t ) and ( a ) is the coefficient on ( t2 ) . If this formula was already known , we could have found ( h(t) ) for this ( t ) -value instead of converting the function into vertex form : LONG ... or approximately 104 feet above the ground . <p> We can also find the ( t ) -coordinate of the vertex by determining the midway point between the two roots of ( h(t) ) . Setting ( h(t)=0 ) and using the quadratic formula , we have $$0=-16t2+79t+6$$ $$implies LONG ... $$implies t=frac-79pmsqrt6625-32$$ $$implies tapprox 5.01 mbox and tapprox -0.07$$ To find the midway point between these two numbers , we average them . $$frac5.01+ ( -0.07 ) 2=2.47$$ This is the same ( t ) -coordinate we found above , and similarly we evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throw at approximately 104 feet . <p> Looking at the graph of the height of Andre 's baseball , we see that his throw does not even get higher than 80 feet off the ground . So , Brett 's baseball went higher . <p> We know that each boy let go of his baseball at ( t=0 ) seconds . To determine how long each ball was airborne , we need to find the number of seconds , or the ( t ) -coordinates , when the height of the ball , ( h(t) ) , is 0 . <p> For Brett , we set his function equal to 0 and determine values of ( t ) that make it true . To do this , ( if not already done in part ( a ) ) we can use the quadratic formula . $$0=-16t2+79t+6$$ $$implies LONG ... $$implies t=frac-79pmsqrt6625-32$$ $$implies tapprox 5.01 mbox and tapprox -0.07$$ Interpreting these two answers , this means that Brett 's ball has a height of 0 feet at approximately ( -0.07 ) and at ( 5.01 ) seconds . Negative seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brett first threw the ball is considered 0 seconds , and so we see that Brett 's baseball was airborne for about 5 seconds . <p> Looking at Andre 's graph , we see that the ball left his hands at ( t=0 ) , and then returned to the ground ( i.e. had a height of 0 ) at approximately ( t=4.2 ) . So , Andre 's baseball was airborne for about 4.2 seconds . <p> By graphing Brett 's height function on the same axes as Andre 's height , we arrive at the following graph : Here , we can clearly see that Brett 's throw went higher , as his graph reaches a greater ( h ) -value , and that his ball is airborne for longer , as his graph " touches down " on the ( t ) -axis after Andre 's . This supports the conclusions we came to in parts ( a ) and ( b ) . <p> Solution : Graphically <p> Alternatively , we can determine which function has the greatest maximum by graphing ( h(t) ) on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height function , and visually comparing the heights of the vertices . Clearly , we can see here that Brett 's throw reached a maximum height of over 100 feet , while Andre 's throw did not reach above 80 feet .

" Both boys let go of their baseballs at ( t=0 ) seconds . Andre 's graph touches the ( t ) -axis next at about 4.2 , so his baseball was airborne for about 4.2 seconds .

In terms of the numbers ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) what formula will Amy and Greg find for the number of leaves on the tree ? <h> Commentary <p> Teachers who use this version of the task will need to bring tree leaves ( or prepare a good sketch of a tree leaf ) to class so that they can work on and discuss how to approximate the area of an irregular shape like a leaf . The estimated number of leaves on the tree will depend highly on the size of those leaves . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be expected to have far more leaves than a comparable sized maple tree . Note that the answer in part ( b ) of the question will depend on the leaves which the teacher chooses to bring to class or sketch . This is indicated in the solution below . As with ' ' How many leaves on a tree ( version 1 ) ' ' the focus should be on the thought that goes into the model and making sure that the mathematics is then correctly executed . <p> In this problem , the variables ( a , b , c , ) and ( d ) are introduced to represent important quantities for this esimate : students should all understand where the formula in the solution for the number of leaves comes from . Estimating the values of these variables is much trickier and the teacher should expect and allow a wide range of variation here . The trickiest of the variables to estimate are ( c ) and ( d ) . At different parts of the tree ( near the trunk versus near the perimeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given spot may vary substantially and the students should choose a representative value and explain their choice . The type of tree under study will greatly influence how difficult these numbers are to estimate : for a maple tree , the leaves are pretty uniformly distributed throughout so this makes ( c ) and ( d ) easier to estimate . <p> Students who do n't believe that ( 1,000,000 ) leaves on a tree is a reasonable number should consult the following : <p> The reasoning here shows some of the issues which students hopefully thought of in working through this problem . <p> While it seems unlikely , after working through this task and its predecessor , that this particular maple tree has ( 1,000,000 ) leaves it would not be surprising at all for a much larger tree , say in a tropical rain forest , to have well over ( 1,000,000 ) leaves . <p> There are many ways of trying to visualize or grasp a large number such as ( 1,000,000 ) . For example , an average piece of paper is about ( 0.004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be about $$ 1,000,000 times 0.004 = 4,000 $$ inches thick . This is ( frac4,00012 = frac10003 ) feet so a little over the length of a football field . A page on a book contains about ( 40 ) lines , each with about ( 80 ) characters so this is about ( 40 times 80 = 3,200 ) characters per page . So in a ( 300 ) page book there are close to ( 1,000,000 ) characters . Of course these numbers will differ depending on the book but certainly finding a book with ( 1,000,000 ) characters will not be difficult . <p> Usually , in order for one quantity to be ( 1,000,000 ) times as large as another , either the smaller quantity is very small or the larger quantity is very large . The leaves on this tree fall short of ( 1,000,000 ) but the choice of a tree is a reasonable one because the leaves are large enough to easily grasp while the tree as a whole is not so colossal as to exceed what we can easily imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves on a tree would be to weigh a small number of leaves to find an estimate for the average weight of a leaf and then weigh a trash bag full of leaves to see about how many leaves fill a trash bag . Then over the course of the autumn as the leaves fall and are raked up and disposed of , an estimate for the number of bags of leaves on the tree could be found . The downside to this method is that it does not take account of the leaves that blow away and it can only be executed over a longer period of time . Moreover , the weight of the leaves will be variable depending on how much of the water inside of them has evaporated so this method requires a whole new set of variables for consideration . <h> Solutions 212257 @qwx1072257 <p> A circle of diameter ( 30 ) feet has a radius of ( 15 ) feet and an area of $$ pi times 152 , , , mboxfeet2. $$ This is a little over ( 700 ) square feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be measured in square inches in part ( b ) , we will have to convert one of these two measurements . We have <p> So ( 100,000 ) square inches would be a good estimate for the amount of ground shaded by this tree . <p> A good method would be to divide the leaf into a relatively small number of shapes such as rectangles and triangles for which the area can be found using algebraic formulas . As more and more smaller shapes are used to approximate the area of the leaf , the approximation will improve . Since there are many assumptions which go into the estimate for the number of leaves on a tree , it is not necessary to get an extremely accurate estimate for the area of an individual leaf . <p> A second good method ( requiring a scale or balance ) would be to make a paper cut out of the leaf . If the cutout weighs ( x ) grams and one square inch of the same paper weighs ( y ) grams then the approximate area of the leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here will vary considerably depending on the kind of tree leaves being examined . Maple tree leaves could easily be ( 12 ) square inches in area or more while willow tree leaves could be a little less than ( 1 ) square inch . <p> For Greg 's idea , this is likely the hardest step to perform with precision . For some trees , like weeping willows , the leaves tend to lie with relatively little of their surface area facing in the vertical direction . For a maple tree , on the other hand , the leaves lie in a variety of directions . So for this part of the estimate a larger multiple will be needed for the willow tree than for the maple ( though this will be compensated for by the fact that the willow tree let 's more light through than a maple tree ) . <p> The second part of this idea is also delicate , namely estimating the number of leaves which lie over a given point underneath the tree . A good way to estimate this would be to count the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) which lie over that point . Then a few branches could be studied closely to arrive at an estimate . For example , perhaps there are about ten small branches lying over a point on the surface . Studying one of these closely , it appears to shade only about half of the area underneath it . This would lead to an estimate of ( 5 ) for the number of leaves lying over that point on the ground . <p> To fix ideas more precisely , suppose the tree in question is a maple tree and at a few places , looking up and counting the branches overhead we come up with about ( 10 ) . The leaves are relatively thick and cover about ( frac12 ) of the ground below . This would mean that we have an estimate of ( 5 ) leaves overhead for a given point . As to how much of the area of an average maple leaf will show in its shadow below the tree , suppose our estimate is ( frac12 ) . This data is then used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaves on this maple tree . <p> Note that the number of leaves over a given spot underneath the tree might vary considerably because the shape of the canopy of the tree is not cylindrical and so there will tend to be more leaves covering the area near the tree trunk . The best one can do is to try to estimate at several different places under the tree and make the best possible overall estimate . <p> First we go through the estimates for the data associated to the maple tree in parts ( b ) and ( c ) . From part ( a ) , the tree shades about ( 100,000 ) square inches . An average leaf is ( 12 ) square inches but only shades half of this or ( 6 ) square inches . This gives an estimate of about ( frac100,0006 ) leaves . But this needs to multiplied by the factor of ( 5 ) leaves lying over a given point on the ground . So we get an overall estimate of $$ frac5 times 100,0006 $$ leaves or a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the variables introduced in the problem , there are about ( d ) leaves on average above the area shaded by the tree . The average area of the leaves is ( b ) and ( c ) represents the fraction of the ground shaded by an average leaf . With this data , the estimate for the number of leaves on this tree is $$ fraca times dbc. $$ To understand this formula , note that the total amount of ground shaded by all of the leaves is ( a ) but since there are on average ( d ) leaves over a given point this means that we could spread out the leaves to cover an area of ( a times d ) . The denominator , ( bc ) , is the average area shaded by an individual leaf on the tree . Dividing the total area shaded by all leaves by the average area shaded by each leaf gives the number of leaves on the tree . <p> If the tree only covers a fraction , say ( e ) , of the ground below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a factor in the numerator : $$ fraca times d times ebc. $$ 
@@119689316 @8689316/ <h> Ions Dissolving and Dissociating in Aqueous Solution 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> When a chemical dissolves , its molecules or formula units ( depending on the chemical ) separate from each other and immerse themself in the chemical which dissolved them . In aqueous solutions , that chemical is water . Some chemicals also dissociate--they are broken into their component ions , if there are any . In this article we will explore dissociativity in relation to a chemical 's electrolytic qualities , and show how this relates to other key properties of chemicals . <h> What is an Electrolyte ? <p> An electrolyte is a substance that , once dissolved , is able to perform electrical work . Place two wires connected to a lightbulb on both ends into your solution . The brightness of the lightbulb gives you the strength of the electrolyte . However , there is a more theoretical way to classify chemicals based on their electrolytic quality . An electrolyte can perform electrical work because the chemical dissociates into ions--some of these are anions which have excess electrons . The anions will attempt to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as they are not in close proximity to cations ( in which case the cations and anions will form the original chemical ) . These free electrons travel through the wire and power the lightbulb . Chemicals that do not have this ability are called nonelectrolytes . When nonelectrolytes are dissolved in water , the molecules remain intact , seemingly impervious to attractive forces with different ends of the water molecule . <h> Strong Electrolyte vs . Weak Electrolyte <p> There are actually two different types of electrolytes . A strong electrolyte completely dissociates into its component ions , leaving none of the original solute . Weak electrolytes , however , only partially dissociate into component ions--some molecules of the original chemical will still float around in the solution . Note that all ionic compounds are strong electrolytes . Molecular , or colvantly-bonded compounds , are almost all either weak electrolytes or nonelectrolytes , except for acids , which are also strong electrolytes . There is no " magic " rule for differentiating between weak electrolytes and nonelectrolytes . <p> Example 1 : Is ( Cr(OH)3 ) a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it is an electrolyte , write out the ions it dissociates into . <p> Solution : Note that Chromium ( III ) hydroxide is an ionic compound , so it completely dissociates into ions in aqueous solution and is thus a strong electrolyte . The ions formed are the cation and anion that comprise this compound ; those are ( Cr3+ ) cations and ( OH- ) anions , respectively . <h> The Intermolecular Forces Explanation of Electrolytes <p> The idea of why some compounds dissociate in water more easily than others can be explained using the concepts of intermolecular forces . Note that intermolecular forces are sometimes taught well after aqueous solutions are introduced , so you , as the student or teacher , may opt to skip this section for now . <p> Here is a copy of the Lewis Structure for water , the solvent in all solutions being covered here : <p> Now , oxygen has a greater electronegativity than hydrogen , which means that in a hydrogen-oxygen bond , the electrons shared between the two atoms are more attracted to the oxygen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( less than the charge of an electron ) and the hydrogen acquires a slight partial positive charge . Thus the hydrogen end of the molecule will be more attracted to anions , and the oxygen end of the molecule will be more attracted to cations . Thus you can see why ionic compounds tend to be " ripped apart " in water . The attractive forces between the hydrogen atoms and the ionic compound 's anion alongside the attractive forces between the oxygen atoms and the ionic compound 's cation exceed the strength of the attractive force that holds the ionic compound together . In nonelectrolytes , the forces holding the atoms of the original solute exceed the strength of any attractive forces between ends of the solute and ends of the water molecule . In weak electrolytes , all of the aforementioned attractive forces are more equal in strength . At this point , the decision as to whether an individual molecule gets ripped apart depends on its proximity to the water molecules . <p> Example 2 : Chromium ( III ) hydroxide , as discussed in Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are attracted to the oxygen atoms in the water , and the hydroxide anions are attracted to the hydrogen atoms in the water molecules . <p> This particular diagram is actually very helpful , because it illustrates that some of the oxygen atoms in this polyatomic anion have negative charges.Thus these oxygen atoms will be attracted to the hydrogen atoms in the water . However , all other parts of the anion have a neutral charge , so the oxygen atoms in the water molecules will not be attracted to or repelled to any atoms in particular . Obviously this is not a strong electrolyte , but keep in mind two things for this particular example : <p> I. It is not important whether this is a weak electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte . It is more important to be able to analyze the intermolecular forces between atoms and see why it is not a strong electrolyte . <p> II . As this is an anion , it was likely initially accompanied by a cation as it entered the water solvent . For instance , if this cation was magnesium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong electrolyte because it is an ionic compound . The magnesium and dichromate ions will separate before any intermolecular forces between the dichromate ions and the water molecules can take place . <p> Dissociability and Electrolytic Properties are one example of taking a big-picture approach to chemistry . While it is important to be able to identify electrolytes and how they are defined , also remember how the use of other topics in chemistry can make this topic much more clear . <p> Resources <p> Thanks to WolframAlpha for allowing use of this widget : LONG ...

This module will discuss the social and political order of Europe following the black plague , the Enlightenment and the Reformation . At the end of the module you should be able to explain how European culture developed , and how changes in social order and scientific thought affected Europeans . <h> Out of the Darkness <h> Early Modern Europe <p> When it comes to history , historians often find it easiest to break the past up into smaller sections , and even smaller subsections within them . That makes understanding the past much easier to manage . In this way history works much like a puzzle , with historians putting all the pieces together to form the larger picture . When it comes to understanding the history of Europe , the best place to start is with the period of history known as the Early Modern Period . The Early Modern Period refers to the centuries between the end of the Middle Ages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century to the 18th ) . It was during this period that the Europe of the Middle Ages began resembling the world we see today . It was a period of great social and political change and set the gears in motion which would carry the world on its path to the present . <p> New Terms <p> Early Modern Period : The period of European history beginning after the Middle Ages encompassing the centuries between around 1450 to 1750 <p> Middle Ages : The Middle Ages or Medieval Period refers to the period of European history which spanned from roughly the 5th century to the 15th century <p> Industrial Revolution : The Industrial Revolution refers to the period rapid technological innovation and mechanization which occurred between 1760 and 1840 . During these years European cultures underwent significant amounts of social change including the restructuring of societies around factory work instead of agriculture , a rapid increase in the population and living standards and the mechanization of manufacturing and industry . For more information on the Industrial Revolution see the Industrial Revolution section . ( Coming Soon ) <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe had been ravaged by one of the worst pandemics known in history " the Black Death . During its peak years in Europe between 1348 and 1350 the plague is estimated to have killed some 75 to 200 million people . By the time the plague was finally brought under control historians believe it caused the deaths of 30 to 60 percent of the European population . As such by the 1500 's the population of Europe is estimated to have been only about 61 million . Of that population the average life expectancy was around 40 years , provided you survived past the age of 10 . Infant mortality rates at the time were at an excess of 30% and the fertility rate was extremely low . <p> One of the reasons for low fertility rates was that marriage during the 1500 's was an extremely formal process with certain requirements being made on both husbands and wives . If a woman was to get married it was generally expected that her parents would provide her new husband with a dowry . A dowry was the goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . A woman with a higher dowry was seen to be more desirable , a woman with a small dowry or no dowry was unlikely to find a husband . It 's important to note however that the importance of financial incentives for marriage applied to both men and women . Just as women were expected to provide a dowry , men were expected to have mastered a trade and achieved a certain level of financial stability before they were considered viable husbands . As a result many people living in 16th Century Europe either married very late or not at all . Remarriage however was a common occurrence due to the high percentage of widows and widowers , and it was not uncommon for two families to be merged through marriage . <p> New Terms <p> Black Death : A devastating pandemic which broke out in the 14th Century and traveled across Europe and Asia . Believed to have been a case of the Bubonic Plague spread by rats and fleas , the plague ravaged the population killing between 75 to 200 million people in the 14th Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bride to her husband on their marriage . A woman 's family was expected to provide a dowry when she got married , and the size of the dowry affected her desirability . The purpose of the dowry was to provide the wife with something to fall back on should anything happen to her husband , but often the dowry was used to pay ordinary expenses . <h> Cities and the Social Order <p> For the most part Europe was dominated by rural agrarian societies ( societies made up of peasants , landowners and farmers ) , but there were also a number of prominent European cities and some , including historian Christopher Friedrichs estimate that between 100 and 200 million people lived in cities between 1450 and 1750 . By the early 16th Century the largest cities in Europe were Naples , Paris and Venice each of which had populations between 100,000 and 200,000 . Within most of these cities both the rich and poor lived together , although the wealthier inhabitants of the city tended to migrate towards city centers and busy markets , whereas poorer citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and side streets ( Friedrichs , 6 ) . <p> Despite their close proximity , the European cities of the Early Modern period kept a rigid class structure . At the top were royalty . Kings and Queens were the primary rulers of Early Modern Europe and it was taken as a given that their authority was final . Their authority was backed up by the most powerful political force at the time , the Catholic Church . Kings and Queens aligned themselves with the Catholic Church and claimed their rule was ordained by God . <p> The remaining non-royal European peoples were divided into three estates . The First Estate was comprised of the clergy , " those who pray . " The Second Estate was made up of the nobility , " those who fight . " And the Third Estate was comprised of everyone else , " those who work . " Mobility between the estates was impossible , and so , individuals born into the Third Estate , were unable to improve their social condition . <p> For members of the Third Estate , occupation provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ability to exercise political power . Society within cities was divided by Guilds , groups of craftsmen and artisans who controlled the industries within their city . Each occupation had its own guild , and these guilds in turn controlled the people working in the trade . Membership within a guild was extremely selective and followed a rigid process of training . Individuals began as apprentices working under a given master . If they proved successful they were advanced to the level of journeymen and began production of their own masterpiece . Finally , upon successful completion of a masterpiece , the guild would consider the maker a master of the trade . It was n't until this point that men were allowed to marry . <p> New Terms <p> The Three Estates : The Three Estates were the class system commonly adopted during the Early Modern Period in Europe . The Estate you were in determined your social standing . <p> The First Estate : The First Estate was the highest of the Early Modern social groups , and was made up of members of the Clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremendous amount of power and influence , and clergymen had the greatest political power and social standing . <p> The Second Estate : The second highest social group was comprised of the nobility . These were the rich land owners who controlled most of the land and wealth but comprised a minority of the population . <p> The Third Estate : Those who were not members of the first or second estates were members of the Third Estate . Members of this group ran from rich merchants to the poorest of peasants . Although they were the largest of all the estates , they held the least power and typically owned little property . <p> Guilds : groups of craftsmen and artisans who controlled the industries within their city . <h> Printing and Renaissance Humanism <p> Perhaps the greatest challenge to the rigid Estate System came in the form of the Gutenberg Press , which was one of the first printing presses able to mass produce printed texts which were then distributed around the world . Beginning in the mid-15th Century , cities began to boast their own presses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mainz , Germany . The next major press was established in Italy in 1465 and three more presses were established in 1469 in the cities of Basel , Paris and Rome . By the 1500s there were over 250 presses in cities all across the European continent and literacy was beginning to improve . Soon the bible became one of the most commonly printed and translated texts . The advent of the printing press brought with it an unprecedented dedication to scholarship which in turn sparked a number of movements committed to better understanding the world . Now that they were able to read important texts for themselves as opposed to simply hearing them dictated , many Europeans felt that time and others ' misinterpretations had corrupted them . Particularly , many scholars felt that such corruptions had led to corruption in society and as such wished to remove those corruptions . <p> Their efforts began the Renaissance ( translated from the French to mean ' rebirth ' ) which was a cultural and artistic movement aimed at restoring society to what many believed was its former glory in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of Renaissance Humanism which changed to focus of education to secular ideas such as grammar , rhetoric , poetry , history and moral philosophy . These scholars hoped to better understand their world by looking to the resources of the past and reexamining old truths . Their mantra soon became that of Ad fontes or " back to the sources . " Unfortunately their attempts to look backward simply resulted in the questioning of the world they lived in and a general questioning of authority . <p> The rise in education was not simply centered around the elite , and indeed there were soon Universities devoted to teaching ordinary people . The combination of Universities and printing presses allowed for information to be disseminated further and faster than ever before . Literacy among Europeans rose steadily and even though reading and writing were generally taught separately , by the 1800 's about half of all Europeans were able to sign their own names . The printing press made literature a mass commodity , and many of what we now regard as the ' classics ' were popular reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible by the printing press , combined with the dedication of scholars soon lead many people of all walks of life to being thinking critically about their society .

Regarded as one of the first and most important printing presses , the Gutenberg Press was the first press able to print using high quality lettering and inks producing durable books . His press was also the first to attempt to use color in printing . The Gutenberg Press is also famous for being on of the first mass publishers of the Bible which had been translated from the original Latin to German for the first time . <p> Renaissance : The Renaissance , French for ' rebirth ' , was a cultural and artistic movement which began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe during the beginning of the Early Modern Period . <p> Renaissance Humanism : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on secular teaching and the importance of the fields of grammar , rhetoric , poetry , history , science and moral philosophy . <p> Ad fontes : A Latin word meaning back to the sources .

So the physics of music is the physics of the kinds of sounds these instruments can make . What kinds of sounds are these ? They are tones caused by standing waves produced in or on the instrument . So the properties of these standing waves , which are always produced in very specific groups , or series , have far-reaching effects on music theory . <p> Most sound waves , including the musical sounds that actually reach our ears , are not standing waves .

But to be a tone - a sound with a particular pitch - a group of sound waves has to be very regular , all exactly the same distance apart .

The high parts of the reflected waves would meet the high parts of the oncoming waves and make them even higher . The low parts of the reflected waves would meet the low parts of the oncoming waves and make them even lower . Instead of a roiled mess of waves cancelling each other out , you would have a pond of perfectly ordered waves , with high points and low points appearing regularly at the same spots again and again . <p> This sort of orderliness is actually hard to get from water waves , but relatively easy to get in sound waves , so that several completely different types of sound wave " containers " have been developed into musical instruments . The two most common - strings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's finish discussing what makes a good standing wave container , and how this affects music theory . <p> In order to get the necessary constant reinforcement , the container has to be the perfect size ( length ) for a certain wavelength , so that waves bouncing back or being produced at each end reinforce each other , instead of interfering with each other and cancelling each other out . And it really helps to keep the container very narrow , so that you do n't have to worry about waves bouncing off the sides and complicating things . So you have a bunch of regularly-spaced waves that are trapped , bouncing back and forth in a container that fits their wavelength perfectly . If you could watch these waves , it would not even look as if they are traveling back and forth . Instead , waves would seem to be appearing and disappearing regularly at exactly the same spots , so these trapped waves are called standing waves . <p> NOTE : Although standing waves are harder to get in water , the phenomenon does apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can sometimes get the same effect by pushing a tub of water back and forth , but this is a messy experiment ; you 'll know you are getting a standing wave when the water suddenly starts sloshing much higher - right out of the tub ! <p> For any narrow " container " of a particular length , there are plenty of possible standing waves that do n't fit . But there are also many standing waves that do fit . The longest wave that fits it is called the fundamental . It is also called the first harmonic . The next longest wave that fits is the second harmonic , or the first overtone . The next longest wave is the third harmonic , or second overtone , and so on . <p> Figure 2 : There is a whole set of standing waves , called harmonics , that will fit into any " container " of a specific length . This set of waves is called a harmonic series . <p> Notice that it does n't matter what the length of the fundamental is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the first harmonic ; that 's the only way they 'll both " fit " . The waves of the third harmonic must be a third the length of the first harmonic , and so on . This has a direct effect on the frequency and pitch of harmonics , and so it affects the basics of music tremendously . <h> Standing Waves on Strings <p> You may have noticed an interesting thing in the animation of standing waves : there are spots where the " water " goes up and down a great deal , and other spots where the " water level " does n't seem to move at all . All standing waves have places , called nodes , where there is no wave motion , and antinodes , where the wave is largest . It is the placement of the nodes that determines which wavelengths " fit " into a musical instrument " container " . <p> Figure 3 : As a standing wave waves back and forth ( from the red to the blue position ) , there are some spots called nodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no change , no waving up-and-down ( or back-and-forth ) , at these spots . The spots at the biggest part of the wave - where there is the most change during each wave - are called antinodes . <p> One " container " that works very well to produce standing waves is a thin , very taut string that is held tightly in place at both ends . Since the string is taut , it vibrates quickly , producing sound waves , if you pluck it , or rub it with a bow . Since it is held tightly at both ends , that means there has to be a node at each end of the string . Instruments that produce sound using strings are called chordophones , or simply strings . <p> Figure 4 : A string that 's held very tightly at both ends can only vibrate at very particular wavelengths . The whole string can vibrate back and forth . It can vibrate in halves , with a node at the middle of the string as well as each end , or in thirds , fourths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a node at each end of the string , ca n't make a standing wave on the string . To get any of those other wavelengths , you need to change the length of the vibrating string . That is what happens when the player holds the string down with a finger , changing the vibrating length of the string and changing where the nodes are . <p> The fundamental wave is the one that gives a string its pitch . But the string is making all those other possible vibrations , too , all at the same time , so that the actual vibration of the string is pretty complex . The other vibrations ( the ones that basically divide the string into halves , thirds and so on ) produce a whole series of harmonics . We do n't hear the harmonics as separate notes , but we do hear them . They are what gives the string its rich , musical , string-like sound - its timbre . ( The sound of a single frequency alone is a much more mechanical , uninteresting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger holds the string down tightly , the finger becomes the new end of the vibrating part of the string . The vibrating part of the string is shorter , and the whole set of sound waves it makes is shorter . <h> Standing Waves in Wind Instruments <p> The string disturbs the air molecules around it as it vibrates , producing sound waves in the air . But another great container for standing waves actually holds standing waves of air inside a long , narrow tube . This type of instrument is called an aerophone , and the most well-known of this type of instrument are often called wind instruments because , although the instrument itself does vibrate a little , most of the sound is produced by standing waves in the column of air inside the instrument . <p> If it is possible , have a reed player and a brass player demonstrate to you the sounds that their mouthpieces make without the instrument . This will be a much " noisier " sound , with lots of extra frequencies in it that do n't sound very musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument shaped like a tube , only some of the sounds the mouthpiece makes are the right length for the tube . Because of feedback from the instrument , the only sound waves that the mouthpiece can produce now are the ones that are just the right length to become standing waves in the instrument , and the " noise " is refined into a musical tone . <p> Figure 6 : Standing Waves in a wind instrument are usually shown as displacement waves , with nodes at closed ends where the air can not move back-and-forth . <p> The standing waves in a wind instrument are a little different from a vibrating string . The wave on a string is a transverse wave , moving the string back and forth , rather than moving up and down along the string . But the wave inside a tube , since it is a sound wave already , is a longitudinal wave ; the waves do not go from side to side in the tube . Instead , they form along the length of the tube . <p> Figure 7 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . Here the displacement standing waves in Figure 6 are shown instead as longitudinal air pressure waves . Each wave would be oscillating back and forth between the state on the right and the one on the left . <p> The harmonics of wind instruments are also a little more complicated , since there are two basic shapes ( cylindrical and conical ) that are useful for wind instruments , and they have different properties . The standing-wave tube of a wind instrument also may be open at both ends , or it may be closed at one end ( for a mouthpiece , for example ) , and this also affects the instrument . For the purposes of understanding music theory , however , the important thing about standing waves in winds is this : the harmonic series they produce is essentially the same as the harmonic series on a string . In other words , the second harmonic is still half the length of the fundamental , the third harmonic is one third the length , and so on . ( Actually , some harmonics are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects the timbre and some aspects of playing the instrument . It does not affect the basic relationships in the harmonic series . ) <h> Standing Waves in Other Objects <p> So far we have looked at two of the four main groups of musical instruments : chordophones and aerophones . That leaves membranophones and idiophones . Membranophones are instruments in which the sound is produced by making a membrane vibrate ; drums are the most familiar example . Most drums do not produce tones ; they produce rhythmic " noise " ( bursts of irregular waves ) . Some drums do have pitch , due to complex-patterned standing waves on the membrane that are reinforced in the space inside the drum . This works a little bit like the waves in tubes , above , but the waves produced on membranes , though very interesting , are too complex to be discussed here . <p> Idiophones are instruments in which the body of the instrument itself , or a part of it , produces the original vibration . Some of these instruments ( cymbals , for example ) produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of the instrument - usually a tube , block , circle , or bell shape - allows the instrument to ring with a standing-wave vibration when you strike it . The standing waves in these **26;405;TOOLONG idiophones - for example , the blocks on a xylophone - produce pitched tones , but again , the patterns of standing waves in these instruments are a little too complicated for this discussion . If a percussion instrument does produce pitched sounds , however , the reason , again , is that it is mainly producing harmonic-series overtones . <p> NOTE : Although percussion specializes in " noise " -type sounds , even instruments like snare drums follow the basic physics rule of " bigger instrument makes longer wavelengths and lower sounds " . If you can , listen to a percussion player or section that is using snare drums , cymbals , or other percussion of the same type but different sizes . Can you hear the difference that size makes , as opposed to differences in timbre produced by different types of drums ?

@@119689386 @8689386/ <h> Transposing Instruments 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To understand transposing instruments , their purpose , and to provide examples of transposing instruments <h> What is a Transposing Instrument ? <p> It is easier for musicians to play together , talk to each other about music , and share written music with each other , if everyone agrees on the same names for each pitch . The most widely used standard is called concert pitch . Used in most genres of Western music , concert pitch is usually defined by saying that a pitch that sounds at 440 hertz is an " A " , with all other pitches related to that A using equal temperament tuning . <p> Even though concert pitch is defined by the sound of an " A " , instruments that read music at concert pitch are called C instruments . This is because the key of C is the " natural " key , the major key that has no sharps or flats , only natural notes . ( You may wonder why A is not the natural key . As is true for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no logical reason ; it is just a happenstance that arose out of the history of Western music . ) <p> Many instruments are C instruments . For example , piano , organ , oboe , violin , guitar , and trombone are all C instruments . A pianist who sees a written C will play a note that the violinist would agree is a C. This may seem obvious , but a clarinet player who sees a C on the page will play a note that does not sound like a C to the other players . This is because the clarinet is a transposing instrument . The music for transposing instruments is not written or read at concert pitch . The clarinet player , for example , seeing a C on the page , will play a note that sounds like a B flat . The clarinet is therefore called a B flat instrument . A French horn player , seeing a C on his " horn in F " or " F horn " part , will play a note that sounds like an F. So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " F horn " ) tells you which concert-pitch note the instrument plays when given a written C. <p> Transposing does not just change the written C , however ; it changes every note . For example , a B flat instrument plays every note a whole step lower than written , not just the C. This means that if you want the clarinet player to play particular concert-pitch notes , you must write those notes one whole step higher than you would for a non-transposing instrument . <p> Since every note of the scale is changed , the result is a different scale . This means that the part for the transposing instrument will be in a different key and have a different key signature than the parts for C instruments . Changing music to put it into a different key is called transposing the music . Music for transposing instruments must be properly transposed in order for most players to be able to read it . ( There are musicians who can " transpose at sight , " for example horn players who can read concert-pitch music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual . ) <h> Transposing and Non-transposing Instruments <p> A complete list of all the transposing instruments would be very long . Many are very rare . Listed here are only the most common ones . A couple of issues that sometimes cause confusion : octave-transposing C instruments and non-C , non-transposing instruments . <p> Common Transposing Instruments <p> Clarinet is usually a Bb instrument . The most common clarinet sounds one whole step lower than written , so parts for it must be written one whole step higher than concert pitch . Like French horns , clarinets used to come in several different keys , and clarinets in A ( with parts that are written a minor third higher ) and other keys can still be found . <p> Alto and Baritone Saxophone are Eb instruments . Parts for alto saxophone are transposed up a major sixth . Parts for bari sax are transposed up an octave plus a major sixth . <p> Tenor and Soprano Saxophone are Bb instruments . Parts for soprano sax are written a step higher than they sound , and parts for tenor sax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major ninth ) . <p> English Horn is an F instrument . Parts for English horn are transposed up a perfect fifth . <p> Trumpet and Cornet can be in B flat or C , depending on the individual instrument . B flat is the more common key for cornet . If you are writing for a particular player , you may want to find out if a C or B flat part is expected . <p> French horn parts are usually written in F these days , up a perfect fifth . However , because of the instrument 's history , older orchestral parts may be in any conceivable transposition , and may even change transpositions in the middle of a piece . Because of this , some horn players learn to transpose at sight . <p> Alto flute is in G , written a fourth higher than it sounds . <p> Tubas and euphoniums may also be transposing instruments . Some tuba and euphonium parts are written as bass clef C parts ( sometimes even when the instrument played is nominally not a " C instrument " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eb tubas ( called basses ) are written in treble clef . The BBb is written two octaves and a major second higher than it sounds , and the Eb an octave and a major sixth higher than it sounds . in France ( and in the case of parts printed in France ) , you find Bb euphoniums ( calles basses or petites basses ) written for in bass clef transposing by a major second , and bass tubas ( called contrebasses ) in Bb written for in bass clef transposing by a major ninth . If you are writing for a particular group or player , you may want to check to see what kind of instrument is available and what transposition the player is comfortable with . <p> Some transposing instruments do not change key , but play an octave higher or lower than written . <p> Guitar parts are written one octave higher than they sound . <p> Men 's voices , when given a melody written in treble clef , will usually sing it one octave lower than written . <p> String Bass parts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts are written one octave lower than they sound . <p> Contrabassoon parts are written one octave higher than they sound . <p> Handbell and handchime parts are written one octave lower than they sound . <p> There are also instruments that do not transpose but are also not considered C or concert-pitch instruments . Players of these instruments read concert-pitch music , but the instruments are considered to be fundamentally pitched on a note other than C. This is of very little practical importance , but is an issue that confuses some people , so let 's take two examples . Soprano and tenor recorders , when all the finger-holes are covered ( so that the air must go through the entire instrument ) , play a C. Alto recorders , when all the finger-holes are covered , play an F. Like B flat trumpets , this would seem to make alto recorder a good candidate to be a transposing instrument . If it were , a player could easily switch from one size recorder to another ; a written C would have the same fingering on all instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tradition ; so , although alto recorder can be considered to be " pitched in F " , alto players learn to read at concert pitch , associating the fingerings with different notes than a soprano or tenor player would . <p> The second example is from brass instruments . The fundamental pitch of a woodwind ( the recorder , for example ) is considered to be the lowest note it can play when all holes are closed . The fundamental pitch of a brass instrument , on the other hand , is considered to be the fundamental of the harmonic series it plays when no valves are being used . For example , the C trumpet , using no valves , plays a harmonic series based on C , while a B flat ( transposing ) trumpet plays a B flat harmonic series . Tubas , on the other hand , can be based on several different harmonic series , including C , B flat , F , and E flat . But these are not necessarily transposing instruments . A tuba player playing a B flat instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read concert-pitch music and simply use different fingerings for the same note than a player on a C instrument . <p> Some Non-transposing , Non-C Instruments : <p> Alto recorder - Fundamental note is an F. <p> Various tubas - Can be in B flat , F , or E flat as well as C , and may be transposing or non-transposing , depending on the piece of music , the player , and the local tradition for the instrument . <p> Trombone - " First position " is based on the B flat harmonic series . <p> Bassoons - Are also based on B flat ; the lowest ( all holes covered ) note is a B flat ( A on some contrabassoons ) . <p> Baritone and Euphonium - These instruments are pitched in B flat , and may or may not be treated as a transposing instrument . Players may read either a bass clef non-transposed part , or a treble clef B flat transposed part in which the part is written a major ninth ( an octave plus a whole step ) higher than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are accustomed to playing non-transposing bass clef parts ) and cornet players ( accustomed to playing treble clef B flat parts ) who want to switch to the less-common baritone when needed . <h> Why are there Transposing Instruments <p> Things do run more smoothly when everyone agrees on the same name for the same sound . So why are there transposing instruments ? The instruments that transpose an octave have either a very high or very low range . Transposition puts their written parts comfortably in the staff and avoids using too many harder-to-read ledger lines . <p> Some transpositions are for the convenience of the player . Someone who has learned to play C trumpet , for example , associates a particular note with a particular fingering . If he switches to a B flat trumpet , he can use the same fingerings for the written notes , as long as the part has been appropriately transposed . If it has not ( and some modern composers do not bother with transposition ) , he must learn to associate the same fingerings with different written notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for the convenience of the player , but are now mostly accidents of history . For example , there was a time when French horns , like harmonicas , came in every key , and could only play well in that key or closely related keys . French horn players could switch between different instruments playing what looked like the same set of notes , but which actually sounded in whatever key was needed . As the horn became capable of playing all notes equally well , the horn in F was the one that was chosen as having the nicest sound , so players still read parts in F.

Of course there is no harm in receiving in put from four or more satellites since this will not influence the determination of the location of the GPS . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this task : first visualizing the intersections of spheres and then working with equations to check that the visual intuition is correct . The GPS unit measures its distance from a given satellite . The set of all points of distance ( d ) from a satellite is a sphere of radius ( d ) . If the earth is modeled as a sphere , the intersection of those two spheres can be a point or a circle . The case of a point is pictured below ( the point at which they meet is on the ( x ) -axis : <p> Another possibility is that the two spheres meet in a circle : this is pictured below ( here the second sphere has been removed from the picture to show the intersection : the second sphere is located directly underneath the green sphere ) : <p> A circle and a point are the only possible intersections of the sphere representing the earth and the sphere representing points on the surface of the earth a distance ( d ) from the satellite : indeed , we know that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance ( d ) from the satellite , namely the location of the GPS unit . On the other hand , the satellite is in outer space and so the intersection of the two spheres can not be all of the earth . <p> With this information in mind , we can now give examples of the different scenarios presented in this problem . <p> This case is represented by the first picture above if we let the purple sphere represent the earth and the green sphere the set of points of distance ( d ) from the satellite ( so the satellite is located at the center of the green sphere ) . In words , if we imagine that the GPS unit is at the north pole and that the satellite is directly above the earth on the axis going through north and south poles , then the location of the GPS unit would be the only point on the earth of distance ( d ) from this satellite . <p> In general , as in the second picture above , the set of points on the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single point but a circle as is represented in the following picture : <p> If the information from either satellite alone is not enough to determine the location of the GPS this means that points of distance ( d1 ) from Satellite 1 and distance ( d2 ) from Satellite 2 must both be circles . So we are looking for circles on the earth which meet in a single point . This situation is captured in the picture below ( the location of Satellite 2 here is a 180 degree rotation of Satellite 1 through the axis going through the center of the earth and the location of the GPS unit ) : <p> Generally two circles on the surface of the earth could meet in two points rather than one and this situation is pictured below : <p> Here we want a situation where the two circles on the earth representing points of distance ( d1 ) from Satellite 1 and ( d2 ) from Satellite 2 meet in more than one point . It is possible for them to meet in two points as is pictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right location on the earth ( the satellites are not pictured here , only the points of fixed distances on the earth from those satellites ) : <p> A bad situation where three satellites are not enough to determine the location of the GPS on the earth would happen , for example , if all three satellites are lined up directly over the north pole but the GPS is not at the north pole . In this situation , all three circles on the earth coming from the distances from the satellites are identical . <p> Solution : 2 Algebraic Equations <p> Here we show algebraically , with the examples used to generate the first two pictures in the first solution , why the intersection of two spheres can be a point or a circle . Then we carry out further algebraic manipulations for part ( a ) . For parts ( b ) and ( c ) these equations become more complicated and present a formidable challenge : for part ( b ) we study a special case and similarly for part ( c ) . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in the first solution . For the first picture , the two spheres defined by the equations ( x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 ) and ( ( x-3 ) 2 + y2 + z2 = 4 ) . Subtracting the first equation from the second gives ( ( x-3 ) 2 - x2 = 3 ) . Expanding , this becomes ( -6x + 9 = 3 ) . This means that ( x = 1 ) and plugging this back into either of the equations we find that the point of intersection of the two spheres is ( ( 1,0,0 ) ) . <p> For the second picture in the first solution , consider the two spheres given by the equations ( x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 ) and ( x2 + y2 + left ( z - frac32right ) 2 = 1 ) . To solve these equations we can subtract the first from the second to find $$ left ( z - frac32right ) 2 - z2 = 0 . $$ Simplifying this gives ( -3z + frac94 = 0 ) so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first equation we find that the common solutions for the two equations satisfy ( x2 + y2 = frac716 ) . This is a circle contained in the plane where ( z = frac34 ) . <p> In general a signal from a single satellite will not determine a unique position on the earth but rather a circle of possible locations . There is one exception , however , namely when the satellite is directly overhead from the GPS unit . To see what this looks like in equations , suppose we model the surface of the earth by the sphere $$ x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 . $$ Let 's suppose that the GPS is at the north pole ( ( 0,0,1 ) ) . A point directly overhead of the north pole would be ( ( 0,0,2 ) ) for example . If a satellite is located here then the GPS is one unit directly south of the satellite and the sphere of radius one centered at ( ( 0,0,2 ) ) has equation $$ x2 + y2 + ( z-2 ) 2 = 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0,0,1 ) ) as can be seen by subtracting the first equation from the second givine ( ( z-2 ) 2 - z2 = 0 ) whose only solution is ( z = 1 ) . So when the satellite is directly overhead , it is possible to determine the position on the earth from a single reading . <p> To see what happens when the satellite is not directly overhead , let 's assume that the satellite is directly over the north pole ( ( 0,0,1 ) ) but the GPS is at some other point ( P ) in the northern hemisphere . Suppose the satellite has coordinates ( ( 0,0 , a ) ) for some number ( a ) which is larger than ( 1 ) . So the distance of the satellite to the earth is ( a -1 ) . If ( b ) denotes the distance of the satellite to the GPS then ( b gt a - 1 ) . <p> We are interested in finding the intersection of the sphere $$ x2 + y2 + ( z-a ) 2 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ z2 = 1 ) : this will tell us which points on the earth are a distance ( b ) from the satellite . Subtracting ( x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 ) from this equation we find $$ ( z-a ) 2 - z2 = b2 - 1 . $$ This means that ( -2az + a2 = b2 -1 ) or $$ z = frac1 + a2 - b22a. $$ We know this quantity is positive and is less than ( 1 ) because the ( z ) coordinate of the ( GPS ) is positive ( since it is in the northern hemisphere ) and less than one ( since it is not at the north pole ) . Since we also want ( x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 ) this means that $$ x2 + y2 = 1 - left ( frac1 + a2 - b22aright ) 2. $$ Thus the intersection of the two spheres is a circle . Moreover , this circle is contained in the plane perpendicular to the line joining the satellite and the center of the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere ( x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 ) and we place Satellite 1 at ( ( 0,0,2 ) ) and the GPS unit at ( left ( 0 , fracsqrt74 , frac34right ) ) . If we place the second satellite on the ( x ) -axis at ( ( 2,0,0 ) ) then the points on the surface of the earth which are the same distance from Satellite 2 as the GPS unit lie on the great circle where ( x = 0 ) , that is they are the points of the form ( ( 0 , a , b ) ) where ( a2 + b2 = 1 ) ( from the point of view of the previous paragraph , the plane perpendicular to the line joining ( ( 2,0,0 ) ) and ( ( 0,0,0 ) ) is the plane where ( x = 0 ) ) . Satellite 1 tells us the longitude of the GPS unit . Satellite 2 tells us the latitude of the GPS unit except that latitudes of ( x ) ( where ( 0 leq x lt 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed . So the information from these two GPS units limits the location of the GPS unit to two possible locations : in this case those two possible locations are ( left ( 0 , fracsqrt74 , frac34right ) ) and ( left ( 0 , frac-sqrt74 , frac-34right ) ) . <p> Any location of satellite 3 which will is not equidistant from the two points from part ( b ) will suffice . For example we could place satellite 3 at ( ( 0,2,0 ) ) . <p> Summarizing the two solutions , the typical situation where the information from three satellites is not enough to locate the GPS would be when the three satellites lie in a line . If they all lie on a line through the center of the earth then the distances from the respective satellites all give the same information and so they will only determine a circle of possible locations for the GPS , unless they are all directly overhead . If the three satellites lie on a plane which goes through the center of the earth then again , unless one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to determine where the GPS is . <p> Rephrasing the previous paragraph , as long as satellites 1 and 2 have been chosen to limit the possible locations of the GPS to two points ( P1 ) and ( P2 ) , satellite 3 can be selected to be anywhere as long as it is not equidistant from ( P1 ) and ( P2 ) . The set of points equidistant from ( P1 ) and ( P2 ) forms a plane which contains satellites 1 and 2 and the center of the earth . So it is sufficient to avoid this plane and then satellite 3 will determine the location of the GPS . This is what will usually happen if three locations are chosen at random for the three satellites .

Satellite 1 tells us the longitude of the GPS unit . Satellite 2 tells us the latitude of the GPS unit except that latitudes of ( x ) ( where ( 0 leq x lt 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed . So the information from these two GPS units limits the location of the GPS unit to two possible locations : in this case those two possible locations are ( left ( 0 , fracsqrt74 , frac34right ) ) and ( left ( 0 , frac-sqrt74 , frac-34right ) ) . <p> Any location of satellite 3 which will is not equidistant from the two points from part ( b ) will suffice . For example we could place satellite 3 at ( ( 0,2,0 ) ) . <p> Summarizing the two solutions , the typical situation where the information from three satellites is not enough to locate the GPS would be when the three satellites lie in a line . If they all lie on a line through the center of the earth then the distances from the respective satellites all give the same information and so they will only determine a circle of possible locations for the GPS , unless they are all directly overhead . If the three satellites lie on a plane which goes through the center of the earth then again , unless one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to determine where the GPS is . <p> Rephrasing the previous paragraph , as long as satellites 1 and 2 have been chosen to limit the possible locations of the GPS to two points ( P1 ) and ( P2 ) , satellite 3 can be selected to be anywhere as long as it is not equidistant from ( P1 ) and ( P2 ) . The set of points equidistant from ( P1 ) and ( P2 ) forms a plane which contains satellites 1 and 2 and the center of the earth . So it is sufficient to avoid this plane and then satellite 3 will determine the location of the GPS . This is what will usually happen if three locations are chosen at random for the three satellites .

It 's also very useful at a " practical " level for composers , arrangers , and performers ( especially people playing chords , like pianists and guitarists ) , who need to be able to talk to each other about the chords that they are reading , writing , and playing . <p> Chord manuals , fingering charts , chord diagrams , and notes written out on a staff are all very useful , especially if the composer wants a very particular sound on a chord . But all you really need to know are the name of the chord , your major scales and minor scales , and a few rules , and you can figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you need to know to be able to name most chords ? <p> You must know your major , minor , augmented and diminished triads . Either have them all memorized , or be able to figure them out following the rules for triads . <p> You must be able to find intervals from the root of the chord . One way to do this is by using the rules for intervals . Or if you know your scales and do n't want to learn about intervals , you can use the method in #3 instead . <p> If you know all your scales ( always a good thing to know , for so many reasons ) , you can find all the intervals from the root using scales . For example , the " 4 " in Csus4 is the 4th note in a C ( major or minor ) scale , and the " minor 7th " in Dm7 is the 7th note in a D ( natural ) minor scale . <p> You need to know the rules for the common seventh chords , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for naming bass notes . The basic rules for these are all found below . <p> NOTE : Please note that the modern system of chord symbols , discussed below , is very different from the figured bass shorthand popular in the seventeenth century ( which is not discussed here ) . For example , the " 6 " in figured bass notation implies the first inversion chord , not an added 6 . <h> Chord Symbols <p> Some instrumentalists , such as guitarists and pianists , are sometimes expected to be able to play a named chord , or an accompaniment based on that chord , without seeing the notes written out in common notation . In such cases , a chord symbol above the staff tells the performer what chord should be used as accompaniment to the music until the next symbol appears . <p> Figure 1 : A chord symbol above the staff is sometimes the only indication of which notes should be used in the accompaniment . Chord symbols also may be used even when an accompaniment is written out , so that performers can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they prefer . <p> There is widespread agreement on how to name chords , but there are several different systems for writing chord symbols . Unfortunately , this can be a little confusing , particularly when different systems use the same symbol to refer to different chords . If you 're not certain what chord is wanted , you can get useful clues both from the notes in the music and from the other chord symbols used . ( For example , if the " minus " chord symbol is used , check to see if you can spot any chords that are clearly labelled as either minor or diminished . ) <p> Figure 2 : There is unfortunately a wide variation in the use of chord symbols . In particular , notice that some symbols , such as the " minus " sign and the triangle , can refer to different chords , depending on the assumptions of the person who wrote the symbol . <h> Seventh Chord <p> If you take a basic triad and add a note that is a seventh above the root , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh chords , distinguished by both the type of triad and the type of seventh used . Here are the most common . <p> ( bullet ) The major seventh is one half step below the octave . ( bullet ) The minor seventh is one half step below the major seventh . ( bullet ) The diminished seventh is one half step below the minor seventh . <p> Figure 3 : Common Seventh Chords . <h> Added Notes , Suspensions , and Extensions <p> The seventh is not the only note you can add to a basic triad to get a new chord . You can continue to extend the chord by adding to the stack of thirds , or you can add any note you want . The most common additions and extensions add notes that are in the scale named by the chord . <p> Figure 4 : Extending and Adding Notes to Chords . To find out what to call a note added to a chord , count the notes of the scale named by the chord . <p> The first , third , and fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale are part of the basic triad . So are any other notes in other octaves that have the same name as 1 , 3 , or 5 . In a C major chord , for example , that would be any C naturals , E naturals , and G naturals . If you want to add a note with a different name , just list its number ( its scale degree ) after the name of the chord . <p> Figure 5 : Labelling a number as " sus " ( suspended ) implies that it replaces the chord tone immediately below it . Labelling it " add " implies that only that note is added . In many other situations , the performer is left to decide how to play the chord most effectively . Chord tones may or may not be left out . In an extended chord , all or some of the notes in the " stack of thirds " below the named note may also be added . <p> Many of the higher added notes are considered extensions of the " stack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a C13 can include ( it 's sometimes the performer 's decision which notes will actually be played ) the seventh , ninth , and eleventh as well as the thirteenth . Such a chord can be dominant , major , or minor ; the performer must take care to play the correct third and seventh . If a chord symbol says to " add13 " , on the other hand , this usually means that only the thirteenth is added . <p> Figure 6 : Take care to use the correct third and seventh - dominant , major , or minor - with extended chords . If the higher note is labelled " add " , do n't include the chord extensions that are n't named . <p> NOTE : All added notes and extensions , including sevenths , introduce dissonance into the chord . In some modern music , many of these dissonances are heard as pleasant or interesting or jazzy and do n't need to be resolved . However , in other styles of music , dissonances need to be resolved , and some chords may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , by leaving out the 3 in a chord with a 4 ) . <p> You may have noticed that , once you pass the octave ( 8 ) , you are repeating the scale . In other words , C2 and C9 both add a D , and C4 and C11 both add an F. It may seem that C4 and C11 should therefore be the same chords , but in practice these chords usually do sound different ; for example , performers given a C4 chord will put the added note near the bass note and often use it as a temporary replacement for the third ( the " 3 " ) of the chord . On the other hand , they will put the added note of a C11 at the top of the chord , far away from the bass note and piled up on top of all the other notes of the chord ( including the third ) , which may include the 7 and 9 as well as the 11 . The result is that the C11 - an extension - has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The C4 , on the other hand , has a more intense , needs-to-be-resolved , classic suspension sound . In fact , 2 , 4 , and 9 chords are often labelled suspended ( sus ) , and follow the same rules for resolution in popular music as they do in classical . <p> Figure 7 : Low-number added notes and high-number added notes are treated differently . So even though they both add an F , a C4 suspension will sound quite different from a C11 extended chord . <h> Bass Notes <p> The bass line of a piece of music is very important , and the composer/arranger often will want to specify what note should be the lowest-sounding in the chord . At the end of the chord name will be a slash followed by a note name , for example C/E . The note following the slash should be the bass note . <p> Figure 8 : The note following the slash is the bass note of the chord . It can be a note that is already in the chord - making the chord a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , following the same basic rules as other added notes ( including using it to replace other notes in the chord ) . <p> The note named as the bass note can be a note normally found in the chord - for example , C/E or C/G - or it can be an added note - for example C/B or C/A . If the bass note is not named , it is best to use the tonic as the primary bass note . <h> Altering Notes and Chords <p> If a note in the chord is not in the major or minor scale of the root of the chord , it is an altered note and makes the chord an altered chord . The alteration - for example " flat five " or " sharp nine " - is listed in the chord symbol . Any number of alterations can be listed , making some chord symbols quite long . Alterations are not the same as accidentals . Remember , a chord symbol always names notes in the scale of the chord root , ignoring the key signature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alterations are from the scale of the chord , not from the key of the piece . <p> Figure 9 : There is some variation in the chord symbols for altered chords . Plus/minus or sharp/flat symbols may appear before or after the note number . When sharps and flats are used , remember that the alteration is always from the scale of the chord root , not from the key signature .

@@119689473 @8689473/ <h> What does the Octet Rule Mean ? 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> In chemical bonding , there are some trends that apply to the majority of chemical compounds . One of these is known as the Octet Rule . This rule states that an atom will always attempt to have a full set of eight valence electrons by bonding with other atoms either covalently or ionically . The way that the Octet Rule works varies for different types of compounds , so in this article we will explore the different possibilities in an organized fashion . Overall , the Octet Rule is one of the most important fundamentals of chemical bonding . <h> General Trends <p> The amount of electrons an element will tend to gain or lose depends on the number of electrons in the atom 's valence shell . An atom will always try to ionize to its stable state with the transfer of the fewest electrons possible . <p> Example 1 : A fluorine atom can get a full valence shell by either gaining one more electron , or by losing seven electrons . The former requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to gain one electron first . Therefore , ( F- ) ions are more common than ( F7+ ) ions . <p> Example 2 : A magnesium atom can get a full valence shell bt either losing two electrons , or by gaining six . The former requires the transfer of fewer electrons , so ( Mg2+ ) ions are more common than ( Mg6- ) ions . <p> Example 3 : Note that a carbon atom 's valence shell has ( 4 ) electrons . It can either lose four electrons or gain four electrons to get a full valence shell . Note that either transition requires the transfer of the same number of electrons , so which ion results depends on the other chemicals involved . Note that in an ionic compound comprised of a metal and carbon , carbon will form the ( -4 ) carbide ion and form compounds such as magnesium carbide ( Mg2C ) and sodium carbide ( Na4C ) . <p> Here is a table of the group that a chemical is in and its most common transaction of gaining or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group Electrons gained/lost <p> LONG ... <p> 1 Lose 1 electron <p> 2 Lose 2 electrons <p> 3 Lose 3 electrons <p> 4 Lose 4 electrons/gain 4 electrons , depends on situation <p> 5 Gain 3 electrons <p> 6 Gain 2 electrons <p> 7 Gain 1 electrons <p> 8 These chemicals , known as the noble gases , already have a full valence shell and thus tend to be unreactive ( inert ) . <h> Binary Ionic Compounds <p> In an ionic compound , electrons are not shared between ions . Each valence electron is designated to belong to a specific ion in the bond . In a binary ionic compound ( one with only two different types of ions ) , each valence electron belongs to either the cation or anion . When either the cation or anion is polyatomic , it becomes more complicated . We can say that the electron belongs to either the cation or anion , but then we need to determine how it is shared between atoms that comprise the polyatomic ion . We will worry about this special case later . <p> Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one valence electron and chlorine atoms have seven . If a single electron is transferred from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom , then we get ( Na+ ) and ( Cl- ) , two ions in stable states . Thus we only need one of each atom to form this stable ionic compound , and both ions now satisfy the Octet Rule . <p> Example 5 : Consider Aluminum Bromide , ( AlBr3 ) . Aluminium is in Group III , and it tends to lose three electrons to form an ion with a full octet ( meaning it obeys the Octet Rule ) . Bromine atoms tend to gain just one electron to get to a full octet , as Bromine is in Group VII . A chemical consisting of an aluminum ion and a bromide ion in their stable states would be ( AlBr2+ ) , but it is not an ionic compound because it has a charge . Therefore , we need more negatively charged bromide ions to get an ionic compound . Each such ion has a charge of ( -1 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus aluminum bromide is ( AlBr3 ) , with each ion being in its stable octet form . <p> Example 6 : Consider Magnesium Nitride , ( Mg3N2 ) . Magnesium is in Group II and has two electrons in its valence shell . Thus it tends to lose two electrons . In this case , the next set of electrons closer to the nucleus is the new valence shell , and it is full . Nitrogen , on the other hand , is in Group V and has five valence electrons , so it needs to gain three electrons to get a full valence shell . Thus the most stable state for nitrogen ions is the ( N3- ) ion . To find the number of electrons that need transferred <h> Covalently Bonded Compounds <p> In covalently bonded compounds , electrons are shared between two atoms through the bonds between them . Every such single bond consists of two electrons , which count towards both atoms ' full set of eight valence electrons . Thus in a compound where two atoms have a single bond to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have six additional valence electrons . <p> Solution : Fluorine is in Group VII , and a single fluorine atom has seven valence electrons . However , by the Octet Rule it would like to gain one electron to get a full octet of valence electrons . Two fluorine atoms can each " sacrifice " one of their valence electrons to form a single bond between the atoms . Now each fluorine atom has six valence electrons to itself . However , the bond consists of two additional valence electrons for each fluorine atom ( as the electrons are shared ) , so both fluorine atoms now have a full octet . Thus fluorine is more stable as a diatomic molecule . <p> Below is a Lewis Structure for elemental fluorine for reference . Note that only valence shell electrons are included in the picture . <p> Now , recall that double bonds and triple bonds exist . These have slightly different advantages compared to single bonds . In particular , they allow even more electrons to be shared between two atoms . If a double bond exists between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a triple bond , the two atoms share six valence electrons . The Octet Rule still applies regardless of which type of covalent bond is involved . <p> Example 8 : Consider ( O2 ) , oxygen 's elemental form . Lone oxygen atoms have six valence electrons . However , oxygen is even more stable in groups of two atoms , because each oxygen atom can " sacrifice " two valence electrons , giving a total of four electrons used to bond the two atoms . Since there are four valence electrons to share , this is a double bond . Each oxygen atom has four valence electrons to itself and four that are shared through the double bond . Thus each oxygen atom now has a full octet . Below is the Lewis Structure .

Therefore , this is a ( frac00 ) indeterminate form , and we can use L'Hopital 's Rule .

Algebraic manipulations such as substitution and elimination can help to achieve a one-variable equation that can be solved with ease . Then any remaining variables can be solved for more easily . <p> There are a few crucial identities that are used to transform logarithmic expressions of a base ( a ) : <h> Using Substitution <p> Often reducing solving one equation for a variable in terms of the other can be useful , as it allows you to work with a one-variable equation . The general concept is the same as linear systems of equations , but there is more algebra required . Logarithmic identities and exponents will be helpful . <p> The logarithms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 = 25 ) and ( 42 = 16 ) . Convert the logarithms with smaller bases to match the base of the other logarithm in the equation with a logarithm identity : <p> We can not include ( x = -y ) because otherwise some of the arguments of the logarithms will inevitably be ( 0 ) or negative . In other words , we know that ( x ) and ( y ) are both positive , so ( x neq -y ) . Similar arguments are applicable in many such problems . Substitute ( x = y ) into the second equation : <p> $$log16(x6) = 7 + log16(x2)$$ <p> Move the logarithms to the same side : <p> $$log16(x6) - log16(x2) = 7$$ <p> The logarithms can be combined with an identity since the bases are the same : <p> Solution : Generally , having two expressions in the form of a quotient , where each expression contains one of the variables , makes it hard to create a substitution , so we need to try to avoid creating such a quotient in the first equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cdot log4(8x)$$ <p> Divide both sides of the equation by this constant : <p> $$log4(8x) = fraclog36(y2)log6(4)$$ <p> Remove the logarithm on the left-hand side to work on isolating ( x ) : <p> Take the base ( 6 ) exponent of both sides and then divide both sides of the equation by ( 8 ) : <p> $$x = frac185 cdot 6log4(8)$$ <h> Elimination of a Variable <p> Just like in linear systems of equations , it is often possible to set up the equations so that **39;433;TOOLONG the two equations will get rid of one variable and leave you with a one-variable equation . Two examples of this will be shown . <p> Example 3 : Solve the system of equations : <p> $$log7(x) + log49(y4) = 12$$ $$log7(xy3) = 6$$ <p> Solution : Convert the base ( 49 ) logarithm to base ( 7 ) with an identity : <p> $$log7(x) + log7(y2) = 12$$ <p> Break up the product in the second equation by using a logarithm identity : <p> $$log7(x) + log7(y3) = 6$$ <p> This configuration was chosen in order to set up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> $$log7(y3) - log7(y2) = -6$$ <p> The logarithms have the same base , so divide the arguments with another logarithm identity : <p> $$log7(y) = -6$$ <p> Use an exponent to isolate ( y ) : <p> $$y = 7-6$$ <p> Substitute into the second original equation : <p> $$log7 ( x cdot 7-6 ) = 6$$ <p> Break up this product and create a sum , just like we did earlier : <p> $$log7(x) + log7(7-6) = 6$$ <p> The second logarithm can be simplified , since exponents and logarithms are inverse operations : <p> $$log7(x) - 6 = 6 Rightarrow$$ $$log7(x) = 12$$ <p> Now use a base ( 7 ) exponent to solve for ( x ) : <p> $$x = 712$$ <p> Example 4 : Solve the system of equations : <p> $$log5(x2) + log125(y3) = 5$$ $$log25(x2y2) = 3$$ <p> Solution : We see that ( 125 = 53 ) , so we can transform the second logarithm in the first equation to one of base ( 5 ) : <p> $$log5(x2) + log5(y) = 5$$ <p> Now these two logarithms have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a logarithm identity : <p> $$log5(x2y) = 5$$ <p> This logarithm is in base ( 5 ) , so convert the logarithm in the second equation to base ( 5 ) to make setting up an elimination of one of the variables easier : <p> $$log5(xy) = 3$$ <p> Both equations now have only base ( 5 ) logarithms . We can convert this to an exponential system by taking the base ( 5 ) exponent of both sides of both equations . <p> $$x2y = 55$$ $$xy = 53$$ <p> Now divide the second equation from the first to eliminate ( y ) : <p> $$x = 55 - 3 = 52 = 25$$ <p> Substitute this into the second original equation : <p> $$log25 ( y2 cdot 252 ) = 3$$ <p> This logarithm can be broken up into a sum with the sum-product logarithm identity : <p> $$log25(y2) + log25(252) = 3$$ <p> The second logarithm can be removed since the exponent has the same base : <p> $$log25(y2) + 2 = 3 Rightarrow$$ $$log25(y2) = 1$$ <p> Remove the logarithm with a base ( 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $$y2 = 25 Rightarrow$$ $$y = pm 5$$ <p> Finally , notice that using ( x = -5 ) does not make any individual expressions in the original equations undefined . Often using negative values of variables as solutions to logarithmic equations creates a problem here , but in this case it does not , because every instance of ( x ) in the original equations includes an even exponent , removing the negative signs . <h> Transformations to Linear Systems <p> This section details how certain logarithmic systems of equations can be written as two-variable linear systems , which makes them much easier to solve . Typically a substitution is required here . <p> Solution : To transform to a linear system , we need to make the logarithmic expressions look alike with identities . Later , we will set ( a ) and ( b ) equal to logarithmic expressions involving ( x ) and ( y ) , respectively . Dealing with ( y ) first , notice that <p> Now we can transform this into a linear system by substituting ( a = log36(x2) ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 7$$ $$a + 2b = 4$$ <p> To prove this system has no solutions , divide the first equation by ( 2 ) : <p> $$a + 2b = frac72$$ <p> Thus the system claims that ( frac72 = 4 ) , which is not true , so the system has no solutions . <p> Similarly to exponential systems of equations , logarithmic systems of equations can be manipulated using the central principles of exponents and logarithms , particularly identities , to create equations that are easy to solve , either a simple one-variable logarithmic or exponential equation , or a system of linear equations . Often testing different manipulations on a system ( e.g. applying three different identities to an equation ) can create an indication as to which technique to use . More complicated systems usually require multiple identities and possibly more than one substitution .

In common notation , clef and key signature are the only symbols that normally appear on every staff . They appear so often because they are such important symbols ; they tell you what note is found on each line and space of the staff . This can change from one piece of music to another , so the musician must know the clef and key signature in order to read the music correctly ; in a way , the written music is a coded message , with each note standing for a sound with a particular pitch , and the clef and key signature are the key that tell you how to decode this particular message . <p> Figure 1 <p> The clef tells you the letter name of the note - for example , the top line on a bass clef staff is always some kind of A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of A. It may have either some sharp symbols on particular lines or spaces , or some flat symbols , again on particular lines or spaces . If there are no flats or sharps listed after the clef symbol , then the key signature is " all notes are natural " . <p> The key signature is a list of all the sharps and flats in the key that the music is in . When a sharp ( or flat ) appears on a line or space in the key signature , all the notes on that line or space are sharp ( or flat ) , and all other notes with the same letter names in other octaves are also sharp ( or flat ) . <p> Figure 2 : This key signature has a flat on the " B " line , so all of these B 's are flat . <p> The sharps or flats always appear in the same order in all key signatures . This is the same order in which they are added as keys get sharper or flatter . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has only one sharp , it will be F sharp , so F sharp is always the first sharp listed in a sharp key signature . The keys that have two sharps ( D major and B minor ) have F sharp and C sharp , so C sharp is always the second sharp in a key signature , and so on . The order of sharps is : F sharp , C sharp , G sharp , D sharp , A sharp , E sharp , B sharp . The order of flats is the reverse of the order of sharps : B flat , E flat , A flat , D flat , G flat , C flat , F flat . So the keys with only one flat ( F major and D minor ) have a B flat ; the keys with two flats ( B flat major and G minor ) have B flat and E flat ; and so on . The order of flats and sharps , like the order of the keys themselves , follows a circle of fifths . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the key of a piece of music , the key signature can help you find out . Assume for a moment that you are in a major key . If the key contains sharps , the name of the key is one half step higher than the last sharp in the key signature . If the key contains flats , the name of the key signature is the name of the second-to-last flat in the key signature . <p> Example 1 <p> Figure 4 demonstrates quick ways to name the ( major ) key simply by looking at the key signature . In flat keys , the second-to-last flat names the key . In sharp keys , the note that names the key is one half step above the final sharp . <p> The only major keys that these rules do not work for are C major ( no flats or sharps ) and F major ( one flat ) . It is easiest just to memorize the key signatures for these two very common keys . If you want a rule that also works for the key of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect fourth higher than ( or a perfect fifth lower than ) the final flat . So you can also say that the name of the key signature is a perfect fourth lower than the name of the final flat . <p> Figure 5 : The key of C major has no sharps or flats . F major has one flat . <p> If the music is in a minor key , it will be in the relative minor of the major key for that key signature . You may be able to tell just from listening whether the music is in a major or minor key . If not , the best clue is to look at the final chord . That chord ( and often the final note of the melody , also ) will usually name the key .

Explain . <h> Commentary <p> In the middle grades , students have lots of experience analyzing and comparing linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal descriptions . In this task , students may choose a representation that suits them and then reason from within that representation . <p> To find the point of intersection in part ( b ) , tabular approaches must extend beyond integer domain values . Halves , quarters , and tenths of hours can help students gradually hone in on the intersection , but more efficient methods use general equation solving techniques or proportional reasoning from values in the table . <p> Parts ( c ) and ( d ) require that students imagine changes in one of the two linear graphs ( foreshadowing F-BF.3 ) and then predict what will happen to the point of intersection . <p> When used in instruction , this task provides opportunities to compare representations and to make connections among them . <p> While this problem involves linear functions , other tasks in this set illustrate F.BF.1a in the context of quadratic ( Skeleton Tower ) , exponential ( Rumors ) , and rational ( Summer Intern ) functions . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Kimi and Jordan <p> The weekly total of Kimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the sum of her $8 allowance and ( $9 cdot h ) , where ( h ) is the number of hours she works . In other words , ( K = 8+9h ) . Similarly , the weekly total of Jordan 's allowance and job earnings , ( J ) , is given by ( J = 16+7.5h ) . The graphs of these two equations are shown below . <p> The graphs show that if they work less than ( 5frac13 ) hours , Jordan has a greater total . But if they work more than ( 5frac13 ) hours , Kimi has a greater total . <p> Their totals are the same at the point of intersection of the graphs . We find the ( h ) -coordinate of this point of intersection by finding the number of hours for which Kimi and Jordan will have the same total , assuming they both work with same number of hours in a week . We do this by setting the expressions for Kimi 's total and Jordan 's total equal and solving for ( h ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that Kimi and Jordan 's totals are the same if they both work for ( 5frac13 ) hours . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were to increase , the dotted line above would have an increased slope and intersect the vertical axis at the same point , which would move the point of intersection to the left . So Kimi and Jordan 's total would be the same if they both worked a number of hours less than ( 5frac13 ) . <p> If Jordan were to have no allowance , the solid line would intersect the vertical axis at ( 0 ) and have the same slope . Because the slope of the solid line is less than that of the dotted line , the lines would not intersect in the first quadrant . So Jordan and Kimi 's totals would never be the same . <p> Solution : Reasoning from the context <p> Kimi 's allowance is less than Jordan 's , but her hourly rate is higher . So for only a few hours worked , she will have less job earnings per week than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her higher hourly rate will more than make up for the lower allowance . We can find the number of hours at which this change occurs by calculating how many hours , at ( $1.50 ) more per hour , it will take to make up the ( $8 ) difference in their allowances : ( $8/ ( $1.50/mboxhour ) = 5frac13 ) hours , or ( 5 ) hours and ( 20 ) minutes . <p> See part ( a ) . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were higher she would be able to make up the allowance difference more quickly . In the above calculation , the denominator would increase and the resulting number of hours would decrease . <p> If Jordan were without an allowance , it would be impossible for him to make up for Kimi 's allowance because his hourly rate is lower . <p> Solution : Tabular solution <p> Based on their allowances and hourly rates , the following table compares their weekly income from 0 to 7 hours . <p> Hours worked , ( h ) <p> 0 <p> 1 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 <p> Kimi 's weekly total , ( K ) <p> 8 <p> 17 <p> 26 <p> 35 <p> 44 <p> 53 <p> 62 <p> 71 <p> Jordan 's weekly total , ( J ) <p> 16 <p> 23.5 <p> 31 <p> 38.5 <p> 46 <p> 53.5 <p> 61 <p> 68.5 <p> From the data in the table , Jordan has a greater total if they both work 0 to 5 hours , and Kimi has a greater total if they both work 6 or 7 hours . Since Kimi 's hourly rate is greater , she will have a greater total for any number of hours worked beyond this as well . <p> From the table above , it looks like their incomes will be the same somewhere between 5 and 6 hours . An income table for quarter hours shows that the their incomes might be equal between ( 5frac14 ) and ( 5frac12 ) hours . Similarly , a table for tenths of hours shows that the incomes might be equal between 5.3 and 5.4 hours . <p> A more efficient strategy is to notice from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each hour , which makes sense as this is the difference between their hourly rates . At 5 hours , the difference is $0.50 , which is ( frac13 ) of $1.50 . So it makes sense to try ( frac13 ) hour more . During this 20 minutes , Kimi will make $3.00 and Jordan will make $2.50 . So in ( 5frac13 ) hours they both will make $56 . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were to increase , then the numbers in the middle row of the table ( after the 8 ) would increase , exceeding the bottom row of the table sooner in the row . So Kimi and Jordan 's totals be the same at less than ( 5frac13 ) hours . <p> If Jordan were to have no allowance , all of the entries in the bottom row of the table would decrease by $16 . Because Jordan 's total increases more slowly than Kimi 's , it would fall further and further behind Kimi 's , and their totals would never be the same . <p> Solution : Purely algebraic solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings , ( K ) , is the sum of her $8 allowance and ( $9 * ( h ) ) , where ( h ) is the number of hours she works . In other words , ( K = 8+9h ) . Similarly , the weekly total of Jordan 's allowance and job earnings , ( J ) , is given by ( J = 16+7.5h ) . Both ( K ) and ( J ) depend on ( h ) , so there is no obvious answer to Jordan 's question without further investigation . <p> First we find the number of hours for which Kimi and Jordan will have the same total , assuming they both work with same number of hours in a week . We do this by setting the expressions for Kimi 's total and Jordan 's total equal and solving for ( h ) : beginalign 9h+8&amp;=7.5h+16 1.5h &amp;= 8 h&amp;=8/1.5=5frac13 endalign Because Jordan 's allowance is greater , this also tells us that Jordan will have a greater total than Kimi if they work less than ( 5frac13 ) hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , then Kimi 's total will be greater . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were greater , the 1.5 in the above solution would be a greater number , and the result of the division would be less . So they would have the same income at less than ( 5frac13 ) hours . <p> Without an allowance Jordan 's total would be given by ( J=7.5h ) . And the solution process above would become as follows : beginalign 9h+8&amp;=7.5h 1.5h &amp;= -8 h&amp;=-8/1.5=-5frac13 endalign This means that their total would be the same if they both worked ( -5frac13 ) hours . This solution to the algebraic equation does not make sense in terms of the context , since they both work a positive number of hours . So their totals would never be equal .

It is harder to visually identify the difference between ( A ) and ( E ) , we compute their respective length-to-width ratios numerically , which turn out to be approximately ( 1.3 ) for ( A ) and ( 1.6 ) for ( E ) .

Explain . <h> Commentary <p> In the middle grades , students have lots of experience analyzing and comparing linear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal descriptions . In this task , students may choose a representation that suits them and then reason from within that representation . <p> To find the point of intersection in part ( b ) , tabular approaches must extend beyond integer domain values . Halves , quarters , and tenths of hours can help students gradually hone in on the intersection , but more efficient methods use general equation solving techniques or proportional reasoning from values in the table . <p> Parts ( c ) and ( d ) require that students imagine changes in one of the two linear graphs ( foreshadowing F-BF.3 ) and then predict what will happen to the point of intersection . <p> When used in instruction , this task provides opportunities to compare representations and to make connections among them . <p> While this problem involves linear functions , other tasks in this set illustrate F.BF.1a in the context of quadratic ( Skeleton Tower ) , exponential ( Rumors ) , and rational ( Summer Intern ) functions . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Kimi and Jordan <p> The weekly total of Kimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the sum of her $8 allowance and ( $9 cdot h ) , where ( h ) is the number of hours she works . In other words , ( K = 8+9h ) . Similarly , the weekly total of Jordan 's allowance and job earnings , ( J ) , is given by ( J = 16+7.5h ) . The graphs of these two equations are shown below . <p> The graphs show that if they work less than ( 5frac13 ) hours , Jordan has a greater total . But if they work more than ( 5frac13 ) hours , Kimi has a greater total . <p> Their totals are the same at the point of intersection of the graphs . We find the ( h ) -coordinate of this point of intersection by finding the number of hours for which Kimi and Jordan will have the same total , assuming they both work with same number of hours in a week . We do this by setting the expressions for Kimi 's total and Jordan 's total equal and solving for ( h ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that Kimi and Jordan 's totals are the same if they both work for ( 5frac13 ) hours . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were to increase , the dotted line above would have an increased slope and intersect the vertical axis at the same point , which would move the point of intersection to the left . So Kimi and Jordan 's total would be the same if they both worked a number of hours less than ( 5frac13 ) . <p> If Jordan were to have no allowance , the solid line would intersect the vertical axis at ( 0 ) and have the same slope . Because the slope of the solid line is less than that of the dotted line , the lines would not intersect in the first quadrant . So Jordan and Kimi 's totals would never be the same . <p> Solution : Reasoning from the context <p> Kimi 's allowance is less than Jordan 's , but her hourly rate is higher . So for only a few hours worked , she will have less job earnings per week than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her higher hourly rate will more than make up for the lower allowance . We can find the number of hours at which this change occurs by calculating how many hours , at ( $1.50 ) more per hour , it will take to make up the ( $8 ) difference in their allowances : ( $8/ ( $1.50/mboxhour ) = 5frac13 ) hours , or ( 5 ) hours and ( 20 ) minutes . <p> See part ( a ) . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were higher she would be able to make up the allowance difference more quickly . In the above calculation , the denominator would increase and the resulting number of hours would decrease . <p> If Jordan were without an allowance , it would be impossible for him to make up for Kimi 's allowance because his hourly rate is lower . <p> Solution : Tabular solution <p> Based on their allowances and hourly rates , the following table compares their weekly income from 0 to 7 hours . <p> Hours worked , ( h ) <p> 0 <p> 1 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 <p> Kimi 's weekly total , ( K ) <p> 8 <p> 17 <p> 26 <p> 35 <p> 44 <p> 53 <p> 62 <p> 71 <p> Jordan 's weekly total , ( J ) <p> 16 <p> 23.5 <p> 31 <p> 38.5 <p> 46 <p> 53.5 <p> 61 <p> 68.5 <p> From the data in the table , Jordan has a greater total if they both work 0 to 5 hours , and Kimi has a greater total if they both work 6 or 7 hours . Since Kimi 's hourly rate is greater , she will have a greater total for any number of hours worked beyond this as well . <p> From the table above , it looks like their incomes will be the same somewhere between 5 and 6 hours . An income table for quarter hours shows that the their incomes might be equal between ( 5frac14 ) and ( 5frac12 ) hours . Similarly , a table for tenths of hours shows that the incomes might be equal between 5.3 and 5.4 hours . <p> A more efficient strategy is to notice from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each hour , which makes sense as this is the difference between their hourly rates . At 5 hours , the difference is $0.50 , which is ( frac13 ) of $1.50 . So it makes sense to try ( frac13 ) hour more . During this 20 minutes , Kimi will make $3.00 and Jordan will make $2.50 . So in ( 5frac13 ) hours they both will make $56 . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were to increase , then the numbers in the middle row of the table ( after the 8 ) would increase , exceeding the bottom row of the table sooner in the row . So Kimi and Jordan 's totals be the same at less than ( 5frac13 ) hours . <p> If Jordan were to have no allowance , all of the entries in the bottom row of the table would decrease by $16 . Because Jordan 's total increases more slowly than Kimi 's , it would fall further and further behind Kimi 's , and their totals would never be the same . <p> Solution : Purely algebraic solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings , ( K ) , is the sum of her $8 allowance and ( $9 * ( h ) ) , where ( h ) is the number of hours she works . In other words , ( K = 8+9h ) . Similarly , the weekly total of Jordan 's allowance and job earnings , ( J ) , is given by ( J = 16+7.5h ) . Both ( K ) and ( J ) depend on ( h ) , so there is no obvious answer to Jordan 's question without further investigation . <p> First we find the number of hours for which Kimi and Jordan will have the same total , assuming they both work with same number of hours in a week . We do this by setting the expressions for Kimi 's total and Jordan 's total equal and solving for ( h ) : beginalign 9h+8&amp;=7.5h+16 1.5h &amp;= 8 h&amp;=8/1.5=5frac13 endalign Because Jordan 's allowance is greater , this also tells us that Jordan will have a greater total than Kimi if they work less than ( 5frac13 ) hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , then Kimi 's total will be greater . <p> If Kimi 's hourly rate were greater , the 1.5 in the above solution would be a greater number , and the result of the division would be less . So they would have the same income at less than ( 5frac13 ) hours . <p> Without an allowance Jordan 's total would be given by ( J=7.5h ) . And the solution process above would become as follows : beginalign 9h+8&amp;=7.5h 1.5h &amp;= -8 h&amp;=-8/1.5=-5frac13 endalign This means that their total would be the same if they both worked ( -5frac13 ) hours . This solution to the algebraic equation does not make sense in terms of the context , since they both work a positive number of hours . So their totals would never be equal . 
@@119689530 @8689530/ <h> The French Horn 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To provide an introduction and history of the French horn <p> The middle-range brass instrument in the Western orchestra or band is sometimes called the horn , sometimes the French horn . It is an aerophone with a conical bore , a fairly small mouthpiece , a widely flaring bell , and about 17 feet of metal tubing wrapped into a circular shape to make it easier to hold . It is a transposing instrument ; most horn music is written in F. <h> The Instrument <p> Figure 1 : The French Horn . <p> As in other brass instruments , the sound of a horn is produced by " buzzing " the lips against the mouthpiece . Players get higher or lower notes by changing the embouchure ( the lips and facial muscles ) , but the three valves that open extra sections of tubing are also needed to get all the notes possible on the horn . The left hand works the valves ; the right hand is normally placed inside the bell of the instrument , where it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its timbre . <p> The most common modern instrument is a double horn , which has two parallel sets of tubing . One set makes it an F horn ; the other a smaller , higher B flat horn . A fourth valve called the trigger is used to switch between the two sides of the instrument . But as a transposing instrument , the double horn is considered to be " in F " ; music for the instrument is usually written in F , allowing individual players to choose whether to use the F or the B flat " side " of the instrument for any given note . <p> Figure 2 : The Range of the French Horn . The modern horn is a transposing instrument ; music for horn is in F , written a perfect fifth higher than it sounds . <p> The mellophone is a brass instrument closely related to the French horn . It is only half the length of a normal horn , which has two useful effects . One is that it is lighter to carry around . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French horn , it is playing lower in the harmonic series , where the harmonics are not so close together and it is not so easy to play the wrong harmonic . Because of these advantages , the bell-front mellophone ( which looks a bit like a rounded oversized trumpet ) is commonly used by French horn players in marching bands . <h> History <p> Figure 3 : Horns and other brass instruments are played by buzzing the lips against the mouthpiece . The very earliest instruments in this family were natural objects ( such as animal horns or this conch shell ) that could be played by buzzing the lips against a hole in one end of the object . <p> The very earliest horns were hollowed-out animal horns , or other natural objects that would resonate at a particular pitch when the player buzzed the lips against a hole in one end . <p> The modern instrument is descended from earlier brass instruments that were used for centuries in Europe for military and hunting purposes . These horns came in various different sizes and shapes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasse ; hence the name " French horn " . This hunting horn , in use in France in the seventeenth century , was a slender tube that was coiled into a large hoop that could easily be slung over a huntsman 's shoulder . The tube was only about 7 feet long and was much more cylindrical than a modern horn . The eighteenth-century cor de chasse , the typical instrument in the orchestra of Bach 's and Handel 's time , was twice as long and coiled into a double hoop . This instrument had no valves and was originally played with the bell pointing up and out . It could therefore play only the notes of a single harmonic series . This severely limited the parts a single instrument could play ; a horn that could play a harmonic series on an E flat fundamental , for example , could play some , but not all , of the notes in the key of E flat , could play even fewer notes in keys closely related to E flat , and could play no notes at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant that a horn player who wanted to be able to play in more than one key would need several different horns , would need time to switch from one horn to another whenever the music changed keys , and would still not be able to play every note in the key . For centuries , the history of the horn was a history of the search for solutions to these limitations . <p> One solution to this problem was to add a second set of players . One pair of horns could play in one key ; the other in the other key . The setup of the modern orchestra often still reflects this early solution , with four horns playing in two pairs , and the third horn part almost acting like another first horn . <p> A second solution was to change the position of the horn so that the bell rested on the player 's leg , and the right hand could be placed inside the bell . The player could then use the hand in two different ways , partially blocking the air flow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially blocking the air lowered the pitch by about a half step , but the full stop basically shortened the playing length of the instrument and thus raised the pitch by about a whole step . The timbre of half-stopped and stopped notes are very different from each other and also very different from the sound of " open " notes . They can sound very jarring to modern ears . But hand-horn technique , invented by a Dresden horn player named Hampl around 1770 , allowed the entire chromatic scale to be played on a single instrument without pause . This was so useful that hand-horn became widely accepted in spite of its timbre idiosyncrasies . In fact , it continued to be expected and used for decades after it was no longer really necessary . <p> Finally , there were many mechanical solutions . A very popular early solution involved adding extra lengths of tubing to the instrument to change its key . There were different ways to add the extra tubing : crooks could be fitted into sockets in the hoop , couplers could be added in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn player could play in many different keys with only one horn and a bag of crooks or couplers . He still needed time to change the crooks on his instrument when the music changed keys , but not as much time as before . To simplify things for the horn player , the composer would indicate which crook was needed ( a movement might be labelled " for horn in A " ) and transpose the part for that instrument . This made the music easy to read - the first harmonic always looked like a C , the third like a G , and so on - easy for the horn player of that time , whose instrument was transposing the notes for him , but harder for a modern horn player trying to read older music , who may have to transpose the A part to her accustomed horn in F. <p> Of course , the ideal horn could switch crooks nearly instantaneously , and many new horns were invented to provide this solution . Some more successful than others . The omnitonic horn attached all crooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tube to another . This made it very easy and fast to change crooks , but hand horn technique was still needed to be able to play any note in the key . <p> The invention that really freed the horn to play the full chromatic scale easily was the valve . A valve can open and close almost instantly , redirecting the air through an extra crook in the middle of the instrument . It 's really not clear who first invented a valved horn and when , but n 1818 a valve horn with two piston valves was patented ; in the 1830 's a third piston was added . Although most other modern brass still use piston valves , the horn switched to rotary valves , apparently invented by Joseph Riedl of Vienna around 1832 . The modern horn uses three rotary valves , which lower its natural ( F ) harmonic series by a half step , a whole step , and one and a half steps , giving the horn a quick and easy chromatic scale . <p> Most modern horns are also double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When instrument makers and players were settling on which of the many instruments ( Horn in D ? In E flat ? ) to use for the modern valved horn , the F horn was originally chosen as having a particularly full , moderate , and pleasing sound . But it is difficult to play high notes accurately on the F horn , so a second set of crooks , for the smaller , higher B flat horn , was added . A fourth valve , or trigger opens the shorter set of crooks , switching the instrument from the F " side " to the B flat " side " to play high notes . <h> Repertoire <p> Horns are part of the standard orchestra . A small orchestra will have two horns , a large one four or more . The first horn ( principal ) part may be so tiring that a large orchestra may have an associate principal horn player to take the principal 's place on some of the program , and/or an assistant principal horn player to play along with the principal on non-solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at least four horns . Some easy-to-find recordings that feature horns in larger ensembles are Strauss ' " Blue Danube " waltz , the " Waltz of the Flowers " from Tchaikovsky 's ballet The Nutcracker , the " Nocturne " from Mendelssohn 's Midsummer Night 's Dream , and the " Ride of the Valkyries " music from Wagner 's opera Die Walkuere . <p> Horns are also well-represented in the chamber music repertoire . The standard brass quintet includes a horn , and so does the standard woodwind quintet . There is also much music written for horn quartet , some - but by no means all - of it derived from orchestral works . <p> In spite of the historic limitations of the instrument ( see history , above ) , several famous composers also wrote solo music for the horn . The most well-known of these are the four Mozart horn concertos . <h> Practical Information for Composers and Arrangers <p> The French horn is a versatile brass instrument with a large range , very useful in many different kinds of arrangements . Played with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can give a military or fanfare flavor , but , played with a mellower tone it also blends very well with orchestral woodwinds . It can give a sweet , haunting color to solos and easily evokes hunting or other pastoral scenes . <p> The most important thing to remember when writing for horn is that it is a transposing instrument ; most players are only comfortable reading parts that have been transposed into F. <p> The horn is a more agile instrument than the lower brass , but not as agile as the trumpet . Avoid writing too many fast notes or large leaps in a row . Note also that the horn plays higher in its harmonic series than other orchestral brass instruments . This means the notes at the top of the intrument 's range ( the notes above the treble staff in the instrument 's written range ) that have the same fingering are so close together that it is very easy to hit the wrong note . Use this range sparingly unless writing for professionals .

Some reactions also produce electricity , which at first glance appears to have a lot of potential in the environment . A reaction can produce electricity if the reaction can be made to occur in a galvanic cell , a vessel for a reaction that forces the electrons that are transferred between the reactants to do work and produce an electrical current . This article focuses on the different pieces of galvanic cells and what they do . <h> The Chemicals <p> Most galvanic cells will consist of two reactions , one that is an oxidation reaction and one that is reduction reaction . This is because an oxidation reaction produces free electrons , and a reduction reaction requires free electrons , so the electrons can transfer between the two reactions and do electrical work and produce electricity . Both oxidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present either before or after the reaction ; they have not been completely transferred from one chemical to another . Typically each half-reaction occurs in its own container , which are often made of class . <p> Example 1 : Galvanic cells can be comprised of a huge variety of different half-reactions . For instance , the two half-reactions for a galvanic cell can be <p> Most half-reactions that include polyatomic molecules/ions will also include hydrogen ions and water molecules , which come from balancing the reactions . <h> Cathode and Anode <p> There are certain locations in the galvanic cell designated for the half-reactions . The reduction reaction occurs in the cathode . The oxidation reaction occurs in the anode . For a pair of chemicals , one can be selected as the cathode and the other will be the anode . Both of the chemicals that are included in the chemical equations on the sides of those equations without free electrons are called electrodes and have a wire connecting them to transmit electrons and let them use their electricity to power some device . <p> Example 3 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron and lithium . If you want iron to be in the cathode , it will be reduced , and you could have the half-reaction <p> $$Fe3+ + 3e- rightarrow Fe$$ <p> This means the anode contains lithium and thus the lithium gets oxidized : <p> $$Li rightarrow Li+ + e-$$ <p> Alternatively , you could let the anode contain iron and the cathode contain lithium . In this case the reactions are <p> $$Li+ + e- rightarrow Li$$ $$Fe rightarrow Fe3+ + 3e-$$ <p> However , for every cathode-anode pair for the two half-reactions , only one will generate electricity . The other half-reactions , which are collectively called nonspontaneous , require electricity to occur , and these are not galvanic cells , but electrolytic cells . <h> The Salt Bridge <p> A salt bridge is a key part of a galvanic cell , because it is a source of cations and ions for the cell . Without a salt bridge , the reactants for the half-reactions would run out very quickly , and the electricity produced by the cell would be short-lived .

Chords built only of consonances sound pleasant and " stable " ; you can listen to one for a long time without feeling that the music needs to change to a different chord . Notes that are dissonant can sound harsh or unpleasant when played at the same time . Or they may simply feel " unstable " ; if you hear a chord with a dissonance in it , you may feel that the music is pulling you towards the chord that resolves the dissonance . Obviously , what seems pleasant or unpleasant is partly a matter of opinion . This discussion only covers consonance and dissonance in Western music . <p> Of course , if there are problems with tuning , the notes will not sound good together , but this is not what consonance and dissonance are about . ( Please note , though , that the choice of tuning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound dissonant ! ) <p> Consonance and dissonance are subjective qualities of relationship that we assign to music intervals . A quick review of intervals might be helpful if you 're approaching the subject for the first time . A dissonant interval can be described as being " unstable " or demanding treatment by resolving to a consonant interval . A consonant interval is one that is stable and does not demand treatment . However , dissonance in itself is not an undesirable thing ; we use dissonance to provide the " spice " to music . Thus , there is a hierarchy of consonant and dissonant intervals . ( Chords having dissonant intervals are themselves considered dissonant ) . <p> Note that this distinction depends entirely on musical context . As such , a sonority which is consonant in one context where it does not seem to demand resolution ( say , major 2nds in a Debussy prelude ) may sound harsh or out-of-place in a different context where it must be resolved ( the same major 2nds in a Bach fugue ) . In this article , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissonant " as they are understood in common-practice tonal music , as is the tacit convention when speaking of consonance and dissonance in general . <p> Consonance and dissonance refer to intervals and chords . The interval between two notes is the number of half steps between them , and all intervals have a name that musicians commonly use , like major third ( which is 4 half steps ) , perfect fifth ( 7 half steps ) , or octave . <p> An interval is measured between two notes . When there are more than two notes sounding at the same time , that 's a chord . Of course , you can still talk about the interval between any two of the notes in a chord . <p> The simple intervals that are considered to be consonant are the minor third , major third , perfect fourth , perfect fifth , minor sixth , major sixth , and the octave . <p> Figure 1 : Consonant Intervals . <p> In modern Western Music , all of these intervals are considered to be pleasing to the ear . Chords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable " , restful chords that do n't need to be resolved . When we hear them , we do n't feel a need for them to go to other chords . <p> The intervals that are considered to be dissonant are the minor second , the major second , the minor seventh , the major seventh , and particularly the tritone , which is the interval in between the perfect fourth and perfect fifth . <p> Figure 2 : Dissonant Intervals . <p> These intervals are all considered to be somewhat unpleasant or tension-producing . In tonal music , chords containing dissonances are considered " unstable " ; when we hear them , we expect them to move on to a more stable chord . Moving from a dissonance to the consonance that is expected to follow it is called resolution , or resolving the dissonance . The pattern of tension and release created by resolved dissonances is part of what makes a piece of music exciting and interesting . Music that contains no dissonances can tend to seem simplistic or boring . On the other hand , music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for example , much of twentieth-century " classical " or " art " music ) can be difficult for some people to listen to , because of the unreleased tension . <p> Figure 3 : In most music a dissonance will resolve ; it will be followed by a consonant chord that it naturally leads to , for example a G seventh chord resolves to a C major chord , and a D suspended fourth resolves to a D major chord . A series of unresolved dissonances , on the other hand , can produce a sense of unresolved tension . <p> Why are some note combinations consonant and some dissonant ? Preferences for certain sounds is partly cultural ; that 's one of the reasons why the traditional musics of various cultures can sound so different from each other . Even within the tradition of Western music , opinions about what is unpleasantly dissonant have changed a great deal over the centuries . But consonance and dissonance do also have a strong physical basis in nature . <p> In simplest terms , the sound waves of consonant notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dissonant notes . For example , if two notes are an octave apart , there will be exactly two waves of one note for every one wave of the other note . If there are two and a tenth waves or eleven twelfths of a wave of one note for every wave of another note , they do n't fit together as well . <h> Consonant Intervals in Tonal Music <p> ( bullet ) The perfect fifth and the perfect octave are considered perfect consonances . The unison is a consonance insofar as it can be considered an interval at all ( many say it can not ) . ( bullet ) The major third and sixth , as well as the minor third and sixth , are imperfect consonances. ( bullet ) The perfect fourth is dissonant in some contexts but consonant in others ( see below ) . Specifically , the perfect fourth is dissonant when it is formed with the bass note of any sonority . <h> Dissonant Intervals <p> ( bullet ) The perfect fourth is considered dissonant in common practice music when not supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ( bullet ) Major and minor seconds , sevenths , and ninths are dissonant . Composer/theorist Vincent Persichetti , in his book Twentieth-Century Harmony , classifies major 2nds , minor 7ths , and major 9ths as " soft dissonances , " whereas minor 2nds , major 7ths , and minor 9ths are " sharp dissonances. " ( bullet ) The tritone ( an augmented fourth or diminished fifth ) is dissonant . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance , it was known as diabolus in musica because the perfect fifth was considered to be a reflection of the divine , and the tritone falls just short of a perfect fifth . Note for the advanced : Technically , it is not proper to refer to the diminished fifth as a " tritone . " The word " tritone " refers to " three whole-tones , " the distance represented by the tritone . This means that the augmented fourth , which comprises three whole-tones , is a true tritone , while the diminished fifth , because of its accidental-spelling , is not made up of three whole-tones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable as an informal convention to refer to the diminished fifth as a " tritone. " ( bullet ) In Jazz , the minor 9th is often considered too dissonant for practical use . This is the basis for some notes being called " avoid notes " , typically the 4th of a major scale - it sounds dissonant because it forms a minor 9th with the 3rd . Other " avoid notes " are the minor 6th in aeolian mode , or the minor 2nd in phrygian mode . Some chords are typically voiced to avoid a minor 9th ( musicians invert the interval and play a major 7th instead ) . For example , in a Cadd11 chord ( see Complete List of Chord Patterns ) , there is a minor ninth between the third , E and the eleventh F. If the F is played below the E , the interval becomes a major seventh , which is less dissonant . <h> The perfect fourth <p> The perfect fourth is the inversion of the perfect fifth . In common practice music , it can be both consonant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for resolution when unsupported by lower notes , in which case it is dissonant even though it sounds as " good " as the fifth . The fourth is always consonant when supported by a lower third or perfect fifth , for example , E-G-C-E is consonant , but G-C-E is dissonant . In more contemporary music , many consider the fourth to always be as consonant as the fifth . <p> In Medieval music , the perfect fourth was even considered a perfect consonance , as the perfect fifth and the octave . However , this attitude no longer prevails .

This is because an oxidation reaction produces free electrons , and a reduction reaction requires free electrons , so the electrons can transfer between the two reactions and do electrical work and produce electricity . Both oxidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present either before or after the reaction ; they have not been completely transferred from one chemical to another .

If you want iron to be in the cathode , it will be reduced , and you could have the half-reaction <p> $$Fe3+ + 3e- rightarrow Fe$$ <p> This means the anode contains lithium and thus the lithium gets oxidized : <p> $$Li rightarrow Li+ + e-$$ <p> Alternatively , you could let the anode contain iron and the cathode contain lithium .

Since ( 30 times 60 = 1800 ) , we can write $$ 2011 = 30 times 60 + 211. $$ Next , ( 60 ) goes into ( 211 ) three times , with a remainder of 31 so we get $$ 2011 = 30 times 60 + 3 times 60 + 31. $$ Using the distributive property this last expression is equivalent to $$ 2011 = ( 30 + 3 ) times 60 + 31. $$ So 2011 minutes is the same as 33 hours and 31 minutes . Now 33 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that 2011 minutes is one day , nine hours , and thirty-one minutes . So 2011 minutes after the beginning of 2011 it is January 2 and it is 9:31 AM.

@@119689567 @8689567/ <h> Major Keys and Scales 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To learn about the list of major scales <p> The simple , sing-along , nursery rhymes and folk songs we learn as children ; the " catchy " tunes used in advertising jingles ; the cheerful , toe-tapping pop and rock we dance to ; the uplifting sounds of a symphony : most music in a major key has a bright sound that people often describe as cheerful , inspiring , exciting , or just plain fun . <p> How are these moods produced ? Music in a particular key tends to use only some of the many possible notes available ; these notes are listed in the scale associated with that key . In major keys , the notes of the scale are often used to build " bright " -sounding major chords . They also give a strong feeling of having a tonal center , a note or chord that feels like " home " , or " the resting place " , in that key . The " bright " -sounding major chords and the strong feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moods . This contrasts with the moods usually suggested by music that uses minor keys , scales , and chords . Although it also has a strong tonal center ( the Western tradition of tonal harmony is based on major and minor keys and scales ) , music in a minor key is more likely to sound sad , ominous , or mysterious . In fact , most musicians , and even many non-musicians , can distinguish major and minor keys just by listening to the music . <h> Tonal Center <p> A scale starts with the note that names the key . This note is the tonal center of that key , the note where music in that key feels " at rest " . It is also called the tonic , and it 's the " do " in " do-re-mi " . For example , music in the key of A major almost always ends on an A major chord , the chord built on the note A. It often also begins on that chord , returns to that chord often , and features a melody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often enough that listeners will know where the tonal center of the music is , even if they do n't realize that they know it . <h> Major Scales <p> To find the rest of the notes in a major key , start at the tonic and go up following this pattern : whole step , whole step , half step , whole step , whole step , whole step , half step . This will take you to the tonic one octave higher than where you began , and includes all the notes in the key in that octave . <p> EXAMPLE 1 <p> Figure 1 : All major scales have the same pattern of half steps and whole steps , beginning on the note that names the scale - the tonic . <p> In the example above , the sharps and flats are written next to the notes . In common notation , the sharps and flats that belong in the key will be written at the beginning of each staff , in the key signature . <h> Music in Different Major Keys <p> What difference does key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , they all sound very much alike . Here is the tune " Row , Row , Row Your Boat " , written in G major and also in D major . <p> EXAMPLE 1 <p> Figure 2 : In G Major <p> Figure 3 : In D Major <p> The music may look quite different , but the only difference when you listen is that one sounds higher than the other . So why bother with different keys at all ? Before equal temperament became the standard tuning system , major keys sounded more different from each other than they do now . Even now , there are subtle differences between the sound of a piece in one key or another , mostly because of differences in the timbre of various notes on the instruments or voices involved . But today the most common reason to choose a particular key is simply that the music is easiest to sing or play in that key .

Because of this difference , students will likely approach the parts of the task in different ways .

If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by 8 , we get an equivalent ratio that involves 1 cup of butter . $$8times frac34 = 6$$ and $$8times frac18 = 1$$ <p> In other words , ( frac34 : frac18 ) is equivalent to ( 6 : 1 ) , and so six cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of butter . <p> In the previous part we saw that we have 8 times as much butter , so all the ingredients need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantity of each ingredient in the original recipe needs to be multiplied by 8 in order for all the ratios to be the same in the new mixture . <p> The ratio of cups of blueberries to cups of butter is ( frac38 : frac18 ) in the original recipe , so Travis will need to add ( 8timesfrac38=3 ) cups of blueberries to his new mixture . <p> The ratio of cups of sugar to cups of blueberries is ( frac34 : frac38 ) . If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by ( frac83 ) , we get an equivalent ratio . <p> ( frac83 times frac34 = 2 ) and ( frac83 times frac38 = 1 ) . <p> Since ( frac34 : frac38 ) is equivalent to ( 2 : 1 ) , two cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of blueberries . <p> The ratio of cups of butter to cups of sugar is ( frac18 : frac34 ) . If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by ( frac43 ) , we get an equivalent ratio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( frac12 : 1 ) , Travis would need ( frac12 ) cup of blueberries if there is one cup of sugar . <p> Instructional Note : For part ( b ) , I have encouraged students to think about unit fractions as an intermediate step to developing an understanding of how to multiply by fractions . With the emphasis on unit fractions in the CCSSM , I decided to use this approach this year and have found success . Students see the value of scaling to a unit fraction and then going from there . <p> For example , if a student realizes that ( frac38 ) needs to become 1 to answer part ( b.i ) , she can first take ( frac13 ) of the amount to create a unit fraction of ( frac18 ) and then multiply this by 8 to create 1 . <p> The composite result of these calculations is equivalent to multiplying by ( frac83 ) . Students often find that the two calculations ( taking ( frac13 ) of the amount to create a unit fraction of ( frac18 ) and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible , which makes them a nice intermediate step in understanding the composite calculation of multiplying by the reciprocal . <p> Solution : Using tables <p> The ratio of cups of sugar to cups of butter is ( frac34 : frac18 ) . If we set up a table , we can successively double the amounts : <p> cups of sugar <p> ( frac34 ) <p> ( frac64 ) <p> ( frac124 ) <p> ( frac244=6 ) <p> cups of butter <p> ( frac18 ) <p> ( frac28 ) <p> ( frac48 ) <p> ( frac88=1 ) <p> So six cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of butter . <p> In the previous part , we had to double the quantities three times : ( 2cdot2cdot2=8 ) . So Travis needs 8 times as much butter as the original recipe required . If we want to keep all the ingredients in the same ratio , Travis needs to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 8 . <p> The ratio of cups of blueberries to cups of butter is ( frac38 : frac18 ) in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8cdot frac38=3 ) cups of blueberries . <p> It is much harder to solve this problem using a table because the scale factor is no longer a whole number . Students who solved the first part using a table may need guidance from their classmates or the teacher to see that multiplying both numbers in the ratio by the reciprocal of the amount of blueberries will give an equivalent ratio with 1 cup of blueberries . Here is where the teacher should highlight the importance of being able to find a unit rate . <p> The ratio of cups of sugar to cups of blueberries is ( frac34 : frac38 ) . If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by ( frac83 ) , we get an equivalent ratio . <p> ( frac34 times frac83 = 2 ) and ( frac38 times frac83 = 1 ) . <p> So two cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of blueberries . <p> The ratio of cups of butter to cups of sugar is ( frac18 : frac34 ) .

Explain how you know . <h> Commentary <p> Exponential functions with a base larger than one eventually exceed in value any given linear ( or polynomial ) function if the value of the input is sufficiently large .

A recipe context works especially well since there are so many different pair-wise ratios to consider . <p> This task can be modified as needed ; depending on the choice of numbers , students are likely to use different strategies which the teacher can then use to help students understand the connection between , for example , making a table and strategically scaling a ratio . <p> The choice of numbers in this task is already somewhat strategic : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole number and in part ( b ) , the scale factors are fractions . Because of this difference , students will likely approach the parts of the task in different ways . The teacher can select and sequence a discussion of the different approaches to highlight the structure of the mathematics and allow for connections to proportional relationships . <p> This task was submitted by Travis Lemon for the first IMP task writing contest 2011/12/12-2011/12/18 . <h> Solutions 212258 @qwx1072258 <p> The ratio of cups of sugar to cups of butter is ( frac34 : frac18 ) . If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by 8 , we get an equivalent ratio that involves 1 cup of butter . $$8times frac34 = 6$$ and $$8times frac18 = 1$$ <p> In other words , ( frac34 : frac18 ) is equivalent to ( 6 : 1 ) , and so six cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of butter . <p> In the previous part we saw that we have 8 times as much butter , so all the ingredients need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantity of each ingredient in the original recipe needs to be multiplied by 8 in order for all the ratios to be the same in the new mixture . <p> The ratio of cups of blueberries to cups of butter is ( frac38 : frac18 ) in the original recipe , so Travis will need to add ( 8timesfrac38=3 ) cups of blueberries to his new mixture . <p> The ratio of cups of sugar to cups of blueberries is ( frac34 : frac38 ) . If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by ( frac83 ) , we get an equivalent ratio . <p> ( frac83 times frac34 = 2 ) and ( frac83 times frac38 = 1 ) . <p> Since ( frac34 : frac38 ) is equivalent to ( 2 : 1 ) , two cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of blueberries . <p> The ratio of cups of butter to cups of sugar is ( frac18 : frac34 ) . If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by ( frac43 ) , we get an equivalent ratio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( frac12 : 1 ) , Travis would need ( frac12 ) cup of blueberries if there is one cup of sugar . <p> Instructional Note : For part ( b ) , I have encouraged students to think about unit fractions as an intermediate step to developing an understanding of how to multiply by fractions . With the emphasis on unit fractions in the CCSSM , I decided to use this approach this year and have found success . Students see the value of scaling to a unit fraction and then going from there . <p> For example , if a student realizes that ( frac38 ) needs to become 1 to answer part ( b.i ) , she can first take ( frac13 ) of the amount to create a unit fraction of ( frac18 ) and then multiply this by 8 to create 1 . <p> The composite result of these calculations is equivalent to multiplying by ( frac83 ) . Students often find that the two calculations ( taking ( frac13 ) of the amount to create a unit fraction of ( frac18 ) and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible , which makes them a nice intermediate step in understanding the composite calculation of multiplying by the reciprocal . <p> Solution : Using tables <p> The ratio of cups of sugar to cups of butter is ( frac34 : frac18 ) . If we set up a table , we can successively double the amounts : <p> cups of sugar <p> ( frac34 ) <p> ( frac64 ) <p> ( frac124 ) <p> ( frac244=6 ) <p> cups of butter <p> ( frac18 ) <p> ( frac28 ) <p> ( frac48 ) <p> ( frac88=1 ) <p> So six cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of butter . <p> In the previous part , we had to double the quantities three times : ( 2cdot2cdot2=8 ) . So Travis needs 8 times as much butter as the original recipe required . If we want to keep all the ingredients in the same ratio , Travis needs to multiply the amount of each ingredient by 8 . <p> The ratio of cups of blueberries to cups of butter is ( frac38 : frac18 ) in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8cdot frac38=3 ) cups of blueberries . <p> It is much harder to solve this problem using a table because the scale factor is no longer a whole number . Students who solved the first part using a table may need guidance from their classmates or the teacher to see that multiplying both numbers in the ratio by the reciprocal of the amount of blueberries will give an equivalent ratio with 1 cup of blueberries . Here is where the teacher should highlight the importance of being able to find a unit rate . <p> The ratio of cups of sugar to cups of blueberries is ( frac34 : frac38 ) . If we multiply both numbers in the ratio by ( frac83 ) , we get an equivalent ratio . <p> ( frac34 times frac83 = 2 ) and ( frac38 times frac83 = 1 ) . <p> So two cups of sugar is needed if there is one cup of blueberries . <p> The ratio of cups of butter to cups of sugar is ( frac18 : frac34 ) .

Is Alex correct ? Explain how you know . <h> Commentary <p> Exponential functions with a base larger than one eventually exceed in value any given linear ( or polynomial ) function if the value of the input is sufficiently large .

Continuing the table <p> Notice in the table that for the smaller values of ( x ) which Alex has plugged in , ( 1.001x ) grows roughly like $$ 1 + fracx1000. $$ If this behavior were to persist , then ( 2x ) would always remain larger than ( 1.001x ) because its slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the table , it appears as if the values of ( 1.001x ) are beginning to grow a little faster .

Explain . <h> Commentary <p> The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities in a context with equations and interpret the resulting system of equations in the context . This task has a wide array of uses : it could be an introductory task to systems of equations or used in assessment . The task initially has the students write out different equations for two different scenarios . Then the students can consider the two equations together , which naturally leads into a discussion on the point of intersection of two graphs and into systems of equations . Students are asked to reason abstractly and make sense of the representations of the relationships between two quantities in the context ( MP2 ) . <p> This task also asks the student to not only consider what ( m ) ( the amount of money they spend ) would be for different values of ( d ) ( the number of days they swim ) but what would ( d ) be for a certain value of ( m ) . Although it is not mentioned in the solution until part ( e ) , this task also provides a good opportunity to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense in this context , although we make a continuous line in our graphs . We do this to see the general trend and compare the two relationships more easily , and because we are asked to graph our equations , not a table of discrete values . <h> Solutions 212257 @qwx1072257 <p> Let ( m ) represent the amount of money you spend , and let ( d ) represent the number of days you go to the pool . At full price , you would spend $7 per day , so ( m=7d ) represents the amount of money you would spend without the special offer . <p> Again , let ( m ) represent the amount of money you spend , and let ( d ) represent the number of days you go to the pool . With the special offer , you would spend $30 once , and then $4 per day , so ( m=4d+30 ) represents the amount of money you would spend with the special offer . <p> We can graph these equations on the same set of axes : <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we want to find out after how many days we will be spending less money than with the full price passes . For example , after 3 days , the full price offer will cost us $21 dollars and the special offer will cost us $39 , so the special will cost more . We see that this is because of the initial fee of $30 . <p> Algebraically , we can determine exactly when the special offer costs the same amount as the standard price by setting our two expressions for ( m ) equal to each other and solving for ( d ) . $$4d+30=7d$$ $$30=3d$$ $$d=10. $$ So , when ( d=10 ) , or on the 10th day , the special offer and the original will have cost us the same amount of money : $$m=7(10)=70$$ and $$m=4(10)+30=70. $$ Because on the 11th day , and every day thereafter , the special offer will cost less ( $4 a day versus $7 a day ) , we can conclude that after the 10th day is when the special offer becomes a better deal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special offer drops below the graph of the original offer after ( d=10 ) , and as lower translates into less money spent , we can see our conclusion in the graph , as well . <p> We have a total of $60 to spend , and so ( m=60 ) . We can substitute this into the equation for each offer . <p> Special offer : $$60=4d+30 implies 30=4d implies frac304=7.5=d$$ Since ( d ) represents days , and we can only go for full days , ( .5 ) of a day does not make sense , and so we find that with $60 , we can go to the pool for 7 days if we take the special offer . <p> Original offer : $$60=7d implies frac607=8frac47=d$$ Again , we can not visit the swim center for ( frac47 ) of a day , and so with $60 we are able to go for a full 8 days if we take the full price offer . <p> Therefore , we should take the original offer if we only have $60 to spend , because we can go for an additional day over the special offer .

The same goes for rests . But what if you want a note ( or rest ) length that is n't half of another note ( or rest ) length ? <h> Dotted Notes <p> One way to get a different length is by dotting the note or rest . A dotted note is one-and-a-half times the length of the same note without the dot . In other words , the note keeps its original length and adds another half of that original length because of the dot . So a dotted half note , for example , would last as long as a half note plus a quarter note , or three quarters of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it is adding another note half the length of the original note . A dotted quarter note , for example , would be the length of a quarter plus an eighth , because an eighth note is half the length of a quarter note . <p> A note may have more than one dot . Each dot adds half the length that the dot before it added . For example , the first dot after a half note adds a quarter note length ; the second dot would add an eighth note length . <p> Figure 2 : When a note has more than one dot , each dot is worth half of the dot before it . <h> Tied Notes <p> A dotted half lasts as long as a half note plus a quarter note . The same length may be written as a half note and a quarter note tied together . Tied notes are written with a curved line connecting two notes that are on the same line or the same space in the staff . Notes of any length may be tied together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound they stand for will be a single note that is the length of all the tied notes added together . This is another way to make a great variety of note lengths . Tied notes are also the only way to write a sound that starts in one measure and ends in a different measure . <p> NOTES : Ties may look like slurs , but they are not the same ; a slur connects to notes with different pitches and is a type of articulation . <p> Figure 3 : When these eight notes are played as written , only five distinct notes are heard : one note the length of two whole notes ; then a dotted half note ; then another note the same length as the dotted half note ; then a quarter note ; then a note the same length as a whole note plus a quarter note . <h> Borrowed Divisions <p> Dots and ties give you much freedom to write notes of varying lengths , but so far you must build your notes from halves of other notes . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halves or halves of halves - if you want to divide a beat into thirds or fifths , for example - you must write the number of the division over the notes . These unusual subdivisions are called borrowed divisions because they sound as if they have been borrowed from a completely different meter . They can be difficult to perform correctly and are avoided in music for beginners . The only one that is commonly used is triplets , which divide a note length into equal thirds . <p> Figure 4 : Any common note length can be divided into an unusual number of equal-length notes and rests , for example by dividing a whole note into three instead of two " half " notes . The notes are labeled with the appropriate number . If there might be any question as to which notes are involved in the borrowed division , a bracket is placed above them . Triplets are by far the most common borrowed division . <p> Figure 5 : In a compound meter , which normally divides a beat into three , the borrowed division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple meter . You may also see duplets in swing music . <p> Notes in jazzy-sounding music that has a " swing " beat are often assumed to be triplet rhythms , even when they look like regular divisions ; for example , two written eighth notes ( or a dotted quarter-sixteenth ) might sound like a triplet quarter-eighth rhythm . In jazz and other popular music styles , a tempo notation that says swing usually means that all rhythms should be played as triplets . Straight means to play the rhythms as written . <p> NOTES : Some jazz musicians prefer to think of a swing rhythm as more of a heavy accent on the second eighth , rather than as a triplet rhythm , particularly when the tempo is fast . This distinction is not important for students of music theory , but jazz students will want to work hard on using both rhythm and articulation to produce a convincing " swing " . <p> Figure 6 : Jazz or blues with a " swing " rhythm often assumes that all divisions are triplets . The swung triplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be written as " straight " eighth notes or dotted eighth-sixteenths .

A monotonically increasing function is one that increases as ( x ) does for all real ( x ) . A monotonically decreasing function , on the other hand , is one that decreases as ( x ) increases for all real ( x ) . In particular , these concepts are helpful when studying exponential and logarithmic functions . <h> Monotonically Increasing Functions <p> The graphs of exponential and logarithmic functions will be crucial here . From them we can see a general rule : <p> If ( a &gt; 1 ) , then both of these functions are monotonically increasing : <p> $$f(x) = ax$$ $$g(x) = loga(x)$$ <p> By looking at a sufficient number of graphs , we can understand this .

The red one is ( f(x) = 3x ) while the green one is ( g(x) = 3x + 1 ) : <p> Notice that as ( x ) is increasing , ( f(x) ) is increasing . Now notice this algebraic manipulation : <p> $$g(x) = 3x + 1 = 3 cdot 3x = 3f(x)$$ <p> Therefore , ( g(x) ) is also monotonically increasing . You can multiply ( f(x) ) by any positive constant , and the values of the new function will continue to grow at a faster or slower rate as ( x ) increases . <p> Now we consider a logarithmic function . <p> Example 2 : We will use an example involving the common logarithm . Let ( f(x) = log10(x) ) . A graph is shown below : <p> The graph is curved upward where the function is defined ( positive real numbers ) , in a way that it is always increasing . Any logarithm with a positive base will have a similar pattern . <p> Example 3 : Explain why ( x = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) . <p> Solution : Over the real numbers , the function ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing , so there can only be one solution , because no value of ( y ) is achieved on the graph twice . <h> Monotonically Decreasing Functions <p> Monotonically decreasing functions are basically the opposite of monotonically increasing functions . As a result : <p> If ( f(x) ) is a monotonically increasing function over some interval , then ( -f(x) ) is a monotonically decreasing function over that same interval , and vice-versa . <p> Here is an example of a monotonically decreasing function . <p> Example 4 : Consider the graph of ( f(x) = -5x ) , shown below : <p> The function ( 5x ) is monotonically increasing , so ( f(x) = -5x ) must be monotonically decreasing , because wherever ( 5x ) is increasing ( everywhere ) , ( f(x) ) is decreasing . <h> When a Function is not Monotonically Increasing or Decreasing <p> There are some functions that are not monotonically increasing nor monotonically decreasing .

Therefore the function will alternate between increasing and decreasing as ( x ) increases . <p> Main Group 3 : Trigonometric Functions <p> Consider basic trigonometric functions such as ( sin(x) ) , which move up and down , and thus do not exclusively increase or decrease . <p> Main Group 4 : Functions with Discontinuities <p> A function can not increase or decrease over any type of discontinuity , especially when the discontinuity is caused by an undefined value ( i.e. ( x = 0 ) in ( f(x) = frac1x ) ) . <p> Monotonically increasing and decreasing graphs can be identified by graphs , but this is not a very rigorous method .

One of these is known as the Octet Rule . This rule states that an atom will always attempt to have a full set of eight valence electrons by bonding with other atoms either covalently or ionically .

Overall , the Octet Rule is one of the most important fundamentals of chemical bonding . <h> General Trends <p> The amount of electrons an element will tend to gain or lose depends on the number of electrons in the atom 's valence shell .

A chemical consisting of an aluminum ion and a bromide ion in their stable states would be ( AlBr2+ ) , but it is not an ionic compound because it has a charge .

Nitrogen , on the other hand , is in Group V and has five valence electrons , so it needs to gain three electrons to get a full valence shell .

@@119689681 @8689681/ 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> The objective of this article is to introduce monotonically increasing and decreasing functions and their properties , specifically pertaining to exponential and logarithmic functions . 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> The groups of monotonically increasing and monotonically decreasing functions have some special properties . A monotonically increasing function is one that increases as ( x ) does for all real ( x ) . A monotonically decreasing function , on the other hand , is one that decreases as ( x ) increases for all real ( x ) . In particular , these concepts are helpful when studying exponential and logarithmic functions . <h> Monotonically Increasing Functions <p> The graphs of exponential and logarithmic functions will be crucial here . From them we can see a general rule : <p> If ( a &gt; 1 ) , then both of these functions are monotonically increasing : <p> $$f(x) = ax$$ $$g(x) = loga(x)$$ <p> By looking at a sufficient number of graphs , we can understand this . Over an interval on which a function is monotonically increasing ( or decreasing ) , an output for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 : Consider these two graphs . The red one is ( f(x) = 3x ) while the green one is ( g(x) = 3x + 1 ) : <p> Notice that as ( x ) is increasing , ( f(x) ) is increasing . Now notice this algebraic manipulation : <p> $$g(x) = 3x + 1 = 3 cdot 3x = 3f(x)$$ <p> Therefore , ( g(x) ) is also monotonically increasing . You can multiply ( f(x) ) by any positive constant , and the values of the new function will continue to grow at a faster or slower rate as ( x ) increases . <p> Now we consider a logarithmic function . <p> Example 2 : We will use an example involving the common logarithm . Let ( f(x) = log10(x) ) . A graph is shown below : <p> The graph is curved upward where the function is defined ( positive real numbers ) , in a way that it is always increasing . Any logarithm with a positive base will have a similar pattern . <p> Example 3 : Explain why ( x = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) . <p> Solution : Over the real numbers , the function ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing , so there can only be one solution , because no value of ( y ) is achieved on the graph twice . <h> Monotonically Decreasing Functions <p> Monotonically decreasing functions are basically the opposite of monotonically increasing functions . As a result : <p> If ( f(x) ) is a monotonically increasing function over some interval , then ( -f(x) ) is a monotonically decreasing function over that same interval , and vice-versa . <p> Here is an example of a monotonically decreasing function . <p> Example 4 : Consider the graph of ( f(x) = -5x ) , shown below : <p> The function ( 5x ) is monotonically increasing , so ( f(x) = -5x ) must be monotonically decreasing , because wherever ( 5x ) is increasing ( everywhere ) , ( f(x) ) is decreasing . <h> When a Function is not Monotonically Increasing or Decreasing <p> There are some functions that are not monotonically increasing nor monotonically decreasing . There are an infinite number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Main Group 1 : Constant Functions <p> These are straight lines , so they are not decreasing or decreasing . <p> Main Group 2 : Absolute Value Functions <p> Functions surrounded by an absolute value sign are always nonnegative , but then all non-constant functions of this type will have a minimum . Therefore the function will alternate between increasing and decreasing as ( x ) increases . <p> Main Group 3 : Trigonometric Functions <p> Consider basic trigonometric functions such as ( sin(x) ) , which move up and down , and thus do not exclusively increase or decrease . <p> Main Group 4 : Functions with Discontinuities <p> A function can not increase or decrease over any type of discontinuity , especially when the discontinuity is caused by an undefined value ( i.e. ( x = 0 ) in ( f(x) = frac1x ) ) . <p> Monotonically increasing and decreasing graphs can be identified by graphs , but this is not a very rigorous method .

The task also provides the background required to understand the mathematical definition of translation of a point by a line segment . Using the notation of this problem , if ( overlineAB ) is a line segment then the translation of the point ( D ) by segment ( overlineAB ) can be defined in two steps : <p> If ( D ) lies on ( overleftrightarrowAB ) then the translation of ( D ) by ( overlineAB ) is the point ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( overrightarrowDC ) intersected with ( overrightarrowAB ) is a ray . <p> If ( D ) does not lie on ( overleftrightarrowAB ) then the translation of ( D ) by ( overlineAB ) is the point ( C ) defined in this task .

The second objective of this article is to demonstrate and elaborate on the natural logarithm 's special properties . 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Logarithms are known as the inverse operations of exponential functions of the same base , so the two types of functions undo each other . It does not matter whether you apply the logarithm or the exponent first " the result is the same . If the base of the logarithm is Euler 's number , ( e ) , there are special properties that the function has . It is called the natural logarithm , and uses the notation ( ln ) to reflect upon that . To demonstrate the base of the natural logarithm : <p> $$ln ( e ) = 1$$ $$ln(ea) = a$$ <p> Natural logarithms follow all the properties that other logarithms do , but there are some special patterns that can be observed .

@@119689712 @8689712/ <h> What does the Octet Rule Mean ? 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> In chemical bonding , there are some trends that apply to the majority of chemical compounds . One of these is known as the Octet Rule . This rule states that an atom will always attempt to have a full set of eight valence electrons by bonding with other atoms either covalently or ionically . The way that the Octet Rule works varies for different types of compounds , so in this article we will explore the different possibilities in an organized fashion . Overall , the Octet Rule is one of the most important fundamentals of chemical bonding . <h> General Trends <p> The amount of electrons an element will tend to gain or lose depends on the number of electrons in the atom 's valence shell . An atom will always try to ionize to its stable state with the transfer of the fewest electrons possible . <p> Example 1 : A fluorine atom can get a full valence shell by either gaining one more electron , or by losing seven electrons .

It can either lose four electrons or gain four electrons to get a full valence shell . Note that either transition requires the transfer of the same number of electrons , so which ion results depends on the other chemicals involved . Note that in an ionic compound comprised of a metal and carbon , carbon will form the ( -4 ) carbide ion and form compounds such as magnesium carbide ( Mg2C ) and sodium carbide ( Na4C ) . <p> Here is a table of the group that a chemical is in and its most common transaction of gaining or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group Electrons gained/lost <p> LONG ... <p> 1 Lose 1 electron <p> 2 Lose 2 electrons <p> 3 Lose 3 electrons <p> 4 Lose 4 electrons/gain 4 electrons , depends on situation <p> 5 Gain 3 electrons <p> 6 Gain 2 electrons <p> 7 Gain 1 electrons <p> 8 These chemicals , known as the noble gases , already have a full valence shell and thus tend to be unreactive ( inert ) . <h> Binary Ionic Compounds <p> In an ionic compound , electrons are not shared between ions . Each valence electron is designated to belong to a specific ion in the bond . In a binary ionic compound ( one with only two different types of ions ) , each valence electron belongs to either the cation or anion . When either the cation or anion is polyatomic , it becomes more complicated . We can say that the electron belongs to either the cation or anion , but then we need to determine how it is shared between atoms that comprise the polyatomic ion . We will worry about this special case later . <p> Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one valence electron and chlorine atoms have seven . If a single electron is transferred from the sodium atom to the chlorine atom , then we get ( Na+ ) and ( Cl- ) , two ions in stable states . Thus we only need one of each atom to form this stable ionic compound , and both ions now satisfy the Octet Rule . <p> Example 5 : Consider Aluminum Bromide , ( AlBr3 ) . Aluminium is in Group III , and it tends to lose three electrons to form an ion with a full octet ( meaning it obeys the Octet Rule ) . Bromine atoms tend to gain just one electron to get to a full octet , as Bromine is in Group VII . A chemical consisting of an aluminum ion and a bromide ion in their stable states would be ( AlBr2+ ) , but it is not an ionic compound because it has a charge .

However , by the Octet Rule it would like to gain one electron to get a full octet of valence electrons . Two fluorine atoms can each " sacrifice " one of their valence electrons to form a single bond between the atoms . Now each fluorine atom has six valence electrons to itself . However , the bond consists of two additional valence electrons for each fluorine atom ( as the electrons are shared ) , so both fluorine atoms now have a full octet . Thus fluorine is more stable as a diatomic molecule . <p> Below is a Lewis Structure for elemental fluorine for reference . Note that only valence shell electrons are included in the picture . <p> Now , recall that double bonds and triple bonds exist . These have slightly different advantages compared to single bonds . In particular , they allow even more electrons to be shared between two atoms . If a double bond exists between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a triple bond , the two atoms share six valence electrons . The Octet Rule still applies regardless of which type of covalent bond is involved . <p> Example 8 : Consider ( O2 ) , oxygen 's elemental form . Lone oxygen atoms have six valence electrons . However , oxygen is even more stable in groups of two atoms , because each oxygen atom can " sacrifice " two valence electrons , giving a total of four electrons used to bond the two atoms . Since there are four valence electrons to share , this is a double bond . Each oxygen atom has four valence electrons to itself and four that are shared through the double bond . Thus each oxygen atom now has a full octet . Below is the Lewis Structure . <p> Example 9 : Consider ( N2 ) , nitrogen 's elemental form .

For part ( b ) of the problem , the teacher may wish to provide extra guidance , indicating that the goal is to use the calculations from part ( a ) to situate the annual interest rate earned by the rare coin . Also worth discussing is the fact that banks do not credit interest to accounts on an annual basis but rather at the end of each month : the monthly interest rate will , however , correspond to some annual interest rate so this does not change the nature of the calculations . <p> It is good for everyone , teachers and students , to spend a moment seeing the power of compounding interest which is revealed in this problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but yield fantastic results over a long period of time : of course the results are magnified even further if money is being deposited or invested on a regular basis , as opposed to a single deposit in this situation .

The all time record for sales price of any quarter was set in 1990 when a 1901 San Francisco quarter reportedly sold for an astonishing $550,000 . The teacher could give this data point for an additional calculation to see if the annual rate of return for this coin exceeds 15% . Since this task was written , a new record price of $1,527,000 was set in November , 2013 by an extraordinary 1796 quarter dollar , the first date produced by the United States of America . <p> Students will engage in MP8 ' ' Look For and Express Regularity in Repeated Reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying a similar exponential expression with different interest rates but also these formulas themselves come from compounding the annual interest 112 times in each case . Students also have an opportunity to ' ' Look For and Make Use of Structure ' ' ( MP7 ) when they produce the exponential expressions used to solve part ( a ) : the exponential growth of the bank account balance comes from the fact that it grows by an equal factor each year . Finally , if the teacher wishes to discuss MP6 ' ' Attend to Precision ' ' there is an ideal opportunity here because banks , when they credit interest , round off to the nearest cent : this is not taken into account in the exponential formulas in the solution . Therefore the actual bank balance after 112 years will likely differ , and could differ substantially , from the answers given . For the 5% interest rate , for example , for the first several years , the account will only be credited with 1 cent ( as opposed to 1 cent plus a fraction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is between one and a half cents and two cents , the amount of credited interest will be two cents . It would be interesting to study how much these rounding errors tend to cancel each other out . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : 1 Exponential equations <p> From January 1 , 1901 to January 1 , 2013 is 2013 - 1901 = 112 years . To develop an expression for the bank account balance after 112 years , we can start by looking at the balance after 1 , 2 , and 3 years . We begin with the 5% interest rate . So on January 1 , 1902 we will have our initial $0.25 and an additional 5% : $$ $0.25 times ( 1.05 ) = $0.2625. $$ After 2 years we will have the $0.2625 from the first year plus an additional 5% interest on this amount : $$ $0.25 times ( 1.05 ) 2 = $0.2625 times ( 1.05 ) = $0.275625. $$ After 3 years we will have the $0.275625 from the first year plus an additional 5% interest on this amount : $$ $0.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = $0.28940625. $$ Note that it is difficult to see a pattern in the actual account balances after 1 , 2 , and 3 years . The expressions on the left , however , follow a simple pattern . Each year , the account grows by an additional multiplicative factor of 1.05 : this makes sense as the 1 in 1.05 carries the beginning balance through to the next year and the 0.05 adds the 5% annual interest . So at 5% annual interest , the account balance at the end of ( t ) years would be $$ $0.25 times ( 1.05 ) t. $$ From January 1 , 1901 to January 1 , 2013 is 2013 - 1901 = 112 years so the account balance on January 1 , 2013 would be $$ $ 0.25 times ( 1.05 ) 112 approx $59.04. $$ Note that this is only an approximation : as can be seen from the cases calculated above , each additional year of interest adds two more decimals to the value of the expression ( $0.25 times ( 1.05 ) t ) . <p> The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only part of the expressions that changes is the 1.05 term : with a 10% interest rate this becomes 1.10 and with a 15% interest rate it is 1.15 . <p> A higher appreciation rate brings more money to the account while a lower appreciation rate brings less money to the account . The value of the $0.25 as a rare coin is $60,000 which is greater than $10,812.37 but less than $1,570,717.67 so this means that the appreciation rate of the quarter as a rare coin is greater than 10% but less than 15% . <p> Consider the equation $$ $ 0.25 times x112 = $ 60,000 $$ If we solve for ( x ) we will know what number $0.25 must be multiplied by 112 times , in order to reach $ 60,000 . To solve the equation we can divide both sides by $0.25 giving $$ x112 = frac$ 60,000$ 0.25 = 240,000. $$ We can solve this by extracting a root : $$ x = sqrt112240,000. $$ Using a calculator we find $$ x approx 1.117. $$ From the calculations above , we see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation rate so the coin has appreciated at a rate of about 11.7% per year , in line with our conclusion from part ( b ) . <p> Alternatively we may solve the equation ( x112 = frac$ 60,000$ 0.25 = 240,000 ) by taking a logarithm with base 10 , giving ( logx112 = log240,000 ) which leads to the equation $$ 112logx = log240,000. $$ This gives us that ( logx = fraclog240,000112 ) and , finally , $$ x = **30;571;TOOLONG $$ Using a calculator again shows that ( x approx 1.117 ) and the annual rate by which the coin has appreciated is about 11.7%. 
@@119689728 @8689728/ <h> Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> The objective of this article is to introduce conjugate pairs as a way to relate acids and bases . 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> Acids will release hydrogen ions , and bases will accept them . However , if you remove a hydrogen ion from a molecule , and then add a hydrogen ion , you get the same molecule . For instance : <p> $$HNO3 - H+ + H+ rightarrow HNO3$$ <p> However , immediately after removing the hydrogen ion , you have a nitrate ion , ( NO3- ) . A conjugate acid-base pair is a pair of chemicals whose molecular formulas differ by only one hydrogen ion . Therefore , by adding and removing hydrogen ions , you can toggle between the two chemicals in a conjugate acid-base pair . <h> Identifying Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs <p> As stated before , the two chemicals that are part of an acid-base conjugate pair will have chemical formulas that differ by only one hydrogen atom , and the charge difference between the two chemicals will be 1 . <p> Solution : These chemicals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more oxygen atoms than the other . Also , the difference in charge is ( 2 ) instead of ( 1 ) , and both chemicals have one hydrogen atom , with no difference in hydrogen atoms , so a hydrogen atom can not be transferred to or from one of the chemicals to get the other . <p> This is a slightly different and more difficult example . <p> Example 3 : Use each of the following chemicals once to create two acid-base conjugate pairs : <p> $$H3PO4$$ <p> $$H2PO4-$$ <p> $$HPO42-$$ <p> $$PO43-$$ <p> Solution : These chemicals are ordered in a special way . As you go down the list , the number of hydrogen atoms decrease , and the charge gets more negative , each in increments of 1 for each chemical you pass on the list . Therefore we have a chain of chemicals , and there are many acid-base conjugate pairs . However , we can only use each chemical one time , so pick the two chemicals with the most hydrogen atoms for one pair : <p> $$H3PO4$$ <p> $$H2PO4-$$ <p> That leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid-base pair : <p> $$HPO42-$$ <p> $$PO43-$$ <p> In this example , notice that ( H2PO4- ) and ( HPO42- ) are also a conjugate acid-base pair , but the other two chemicals are not , so this separation of the chemicals does not fully solve the problem . <h> Conjugate Acids vs . Conjugate Bases <p> A conjugate acid is a chemical that results from adding a hydrogen ion to a base . A conjugate base is a chemical that results from removing a hydrogen ion to an acid . A conjugate pair can be either a conjugate acid and a base , or an acid and a conjugate base ; really there are no special properties that distinguish these two groups from each other aside from the terminology . <p> Example 4 : ( HClO2 ) is an acid . If you remove a hydrogen ion from it , you get its conjugate base , the chlorite ion , which has the chemical formula ( ClO2- ) . <p> Example 5 : ( CO32- ) is a base . If you add a hydrogen ion to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its chemical formula is ( HCO3- ) . <p> Acid-base conjugate pairs are important in acid-base chemistry because the two chemicals differ by only one hydrogen ion . The hydrogen ion is a centerpiece of acid-base chemistry for this very reason-many reactions involve two or more conjugate pairs , which means that the transfer of hydrogen ions will occur .

In order to contain ( Q ) we need ( f(3) = -3 ) . If ( f(x) ) goes through ( ( 0,5 ) ) then it is of the form ( f(x) = 5bx ) for some ( b ) . When ( x = 3 ) , ( f ) takes the value ( 5b3 ) .

So none of the graphs of the exponential functions passing through ( P ) also pass through ( Q ) .

This is true when $$ abx = 0 . $$ As we saw in part ( a ) , ( bx ) only takes positive values so the only way ( abx ) could be zero is if ( a = 0 ) . Once ( a = 0 ) then , regardless of what value ( b ) takes , ( f(x) = 0 ) , a linear function .

We also need to know that ( g neq c ) so that dividing by ( g - c ) is legitimate .

If we use ( d = abc ) we find $$ d = LONG ... right ) c. $$ So we can solve for ( a ) : $$ a = LONG ... right ) c $$ Since we have already assumed that ( d ) and ( h ) are positive and ( c neq g ) , these equations for ( a ) and ( b ) make sense and we have found the exponential function of form ( f(x) = aebx ) whose graph passes through the points ( R ) and ( S ) , namely $$ f(x) = abx = LONG ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... right ) ( x-c ) $$ If ( d ) and ( h ) are both negative then so is ( a ) and the above equation still makes sense and is correct . <p> It is an interesting and worthwhile arithmetic exercise to verify that ( f(x) ) is the correct exponential function , that is that ( ( c , d ) ) and ( ( g , h ) ) lie on its graph . The fact that ( ( c , d ) ) is on the graph of ( y = f(x) ) comes from evaluating the expression ( e0 = 1 ) . The fact that ( ( g , h ) ) is on the graph of ( y = f(x) ) comes from the identity $$ elnleft(frachdright) = frachd. $$ <p> Solution : 2 Geometry <p> In preparation for a different approach to part ( c ) , we first resolve part ( a ) using base ( e ) .

In order to contain ( Q ) we need ( f(3) = -3 ) . When ( x = 3 ) , ( f ) takes the value ( 5e3k ) . Regardless of what value ( k ) is , ( 5e3k ) is a positive number and so can never be equal to ( -3 ) . So none of the graphs of the exponential functions passing through ( P ) also pass through ( Q ) . <p> Part ( c ) of the problem can be solved by thinking along the lines suggested by part ( a ) . Suppose for the moment that ( c = 0 ) as in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exponential functions whose graph passes through ( S ) are all of the form $$ f(x) = debx $$ where ( b ) could be any real number . In order for the graph of this exponential function to pass through ( ( g , h ) ) we must have $$ h = debg $$ and this allows us to determine ( b ) : $$ lnh = lnd + lnebg = lnd + bg. $$ Solving for ( b ) gives $$ b = fraclnh - lndg. $$ Thus we have found $$ f(x) = defraclnh - lndgx $$ with the assumption that ( c = 0 ) . <p> In general , if ( c ) is not zero , we may first solve the problem , as above , for ( Rprime = ( 0 , d ) ) and ( Sprime = ( g-c , h ) ) . For this choice of ( Rprime ) and ( Sprime ) the exponential function whose graph contains these two points is $$ f(x) = defraclnh - lndg-cx $$ as we just found above . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find begineqnarray* g(x) &amp;=&amp; f(x-c) &amp;=&amp; defraclnh - lndg-c(x-c) endeqnarray* We see that ( g(x) ) is the same as the exponential function ( f(x) ) we found in the first solution , since ( lnh -lnd = lnleft(frachdright) ) .

@@119689742 @8689742/ <h> Wind Instruments : Some Basics 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To introduce the different wind instruments and the components of the instruments 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> The brass and woodwind sections of the orchestra - all the instruments that one blows into to produce a sound - are called the wind instruments , or winds . The technical term for these instruments is aerophones . There are several basic terms that you need to know in order to discuss wind instruments and the playing of wind instruments . Some of the most common are introduced here . <h> Mouthpieces : Getting the Sound Started <p> In most wind instruments , the air is blown into the instrument at or near one end of the tube and exits at the other end . The place where the air is blown in is the mouthpiece . It is often detachable from the instrument , allowing the player to use the same mouthpiece on different instruments , or different mouthpieces on the same instrument , as needed . The sound vibration usually begins at the mouthpiece , and wind instruments are classified by mouthpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reed plants ( the pieces are called simply reeds ) in their mouthpieces . The reed vibrates very quickly , opening and closing the end of the instrument like an incredibly fast valve . When the rapid puffs of air coming through this " valve " cause a sympathetic vibration of the air in the body of the instrument , the result is a woodwind sound . When they do n't , the result is a squeak familiar to all reed players . In a single-reed instrument , the reed vibrates against the mouthpiece . In a double-reed instrument , two pieces of reed vibrate against each other . <p> In flute-type instruments , a narrow airstream vibrates quickly over and under a sharp edge . <p> In brass instruments , the players lips vibrate against each other and against the rim of a cup mouthpiece . Note that an instrument is classified as brass not because it is made of metal , but because it has this type of mouthpiece , which relies on vibrating lips . <p> In all of these cases , the mouthpiece vibration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , magnifies , and turns into a pretty sound . <h> Bells and Bores : The Shape of the Instrument <p> Most wind instruments are vaguely tube-shaped , because a long , thin column of air is a good place to set up a standing waves of air . The properties of this standing sound wave inside the instrument are what give the sound its pitch , its dynamic level ( loudness or softness ) , its harmonics , and its timbre ( color ) . So an instrument 's sound depends mostly on the size and shape of the tube that the air moves through . <p> NOTE : Interestingly , whether the tube is straight or bent into circles or ovals does n't seem to affect the sound much , although a very sharp bend in the instrument does affect the sound a little . Whether an instrument is straight or bent into circles usually depends on what 's easiest for the musician to hold and the instrument-maker to shape . <p> The air enters the instrument at the mouthpiece . After a length of tube which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the instrument often flares abruptly . This flared section at the end of the instrument is the bell . The bell can be quite large and gradual , as in a French horn , or small and abrupt , as in a trumpet , or even narrowing , as in a bassoon . <p> Figure 1 : Basic Wind Instrument <p> In between the mouthpiece and the bell , the space inside the instrument that the air moves through is the bore of the instrument . The bore of an instrument is often described as being either cylindrical or conical . A cylindrical bore stays about the same width from the mouthpiece to the bell . A conical bore gets gradually wider as it moves from the mouthpiece to the bell . The bore of the instrument strongly affects its timbre . <p> Figure 2 : Bore affects the timbre of the instrument . In general , instruments with a cylindrical bore have a more direct sound with less complex harmonics . Instruments with a conical bore usually have a mellower sound with more complex harmonics . <h> Lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most wind instruments require the player to do something very specific with the lips and the facial muscles while blowing , in order to get a good , controlled sound . ( Brass instruments will get no sound at all unless the lips are buzzing against each other and the mouthpiece . ) The formal term for what a player does with the lips and face is embouchure ; the informal term is chops . <p> Unless they are slurred , notes played on wind instruments are tongued . This means that the tongue , which has temporarily blocked or interrupted the airstream , begins each note by releasing the airstream again . Tonguing is usually done with the tip of the tongue , as if the player is saying " tah " . But sometimes , when the music is very fast , some wind players will double tongue ( tah-kah-tah-kah ) or triple tongue ( tah-kah-tah tah-kah-tah ) the notes , using the back as well as the front of the tongue . Flutes can also get an effect called flutter tongue by using an articulation that resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , the fingers are usually involved in making the column of air in the instrument shorter or longer , to make the pitch higher or lower . This may involve a sliding section of the instrument ( as in a trombone ) , or fingerholes that can be covered or uncovered with the fingers ( as in recorders ) . <p> In most modern instruments , however , it usually involves either keys or valves . The fingering of a note is the keys or valves that need to be held down for that note . But most instruments can get more than one note with the same fingering , by changing the embouchure to get different harmonics of the standing wave . In fact , brass winds can get so many different harmonics with one fingering that changing the embouchure is the main way to play the instrument . Brass usually use valves , and woodwinds usually use keys . Keys and valves work in fundamentally different ways . <p> That vibrating standing-wave column of air inside the instrument generally ends at the first place where air can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for explanation purposes ) , the more fingers a recorder player is holding down , the longer the column of air and the lower the pitch . But it can be difficult ( on some large instruments , impossible ) to completely cover all the holes with the fingers , so most modern woodwind instruments use keys instead . The fingers press down the keys , and the keys cover the holes as needed , usually with a pad that covers the hole more completely than a finger could , and sometimes also using a lever that let 's the finger press in one easy-to-reach spot , while the lever presses the pad over a hole in a more-difficult-to-reach spot . <p> Figure 3 : In general , the more holes that are closed with a key or covered by a finger , the longer the standing wave inside the instrument , and the lower the pitch . <p> Valves are more commonly found on brass instruments . Pressing a valve makes the air flow through an extra section of tube , temporarily making the instrument longer in between the mouthpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly lower fundamental harmonic , and a lower harmonic series . ( A few valves are ascending valves , which cut off a section of tubing and so raise the pitch . ) Press the button in this animation to see how the air gets redirected through one type of ( descending ) valve . <p> Figure 4 : Valves <p> The figure and the animation show one type of piston valve . Other styles of valves , including rotary valves as well as other types of piston valves , have different arrangements for the air flow inside the valve , but the purpose is always to redirect the air when the valve is pressed , opening up or cutting off a section of tubing . <p> Most brass instruments can play an entire chromatic scale with just a few valves . They use small changes in the embouchure to get many different notes from the harmonic series for each valve . But woodwinds have many more keys and fingerings available . Typically a woodwind can play the notes in an entire octave just by changing fingerings . Then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to the next harmonic , so that the next octave can be played . This big change is called overblowing . <p> Some brass instruments may also have a spit valve , a small hole that is normally closed but that the player can open quickly with a small key . This is not used while playing the instrument . It is used to empty the instrument of what players call " spit " . Water vapor from the warm , moist breath of the player condenses in the instrument , especially when it is cold . ( And , yes , there 's probably a little actual spit in it , too , but not much ) . This can cause a bubbling sound in the tone . The spit valve is placed at a spot where the water naturally accumulates ( due to gravity ) , giving the player a way to quickly empty the instrument during rests . <h> Wood and Brass : Instrument Materials <p> Calling the two main wind sections of the orchestra woodwinds and brass is a bit misleading . The important difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , not what the instrument is made of . ( In a brass instrument , the lips are buzzed against the rim of the mouthpiece .

They may be the normal color of brass metal , or they may be tinted to a different metallic color . For example , nickel may be added to the alloy to give the instrument a silver color . Occasionally brass instruments are not made of metal at all ; for example , the sousaphone , a tuba used in marching bands , is often made of ( lighter-weight ) fiberglass . <p> Woodwinds are often made of hardwood , but saxophones are normally made of brass , and most orchestral flutes are made of " nickel-silver " brass .

Nerve cells , skin cells , muscle cells , and many more . These cells obviously have many different functions , yet they all develop from the first cell that makes you . So do they all have the same DNA ? Are all the cells in your body genetically identical ? How does the first cell of an organism know to become two cells , then four cells , and so on ? What tells these cells what to do ? Your body produces about 25 million genetically identical cells every second . These new cells are formed when older cells divide , a process called cell division or cell reproduction . Cell division is the final step in the life of a cell , otherwise known as the cell cycle . Eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cell cycle is a repeating series of events , during which the eukaryotic cell carries out its necessary functions , including metabolism , cellular growth , and division , resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells . To produce two genetically identical daughter cells , the chromosomes need to replicate and the nucleus and cytoplasm need to divide . These are key events in the life of a cell . <p> Cell Division in Prokaryotes <p> Prokaryotic organisms reproduce asexually by binary fission , a process that produces identical offspring ( Figure 1 ) . In asexual reproduction , a single parent produces genetically identical offspring . As prokaryotes do not have a nucleus , and have only one circular chromosome , they do not need to reproduce by the same mechanism as eukaryotic cells . Prokaryotic cell division is a much simpler process . In prokaryotic cell division , after the single chromosome is copied , the cell grows larger . Eventually the two chromosomes separate and move to opposite ends of the cell . Newly formed cell membrane then grows into the center of the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical daughter cells . The formation of two daughter cells is called cytokinesis . Under ideal conditions , reproduction in bacteria is extremely efficient , with some bacteria reproducing every 20 minutes . This makes bacteria an extremely effective tool for the molecular biologist . However , bacteria do not usually live in ideal conditions ; otherwise , bacteria would grow and divide extremely rapidly , eventually covering the surface of Earth . Bacterial growth is limited by nutrients and water , predation , and by their own wastes . <p> Cell Division in Eukaryotes <p> Cell division in eukaryotic organisms is very different from that in prokaryotes , mainly because of the many chromosomes in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells . Cell division in eukaryotic organisms is necessary for development , growth , and repair . This cell division ensures that each resulting daughter cell receives a complete copy of the organisms entire genome . Remember that all of an organisms DNA must be present in each somatic , or body , cell . This DNA contains the information necessary for that cell to perform its functions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cell division , the eukaryotic cells complete genome must be copied , ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete set of the genome . <p> The formation of gametes , an organisms reproductive cells , such as sperm and egg cells , involves a completely different method of cell division . This cell division ensures that each gamete receives half the amount of an organisms DNA . <p> Figure 1 : Binary fission . In binary fission , the single chromosome is copied and eventually separates into two separate chromosomes , the cell grows larger , and two identical cells form by cytokinesis . <p> DNA , Chromosomes , and Genes <p> DNA contains the information necessary to make proteins , direct a cells activities , and give an organism its traits . This information is organized into structural units scattered along the length of the DNA molecule . These units are known as genes . A gene contains the information necessary to encode an RNA molecule or a protein . A single DNA molecule contains hundreds to thousands of genes . Different cell types use the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives different cell types distinct activities . Thus , a liver cell will have many different proteins than a kidney cell , giving the two cells types distinct activities . When a cell is using the information within a gene , the segment of DNA containing that gene is unwound , exposing the double helix to the cell machinery needed to use that information . <p> Prior to cell division , the DNA must duplicate itself in a process called DNA replication . This ensures that each resulting cell receives a complete set of the organisms genome . But how is the replicated DNA divided up evenly ? What guarantees that each new cell will receive a complete set of DNA ? It was the identification of chromosomes that allowed this process to be characterized . As a eukaryotic cell prepares to divide , the DNA and associated proteins ( histones ) coil into a structure , known as a chromosome ( Figure 2 ) . The DNA copies itself prior to this process , so the chromosome that forms consists of two identical chromatids , known as sister chromatids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached at a region called the centromere . The chromatids separate from each other when the nucleus divides just prior to cell division . Thus , each new cell that results after cell division will have the complete amount of genetic material , identical to the original , or parent , cell . In human cells , this amounts to 46 chromosomes . These chromosomes come in pairs ( one from each pair inherited from each parent ) . So these 46 chromosomes are actually two sets of 23 chromosomes each . <p> Figure 2 : A representation of a condensed eukaryotic chromosome , as seen after the DNA has been copied . The chromosome is made of two identical , or sister , chromatids held together by a centromere . <p> Each human somatic cell ( a body cell , or every cell other than a gamete ) normally has two sets of chromosomes , one set inherited from each parent . Each set contains 23 chromosomes , for a total of 46 chromosomes . Each chromosome differs in size , from over 250 million nucleotide pairs to less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific set of genes , making each chromosome essential to survival . <p> Each pair of chromosomes consists of two chromosomes that are similar in size , shape , and genes . These pairs of chromosomes are known as homologous chromosomes , or homologues . Upon fertilization , a zygote is formed ( Figure 3 ) . A zygote is the first cell of a new individual . In humans , a zygote contains 23 pairs ( or two sets ) of chromosomes . Any cell containing two sets of chromosomes is said to be diploid . The zygote forms from the fusion of two haploid gametes . A haploid cell contains one set of chromosomes . In humans , a haploid gamete contains 23 chromosomes . Biologists use the symbol n to represent one set of chromosomes , and 2n to represent two sets . In humans , each set of chromosomes contains 22 autosomes and 1 sex chromosome . Autosomes are chromosomes that are not directly involved in determining the sex of an individual . The sex chromosomes contain genes that determine the sex of an individual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed . In humans , a zygote has 46 chromosomes , 23 inherited from each parent . The gametes , sperm and eggs , are haploid cells , with 23 chromosomes each . <p> Whereas autosomes are found as homologous pairs in somatic cells , sex chromosomes come in two different sizes , shapes , and contain different genes . In many organisms , including humans , the sex chromosomes are known as the X and Y chromosomes . The Y chromosome contains genes that cause male development . Therefore , any individual with a Y chromosome is male , and a male will have both an X and Y chromosome ( XY ) . Females , without a Y chromosome , will have two X chromosomes ( XX ) . As females have two X chromosomes , they must pass an X chromosome to all of their children . As males have both an X chromosome ( inherited from their mother ) and a Y chromosome , they can give either chromosome to their children . If a child inherits a Y from his father , he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , she will be female . It therefore is the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring . <p> The Cell Cycle <p> Cell division in eukaryotic cells is much more complex than in prokaryotic cells because of the many chromosomes within the nucleus . Both the cytoplasm and the genetic material must be divided , ensuring that each resulting daughter cell receives 46 separate chromosomes . To ensure this , in addition to the cell performing its necessary functions , the DNA must be copied , as must many organelles , prior to cell division . <p> The life of a eukaryotic cell is a cycle , known as the cell cycle ( Figure 4 ) . The cell cycle is a repeating series of cellular growth and division . The cell cycle has five phases : the first growth ( ( G1 ) ) phase , the synthesis ( S ) phase , the second growth ( ( G2 ) ) phase , mitosis , and cytokinesis , though many consider mitosis and cytokinesis to be combined into one phase . The cell spends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cycle , collectively known as interphase . After cytokinesis , two genetically identical daughter cells are formed . <p> Figure 4 : The Cell Cycle . The cell cycle depicts the life of an eukaryotic cell . The cell cycle has five phases : the first growth ( ( G1 ) ) phase , the synthesis ( S ) phase , the second growth ( ( G2 ) ) phase , mitosis ( M ) , and cytokinesis ( C ) . The cell spends the majority of the cycle in the first three phases ( ( G1 ) , S , ( G2 ) ) of the cycle , collectively known as interphase . After cytokinesis , two genetically identical daughter cells are formed . Many consider the cell cycle to only have four phases , with mitosis and cytokinesis combined . <p> The first growth ( ( G1 ) ) phase : The cell spends most of its life in the ( G1 ) phase . During this phase , a cell undergoes rapid growth and the cell performs its routine functions . If a cell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The synthesis ( S ) phase : For two genetically identical daughter cells to be formed , the cells DNA must be copied or replicated . When the DNA is replicated , both strands of the double helix are used as templates to produce two new complementary strands . These new strands then hydrogen bond to the template strands and two double helices form . <p> The second growth ( ( G2 ) ) phase is a shortened growth period in which many organelles are reproduced or manufactured . Parts necessary for cell division are made during ( G2 ) . <p> Mitosis is the phase of nuclear division , in which one nucleus divides and becomes two nuclei . After mitosis is cytokinesis , in which the cytoplasm divides in half , producing two daughter cells , each containing a complete set of genetic material . <p> Mitosis <p> Mitosis is the division of the cells nucleus , the final step before two daughter cells are produced . The cell enters mitosis as it approaches its size limitations . Four distinct phases of mitosis have been recognized : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each phase merging into the next one ( Figure 5 ) . <p> Figure 5 : During mitosis , the nucleus divides , paving the way for two cells to be produced after cell division , each with a complete makeup of genetic material . <p> Prophase is the first and longest phase of mitosis . During prophase , the DNA coils up into visible chromosomes , each made up of two sister chromatids held together by the centromere . The nucleus disappears as the nuclear envelope and nucleolus break apart . The centrioles begin to move to opposite ends , or poles , of the cell . As the centrioles migrate , the fiber-like spindle begins to elongate between the centrioles . The spindle is a thin , cage-like structure made out of microtubules . In plant cells , the spindle forms without centrioles . The spindle plays an essential role moving chromosomes and in the separation of sister chromatids . <p> During metaphase the spindle attaches to the centromere of each chromosome . Helped by the spindle , the chromosomes line up at the center , or equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . Each sister chromatid is attached to a separate spindle fiber , with one fiber extending to one pole , and the other fiber extending to the other pole . This ensures that the sister chromatids separate and end up in distinct cells after cell division . <p> Anaphase is the phase in which the sister chromatids separate . The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the shortening of the microtubules of the spindles , similar to the reeling in of a fish by the shortening of the fishing line . One sister chromatid moves to one pole of the cell , and the other sister chromatid moves to the opposite pole . At the end of anaphase , each pole of the cell has a complete set of chromosomes , identical to the amount of DNA at the beginning of ( G1 ) of the cell cycle . <p> Telophase is essentially the opposite of prophase . The chromosomes begin to unwind in preparation to direct the cells metabolic activities . The spindle begins to break down , allowing a new nucleus to form . This is followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two genetically identical cells , ready to enter ( G1 ) of the next cell cycle . The phases of mitosis are summarized in Figure 6 . <p> Figure 6 : Mitosis . The phases of mitosis are depicted . The second phase , metaphase , is shown with the chromosomes lined up at the equator of the cell and the microtubule spindle fibers extending from the centrioles to the centromeres of the chromosomes . <p> Cytokinesis ( Figure 7 ) differs between plant and animal cells . In animal cells , the plasma membrane pinches inward along the cells equator until two cells are formed . In plant cells , a cell plate forms along the cells equator . A new membrane grows along each side of the cell plate , with a new cell wall forming on the outside of each new membrane . <p> Figure 7 : Cytokinesis . In this electron micrograph of a cell , two formation of two new cells is almost complete , as new membrane grows and divides the parent cell . <p> Control of the Cell Cycle <p> How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell know when to replicate the DNA ? The answers to these questions have to do with the control of the cell cycle . But how is the cell cycle controlled ? <p> The cell cycle is controlled by a number of protein-controlled feedback processes . Two types of proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle are kinases and cyclins . Cyclins activate kinases . Cyclins are a group of proteins that is rapidly produced at key stages in the cell cycle . Kinases activate other target molecules . It is this precise regulation of proteins that triggers advancement through the cell cycle . <p> The cell cycle has key checkpoints . When the cell receives key signals or information ( feedback regulation ) , the cell can begin the next phase of the cell cycle . The cell can also receive signals that delay passage to the next phase of the cell cycle . These signals allow the cell to complete the previous phase before moving forward . Three key checkpoints are the cell growth ( ( G1 ) ) checkpoint , the DNA synthesis ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The cell growth ( ( G1 ) ) checkpoint allows the cell to proceed into the S phase of the cell cycle and continue on to divide . The cell spends most of the cycle in the ( G1 ) phase . ( G1 ) is where the cell carries out its main functions . If the cell has performed its functions and has grown to significant size to be divided in half , key proteins will stimulate DNA replication to begin . If the cells are not to divide , such as some muscle and nerve cells , the cell will stop at this checkpoint and move into a resting phase . Some cells may stay in this resting period permanently , never dividing . <p> The DNA synthesis ( ( G2 ) ) checkpoint determines if the cell is ready for mitosis . DNA repair enzymes check the replicated DNA at this point . If the checkpoint is passed , the many molecular mechanisms and processes needed for mitosis will begin . <p> The mitosis checkpoint determines the end of one cycle and the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing the cell to prepare for the beginning of ( G1 ) of the next cell cycle . <p> Cancer and the Cell Cycle <p> Many cancers result from uncontrolled cell division , when the regulation of the cycle is lost ( Figure 8 ) . Cancerous cells divide much more rapidly than healthy cells . These cells use the blood and nutrients that other cells need and they can stress the environment of the healthy cells . As cancerous cells do not provide any useful function to the organism , they are extremely harmful . If cancerous cells are allowed to grow uncontrolled , they will kill the host organism . Many cancerous cells are the products of normal cells that have lost the ability to regulate the cell cycle . The genes that encode the proteins involved in cell cycle regulation have mutations . One category of genes , called oncogenes , accelerate the cell cycle . Many cancers can be inherited , such as breast cancer . Others are triggered by an environmental stimulus , such as through the relationship between tobacco smoke and lung cancer , or ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer .

In general , for two-dimensional vector-valued functions : <p> $$E(t) = &lt; x(t) , y(t) &gt;$$ <p> For three-dimensional vector-valued functions : <p> $$E(t) = &lt; x(t) , y(t) , z(t) &gt;$$ <p> This can theoretically be expanded for a vector in any number of dimensions , but it is not practical to expand this concept beyond three dimensions , so we will stop here . There are a number of operations and calculations that can be done with these vectors , which we will cover in this article . <h> The Magnitude of a Vector-Valued Function <p> The first key operation is the magnitude of the vector-valued function . For a vector-valued function ( E(t) = ) , the magnitude of the vector-valued function is : <p> $$E(t) = sqrt ( x ( t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vector-valued function in three dimensions , the formula is quite similar : <p> $$E(t) = sqrt ( x ( t ) ) 2 + ( y(t) ) 2 + ( z(t) ) 2$$ <p> This is basically an application of the Distance Formula . Here are some examples for specific vector-valued functions . <p> Example 3 : A car is being driven on a flat and level road so that its eastward velocity is ( 20 + 4sin t ) and its southward velocity is ( 50 + 11cos t ) for some time ( t ) in minutes . Find its speed at time ( frac59pi2 ) minutes . <p> Solution : The velocity is a vector-valued function in two dimensions . The functions of the components are ( 20 + 4sin t ) and ( 50 + 11cos t ) , so the magnitude of the velocity ( the speed ) is represented by <p> ( t = frac59pi2 ) can be substituted into this expression to get a speed of ( 55.326 ) miles per hour . <h> Dot Products <p> Two standard vectors can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dot product is the product of two vectors ' individual corresponding components . For two vectors ( a = &lt; ax , ay &gt; ) and ( b = &lt; bx , by &gt; ) , the dot product between them is <p> Regardless of how many dimensions are involved , the dot product will always be a scalar quantity , NOT a vector . These definitions can be expanded to vector-valued functions , where the dot product will be in terms of the same variable as the initial vector-valued functions . <p> We will now proceed to show a limited number of examples . The examples will be limited in this section because there are not very many applications of the dot product . <p> Author 's Anecdote/Example 6 : In my junior year of high school , I enrolled in a mathematics course entitled " Advanced Topics in Mathematics , " which serves as a sampling of many higher-level topics in mathematics . A significant amount of time was devoted to vector calculus , where we explored dot products , among other things . My instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would yield the compatibility between two people . The inputs are based on preferences for three ( or more ) items or things , such as foods , sports , and so forth . <p> However , in this scenario , you are ready to test your program , which gives a compatibility factor of <p> $$C = a cdot b + frac1a cdot b$$ <p> ( a ) and ( b ) are both vector-valued functions with three inputs ( or three components ) . You can not find any data for two people to test your program , so you decide to substitute the following generic vector-valued functions in for ( a ) and ( b ) : <p> $$a = &lt; t , -1 , -2 &gt;$$ $$b = &lt; t , t , frac12 &gt;$$ <p> Assume that the compatibility can be solely determined from a value of ( t ) such that no component of either vector has a magnitude greater than ( 5 ) . Under these circumstances : <p> a . Find ( C ) in terms of ( t ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfies the given requirements that maximizes the compatibility factor between the two people ( skip this part if you have not yet had differential calculus ) . This part of the problem is included to further emphasize the application component of the article . <p> This gives solutions of ( t = 0 ) and ( t = 1 ) . Summarizing , the solutions appear to be ( t = -1 , 0 , frac12 , 1 ) , and ( 2 ) . However , because we took a square root in the process of finding these solutions , they must be checked to ensure they are not extraneous . <p> Therefore , all five solutions to the equation involving ( C ' ) represent extrema on the graph of ( C ) . We must now use the Second Derivative Test to determine which extrema are maxima ( and which ones are minima ) . For starters , differentiate the expression for ( C ' ) to find ( C ' ' ) : <p> This point also represents a local minimum on ( C ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 ) and ( t = 1 ) .

There are twice as many raspberries as blueberries , three times as many grapes as cherries , and four times as many cherries as raspberries . <p> How many cherries are there in the fruit salad ? <h> Commentary <p> The purpose of this task is for students to solve a contextual problem where there is a multiplicative relationship between several quantities in the context . These relationships can either be represented in a ratio table or with a linear equation . Both approaches are valuable and the teacher can link the two by discussing what happens when a variable is used for the number of blueberries in the ratio table . For the algebraic approach , the student is faced with a dilemma : setting the variable equal to the number of cherries leads to a linear equation with fractions while using the number of blueberries as the variable gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up and solving an equation with positive rational coefficients of the form ( px=q ) as described in 6 .

Notice that for the table we successively doubled the number of blueberries which also successively doubles the number of pieces of the other fruits . Students may notice , after the second line , that if they quadruple 70 , this will give the desired 280 pieces of fruit , making the table a little shorter . <p> Solution : Writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for the number of cherries in the fruit salad and will introduce a variable to relate the number of pieces of each fruit . If we let our variable denote the number of cherries then a some work is needed to set up our relationship because the first sentence in the problem deals with blueberries and raspberries . There are twice as many raspberries as blueberries so it is natural to let ( x ) denote the number of blueberries . Then we find the following : <p> Fruit <p> Number of pieces <p> Blueberries <p> ( x ) <p> Raspberries <p> ( 2x ) <p> Cherries <p> ( 8x ) <p> Grapes <p> ( 24x ) <p> Adding up the total number of pieces of fruit gives 35(x) . We have 280 pieces of fruit total so we want to solve $$ 35x = 280. $$ So ( x = 280 div 35 = 8 ) . There are 8 times as many cherries as blueberries so there are 64 cherries . <p> Solution : Another way to write the equation ( 6 . EE.7 ) <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit salad , it is natural to let ( x ) denote the number of cherries . <p> There are 4 times as many cherries as raspberries , so there are ( frac14 ) as many raspberries as cherries . <p> There are 2 times as many raspberries as blueberries , so there are ( frac12 ) as many blueberries as raspberries . Half of one-fourth is one-eighth , so there are ( frac18 ) as many blueberries as cherries . <p> There are 3 times as many grapes as cherries . <p> We can summarize all of this in a table : <p> Fruit <p> Number of pieces <p> Blueberries <p> ( frac18 x ) <p> Raspberries <p> ( frac14 x ) <p> Cherries <p> ( x ) <p> Grapes <p> ( 3x ) <p> Adding up the total number of pieces of fruit gives ( 4frac38 x ) . We have 280 pieces of fruit total so we want to solve $$ 4frac38x = 280. $$ So $$x = 280 div left(4frac38right) = 280 div left(frac358right)= 280 times left(frac835right) = 64. $$ There are 64 cherries in the fruit salad .

To do so , multiply both sides of the equation by ( x ) : <p> $$y ' + 2x6y = 12x2 - 4x$$ <p> Now find ( M(x) ) , given that we can see ( f(x) = 2x6 ) : <p> $$M(x) = eint2x6dx = efrac27x7$$ <h> Backwards Product Rule <p> The next step of the Integrating Factor Technique is an iffy one , because it requires careful observation . You must be able to condense a sum of terms into the derivative of a product . Luckily , since these terms will usually have exponential factors ( due to the Magic Function introducing exponential factors into the equation ) , the product rule application is usually easy to spot . <p> Example 4 : Write ( ex2 + 2x2ex2 ) as the derivative of a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in both terms . Upon differentiation of an exponential term , the argument of the exponent will not change . This means the sum can be written as <p> $$ ( f(x)ex2 ) ' $$ <p> While observation is usually sufficient to find ( f(x) ) , we will show a more thorough way to find ( f(x) ) . Differentiate the above expression with the Product Rule and Chain Rule , then set it equal to the original expression : <p> $$f ' ( x ) ex2 + 2xf(x)ex2 = ex2 + 2x2ex2$$ <p> Divide both sides of the equation by ( ex2 ) ( which never equals zero ) : <p> $$f ' ( x ) + 2xf(x) = 1 + 2x2$$ <p> From here it is obvious that the left-hand side must contain a constant term and a quadratic term . ( f(x) ) must be linear to make this true . <p> $$2xf(x) = 2x2 Rightarrow$$ $$f(x) = x Rightarrow$$ $$f ' ( x ) = 1$$ <p> This makes the equation true , so the condensed form of the original expression is ( ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by expanding and differentiating . <p> Example 5 : Write the expression ( x5ex + 5x4ex ) as the derivative of a product . <p> Solution : Here we will show a different method . See that each term in the sum has two factors that can be paired up : ( x5 ) with ( 5x4 ) , and ( ex ) with ( ex ) . Each pair of factors differs only by one differentiation , which suggests , by the Product Rule , that <p> $$ ( x5ex ) ' = x5ex + 5x4ex$$ <p> Differentiating the left-hand side confirms that this is true . <p> Example 5 makes it worthwhile to recall that the derivative of the product of two factors is in terms of the factors and their derivatives . That is why the methods shown in Examples 4 and 5 are viable . <p> Example 6 : Write the expression ( 2e2xsin x + e2xcos x ) as the derivative of a product of two factors . <p> Solution 1 : We use the method shown in Example 4 . Because both terms have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors , so <p> $$ ( f(x)e2x ) ' = 2e2xsin x + e2xcos x$$ <p> Expand the left side with the Product Rule and the Chain Rule : <p> $$f ' ( x ) e2x + 2f(x)e2x = 2e2xsin x + e2xcos x$$ <p> The second term on the left side must be equivalent to one of the two terms on the right side . If <p> $$2f(x)e2x = 2e2xsin x$$ <p> then ( f(x) = sin x ) and ( f ' ( x ) = cos x ) . Substituting gives <p> $$cos x e2x + 2sin x e2x = 2e2xsin x + e2xcos x$$ <p> That means that ( f(x) = sin x ) and the desired form of the expression is ( ( e2xsin x ) ' ) . <p> Solution 2 : This solution mirrors the given solution for Example 5 . Pair up the factors between the two terms as ( 2e2x ) with ( e2x ) and ( sin x ) with ( cos x ) . This is a logical pairing because the two pieces to each pair differ by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and differentiating ( sin(x) ) gives ( cos(x) ) . Therefore , in the Product Rule we let ( f(x) = e2x ) , ( f ' ( x ) = 2e2x ) , ( g(x) = sin(x) ) , and ( g ' ( x ) = cos(x) ) , implying that the desired form of the sum is ( ( e2xsin(x) ) ' ) . <h> Integrating the Derivative <p> The last major step in the Integrating Factor Technique is to integrate the equation . At this point one side of the equation will contain a derivative of a product . Integrating this side of the equation will result in the argument of the derivative plus a constant . The other side of the equation should be pretty easy to integrate . <h> Combining the Steps <p> Now we will put the steps together to get the entire Integrating Factor Technique . Here are the steps for reference : <p> Ensure that the differential equation is of the appropriate type ( linear and first-order ) and that it is of the form ( y ' + f(x)y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply both sides of the differential equation by it . <p> Write one side of the differential equation as the derivative of a product of two factors . <p> Solve for ( y ) by integrating the derivative . <p> With this in mind , let 's look at some examples . <p> Example 8 : Solve the differential equation <p> $$y ' + 6y = x$$ <p> Solution : The equation is of the appropriate form . Use the ( y ) term to find ( M(x) ) : <p> $$M(x) = eint6dx = e6x$$ <p> Multiply both sides of the differential equation by this function : <p> $$e6xy ' + 6e6xy = xe6x$$ <p> For the derivative of a product , ( y ) will be one of the factors . Obviously , ( e6x ) must be the other factor because it will not vanish upon differentiation ( ( fracddx(e6x) = 6e6x ) ) . Therefore , <p> From now on always assume that ( C ) represents the difference of the two constants that are formed upon integration of the differential equation . Now we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Plug these values in for ( x ) and ( y ) to solve for ( C ) : <p> Solution : It will take some work to get this differential equation into the appropriate form . Take the cube root of both sides of the equation : <p> $$y ' - 5x4 = 3x2y$$ <p> Now move the ( x ) term to the right side of the equation : <p> $$y ' = 3x2y + 5x4$$ <p> Finally , move the term with the ( y ) to the left side of the equation : <p> $$y ' - 3x2y = 5x4$$ <p> The equation is now in the appropriate form . Find ( M(x) ) : <p> $$M(x) = eint-3x2dx = e-x3$$ <p> Multiply both sides of the equation by ( M(x) ) : <p> $$y'e-x3 - 3x2ye-x3 = 5x4e-x3$$ <p> Write the left side as the derivative of a product : <p> $$ ( ye-x3 ) ' = 5x4e-x3$$ <p> Integrate : <p> $$int(ye-x3)'dx = int5x4e-x3dx$$ <p> The left side is easy to integrate due to the derivative in the integrand . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see LONG ... for the actual antiderivative , but the expression is far beyond what you would need to understand for a high-school class ) Multiplying both sides of the equation by ( ex3 ) isolates ( y ) .

The triangles ( triangle WXC ) and ( triangle WYC ) are congruent since they are right triangles with ( angle WCX = angle WCY ) and sharing side ( WC ) . So ( WX=WY ) . Similarly , drawing a perpendicular to Elm through ( W ) meeting Elm at ( Z ) , we have ( WY = WZ ) . Combining the two equalities , we learn that ( WX = WZ ) , so that ( W ) is on the angle bisector and the three angle bisectors are concurrent .

Thus , in order to find the coordinates of the point ( Q ) , we need to find the point at which the parabola and the ( y ) -axis intersect . We know that all of the points along the ( y ) -axis have an ( x ) -coordinate of ( x=0 ) by definition . Thus , the ( x ) -coordinate of point ( Q ) is ( x=0 ) . In order to find the ( y ) -coordinate of point ( Q ) we now need to substitute ( x=0 ) into our equation for the parabola .

In order to find this intersection point we must first find an equation for this line . The general equation of a straight line is given by ( y=mx+b ) where ( m ) is the slope of the line and ( b ) is the ( y ) -intercept . We know that the slope , ( m ) , of this straight line is in general given by : <p> $$ m = fracy2 - y1x2 - x1 $$ <p> where ( ( x1 , y1 ) ) and ( ( x2 , y2 ) ) are two of the points on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and ( ( 1,0 ) ) are two points on this line . Thus , the slope for this line can be found by substituting these points into our general formula : <p> The slope of our line is ( m=1 ) . We already know that the coordinate of the ( y ) -intercept for this line is ( ( 0 , -1 ) ) because this is one of our given points , giving ( b=-1 ) . We have ( m=1 ) and ( b=-1 ) so , by substituting these values into our general equation for a straight line , we find that the equation for the straight line passing through point ( P ) is given by ( y=1 cdot x - 1 ) or ( y=x-1 ) . <p> Now that we know the equation of the straight line passing through point ( P ) we can find the coordinates of point ( P ) by finding the intersection of this line with the parabola defined by ( y=-(x+2)2 + 17 ) . In order to find the coordinates of the intersection point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the linear equation of the straight line : <p> Thus ( x=2 ) or ( x=-7 ) . We know that point ( P ) is in the first quadrant of the ( xy ) -plane so the ( x ) -coordinate of point ( P ) can not be ( x=-7 ) , giving that the ( x ) -coordinate of point ( P ) is ( x=2 ) . We can then substitute ( x=2 ) into the equation for the straight line passing through point ( P ) , giving : ( y=2-1=1 ) . Therefore , point ( P ) has coordinates ( ( 2,1 ) ) .

While dimes are bundles of ten pennies and dollars are bundles of ten dimes , the translation between base-ten numbers and pennies , dimes , and dollars is more complex because of the name differences . Furthermore , there is the potential for confusion since a penny can be thought of as both 1/100 of a dollar and as 1 cent .

Furthermore , there is the potential for confusion since a penny can be thought of as both 1/100 of a dollar and as 1 cent . As a result students may require more support from the teacher to understand contexts involving e.g. dimes and dollars than they would for this task context .

They will write a narrative in which they tell the story of how Okubo went from resisting efforts to make her " invisible " during internment to how she became " visible " post-internment . Students will base their exploded moment narrative on the following writing prompt : " Writing from MinT Okubos perspective , tell the story of one moment in her struggle to become visible after leaving the internment camp . Use narrative techniques and incorporate information from sources about Okubos life to write an original narrative . Answer the question , How did Okubo become visible after her life in the internment camp ? The narrative must end with the sentence , I was visible again. " Then , for their final performance task , students will share their narrative in a small group setting with other students , and reflect upon the research-based story they have written .

@@119689825 @8689825/ <h> Using TED Talks in the Classroom <h> What is a TED Talk ? <p> A TED Talk is one of many presentations no longer than twenty minutes produced by the TED organization . You can view the variety at http : //www.ted.com/ . The subjects range from math to philosophy to economics , to multidisciplinary topics . For a class of middle or high school students , a TED talk can enhance a student 's understanding of a topic by putting it in a different context . Read this article for some advice on whether using a TED talk in your class is a good idea , or , if you are a student , read this article as some advice for enjoying watching TED talks at home . <h> Context <p> Obviously , the first step is deciding whether the content is appropriate for what you 're teaching . This is usually fairly simple to determine , but I advise watching the entire video you are considering showing . If only part of the video is relevant , time stamp the relevnt part and only show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some students will likely be curious about the rest of the video and want to watch it on their own . For this reason , I suggest giving students a hyperlink which they can follow to watch the video in full . <h> Level of Complexity <p> Some TED talks will be very complicated for students to understand , and may require background beyond the scope of the course . For example , high school economics classes generally do not require calculus beforehand , so using a TED talk about economics that contains calculus is not advised , unless you can skip around the confusing computations and give students the core of information you want them to learn about . Again , time stamping is strongly advised . <p> The final section is applicable only to teachers . <h> Assigning TED Talks as Homework <p> Perhaps one of the best things you can do with TED talks is assign students to watch all or part of them for homework . This can be an invaluable way for students to look at class content from a new angle . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of a life sciences class can be infeasible in person , but easy with the help of TED talks . <p> Although it somewhat depends on the structure and content of the course , you can give students a set of open-ended questions accompanying the video to think about . They can then bring some ideas to class the next day and start a discussion about how the video relates to the content being learned . This is a great place to talk about ethics , the global economy , etc. , broader topics that are relevant to the bigger picture of the class you are teaching . And you as a teacher probably want students to see the bigger picture , so why not use TED talks if the students can understand them ? 
@@119689826 @8689826/ <p> Standards have become critical elements of increasingly decentralized K-12 education systems in the current age , as they provide a skeletal framework of target competencies , skills and practices children should aim to achieve to be meeting a certain quality threshhold of desired national/state levels . " ... Early state standards helped set the tone for the unprecedented move to align standards in classrooms that we see today " ( Glatthorn , Boschee , Whitehead , Boschee - Curriculum Leadership ) . While there are arguments for and against the facets of standardization , there is a general understanding that it is very difficult to ensure high accountability of student outcomes across a large population . <p> Common standards serve as an essential element of nation building while ensuring autonomy in curriculum and instruction - standards allow for decentalized control within schools and districts on choices of textbooks and teaching materials , testing , pedagogy , etc . At the same time , they allow for immense economies of scale and advancement of innovation in benchmarking , comparitive policy setting , research , and tools and technologies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperlocal levels anymore . Undeniably , there is a trade-off with a small loss of local vision setting abilities - but the positives far outweigh the shortcomings . This is the reason why Common Core has created a powerful movement towards building standards around the world . <h> Why science standards <p> With Science , the argument for the need for standards not only holds true , but demands even higher emphasis and attention . Science , just like mathematics , and unlike languages , is a subject area where rapid advancement and innovation is changing humanity 's understanding of our world constantly . <p> In such a world and times , the acceptable margin of error in alignment of student learning with demands of society is reducing everyday . Standards have a huge bearing on design of curriculum ( moreso in countries where the curriculum is not simply the govt. textbook ) and outmoded science curriculum is a recipe for disaster in preparing children for understanding problems of today and tomorrow . <h> What are Next Generation Science Standards and what 's new about them <p> The Next Generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science standards aimed at the US education system developed by a few public sector institutions alongside several state partners . They have been based on the Framework for K-12 Science Education ( developed by a team of 18 scholars convened ) by the National Research Council ( NRC ) and their consequent development has been managed by Achieve . They were completed and published in April 2013 , after going through a couple of drafts which were opened to public comments ( something we think every new curricular framework should aspire to go through , at least ) . <p> To understand the principles and philosophies of these standards , and why they are a significant deviation from current practice , it is important to identify the status quo of science teaching and learning , as explained by Brian J. Reiser , professor of learning sciences at Northwestern University , through an example . Liana Heitin , assistant editor at Education Week , watching a lecture by Prof. Reiser while introducing these standards , reflects on his summary of how science classes are taught today : <p> Through application : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab experiment to see it in action . <p> Through the " trust me " method : The teacher does the lab , then teaches the idea so kids understand what they just saw . " Why do we need to learn osmosis ? Because you really need it in high school , " Reiser mocked . <p> Through the " Mr. Wizard " method : The teacher does something awesome and says , " Is n't this cool ? How does this work ? " <p> NGSS , one the other hand , are built on research-based progressive ideas ( like inquiry-based learning ) on teaching and learning , and gain inspiration from Common Core State Standards ( CCSS ) . According to Brett Moulding , an NGSS Writer , NGSS takes " the vision and Framework for K-12 Science Education and puts it into a set of standard expections " 2 . The core tenets of the NGSSs include , but is not limited to : <p> Making students more prepared for future <p> Tying and weaving in real world problems and critical thinking , reasoning and problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Career readiness " and " college readiness " <p> Richness in content and practice <p> Meant to prepare students for global readiness <p> Introducing the scientific and technology innovations of the modern era <p> At the heart of these standards are 3 major dimensions ( which are combined to form each standard ) . These dimensions are : <p> Practices : " Behaviors that scientists engage in as they investigate and build models and theories about the natural world and the key set of engineering practices that engineers use as they design and build models and systems " <p> Crosscutting Concepts : " Way of linking the different domains of science " <p> Disciplinary Core ideas : These are overarching themes that " should meet the at least two of the following criteria and ideally all four : <p> Have broad importance across multiple sciences or engineering disciplines or be a key organizing concept of a single discipline ; <p> Provide a key tool for understanding or investigating more complex ideas and solving problems ; <p> Relate to the interests and life experiences of students or be connected to societal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Be teachable and learnable over multiple grades at increasing levels of depth and sophistication . " <p> Each of these dimensions have subcomponents and touched upon briefly in the video below : <p> NGSS place a strong emphasis on introducing larger ideas upfront to promote discovery and engagement through the course of the units and lessons . In a lot of senses , and as suggested by Liana Heitin , these remind you of work of Dan Meyer and the Understanding by Design framework by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe popularized by ASCD . <h> Competing frameworks / standards used around the world and in the US <p> In a summary of the International Benchmarking report by Achieve that served as a precursor to the development of NGSS , the authors claim that " conditions are right for the United States to take the lead internationally in forging a new conceptual framework for science , and next generation science standards . " This report was a result of a benchmarking research into 10 countries ' science standards . These countries either performed well on international assessments ( like PISA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States " , and happened to have integrated ( " interdisciplinary teaching approach that presents subject matter according to themes or topics " 3 ) science programs . All this also implies the lack of high-quality non-national-focused science education frameworks/standards ; most work in building standards have been focused on specific national education systems . While this makes sense , one may wonder how much local adaptation is needed in science standards in an increasingly " flat " and globalized world , which forms the basis for NGSS . This makes NGSS all-the-more important internationally . <p> Similar to the case with comparative research reporting for the need of CCSS , the opening of this summary report highlights the ( opinion : beaten-to-death ) challenge of students in the US being left behind in international assessments in science , which seems to be a cause for worry . <p> A couple of common characteristics across the standards/framework followed in these countries included : <p> ( #2 ) Physical science ( physical and chemistry ) was the emphasis in science classes in lower primary through lower secondary <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. there is no holistic " life sciences " as a sub-content areas ) . On the other hand , science in the US ( incl. pre-NGSS ) includes physical education in the study of life sciences , under the larger umbrella of science . <p> Achieve identified and called out several " exemplary " practices in these standards , including : <p> Using unifying ideas to provide focus and coherence and a way pare content <p> Providing multiple examples to make expectations for students concrete and transparent <p> Making meaningful connections to assessment to maintain focus on raising student achievement ( Click on the following hyperlink to read the report " Connecting Science Standards with Assessment : A snapshot of three Countries Approaches-England , Hong Kong and Canada ( Ontario ) ) <p> Attending to organization and format has a significant effect on the clarity and accessibility of standards <p> Developing students ' ability in planning and carrying out investigations to nurture scientific habits of mind and engagement <p> Making science accessible to all student populations by providing specific guidance for sub-populations <p> Having begun this discussion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national standards/frameworks world to find comparisons with science programs that are neither nationally governed nor completely open internationally . In this light , the albeit costly and opaque science programs of International Baccalaureate ( IB ) and Advanced Placement ( AP ) program can not be ignored . <p> The IB Science guides , unlike the predecessors of NGSS , have been constantly evolving over the years to " ensure science teaching and learning remains forward-looking , up-to-date and incorporates the latest scientific developments and technologies " 4 . Subjects covered in IB 's Diploma Program ( which is roughly equivalent to AP in terms of years of schooling ) include biology , computer science , chemistry , design technology , physics and " sports , exercise and health " 5 To add much validity to the increasing popularity of NGSS however , according to IB , it is " closely following the Next Generation Science Standards ( NGSS ) and , in collaborating with key organizations and individuals , it is exploring the best ways of supporting schools with the shifts in teaching the new science standards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day , IB is more a " program " and curriculum , and not a set of standards . <h> Adoption and how-to of implementation <p> Just like what we have learned from the challenges of implementing CCSS in the US and beyond , conceiving a brilliant set of standards is the minor problem here . The more significant and uphill challenge is advocating adoption and building ecosystems to support implementation of new standards , as this is a heavily political and institutional process . Gladly for policy makers and standards ' writers , such significant shifts happen less than once a decade . But this time , we are still reeling from the aftereffects of CCSS . <p> Despite the active participation and leadership of 26 states in the development of the NGSS , only 13 states and D.C. have adopted these standards so far . Heitin suggested that the slow adoption is a result of " lack of federal incentives and preoccupation with CCSS " . However , considering that the final version of these standards has been published only slightly over two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , states have been involved since 2011 . <p> While development and standards and benchmarks does n't take care of the heavy-lifting within the state , it does give local administrators a great starting point . According to AAAS , these benchmarks and standards can be used to : <p> Define the territory . State and local curriculum framework developers can use benchmarks and standards to describe the knowledge and skills they want their students to have . By aligning state frameworks with credible , widely-accepted national guidelines , state education leaders will be able to build support for their frameworks more rapidly . They will also be able to take advantage of implementation tools that are being developed to support these national guidelines . <p> Promote K-12 coherence . Research tells us that learning requires making connections between ideas and creating linkages that make sense in a larger context . Unfortunately , as the data from TIMSS indicate , the U.S. curriculum is too often a series of disjointed ideas and experiences , lacking both focus and coherence . This was an important issue for the scientists , mathematicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the document itself the conceptual coherence and the cross-grade , cross-discipline connections that are needed . <p> Rationalize curriculum , instruction , and assessment . Decisions about what to teach , how to teach , and how to evaluate what students have learned are among the most important choices educators make . While there are many reasonable criteria for making such decisions , only by carefully evaluating textbooks , teaching strategies , or tests against specific science literacy goals ( benchmarks or standards ) will we be able to help students achieve those goals . <p> Provide a foundation for teacher preparation and continuing professional development programs . Using benchmarks and standards as the focus of teacher education and professional development programs can help define a base for teachers ' content and pedagogical knowledge and for their understanding of standards-based reform and its implications for teaching and learning . Just as standards and benchmarks can bring coherence to the K-12 curriculum , they can also encourage colleges , universities , and school districts to coordinate their teacher education and professional development efforts . Standards and benchmarks can also help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guide efforts to improve achievement for all students . Setting high academic standards for all students " not just for an elite few " contributes to greater equity in the education system . In science and mathematics , the notion that excellence is out of the reach of girls or minority students no longer persists . A core curriculum based on the goal of science literacy for all students will help create a larger and more diverse pool of students who are likely to pursue further education in scientific fields . These same efforts will help all students gain the knowledge and skills they will need in a world that is increasingly shaped by science and technology . <p> But to understand why implementation gets so difficult for states , let 's look at what adoption by a state looks like , using California as an example . California 's science standards had n't been updated since 19986 . This led California to be one of the earliest adopters of these standards . Here are some of things California had to do to before it could up with a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state adopting standards is indeed a Curriculum Framework . But frameworks solve only a part of the problem - the in-distict and in-school implementations still remain herculean tasks . Here is where appropriate budgetary and manpower allocation to curriculum design and professional development ( 2 of the 8 elements of California 's future plan ) are critical to revamp previous multi-year plans . And neither of these are areas states have already made major strides on . " ... so far , there are very few resources out there to help them with tasks and assessments . So for the most part , they 're making up these mysteries on their own . " 7 ( " mysteries " are the inquiries which guide lessons ) . <p> According to New York Times at the time of publishing of these standards , " it could be several years before the guidelines are translated into detailed curriculum documents , teachers are trained in the material and standardized tests are revised " . <p> While technically the responsibility for implementation of these plans lies on the state boards of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NGO sector is expected to show promising support . This is particularly true with development of curricula . There is a very high need for engaging , highly-aligned and tried &amp; tested well-designed units and lessons that are n't rebranded edits of old curricula . The hope is that newer innovations like Google 's VR Expeditions Program will have wide trickle-down effects , while more startups like Mystery Science emerge and grow in popularity . <h> Outside the US <p> But as stated before , NGSS is a global opportunity beyond the US , and we really need to begin to act like it is one . Which begs the question : how can smaller countries without mature R&amp;D in education and major resources adopt NGSS ? Let 's take Ghana as an example here ( for no particularly strong reason ; its education system is heavily influenced and inspired by the very popular mission schooling as advocated by the British ) . <p> Despite having a population just less than the most populated state US state of California , Ghana does not have any curricular frameworks or educational standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the textbook is the curriculum , and a syllabus guides all textbook publishing and instruction at the school level , which the government dutifully puts out every year . To Ghana 's credit , however , these syllabi documents ( see example ) have enough details to support a targeted approach in local planning . The syllabi contains listing of units for each grade , and each unit contains objectives , suggested teaching and learning activities and suggested assessment in brief . <p> While admittedly impossible-seeming today with current resources , adoption of NGSS for Ghana would require atleast : <p> Massive realignment of units to NGSS domains in each grade level , adjusting for mathematical competencies , high-stakes examinations in grade 10 and 12 , and cultural needs <p> Qualifying and organizing govt. and private publishing to redoing science materials through sample materials and units <p> Budgetary allocations for science labs and equipments for inquiry-based approaches <p> Locally-relevant suggested curricula interventions and programs <p> Redesign of standardized local assessment for each grade <p> Large investment in professional development in rural and urban settings <p> Communication with parents and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , time-consuming and highly political - yet governments able to identify funding , leadership and processes to surpass these battles are going to create huge ripple effects with even the simplest implementations . <p> -- <p> Theoretically , this is an exciting direction for science around the world . But if this piece leaves you with some desire to know more tangibly how understand this transforms learning , consider this example by Prof. Reiser , explained by Heitin : <p> For instance , Reiser showed a lesson in which students were told that there was a large decrease in the number of Galapagos finches between 1976 and 1977 . ( " I do biology , so I like to focus on things like death , " Reiser joked . ) <p> Students were tasked with figuring out why so many finches died and why some were able to survive . They were given access to data on the Web about the time period and had to figure out which questions to ask and what information was relevant . <p> Eventually students determined that there was a drought around that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly depleted . Birds with slightly longer beaks survived because they were able to open the leftover , tough-shelled seeds . <h> Making Models <p> But that 's far from the end . From there , students investigate a similar phenomenon " for instance , why peppered moths were more prominent during the Industrial Revolution . " So you have two general models , " Reiser said . " Then you ask students to tell the story without the finch or moth . " <p> Eventually , they come up with a model . Something like this : <p> That 's when you deliver the kicker , according to Reiser . " Scientists have built a story like this , too , and it 's called natural selection . " 
@@119689828 @8689828/ <h> F-IF Logistic Growth Model , Abstract Version <p> An important example of a model often used in biology or ecology to model population growth is called the logistic growth model . The general form of the logistic equation is $$ P(t) = fracKP0ertK+P0(ert-1). $$ In this equation ( t ) represents time , with ( t = 0 ) corresponding to when the population in question is first measured ; ( K , P0 ) and ( r ) are all real numbers with ( K ) being called the carrying capacity ' ' while ( r ) is a growth rate and is normally a positive number . <p> Explain why the value ( P0 ) represents the population when it is first measured . <p> Explain why , as time elapses , the population stabilizes , approaching the value ( K ) . <p> Explain how the behavior of ( P ) changes if the growth rate ( r ) is increased or decreased . <p> Below is the graph of a particular logistic function ( P ) , showing the growth of a bacteria population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( K ) . <p> Using the values of ( P0 ) and ( K ) from the previous part , sketch the graph of the logistic function ( Q ) given by $$ Q(t) = fracKP0e2rtK+P0(e2rt-1). $$ Note that ( Q ) is the same as ( P ) except that the growth rate ( r ) has been doubled . <h> Commentary <p> This task is for instructional purposes only and students should already be familiar with some specific examples of logistic growth functions such as that given in Logistic growth model , concrete case . ' ' This is an important example of a function with many constants : ( P0 ) the initial population , ( K ) the carrying capacity , and ( r ) the growth rate . Each of these has a specific meaning which determines the shape of the graph and , in case of ( P0 ) and ( K ) , can be readily estimated using the graph . <p> The goal of this task is to have students appreciate how the different constants ( ( P0 ) , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the graph . Only ( r ) has been changed here , in part ( e ) , because it is the most abstract of these numbers . If the instructor wishes to change the other numbers , the function used to generate this particular graph is $$ P(t) = frac51 + 10e-t. $$ Note that this is not given in the form of the logistic equation given above with ( K , P0 , ) and ( r ) . It corresponds , after algebraic manipulation , to the case where ( r = 1 ) , ( K = 5 ) , ( P0 = frac511 ) . Showing this identity is a worthwhile algebraic exercise which requires careful manipulation of fractions and exponential functions . <h> Solutions 212257 @qwx1072257 <p> The population is first measured when ( t = 0 ) . Plugging ( t = 0 ) into the expression for ( P ) gives <p> As the name suggests , the carrying capacity ' ' is the maximum population that the environment can sustain so it is , in this case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Expanding the expression for the denominator of ( P ) , ( K - P0ert - P0 ) , the exponential term ( P0ert ) , grows rapidly as ( t ) grows . The rest of the denominator , ( K - P0 ) , does not depend on ( t ) . So as ( t ) grows , the denominator is better and better approximated by ( P0ert ) . The numerator is ( KP0ert ) . Taking the quotient of ( KP0ert ) by ( P0ert ) gives ( K ) , the carrying capacity . So as ( t ) grows , the values of ( P ) become closer and closer to ( K ) . <p> The rate ( r ) determines how quickly the exponential function ( ert ) grows . Increasing ( r ) will increase the rate of growth of ( ert ) . This means that the values of ( P ) will approach the carrying capacity ( K ) more rapidly since , as seen in part ( b ) , it is the growth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K ) . If ( r ) is decreased , then ( ert ) grows more slowly and the values of ( P ) approach ( K ) more slowly . <p> The value ( P(0) ) is the ( y ) -intercept of the graph of ( P ) . This value is about half way between ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) and since the units in population for the graph are ( 10 ) million this means that there are about ( 5 ) million bacteria at the beginning of the experiment . The carrying capacity ( K ) appears to be close to ( 5 ) which represents ( 50 ) million bacteria . <p> If the actual formula for the function is given , then the ( y ) -intercept can be calculated exactly $$ P(0) = frac5 e01 + 10e0 = frac511. $$ Since one unit on the graph represents ( 10,000,000 ) bacteria , there are a little under ( 5 ) million bacteria when the population is first measured . The carrying capacity is ( 50,000,000 ) as estimated above : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula , becomes less and less significant as ( t ) grows the population approaches ( frac51 ) units or ( 50,000,000 ) . <p> When the value ( r ) is doubled , looking at part ( b ) , what this means is that the exponential term ( P0e2 rt ) in the denominator becomes the dominant term more quickly , twice as quickly in fact . So we expect the population to grow more rapidly at the beginning before approaching the carrying capacity . This is shown in the graph below . Note that this graph is precise because the precise values of ( K , P0 , ) and ( r ) were used : not knowing this information the best one can do is draw a curve with the same initial population , the same carrying capacity , and which grows more rapidly initially . 
@@119689829 @8689829/ <p> A little more than a week ago , we launched an experimental ( and definitely semi-controversial ) initiative called Ask Joshua , which allowed teachers from anywhere in the world to run ideas on new and existing for teaching by a high-schooler . While theoretically-flawed sounding , we wanted to experiment and understand what happens . We do think that students are the customers and are the best at communicating whether or not a pedagogical or curricular style worked for them . Unfortunately , over the years , we have built pretty complex models of instruction and curriculum , and have distanced ourselves from our customers . We do n't think students have all the answers , but they definitely can help us teachers ground their planning . <p> We were very happy to see so many questions trickling in for Joshua , and we have filtered the top ones with Joshua'a answers below : <p> Ciro Santilli asked : <p> When I was in school , I hated teachers who gave exercises without solutions <p> When I decide I 've searched for long enough just let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear teachers : students also have the ability of not looking if they want to , did you know that ? ! = ) <p> I suggest breaking up a set of exercises into two groups : the first consisting of easier , routine problems ; the second should contain problems that require more time and creativity . Assign the first half of the problem set on the first night , and make solutions ( not just answers ! ) available the following day so students can check their basic understanding of the material before moving to the more difficult problems . Perhaps go over one or two of these problems at the start of this class . Then make the second half of the solutions available on the day that this second problem set is due , giving students enough time to fully process and understand the problems " and hopefully solve them " before they can look at solutions . <p> One of the pitfalls with waiting too long is that students may forget what aspects of the problems gave them so much trouble , and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less from reading them . Thus I suggest you urge students to review solutions the night following when they are due . <p> Eder Junior asked : <p> How to teach the concept of negative numbers . Example : -1 , -2 , -3 As an example of ludico mode . <p> Joshua answered : <p> Positive numbers represent the quantity of an object . Therefore a negative number represents lacking that quantity of the object . <p> The most practical example of this is debt . Debts are usually written as negative numbers .

Have a novel , magazine , or something along those lines on your desk to read before you go to bed , or in the morning while you enjoy breakfast . Highlight or circle any words you are unfamiliar with . Then , later , go back and reread the text surrounding each unfamiliar word and take a guess as to what it means by analyzing context clues . Finally , look up the words in a dictionary or on a website such as www.dictionary.com to find the correct meaning . More important words are more common , and if you look these up enough times , they will be ingrained in your memory without you sitting memorizing lists of words . It is more fun and less monotonous than memorizing vocabulary lists .

There are two reasons to ask students to first find a reflection followed by a translation that will show the congruence . One is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , giving students a chance to see that there is more than one way to do this . The other is to set up the conversation that can result after students do part ( b ) . <p> Part ( b ) looks more deeply into the different types of rigid motions ( translations , rotations , and reflections ) examining whether or not it matters in which order these transformations are applied : this depends very much on the specific operations performed as is shown in the solution with some examples . If the students do not produce an example where the order of the reflection and translation influences the end result , the teacher should be prepared to discuss an example similar to the one provided in part ( b ) of the solution . <p> Finally , part ( c ) gives students a chance to think creatively about showing the congruence between the two triangles without having the steps prescribed .

G.3.A : while the students have not been prompted to explicitly describe the transformations in terms of coordinates , they will necessarily use them at least implicitly . If it is appropriate , the teacher can give extra instructions indicating that students need to describe the transformations explicitly in terms of coordinates ; alternatively , the teacher can use this task could lead into a discussion about how to describe each of the transformations using coordinates . Part ( b ) is intended to provide extra depth of understanding to rigid motions and congruence .

For the reflection and translation chosen above , we reverse the order by first translating ( triangle ABC ) by ( 6 ) units downward and then reflecting over the ( y ) -axis .

Looking at ( P(0) ) , the only place where the variable ( t ) appears in the expression defining ( P ) is in the exponentials ( e0.31t ) which are in both the numerator and denominator . Since ( e0 = 1 ) , this means that $$ P(0) = frac3,900,000 times 200,000,000200,000,000 - 0 = 3,900,000. $$ So the approximate U.S. population in ( 1790 ) is the term ( 3,900,000 ) appearing in the numerator of ( P(t) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $$ frac3,900,000 times 200,000,000 times e0.31t200,000,000 + 3,900,000left ( e0.31t - 1right ) = 100,000,000. $$ All of the zeroes here create a distraction , making the work more difficult .

Since ( e0 = 1 ) , this means that $$ P(0) = frac3,900,000 times 200,000,000200,000,000 - 0 = 3,900,000. $$ So the approximate U.S. population in ( 1790 ) is the term ( 3,900,000 ) appearing in the numerator of ( P(t) ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $$ frac3,900,000 times 200,000,000 times e0.31t200,000,000 + 3,900,000left ( e0.31t - 1right ) = 100,000,000. $$ All of the zeroes here create a distraction , making the work more difficult . Dividing the numerator and denominator on the left by ( 1,000,000 ) and dividing both sides of the equation by ( 100,000,000 ) simplifies this equation to $$ frac3.9 times 2 times e0.31t200 + 3.9left ( e0.31t - 1right ) = 1 . $$ Clearing the denominator on the left gives $$ 3.9 times 2 times e0.31t = 200 + 3.9 left ( e0.31t - 1right ) . $$ Moving the exponential terms to the left hand side of the equation and the numbers to the right hand side , we find , after simplifying : $$ 3.9 times e0.31t = 196.1 $$ Solving for ( t ) gives a value of about ( t = 12.64 ) . This means that it would be about ( 126.4 ) years after ( 1790 ) that the population reaches ( 100 ) million . This would be during the year ( 1916 ) . This differs by one year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ( 125 ) years it took for the population to reach ( 100,000,000 ) . <p> Since ( 2010 ) is ( 220 ) years after ( 1790 ) , or ( 22 ) decades , the model predicts that in ( 2010 ) the population of the U.S. should have been $$ P(22) = frac3,900,000 times 200,000,000 times e0.31 times 22 200,000,000 + 3,900,000 ( e0.31 times 22 - 1 ) . $$ Evaluating on a calculator gives an estimate of between ( 189,000,000 ) and ( 190,000,000 ) . This estimate is too low , differing by about ( 119,000,000 ) from the estimated U.S. population of ( 309,000,000 ) in ( 2010 ) . <p> There has been a large growth in the population of the United States since ( 1940 ) . Many factors have influenced this growth , including the general prosperity and availability of resources that has been in place since that time and also the large number of immigrants who have come to the United States from all over the world . <p> Note that ( P(50) ) would represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other words , in the year 2290 . Evaluating on a calculator gives a population , rounded to the nearest one , of ( 199,998,134 ) . Plugging in a larger value , such as ( t = 100 ) gives a value of ( 200,000,000 ) , again to the nearest one . The estimate of ( 200,000,000 ) remains in place for all values of ( t ) larger than ( 100 ) as well . <p> To see why , in terms of the structure of the expression defining ( P ) , the model predicts a population approaching and stabilizing at ( 200,000,000 ) , examine first the denominator of ( P ) : $$ 200,000,000 + 3,900,000e0.31 t - 3,900,000. $$ The exponential term ( 3,900,000e0.31t ) grows rapidly as ( t ) grows . The rest of the denominator , ( 200,000,000 - 3,900,000 ) , does not depend on ( t ) . So as ( t ) grows , the denominator is better and better approximated by ( 3,900,000e0.31t ) . The numerator is ( 3,900,000 times 200,000,000 e0.31t ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ( 3,900,000e0.31t ) , the approximation of the denominator when ( t ) is large , gives ( 200,000,000 ) . So as ( t ) grows , the values of ( P ) become closer and closer to ( 200,000,000 ) .

The sound waves that make musical notes are very evenly-spaced waves , and the qualities of these regular waves - for example how big they are or how far apart they are - affect the sound of the note . A note can be high or low , depending on how often ( how frequently ) one of its waves arrives at your ear . When scientists and engineers talk about how high or low a sound is , they talk about its frequency . The higher the frequency of a note , the higher it sounds . They can measure the frequency of notes , and like most measurements , these will be numbers , like " 440 vibrations per second . " <p> Figure 1 : A sound that has a shorter wavelength has a higher frequency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and talking about music since long before we knew that sounds were waves with frequencies . So when musicians talk about how high or low a note sounds , they usually do n't talk about frequency ; they talk about the note 's pitch . And instead of numbers , they give the notes names , like " C " . ( For example , musicians call the note with frequency " 440 vibrations per second " an " A " . ) <p> But to see where octaves come from , let 's talk about frequencies a little more . Imagine a few men are singing a song together . Nobody is singing harmony ; they are all singing the same pitch - the same frequency - for each note . <p> Now some women join in the song . They ca n't sing where the men are singing ; that 's too low for their voices . Instead they sing notes that are exactly double the frequency that the men are singing . That means their note has exactly two waves for each one wave that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well together that it sounds like the women are singing the same notes as the men , in the same key . They are just singing them one octave higher . Any note that is twice the frequency of another note is one octave higher . <p> Notes that are one octave apart are so closely related to each other that musicians give them the same name . A note that is an octave higher or lower than a note named " C natural " will also be named " C natural " . A note that is one ( or more ) octaves higher or lower than an " F sharp " will also be an " F sharp " . <p> Figure 2 : When two notes are one octave apart , one has a frequency exactly two times higher than the other - it has twice as many waves . These waves fit together so well , in the instrument , and in the air , and in your ears , that they sound almost like different versions of the same note . <h> Naming Octaves <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when musicians talk about a note , a " G " for example , it often does n't matter which G they are talking about . We can talk about the " F sharp " in a G major scale without mentioning which octave the scale or the F sharp are in , because the scale is the same in every octave . Because of this , many discussions of music theory do n't bother naming octaves . Informally , musicians often speak of " the B on the staff " or the " A above the staff " , if it 's clear which staff they 're talking about . <p> But there are also two formal systems for naming the notes in a particular octave . Many musicians use Helmholtz notation . Others prefer scientific pitch notation , which simply labels the octaves with numbers , starting with C1 for the lowest C on a full-sized keyboard . Figure 3 shows the names of the octaves most commonly used in music . <p> Figure 3 : The octaves are named from one C to the next higher C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line c " and " two line c " are " one line " notes . <p> The octave below contra can be labelled CCC or Co ; higher octaves can be labelled with higher numbers or more lines . Octaves are named from one C to the next higher C. For example , all the notes between " great C " and " small C " are " great " . One-line c is also often called " middle C " . No other notes are called " middle " , only the C. <p> EXAMPLE 1 <p> Naming Notes within a Particular Octave <p> Figure 4 : Each note is considered to be in the same octave as the C below it . <h> Dividing the Octave into Scales <p> The word " octave " comes from a Latin root meaning " eight " . It seems an odd name for a frequency that is two times , not eight times , higher . The octave was named by musicians who were more interested in how octaves are divided into scales , than in how their frequencies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good together . The people in different musical traditions have different ideas about what notes they think sound best together . In the Western musical tradition - which includes most familiar music from Europe and the Americas - the octave is divided up into twelve equally spaced notes . If you play all twelve of these notes within one octave you are playing a chromatic scale . Other musical traditions - traditional Chinese music for example - have divided the octave differently and so they use different scales . <p> You may be thinking " OK , that 's twelve notes ; that still has nothing to do with the number eight " , but out of those twelve notes , only seven are used in any particular major or minor scale . Add the first note of the next octave , so that you have that a " complete " -sounding scale ( " do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti " and then " do " again ) , and you have the eight notes of the octave . These are the diatonic scales , and they are the basis of most Western music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only seven letter names are used to name notes : A , B , C , D , E , F , and G. The eighth note would , of course , be the next A , beginning the next octave . To name the other notes , the notes on the black piano keys , you have to use a sharp or flat sign . <p> Figure 5 : The white keys are the natural notes . Black keys can only be named using sharps or flats . The pattern repeats at the eighth tone of a scale , the octave . <p> Whether it is a popular song , a classical symphony , or an old folk tune , most of the music that feels comfortable and familiar ( to Western listeners ) is based on either a major or minor scale . It is tonal music that mostly uses only seven of the notes within an octave : only one of the possible A 's ( A sharp , A natural , or A flat ) , one of the possible B 's ( B sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . The other notes in the chromatic scale are ( usually ) used sparingly to add interest or to ( temporarily ) change the key in the middle of the music .

A long tradition of using scales in particular ways has trained listeners to expect certain things from a piece of music . If you hear a song in C major , for example , not only will your ear/brain expect to hear the notes from the C major scale , it will expect to hear them grouped into certain chords , and it will expect the chords to follow each other in certain patterns ( chord progressions ) and to end in a certain way ( a cadence ) . You do n't have to have any musical training at all to have these expectations ; you only need to have grown up in a culture that listens to this kind of music . <p> The expectations for music in a minor key are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is important to notice that you can move that song in C major to E major , G flat major , or any other major key . It will sound basically the same , except that it will sound higher or lower . In the same way , all minor keys are so alike that music can easily be transposed from one minor key to another . <p> This sameness is not true for musical traditions that use modes instead of scales . In these traditions , the mode , like a scale , lists the notes that are used in a piece of music . But each mode comes with a different set of expectations in how those notes will be used and arranged . There are several traditions that are very different from each other , but that are all based on modes or ragas rather than on scales : <p> the classical Greek modes <p> the medieval church modes <p> modal jazz and folk music <p> Indian classical music <p> Other Nonwestern modal musics <p> Although very different from each other , one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragas that they are based on are much more variable than the major and minor scales of the tonal system .

The pattern of whole steps and half steps within the octave is different ; this would have a major effect on a chant , which would generally stay within the one octave range . Also , the interval between the finalis and the dominant is different , and they are in different places within the range of the mode .

The result is that music in one mode would sound quite different than music in the other mode . You ca n't simply transpose music from one mode to another as you do with scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classical Greek Modes <p> We do n't have any recordings of ancient music , so we do not know exactly what it sounded like . But we can make some educated guesses as to what music from ancient Greek and Roman times really sounded like , based on their writings . We know , for example , that they used modes based on tetrachords , mini-scales of four notes , in descending pitch order , all contained within a stretch of a perfect fourth . We have very detailed descriptions of tetrachords and of Greek music theory ( for example , Harmonics , written by Aristoxenus in the fourth century B.C. ) . <p> The perfect fourth is an interval that occurs naturally , for example in string and wind instrument harmonics , so we can be pretty certain that we understand that part of ancient Greek music theory . It is more difficult to be certain of the exact tuning of each note within a tetrachord . Enharmonic tetrachords are particularly confusing ; it is clear that two of the notes were very close in pitch . As shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using modern tuning , the two notes would sound the same . This sameness is a result of equal-tempered tuning , however ; other tuning systems have been used which cause enharmonic notes to be tuned slightly differently . It is not clear whether these ancient tetrachords actually had only three distinct pitches ( it would not be the only time that something existed only to make a theory seem more consistent ) , or whether the two " enharmonic " notes were actually slightly different . References to " shading " in some of the ancient texts may have referred to differences in tuning . <p> Figure 2 : Here are three possible Greek tetrachords , as nearly as they can be written in common notation . It is clear that the outer notes were a perfect fourth apart , but the exact tuning of the inner notes is not certain . <p> Since a tetrachord fills the interval of a perfect fourth , two tetrachords with a whole step between the end of one and the beginning of the other will fill an octave . Different Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 3 : Each Greek mode was built of two tetrachords in a row , filling an octave . <p> Western composers often consistently choose minor keys over major keys ( or vice versa ) to convey certain moods ( minor for melancholy , for example , and major for serene ) . One interesting aspect of Greek modes is that different modes were considered to have very different effects , not only on a person 's mood , but even on character and morality . This may also be another clue that ancient modes may have had more variety of tuning and pitch than modern keys do . <h> The Medieval Church Modes <p> Sacred music in the middle ages in Western Europe - Gregorian chant , for example - was also modal , and the medieval church modes were also considered to have different effects on the listener . The names of the church modes were even borrowed from the names of the Greek modes , although the two systems do n't really correspond to each other , or usemay have sounded more like some of the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church music , and to avoid confusion some people prefer to name the church modes using Roman numerals . <p> Figure 4 : The modes came in pairs which shared the same finalis . <p> A mode can be found by playing all the " white key " notes on a piano for one octave . From D to D , for example is Dorian ; from F to F is Lydian . Notice that no church modes began on A , B , or C. This is because a B flat was allowed , and the modes beginning on D , E , and F , when they use a B flat , have the same note patterns and relationships as would modes beginning on A , B , and C. After the middle ages , modes beginning on A , B , and C were named , but they are still not considered church modes . Notice that the Aeolian ( or the Dorian using a B flat ) is the same as an A ( or D ) natural minor scale and the Ionian ( or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a C ( or F ) major scale . <p> Figure 5 : These modes are part of the same theoretical system as the church modes , but they were not used in the middle ages . <p> Each of these modes can easily be found by playing its one octave range , or ambitus , on the " white key " notes on a piano . But the Dorian mode , for example , did n't have to start on the pitch we call a D. The important thing was the pattern of half steps and whole steps within that octave , and their relationship to the notes that acted as the modal equivalent of tonal centers , the finalis and the dominant . Generally , the last note of the piece was the finalis , giving it the same " resting place " function as a modern tonic note . The dominant , also called the reciting tone or tenor , was the note most often used for long recitations on the same pitch . <p> NOTE : The dominant in modal music did not have the harmonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our modern tonal system , any note may be sharp , flat , or natural , but in this modal system , only the B was allowed to vary . The symbols used to indicate whether the B was " hard " ( our B natural ) or " soft " ( our B flat ) eventually evolved into our symbols for sharps , flats , and naturals . All of this may seem very arbitrary , but it 's important to remember that medieval mode theory , just like our modern music theory , was not trying to invent a logical system of music . It was trying to explain , describe , and systematize musical practices that were already flourishing because people liked the way they sounded . <p> Figure 6 : The modern symbols for sharp , natural , and flat evolved from medieval notation indicating what type of B should be used . <p> The tuning system used in medieval Europe was also not our familiar equal temperament system . It was a just intonation system , based on a pure perfect fifth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Slight adjustments are made in tuning and intervals to make them more pleasant to the ear ; and the medieval ear had different preferences than our modern ears . This is another reason that modes sounded very different from each other , although that particular difference may be missing today when chant is sung using equal temperament . <h> Modal Jazz and Folk Music <p> Some jazz and folk music is also considered modal and also uses the Greek/medieval mode names . In this case , the scales used are the same as the medieval church modes , but they do not have a reciting tone and are used much more like modern major and minor scales . Modal European ( and American ) folk music tends to be older tunes that have been around for hundreds of years . Modal jazz , on the other hand , is fairly new , having developed around 1960 . <p> It is important to remember when discussing these types of music that it does not matter what specific note the modal scale starts on . What matters is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pattern to the tonic/finalis . For example , note that the Dorian " scale " as written above starts on a D but basically has a C major key signature , resulting in the third and seventh notes of the scale being a half step lower than in a D major scale . ( A jazz musician would call this flatted or flat thirds and sevenths . ) So any scale with a flatted third and seventh can be called a Dorian scale . <p> EXAMPLE <p> D major has 2 sharps : F sharp and C sharp . <p> Looking at Figure 4 , you can see that the Lydian mode starts on an F. The key of F major would have a B flat , but in the mode this is raised one half step , to B natural . Therefore the fourth degree of the Lydian mode is raised one half step . <p> F lydian has the same key signature as C major , which is a perfect fourth lower . So all Lydian modes have the same key signature as the major key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydian . The major scale beginning a perfect fourth below D major is A major . A major has three sharps : F sharp , C sharp and G sharp . Adding a G sharp does raise the fourth degree of the scale by one half step , just as predicted in step 2 . <p> A Dorian <p> C Lydian <p> B flat Mixolydian <p> D Phrygian <p> SOLUTION <h> The Ragas of Classical Indian Music <p> The ragas of classical India and other , similar traditions , are more like modes than they are like scales . Like modes , different ragas sound very different from each other , for several reasons . They may have different interval patterns between the " scale " notes , have different expectations for how each note of the raga is to be used , and may even use slightly different tunings . Like the modal musics discussed above , individual Indian ragas are associated with specific moods . <p> In fact , in practice , ragas are even more different from each other than the medieval European modes were . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically than a modal or major-minor system does . Some pitches will get more emphasis than others ; some will be used one way in an ascending melody and another way in a descending melody ; some will be used in certain types of ornaments . And these rules differ from one raga to the next . The result is that each raga is a collection of melodic scales , phrases , motifs , and ornaments , that may be used together to construct music in that raga . The number of possible ragas is practically limitless , and there are hundreds in common use . A good performer will be familiar with dozens of ragas and can improvise music - traditional classical music in India is improvised - using the accepted format for each raga . <p> The raga even affects the tuning of the notes . Indian classical music is usually accompanied by a tanpura , which plays a drone background . The tanpura is usually tuned to a pure perfect fifth , so , just as in medieval European music , the tuning system is a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ octave is divided into twelve possible notes , only some of which are used in a particular raga ( just as Westerners use only some of the twelve notes in each key ) . But as was true for the church modes , using the pure perfect fifth means that some " half steps " will be larger than others . Even though the variations between these different " half steps " are small , they strongly affect the sound of the music . So , the tuning of some of the notes ( not the ones dictated by the tanpura ) may be adjusted to better suit a particular raga . <h> Other Non-Western Modal Music <p> To the average Western listener , medieval European chant and classical Indian music are the two most familiar traditions that are not based on major and minor scales . But many other musical traditions around the world are not based on Western scales . Some of these have modes similar to the medieval Church modes ; they also tend to be a list of notes ( or a pattern of intervals ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of melodies . While the church mode/jazz mode tradition features diatonic modes ( which can be played using only the white keys of a piano ) , non-Western modes may use other types of scales . <p> In other music traditions , modes are much more like Indian ragas , featuring important variations in tuning and melodic expectations from one mode to the next , so that each mode may be seen as a collection of related melodic ideas , phrases , and ornamentations that are traditionally played with a certain set of notes tuned in a certain way . ( Some non-Indian traditions even use the term raga . ) All of these musics have long traditions that are very different from the familiar major-minor tonal system , and usually also have a different approach to harmony , rhythm , and performance practice .

@@119689887 @8689887/ <h> Modes and Ragas 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To summarize the modes and ragas in music and their use in many musical traditions 212253 @qwx1072253 <p> In many music traditions , including Western music , the list of all the notes that are expected or allowed in a particular piece of music is a scale . A long tradition of using scales in particular ways has trained listeners to expect certain things from a piece of music . If you hear a song in C major , for example , not only will your ear/brain expect to hear the notes from the C major scale , it will expect to hear them grouped into certain chords , and it will expect the chords to follow each other in certain patterns ( chord progressions ) and to end in a certain way ( a cadence ) . You do n't have to have any musical training at all to have these expectations ; you only need to have grown up in a culture that listens to this kind of music . <p> The expectations for music in a minor key are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is important to notice that you can move that song in C major to E major , G flat major , or any other major key . It will sound basically the same , except that it will sound higher or lower . In the same way , all minor keys are so alike that music can easily be transposed from one minor key to another . <p> This sameness is not true for musical traditions that use modes instead of scales . In these traditions , the mode , like a scale , lists the notes that are used in a piece of music . But each mode comes with a different set of expectations in how those notes will be used and arranged . There are several traditions that are very different from each other , but that are all based on modes or ragas rather than on scales : <p> the classical Greek modes <p> the medieval church modes <p> modal jazz and folk music <p> Indian classical music <p> Other Nonwestern modal musics <p> Although very different from each other , one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragas that they are based on are much more variable than the major and minor scales of the tonal system . Figure 1 shows one example for comparison . The two major scales use different notes , but the relationship of the notes to each other is very similar . For example , the pattern of half steps and whole steps in each one is the same , and the interval ( distance ) between the tonic and the dominant is the same . Compare this to the two church modes . The pattern of whole steps and half steps within the octave is different ; this would have a major effect on a chant , which would generally stay within the one octave range . Also , the interval between the finalis and the dominant is different , and they are in different places within the range of the mode . The result is that music in one mode would sound quite different than music in the other mode .

The result is that music in one mode would sound quite different than music in the other mode . You ca n't simply transpose music from one mode to another as you do with scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Classical Greek Modes <p> We do n't have any recordings of ancient music , so we do not know exactly what it sounded like . But we can make some educated guesses as to what music from ancient Greek and Roman times really sounded like , based on their writings . We know , for example , that they used modes based on tetrachords , mini-scales of four notes , in descending pitch order , all contained within a stretch of a perfect fourth . We have very detailed descriptions of tetrachords and of Greek music theory ( for example , Harmonics , written by Aristoxenus in the fourth century B.C. ) . <p> The perfect fourth is an interval that occurs naturally , for example in string and wind instrument harmonics , so we can be pretty certain that we understand that part of ancient Greek music theory . It is more difficult to be certain of the exact tuning of each note within a tetrachord . Enharmonic tetrachords are particularly confusing ; it is clear that two of the notes were very close in pitch . As shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using modern tuning , the two notes would sound the same . This sameness is a result of equal-tempered tuning , however ; other tuning systems have been used which cause enharmonic notes to be tuned slightly differently . It is not clear whether these ancient tetrachords actually had only three distinct pitches ( it would not be the only time that something existed only to make a theory seem more consistent ) , or whether the two " enharmonic " notes were actually slightly different . References to " shading " in some of the ancient texts may have referred to differences in tuning . <p> Figure 2 : Here are three possible Greek tetrachords , as nearly as they can be written in common notation . It is clear that the outer notes were a perfect fourth apart , but the exact tuning of the inner notes is not certain . <p> Since a tetrachord fills the interval of a perfect fourth , two tetrachords with a whole step between the end of one and the beginning of the other will fill an octave . Different Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 3 : Each Greek mode was built of two tetrachords in a row , filling an octave . <p> Western composers often consistently choose minor keys over major keys ( or vice versa ) to convey certain moods ( minor for melancholy , for example , and major for serene ) . One interesting aspect of Greek modes is that different modes were considered to have very different effects , not only on a person 's mood , but even on character and morality . This may also be another clue that ancient modes may have had more variety of tuning and pitch than modern keys do . <h> The Medieval Church Modes <p> Sacred music in the middle ages in Western Europe - Gregorian chant , for example - was also modal , and the medieval church modes were also considered to have different effects on the listener . The names of the church modes were even borrowed from the names of the Greek modes , although the two systems do n't really correspond to each other , or usemay have sounded more like some of the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church music , and to avoid confusion some people prefer to name the church modes using Roman numerals . <p> Figure 4 : The modes came in pairs which shared the same finalis . <p> A mode can be found by playing all the " white key " notes on a piano for one octave . From D to D , for example is Dorian ; from F to F is Lydian . Notice that no church modes began on A , B , or C. This is because a B flat was allowed , and the modes beginning on D , E , and F , when they use a B flat , have the same note patterns and relationships as would modes beginning on A , B , and C. After the middle ages , modes beginning on A , B , and C were named , but they are still not considered church modes . Notice that the Aeolian ( or the Dorian using a B flat ) is the same as an A ( or D ) natural minor scale and the Ionian ( or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a C ( or F ) major scale . <p> Figure 5 : These modes are part of the same theoretical system as the church modes , but they were not used in the middle ages . <p> Each of these modes can easily be found by playing its one octave range , or ambitus , on the " white key " notes on a piano . But the Dorian mode , for example , did n't have to start on the pitch we call a D. The important thing was the pattern of half steps and whole steps within that octave , and their relationship to the notes that acted as the modal equivalent of tonal centers , the finalis and the dominant . Generally , the last note of the piece was the finalis , giving it the same " resting place " function as a modern tonic note . The dominant , also called the reciting tone or tenor , was the note most often used for long recitations on the same pitch . <p> NOTE : The dominant in modal music did not have the harmonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our modern tonal system , any note may be sharp , flat , or natural , but in this modal system , only the B was allowed to vary . The symbols used to indicate whether the B was " hard " ( our B natural ) or " soft " ( our B flat ) eventually evolved into our symbols for sharps , flats , and naturals . All of this may seem very arbitrary , but it 's important to remember that medieval mode theory , just like our modern music theory , was not trying to invent a logical system of music . It was trying to explain , describe , and systematize musical practices that were already flourishing because people liked the way they sounded . <p> Figure 6 : The modern symbols for sharp , natural , and flat evolved from medieval notation indicating what type of B should be used . <p> The tuning system used in medieval Europe was also not our familiar equal temperament system . It was a just intonation system , based on a pure perfect fifth . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Slight adjustments are made in tuning and intervals to make them more pleasant to the ear ; and the medieval ear had different preferences than our modern ears . This is another reason that modes sounded very different from each other , although that particular difference may be missing today when chant is sung using equal temperament . <h> Modal Jazz and Folk Music <p> Some jazz and folk music is also considered modal and also uses the Greek/medieval mode names . In this case , the scales used are the same as the medieval church modes , but they do not have a reciting tone and are used much more like modern major and minor scales . Modal European ( and American ) folk music tends to be older tunes that have been around for hundreds of years . Modal jazz , on the other hand , is fairly new , having developed around 1960 . <p> It is important to remember when discussing these types of music that it does not matter what specific note the modal scale starts on . What matters is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pattern to the tonic/finalis . For example , note that the Dorian " scale " as written above starts on a D but basically has a C major key signature , resulting in the third and seventh notes of the scale being a half step lower than in a D major scale . ( A jazz musician would call this flatted or flat thirds and sevenths . ) So any scale with a flatted third and seventh can be called a Dorian scale . <p> EXAMPLE <p> D major has 2 sharps : F sharp and C sharp . <p> Looking at Figure 4 , you can see that the Lydian mode starts on an F. The key of F major would have a B flat , but in the mode this is raised one half step , to B natural . Therefore the fourth degree of the Lydian mode is raised one half step . <p> F lydian has the same key signature as C major , which is a perfect fourth lower . So all Lydian modes have the same key signature as the major key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydian . The major scale beginning a perfect fourth below D major is A major . A major has three sharps : F sharp , C sharp and G sharp . Adding a G sharp does raise the fourth degree of the scale by one half step , just as predicted in step 2 . <p> A Dorian <p> C Lydian <p> B flat Mixolydian <p> D Phrygian <p> SOLUTION <h> The Ragas of Classical Indian Music <p> The ragas of classical India and other , similar traditions , are more like modes than they are like scales . Like modes , different ragas sound very different from each other , for several reasons . They may have different interval patterns between the " scale " notes , have different expectations for how each note of the raga is to be used , and may even use slightly different tunings . Like the modal musics discussed above , individual Indian ragas are associated with specific moods . <p> In fact , in practice , ragas are even more different from each other than the medieval European modes were . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically than a modal or major-minor system does . Some pitches will get more emphasis than others ; some will be used one way in an ascending melody and another way in a descending melody ; some will be used in certain types of ornaments . And these rules differ from one raga to the next . The result is that each raga is a collection of melodic scales , phrases , motifs , and ornaments , that may be used together to construct music in that raga . The number of possible ragas is practically limitless , and there are hundreds in common use . A good performer will be familiar with dozens of ragas and can improvise music - traditional classical music in India is improvised - using the accepted format for each raga . <p> The raga even affects the tuning of the notes . Indian classical music is usually accompanied by a tanpura , which plays a drone background . The tanpura is usually tuned to a pure perfect fifth , so , just as in medieval European music , the tuning system is a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ octave is divided into twelve possible notes , only some of which are used in a particular raga ( just as Westerners use only some of the twelve notes in each key ) . But as was true for the church modes , using the pure perfect fifth means that some " half steps " will be larger than others . Even though the variations between these different " half steps " are small , they strongly affect the sound of the music . So , the tuning of some of the notes ( not the ones dictated by the tanpura ) may be adjusted to better suit a particular raga . <h> Other Non-Western Modal Music <p> To the average Western listener , medieval European chant and classical Indian music are the two most familiar traditions that are not based on major and minor scales . But many other musical traditions around the world are not based on Western scales . Some of these have modes similar to the medieval Church modes ; they also tend to be a list of notes ( or a pattern of intervals ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of melodies . While the church mode/jazz mode tradition features diatonic modes ( which can be played using only the white keys of a piano ) , non-Western modes may use other types of scales . <p> In other music traditions , modes are much more like Indian ragas , featuring important variations in tuning and melodic expectations from one mode to the next , so that each mode may be seen as a collection of related melodic ideas , phrases , and ornamentations that are traditionally played with a certain set of notes tuned in a certain way . ( Some non-Indian traditions even use the term raga . ) All of these musics have long traditions that are very different from the familiar major-minor tonal system , and usually also have a different approach to harmony , rhythm , and performance practice .

Since ( p(x) ) represents the balance after 4 years if the growth rate is ( x ) , we can graph ( p(x) ) and find which value of ( x ) corresponds to a balance of 4400 .

@@119689905 @8689905/ <h> Pitch : Sharp , Flat , and Natural Notes 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To understand the definition of a pitch , its effect on notes , and the associated symbols . <p> The pitch of a note is how high or low it sounds . Pitch depends on the frequency of the fundamental sound wave of the note . The higher the frequency of a sound wave , and the shorter its wavelength , the higher its pitch sounds . But musicians usually do n't want to talk about wavelengths and frequencies . Instead , they just give the different pitches different letter names : A , B , C , D , E , F , and G. These seven letters name all the natural notes ( on a keyboard , that 's all the white keys ) within one octave . ( When you get to the eighth natural note , you start the next octave on another A. ) <p> Figure 1 : The natural notes name the white keys on a keyboard . <p> But in Western music there are twelve notes in each octave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other five notes ( on a keyboard , the black keys ) ? <p> Figure 2 : Sharp , flat , and natural signs can appear either in the key signature , or right in front of the note that they change . <p> A sharp sign means " the note that is one half step higher than the natural note " . A flat sign means " the note that is one half step lower than the natural note " . Some of the natural notes are only one half step apart , but most of them are a whole step apart . When they are a whole step apart , the note in between them can only be named using a flat or a sharp . <p> Figure 3 <p> Notice that , using flats and sharps , any pitch can be given more than one note name . For example , the G sharp and the A flat are played on the same key on the keyboard ; they sound the same . You can also name and write the F natural as " E sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half step higher than E natural , which is the definition of E sharp . Notes that have different names but sound the same are called enharmonic notes . <p> Figure 4 <p> Sharp and flat signs can be used in two ways : they can be part of a key signature , or they can mark accidentals . For example , if most of the C 's in a piece of music are going to be sharp , then a sharp sign is put in the " C " space at the beginning of the staff , in the key signature . If only a few of the C 's are going to be sharp , then those C 's are marked individually with a sharp sign right in front of them . Pitches that are not in the key signature are called accidentals . <p> Figure 5 : When a sharp sign appears in the C space in the key signature , all C 's are sharp unless marked as accidentals . <p> A note can also be double sharp or double flat . A double sharp is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural note ; a double flat is two half steps ( a whole step ) lower . Triple , quadruple , etc. sharps and flats are rare , but follow the same pattern : every sharp or flat raises or lowers the pitch one more half step . <p> Using double or triple sharps or flats may seem to be making things more difficult than they need to be . Why not call the note " A natural " instead of " G double sharp " ? The answer is that , although A natural and G double sharp are the same pitch , they do n't have the same function within a particular chord or a particular key . For musicians who understand some music theory ( and that includes most performers , not just composers and music teachers ) , calling a note " G double sharp " gives important and useful information about how that note functions in the chord and in the progression of the harmony .

They worked for the first half of the day on the larger field . Then the team split into two groups of equal number . The first group continued working in the larger field and finished it by evening . The second group harvested the smaller field , but did not finish by evening . The next day one farm-worker finished the smaller field in a single day 's work . How many farm-workers were on the team ? <h> Commentary <p> This is a challenging task , suitable for extended work , and reaching into a deep understanding of units . The task requires students to exhibit MP1 , Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them . An algebraic solution is possible but complicated ; a numerical solution is both simpler and more sophisticated , requiring skilled use of units and quantitative reasoning . Thus the task aligns with either A-CED.1 or N-Q.1 , depending on the approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encouraged to check their solutions , to see if they work , because by checking their solutions they will understand the problem more clearly . <p> Although it is not state explicitly , it is assumed that the farm-workers all work at the same rate , harvesting the same area in any given period of time , and that for any period of time , the area cleared by a group of farm-workers is proportional to the number of farm-works working . <p> A flexible understanding of units simplifies some of the solutions . For example , the second solution is simpler if ( R=1 ) , which is achieved by using the rate of a single farm-worker as the unit . And the third solution can be understood in a more sophisticated way as setting the unit for area to the size of one small field . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Harvesting the Fields , method 1 : reasoning with rates <p> First notice that the larger field would have taken the entire team ( frac34 ) of a day to harvest . This is because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team worked on it for another half a day . If the whole team had worked on it for the second half-day , they would have finished it in half the time , that is , ( frac14 ) day .

The area harvested in that first half day was $$frac12mbox daycdot R mboxacresover mboxpersoncdot mboxdaycdot x mboxpeople over mboxteam cdot 1 mbox team = frac12 x R mbox acres. $$ In the second half day , the area harvested was $$frac12mbox day cdot R mboxacresover mboxperson cdot mboxday cdot xmboxpeople over mboxteam cdot frac12 mbox team = frac14 xR mbox acres. $$ <p> So the area of the larger field is $$A=frac12 xR + frac14 xR = frac34 xR. $$ <p> The area of the smaller field is the area harvested by half the team in half a day added to the area harvested by one person in 1 day : $$frac12mbox day cdot R mboxacresover mboxperson cdot mboxday cdot xmboxpeople over mboxteam cdot frac12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person cdot 1 mbox day = frac14 xR + R mbox acres. $$ <p> This is also half of the area of the larger meadow , so $$frac14 xR + R = frac12 cdot frac34 xR. $$ We can divide both sides of this equation by ( R ) since it is not zero , and solve the resulting equation ( x ) : <p> Solution : Harvesting the Fields , method 3 : choosing a size for the fields <p> Let 's assume that the smaller field is 1 acre and the larger one is 2 acres . Assuming these particular sizes does not change our final answer ; if the sizes are different then the rate at which the farm-workers can harvest is different , but the total number of farm-workers stays the same . A more sophisticated way of saying this would be to say that we are working in units of size one small field . In working with this solution it might make sense to make up a name for this unit . <p> Then the larger field would be cleared by the whole team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that working together , they clear ( frac83 ) of an acre per day . Then half of them clear ( frac23 ) of an acre in a half day , so for the 1 acre field , this would mean that there is ( frac13 ) of an acre left for the single farm-worker , so he or she clears ( frac13 ) of an acre per day . This is ( frac18 ) of what the entire team can clear , so the entire team is 8 farm-workers.

Some products on the diagonal , such as 2 ( times ) 2 = 4 , do also appear elsewhere because they have a different factorization ( 4 ( times ) 1 and 1 ( times ) 4 in this case ) .

These are shown below : <p> There are some numbers , such as 9 , 16 , and 36 , which appear 3 times . The numbers which appear 4 times have two distinct factorizations into single digit numbers ( up to the order of the factors ) : for example , ( 24 = 4 times 6 = 3 times 8 ) . If the table were continued further , other larger numbers such as 72 and 48 would appear many more than 4 times . The number 72 will eventually appear 12 times and the number 48 will appear 10 times . <p> We see that 10 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 18 , and 20 all appear in the table so the missing numbers between 10 and 20 are $$ 11 , 13 , 17 , 19. $$ The multiplication table contains all products of single digit numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factored as a product of two single digit numbers . In the case of 11 , 13 , 17 , and 19 , this means that they do not factor at all , except as a product of 1 and themselves . So this list is the list of prime numbers between 10 and 20.

When they want to talk about the loudness of a sound , scientists and engineers talk about amplitude . Musicians talk about dynamics . The amplitude of a sound is a particular number , usually measured in decibels , but dynamics are relative ; an orchestra playing fortissimo sounds much louder than a single violin playing fortissimo . The exact interpretation of each dynamic marking in a piece of music depends on : <p> comparison with other dynamics in that piece <p> the typical dynamic range for that instrument or ensemble <p> the abilities of the performer(s) <p> the traditions of the musical genre being performed <p> the acoustics of the performance space <p> Traditionally , dynamic markings are based on Italian words , although there is nothing wrong with simply writing things like " quietly " or " louder " in the music .

If the composer wants the change from one dynamic level to another to be gradual , different markings are added . A crescendo ( pronounced " cresh-EN-doe " ) means " gradually get louder " ; a decrescendo or diminuendo means " gradually get quieter " . <p> Figure 2 : Gradual Dynamic Markings . Here are three different ways to write the same thing : start softly ( piano ) , gradually get louder ( crescendo ) until the music is loud ( forte ) , then gradually get quieter ( decrescendo or diminuendo ) until it is quiet ( piano ) again . <h> Accents <p> A composer may want a particular note to be louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of a note to be loudest . Accents are markings that are used to indicate these **26;913;TOOLONG notes . There are a few different types of written accents ( see Figure 3 ) , but , like dynamics , the proper way to perform a given accent also depends on the instrument playing it , as well as the style and period of the music . Some accents may even be played by making the note longer or shorter than the other notes , in addition to , or even instead of being , louder . <p> Figure 3 : The exact performance of each type of accent depends on the instrument and the style and period of the music , but the sforzando and fortepiano-type accents are usually louder and longer , and more likely to be used in a long note that starts loudly and then suddenly gets much softer .

So ( overlineAO ) is congruent to ( overlineCO ) and ( overlineBO ) is congruent to ( overlineDO ) . This means that ( O ) is the midpoint of ( overlineAC ) and of ( overlineBD ) . So rotation by 180 about ( O ) switches ( A ) and ( C ) and also switches ( D ) and ( B ) . Hence rotation by 180 degrees maps ( ABCD ) to itself and this means that ( ABCD ) is a parallelogram.

@@119689920 @8689920/ <h> Pitch : Sharp , Flat , and Natural Notes 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To understand the definition of a pitch , its effect on notes , and the associated symbols . <p> The pitch of a note is how high or low it sounds . Pitch depends on the frequency of the fundamental sound wave of the note . The higher the frequency of a sound wave , and the shorter its wavelength , the higher its pitch sounds . But musicians usually do n't want to talk about wavelengths and frequencies . Instead , they just give the different pitches different letter names : A , B , C , D , E , F , and G. These seven letters name all the natural notes ( on a keyboard , that 's all the white keys ) within one octave . ( When you get to the eighth natural note , you start the next octave on another A. ) <p> Figure 1 : The natural notes name the white keys on a keyboard . <p> But in Western music there are twelve notes in each octave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other five notes ( on a keyboard , the black keys ) ? <p> Figure 2 : Sharp , flat , and natural signs can appear either in the key signature , or right in front of the note that they change . <p> A sharp sign means " the note that is one half step higher than the natural note " . A flat sign means " the note that is one half step lower than the natural note " . Some of the natural notes are only one half step apart , but most of them are a whole step apart . When they are a whole step apart , the note in between them can only be named using a flat or a sharp . <p> Figure 3 <p> Notice that , using flats and sharps , any pitch can be given more than one note name . For example , the G sharp and the A flat are played on the same key on the keyboard ; they sound the same . You can also name and write the F natural as " E sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half step higher than E natural , which is the definition of E sharp . Notes that have different names but sound the same are called enharmonic notes . <p> Figure 4 <p> Sharp and flat signs can be used in two ways : they can be part of a key signature , or they can mark accidentals . For example , if most of the C 's in a piece of music are going to be sharp , then a sharp sign is put in the " C " space at the beginning of the staff , in the key signature . If only a few of the C 's are going to be sharp , then those C 's are marked individually with a sharp sign right in front of them . Pitches that are not in the key signature are called accidentals . <p> Figure 5 : When a sharp sign appears in the C space in the key signature , all C 's are sharp unless marked as accidentals . <p> A note can also be double sharp or double flat . A double sharp is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural note ; a double flat is two half steps ( a whole step ) lower . Triple , quadruple , etc. sharps and flats are rare , but follow the same pattern : every sharp or flat raises or lowers the pitch one more half step . <p> Using double or triple sharps or flats may seem to be making things more difficult than they need to be . Why not call the note " A natural " instead of " G double sharp " ? The answer is that , although A natural and G double sharp are the same pitch , they do n't have the same function within a particular chord or a particular key . For musicians who understand some music theory ( and that includes most performers , not just composers and music teachers ) , calling a note " G double sharp " gives important and useful information about how that note functions in the chord and in the progression of the harmony .

The Va n't Hoff Factor of a covalently bonded compound is thus usually ( 1 ) , because the result when the chemical is " dissociated " is one molecule , the one that was initially present . <p> Example 1 : The chemical 1-ethanol , with a structural formula ( CH2OHCH3 ) and molecular formula ( C2H6O ) , is a nonelectrolyte and does not dissociate in aqueous solution . Thus its Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 1 ) . <p> The one major exception to this rule , however , is acids . An acid will decompose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Va n't Hoff Factor for these Bronsted-Lowry Acids is equal to the number of ions that result when the original chemical dissociates in aqueous solution . <p> Example 2 : The chemical hydrochloric acid , ( HCl ) , dissociates into a single ( H+ ) and a single ( Cl- ) when placed in water . Since two ions result , the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) . <p> Example 3 : The chemical sulfuric acid , ( H2SO4 ) dissociates into two ( H+ ) and a single ( SO42- ) when placed in water . There are a total of three ions ( not two ! ) so the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 3 ) . <h> Va n't Hoff Factor for Ionic Compounds <p> Finding the Va n't Hoff Factor for an ionic compound is basically the same as finding the Va n't Hoff Factor for an acid , as described in the previous section . When dissociated , the ionic compound will break down into its component cation and anion . Since two different ions will form from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoff Factor of an ionic compound will always be at least ( 2 ) . However , sometimes more than one cation and/or anion will form from a formula unit , in which case each individual ion is counted separately , even if two or more of the ions are indistinguishable . <p> Note that all ionic compounds are written in the form ( AxBy ) , where ( A ) is the cation , ( B ) is the anion , and ( x ) and ( y ) are the respective coefficients . This indicates how many of each ion are used to create the final ionic compound . Once the ionic compound is dissociated , each cation and each anion will be counted when determining the Va n't Hoff Factor . Thus , ( x ) cations and ( y ) anions form per formula unit . A total of ( x + y ) ions result , so the Va n't Hoff Factor for an ionic compound is ( x + y ) . <p> Example 4 : Find the Va n't Hoff Factor of ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coefficients are both ( 1 ) , so one cation and one anion will be isolated upon dissociation . Thus the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 2 ) . <p> Example 5 : Find the Va n't Hoff Factor of Aluminum Dichromate . <p> Solution : The chemical formula for Aluminum Phosphate is ( Al2(Cr2O7)3 ) ( do n't be thrown off by the anion containing a metal ) . The cation coefficient is ( 2 ) , and the anion coefficient is ( 3 ) . A total of five ions are isolated upon dissociation of one formula unit of this chemical , so the Va n't Hoff Factor is ( 5 ) . <h> Stoichiometry with the Va n't Hoff Factor <p> Finding the Va n't Hoff Factor of a compound can be a helpful technique when performing certain types of stoichiometric calculations , generally where we want to find the number of one or more ions constituting a compound . <p> Example 6 : How many moles of ions are in a ( 30.0 ) -gram sample of sodium bicarbonate ? <p> Solution : The chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert from grams of sodium bicarbonate to moles of sodium bicarbonate , we need to find the molar mass of sodium bicarbonate :

Stanford 's friends were convinced that a galloping horse always had at least one foot on the ground , but Stanford claimed that there was a moment during each cycle of the motion when all four feet were in the air . The human eye was simply not fast enough to settle the question . In 1878 , Muybridge finally succeeded in producing what amounted to a motion picture of the horse , showing conclusively that all four feet did leave the ground at one point . <p> The losers of the bet had probably been influenced by Aristotelian reasoning , for instance the expectation that a leaping horse would lose horizontal velocity while in the air with no force to push it forward , so that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even for students who have converted wholeheartedly to Newtonianism , the relationship between force and acceleration leads to some conceptual difficulties , the main one being a problem with the true but seemingly absurd statement that an object can have an acceleration vector whose direction is not the same as the direction of motion . The horse , for instance , has nearly constant horizontal velocity , so its ( ax ) is zero . But as anyone can tell you who has ridden a galloping horse , the horse accelerates up and down . The horse 's acceleration vector therefore changes back and forth between the up and down directions , but is never in the same direction as the horse 's motion . <p> ( textThe velocity vector ) <p> For motion with constant velocity , the velocity vector is <p> $$v=+ " r/+ " t. ; textonly for constant velocity$$ <p> The + " r vector points in the direction of the motion , and dividing it by the scalar + " t only changes its length , not its direction , so the velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the velocity is not constant , i.e. , when the x-t , y-t , and z-t graphs are not all linear , we use the **25;971;TOOLONG approach to define the components ( vx ) , ( vy ) , and ( vz ) , from which we assemble the velocity vector . Even when the velocity vector is not constant , it still points along the direction of motion . <p> Vector addition is the correct way to generalize the one-dimensional concept of adding velocities in relative motion , as shown in the following example : <p> Example 1 : Velocity vectors in relative motion <p> G You wish to cross a river and arrive at a dock that is directly across from you , but the river 's current will tend to carry you downstream . To compensate , you must steer the boat at an angle . Find the angle ++ , given the magnitude , ( vWL ) , of the water 's velocity relative to the land , and the maximum speed , ( vBW ) , of which the boat is capable relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the land equals the vector sum of its velocity with respect to the water and the water 's velocity with respect to the land , <p> $$vBL=vBW+vWL. $$ <p> If the boat is to travel straight across the river , i.e. , along the y axis , then we need to have ( vBL , x ) =0 . This x component equals the sum of the x components of the other two vectors , <p> $$vBL , x=vBW , x+vWL , x$$ <p> or <p> $$0=-vBWsin+++vWL. $$ <p> Solving for ++ , we find <p> $$sin++ = vWL / vBW $$ <p> so <p> $$++ = sin-1 fracvWL vBW $$ <p> ( textThe acceleration vector ) <p> When all three acceleration components are constant , i.e. , when the ( vx-t , vy-t ) , and ( vz-t ) graphs are all linear , we can define the acceleration vector as <p> If the acceleration is not constant , we define it as the vector made out of the ( ax ) , ( ay ) , and ( az ) components found by applying the **25;998;TOOLONG technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , t ) , and ( vz , t ) graphs . <p> Now there are two ways in which we could have a nonzero acceleration . Either the magnitude or the direction of the velocity vector could change . This can be visualized with arrow diagrams as shown in figures b and c . Both the magnitude and direction can change simultaneously , as when a car accelerates while turning . Only when the magnitude of the velocity changes while its direction stays constant do we have a + " v vector and an acceleration vector along the same line as the motion . <p> Figure b : A change in the magnitude of the velocity vector implies an acceleration . <p> Figure c : A change in the direction of the velocity vector also produces a nonzero + " v vector , and thus a nonzero acceleration vector , + " v/+ " t . <p> If this all seems a little strange and abstract to you , you 're not alone . It does n't mean much to most physics students the first time someone tells them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vector does not have to be in the same direction as the velocity vector . One way to understand those statements better is to imagine an object such as an air freshener or a pair of fuzzy dice hanging from the rear-view mirror of a car . Such a hanging object , called a bob , constitutes an accelerometer . If you watch the bob as you accelerate from a stop light , you 'll see it swing backward . The horizontal direction in which the bob tilts is opposite to the direction of the acceleration . If you apply the brakes and the car 's acceleration vector points backward , the bob tilts forward . <p> After accelerating and slowing down a few times , you think you 've put your accelerometer through its paces , but then you make a right turn . Surprise ! Acceleration is a vector , and need n't point in the same direction as the velocity vector . As you make a right turn , the bob swings outward , to your left . That means the car 's acceleration vector is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful definition of an acceleration vector should relate in a systematic way to the actual physical effects produced by the acceleration , so a physically reasonable definition of the acceleration vector must allow for cases where it is not in the same direction as the motion . <p> Example 2 : Rappelling <p> In figure d , the rappeller 's velocity has long periods of gradual change interspersed with short periods of rapid change . These correspond to periods of small acceleration and force , and periods of large acceleration and force . <p> Example 3 : The galloping horse <p> Figure e shows outlines traced from the first , third , fifth , seventh , and ninth frames in Muybridge 's series of photographs of the galloping horse . The estimated location of the horse 's center of mass is shown with a circle , which bobs above and below the horizontal dashed line . <p> If we do n't care about calculating velocities and accelerations in any particular system of units , then we can pretend that the time between frames is one unit . The horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next can then be found simply by drawing an arrow to connect one position of the center of mass to the next . This produces a series of velocity vectors which alternate between pointing above and below horizontal . <p> The + " v vector is the vector which we would have to add onto one velocity vector in order to get the next velocity vector in the series . The + " v vector alternates between pointing down ( around the time when the horse is in the air , B ) and up ( around the time when the horse has two feet on the ground , D ) . <p> ( textThe force vector and simple machines ) <p> Force is relatively easy to intuit as a vector . The force vector points in the direction in which it is trying to accelerate the object it is acting on . <p> Since force vectors are so much easier to visualize than acceleration vectors , it is often helpful to first find the direction of the ( total ) force vector acting on an object , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Newton 's second law tells us that the two must be in the same direction . <p> Example 4 : A component of a force vector <p> Figure f , redrawn from a classic 1920 textbook , shows a boy pulling another child on a sled . His force has both a horizontal component and a vertical one , but only the horizontal one accelerates the sled . ( The vertical component just partially cancels the force of gravity , causing a decrease in the normal force between the runners and the snow . ) There are two triangles in the figure . One triangle 's hypotenuse is the rope , and the other 's is the magnitude of the force . These triangles are similar , so their internal angles are all the same , but they are not the same triangle . One is a distance triangle , with sides measured in meters , the other a force triangle , with sides in newtons . In both cases , the horizontal leg is 93% as long as the hypotenuse . It does not make sense , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force triangle is not smaller in any meaningful sense . <p> Example 5 : Pushing a block up a ramp <p> G Figure g shows a block being pushed up a frictionless ramp at constant speed by an applied force ( FA ) . How much force is required , in terms of the block 's mass , m , and the angle of the ramp , ++ ? <p> G Figure h shows the other two forces acting on the block : a normal force , ( FN ) , created by the ramp , and the weight force , ( FW ) , created by the earth 's gravity . Because the block is being pushed up at constant speed , it has zero acceleration , and the total force on it must be zero . From figure i , we find <p> $$FA =FWsin++ =mgsin++. $$ <p> Since the sine is always less than one , the applied force is always less than mg , i.e. , pushing the block up the ramp is easier than lifting it straight up . This is presumably the principle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a hard time applying the forces of enough slaves to equal the full weight of the huge blocks of stone . <p> Essentially the same analysis applies to several other simple machines , such as the wedge and the screw . <p> Figure g : The applied force FA pushes the block up the frictionless ramp . <p> Figure h : Three forces act on the block . Their vector sum is zero . <p> Figure i : If the block is to move at constant velocity , Newton 's first law says that the three force vectors acting on it must add up to zero . To perform vector addition , we put the vectors tip to tail , and in this case we are adding three vectors , so each one 's tail goes against the tip of the previous one . Since they are supposed to add up to zero , the third vector 's tip must come back to touch the tail of the first vector . They form a triangle , and since the applied force is perpendicular to the normal force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A layback <p> The figure shows a rock climber using a technique called a layback . He can make the normal forces ( FN1 ) and ( FN2 ) large , which has the side-effect of increasing the frictional forces ( FF1 ) and ( FF2 ) , so that he does n't slip down due to the gravitational ( weight ) force ( FW ) . The purpose of the problem is not to analyze all of this in detail , but simply to practice finding the components of the forces based on their magnitudes . To keep the notation simple , let 's write ( FN1 ) for ( FN1 ) , etc . The crack overhangs by a small , positive angle ( ++ approx 9circ ) . <p> In this example , we determine the x component of ( FN1 ) . <p> The easiest method is the one demonstrated in example 5 .

We expect this force to have a large x component and a much smaller y . Since ++ is small , cos++G 1 , while sin++ is small . Therefore the x component must be -(FN1)cos++ . <p> ( textCalculus with vectors ) <p> Using the unit vector notation , the definitions of the velocity and acceleration components can be translated into calculus notation as <p> To make the notation less cumbersome , we generalize the concept of the derivative to include derivatives of vectors , so that we can abbreviate the above equations as <p> $$v= fracdrdt$$ <p> and <p> $$a = fracdvdt$$ <p> In words , to take the derivative of a vector , you take the derivatives of its components and make a new vector out of those . This definition means that the derivative of a vector function has the familiar properties <p> $$fracd(cf)dt = cfracd(f)dt ; ; textc is a constant$$ <p> and <p> $$fracd(f+g)dt = fracd(f)dt + fracd(g)dt$$ <p> The integral of a vector is likewise defined as integrating component by component . <p> Example 7 : The second derivative of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time given by the equations <p> $$r1 = 3t2 hatx + t haty$$ <p> Find both objects ' accelerations using calculus . Could either answer have been found without calculus ? <p> G Taking the first derivative of each component , we find <p> $$v1 =6thatx+haty$$ $$v2 =12t3 hatx+haty , $$ <p> and taking the derivatives again gives acceleration , <p> $$a1 =6hatx$$ $$a2 =36t2 hatx. $$ <p> The first object 's acceleration could have been found without calculus , simply by comparing the x and y coordinates with the constant-acceleration equation + " x= ( vo + " t+1/2a+ " t2 ) . The second equation , however , is n't just a second-order polynomial in t , so the acceleration is n't constant , and we really did need calculus to find the corresponding acceleration . <p> Example 8 : The integral of a vector <p> G Starting from rest , a flying saucer of mass m is observed to vary its propulsion with mathematical precision according to the equation <p> $$F=bt42 hatx+ct137haty. $$ <p> ( The aliens inform us that the numbers 42 and 137 have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's velocity as a function of time . <p> where we have omitted the constants of integration , since the saucer was starting from rest . <p> Example 9 : A fire-extinguisher stunt on ice <p> G Prof. Puerile smuggles a fire extinguisher into a skating rink . Climbing out onto the ice without any skates on , he sits down and pushes off from the wall with his feet , acquiring an initial velocity ( vo haty ) . At t=0 , he then discharges the fire extinguisher at a 45-degree angle so that it applies a force to him that is backward and to the left , i.e. , along the negative y axis and the positive x axis .

So music that is in , for example , C major , will not sound significantly different from music that is in , say , D major . But music that is in D minor will have a different quality , because the notes in the minor scale follow a different pattern and so have different relationships with each other .

Just as it did in major scales , starting the minor scale pattern on a different note will give you a different key signature , a different set of sharps or flats . The scale that is created by playing all the notes in a minor key signature is a natural minor scale . To create a natural minor scale , start on the tonic note and go up the scale using the interval pattern : whole step , half step , whole step , whole step , half step , whole step , whole step . <p> Figure 1 : Natural minor scale intervals . <h> Relative Minor and Major Keys <p> Each minor key shares a key signature with a major key .

In fact , certain strategic accidentals are very useful in helping establish a strong tonal center in a minor key . These useful accidentals are featured in the melodic minor and harmonic minor scales . <p> Figure 2 : The interval patterns for major and natural minor scales are basically the same pattern starting at different points . <p> It is easy to predict where the relative minor of a major key can be found . Notice that the pattern for minor scales overlaps the pattern for major scales . In other words , they are the same pattern starting in a different place . ( If the patterns were very different , minor key signatures would not be the same as major key signatures . ) The pattern for the minor scale starts a half step plus a whole step lower than the major scale pattern , so a relative minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

C minor is the relative minor of E flat major . <h> Harmonic and Melodic Minor Scales <p> All of the scales above are natural minor scales . They contain only the notes in the minor key signature . There are two other kinds of minor scales that are commonly used , both of which include notes that are not in the key signature .

Like any minor scale , dorian minor may start on any note , but like dorian mode , it is often illustrated as natural notes beginning on d . <p> Figure 5 : The " dorian minor " can be written as a scale of natural notes starting on d .

The student who is interested in modal jazz will eventually become acquainted with all of the modal scales .

The number that is being multiplied is known as the exponent 's base , while the number indicating how many times you multiply is known as the superscript ( used interchangeably with " exponent " ) . Using the definition of an exponent , many expressions can be much easier to write than with expanded notation . Those shortcuts , and ways to use exponents , will be discussed and demonstrated in this article . <h> Converting Between Exponents and Expanded Notation <p> One of the basic examples of converting between exponents and standard notation is where the exponent is a 2 and the base is multiplied by itself twice . For instance : <p> Example 1 : By the definition of the exponent : <p> ( 22 = 2 times 2 ) <p> Of course , this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in general , <p> $$a2 = a times a$$ <p> Here is one more example : <p> Example 2 : Since ( 62 = 6 times 6 ) , we know that the shorthand ( 62 ) is still equivalent to ( 36 ) . <p> The exponent can be anything , really ( even a function with variables in it ) . But for now , we 'll stick with positive integer exponents . An example where the exponent is not ( 2 ) is shown below . <p> Example 3 : We can write the expression ( 45 ) as follows : <p> $$4 times 4 times 4 times 4 times 4$$ <h> When Zero and One are Involved <p> The cases of ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) are special and deserve special attention . When dealing with either of these numbers , there are special rules to consider : <p> When the base is ( 0 ) , the expression equals zero , unless the exponent is also ( 0 ) . <p> When the exponent is ( 0 ) , the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0 ) . <p> When the base is ( 1 ) , the expression equals ( 1 ) , regardless of the exponent . <p> When the exponent is ( 1 ) , the expression is equal to the base , regardless of what the base is . <p> We can break down and explain each of these rules : <p> Rule 1 : This is the same as multiplying zero by itself any number of times , which will always be zero ( excluding the special case ) . <p> Rule 2 : This is like multiplying a number by itself zero times , which , not including ( 00 ) , will always give an answer of ( 1 ) . <p> Rule 3 : Similar to Rule 1 , this is like multiplying ( 1 ) by itself a number of times , which will always give you an answer of ( 1 ) . <p> Rule 4 : This rule resembles being given a number and leaving it alone . You are not multiplying it by itself , but you are not using an exponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( these three quantities have a special relationship which will be explained later ) . <p> The aforementioned exception is ( 00 ) . This expression is undefined , and there is a reason . The first rule suggests that ( 00 = 0 ) , while the second rule suggests that ( 00 = 1 ) , but since ( 0 neq 1 ) , neither of these can be true , and so ( 00 ) is undefined . <p> I will now present a string of examples that illustrate these rules : <p> Example 4 : ( 06 = 0 ) <p> Example 5 : ( 150 = 1 ) <p> Example 6 : ( 241 = 24 ) <p> Example 7 : ( 1x = 1 ) , regardless of the real value of ( x ) . <h> Multiplying Exponents with the Same Base <p> We can also multiply exponents together , which is most easily done when the exponents have the same base . To see how this is done , consider the following example : <p> Example 8 : We will work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) separately and multiply the results : <p> ( 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 ) <p> This is the same as ( 39 ) , as it is a ( 3 ) multiplied by itself eight more times . <p> This example helps to illustrate the following law of exponents : <p> If ( b ) , ( x ) , and ( y ) are numbers , then : <p> $$bx cdot by = bx + y$$ <p> The exception is where ( b = 0 ) and ( x = -y ) because this gives us the dreaded ( 00 ) . <p> Here is another example of using this law . <p> Example 9 : Simplify ( 1115 cdot 114 ) . <p> Solution : The bases are the same , so we can add the exponents : <p> $$1115 cdot 114 = 1115 + 4 = 1119$$ <h> Factoring Bases <p> Sometimes factoring the base of an exponent will allow you to simplify it further . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base factoring works . <p> Example 10 : Since ( 9 = 3 cdot 3 ) , we can rewrite ( 92 ) as <p> $$ ( 3 cdot 3 ) 2$$ <p> We can distribute the exponent just like we would do to a factor : <p> $$32 cdot 32$$ <p> We also see that this can be rewritten as <p> $$ ( 32 ) 2$$ <p> As a final note , notice that ( 92 = 9 cdot 9 = 81 = 34 ) . This is an example of a special pattern that will be discussed later . <p> Example 10 illustrates the following rule : <p> If ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( x ) are numbers , <p> $$ ( ab ) x = ax cdot bx$$ <p> The exception is where ( x = 0 ) and either ( a = 0 ) or ( b = 0 ) , because that gives ( 00 ) . Every exponent rule will have an exception where the relevant expression becomes ( 00 ) or ( frac00 ) , because both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping this exponent law in mind . <p> Example 11 : Simplify the expression ( frac15658 ) . <p> Solution : We realize that ( 15 ) factors as ( 3 cdot 5 ) , so we can rewrite the expression as <p> $$frac ( 5 cdot 3 ) 658 = frac56 cdot 3658$$ <p> Both the numerator and denominator have an exponent with a base of ( 5 ) , so write all of the ( 5 ) s out : <p> It is now clear that the numerator and denominator have six common factors of ( 5 ) , or a common factor of ( 56 ) , so cancel out the corresponding factors : <p> $$frac365 cdot 5 = frac3652$$ <p> Since the bases do not share any common factors besides ( 1 ) , we can not simplify this further . <p> Here is one more example involving variables . It is important to include examples with variables since many problems will be in more general forms . <p> Example 12 : Simplify the expression ( ( 2a ) x + 7 cdot ax + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factor of ( 2a ) , so we can factor the first base : <p> $$ ( 2 cdot a ) x + 7 cdot ax + 7$$ <p> Now , distribute the exponent to each of the two factors : <p> $$2x + 7 cdot ax + 7 cdot ax + 7$$ <p> The factor ( ax + 7 ) appears twice , so just like with any duplicate factor , we can condense it as follows : <p> $$ax + 7 cdot ax + 7 = ( ax + 7 ) 2$$ <p> Thus the expression becomes <p> $$2x + 7 cdot ( ax + 7 ) 2$$ <p> There is something else we can do . We can use the rule ( bx cdot by = bx + y ) on the first factor , but use it backwards , giving the following : <p> $$2x cdot 27 cdot ( ax + 7 ) 2$$ <p> The factor without variables can be written as an integer ( which is considered simplifying if it is relatively easy to do ) : <p> $$128 cdot 2x cdot ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can simplify the expression for now . We will learn another rule to help us simplify it further later on . <h> Dividing Exponents <p> You can also divide exponents , provided they have the same base . Otherwise , nothing can be done to simplify the expression unless you convert between bases ( which is rather hard in most cases ) . Since division and multiplication are inverse ( opposite ) operations , the laws of multiplication and division of exponents are similar . <p> If ( b ) , ( x ) , and ( y ) are numbers , then <p> $$fracbxby = bx - y$$ <p> This is another rule that has common uses . <p> Example 13 : Simplify the expression ( frac8684 ) . <p> Solution : We subtract the exponents , since the bases are the same : <p> $$frac8684 = 86 - 4 = 82 = 8 cdot 8 = 64$$ <p> Here is an example that combines two of the laws we have learned up to this point . We are going to do Example 11 over again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Example 14 : Simplify ( frac15658 ) . <p> Solution : The first step remains the same : we factor the base of the numerator : <p> $$frac ( 5 cdot 3 ) 658 = frac56 cdot 3658$$ <p> Now we subtract the superscripts of the exponents with the same base , giving <p> $$5-2 cdot 36$$ <h> Negative Exponents <p> Example 14 had a negative exponent . While these probably look intimidating to readers that are unfamiliar with them , they are really simple . Just follow this one rule , established by the definition of negative exponents : <p> $$a-x = frac1ax$$ <p> Of course this fails if ( a = 0 ) , because then the denominator is ( 0 ) . <p> As a basic example of this process , we return to where we ended Example 14 : <p> Example 15 : When trying to rewrite ( 5-2 cdot 36 ) without the use of any negative exponents , we ignore the ( 36 ) since the superscript is positive . Then we get <p> All the bases are the same , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = frac13$$ <h> Common Misconceptions <p> Some " rules " in exponent algebra appear to make common sense to people who are new to exponents based on the mechanics of more simple arithmetic . Some of those fake rules will be presented here . Each will be presented with a counterexample , or an example that proves a general relationship false . <p> This suggests that ( ax + y = axy ) , according to a real rule that was already established . <p> Counterexample : <p> $$75 cdot 73 neq 715$$ <p> In reality , the left-hand side is equivalent to ( 78 ) . <p> Fake Rule 3 : ( a-x = -ax ) <p> All exponential functions with a positive base are always nonnegative over the real numbers ( just look at graphs ) , so this one does n't make much sense . Of course it works for ( a = 0 ) and some cases of ( a = -1 ) but it is not always true . <p> Counterexample : <p> $$28 neq -2-8$$ <p> The right hand side is the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously not equivalent . <p> If you study the rules of exponents carefully and do not fall for the pitfalls demonstrated here , you should do well in your studies of exponents . The material used in algebra courses is used again repeatedly in precalculus and calculus courses , so it is worthwhile to keep this information in your head for a long time . The basics will get you very far .

It 's a little sad that in an age of such technological advancement , we can not say " I want to teach about World War II " and instantly have excellent ideas and techniques to inspire us . Free or paid resources - nothing rescues us time-strapped teachers in need to meet those specific students ' or school goals . <p> We are building a completely new way to plan lessons ; an exponentially better solution to anything out there . Using what we have learned from teachers and administrators in the past 4 years , we are taking a teacher-centric stab at this problem . And in the process , we are solving for the curriculum AND instruction problem , together . Our results so far ? Extremely promising ! <p> But why another lesson planning tool ? How is this related to the rest of OpenCurriculum ? And have n't we already tried to solve this problem ? <h> Why another lesson planner ? <p> We asked ourselves this question too many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market that work just fine . You put stuff on templates , and then on a calendar , and even attach resources to them . Makes planning easy , right ? Turns out : not much . <p> Initially , we were n't convinced that a tool for planning did much good . After all , it 's the challenging process of thinking through your lesson , your different students needs , your style of pacing , the larger unit , lessons tried by other good teachers , your state standards ( and its philosophy ) , your district needs , etc. that makes planning time-consuming , lonely , and painful . <p> It turns out these are exactly the problems lesson planning tools are n't solving for teachers . Why ? We think its because these are complex problems with no easy answers . They are also heavily tied to specific content , and ca n't be solved in an agnostic manner through the search engine experience . It 's also very hard to balance flexibility with control in design . <p> As we realized later , these problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of these all this while . Putting them together and taking the experience to the next level was eventually a no-brainer for us . <h> Has n't OpenCurriculum built a lesson planning tool before ? <p> We did ! We made a very ordinary attempt two years ago . We shut it down a few months after launching it . I 'll admit it was rather average - and despite spending a huge amount of effort bringing it to life , we realized it was not really helping teachers the way we now realize we can . <p> In short - it was very procedural . Choose a template , fill some boxes ( get some default non-unique pointers on filling each box ) , save , and share or make changes . It was slightly better than using Google Docs for making a lesson , but really , it was n't all that much helpful to teachers . <p> It 's taken two years to understand how to put the pieces together in the correct way , and we ca n't wait to show you what we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some ideas but not sure what you guys are thinking . <p> We are midway through bringing the product to life , and it will take a couple of more months to bring something early under public light . That said , this is probably the best time to reach out to us and discuss ideas . We can show you what we have and hear from you on your thoughts . Your ideas could be hugely influential in the months to come . <p> We 'd love to hear from you if you are interested in talking more . You can reach out to me at varun at opencurriculum dot org . Do n't hesitate . We 'll be waiting for your email ! <p> Because we are taking a very thoughtful discipline-specific approach ( as opposed to an agnostic one ) , we will be rolling out one content-area for a specific set of grades at a time . We are preparing to serve the CCSS ones before others . International focus is really important for us , so we will also be experimenting with different education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or different from ' OpenCurriculum For Districts ' and all your tools for curriculum mapping and building libraries / repositories ? <p> At the heart of all of these planning , mapping , and organizing tools that we have brought to life so far is the lesson and activity planning piece . It 's also the most complicated . So far , we conveniently outsourced the problem : use PDF or Word or Docs or blog or wherever your ideas flow naturally . <p> However , this meant that the curriculum produced was fragmented and ended up in multiple formats and media . This is a huge curse for the advancement of teaching and learning , as these systems do n't talk to each other . It was finally time to solve this problem too , so it seamlessly connects to all the other pieces . <p> We are aspiring for this planning tool to complete our toolkit for designing and publishing curriculum .

@@119689936 @8689936/ <h> A-REI Accurately weighing pennies I <p> In ( 1983 ) the composition of pennies in the United States was changed due , in part , to the rising cost of copper . Pennies minted after ( 1983 ) weigh ( 2.50 ) grams while the earlier copper pennies weigh ( 3.11 ) grams . <p> A roll of pennies contains ( 50 ) coins . If a particular roll of pennies weighs ( 138.42 ) grams , how many of the old heavier pennies and how many of the new lighter pennies does this roll contain ? <p> Suppose you measure a roll of pennies on a scale which only reads the weight to the nearest gram . The scale says that the roll of pennies weighs ( 131 ) grams . What can you conclude about the pennies in this roll ? What if the roll weighs ( 134 ) grams ? Explain . <p> Some references list the weight of the newer pennies as ( 2.5 ) grams instead of ( 2.50 ) grams . If you only knew that the measurement of ( 2.5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what can you conclude about the pennies in the roll if the scale reads ( 138.4 ) grams ? <h> Commentary <p> This problem involves solving a system of algebraic equations from a context : depending how the problem is interpreted , there may be one equation or two . The main work in parts ( a ) and ( b ) is in setting up the equation(s) appropriately . Question ( c ) is more subtle and it requires thinking carefully about the accuracy available in a particular measurement ( weight ) . The first two parts of this task could be used for instructional or assessment purposes while the third part should strictly be implemented for instructional purposes . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : 1 System of Equations <p> If we call ( x ) the number of older , heavier pennies in the roll and ( y ) the number of newer lighter pennies in the roll then we have the equation $$ x + y = 50 $$ since there are a total of ( 50 ) pennies in the roll . Each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newer pennies weighs ( 2.50 ) grams so the total weight of the pennies in the roll will be ( 3.11x + 2.50y ) giving us a second equation $$ 3.11x + 2.50y = 138.42. $$ <p> Multiplying the first equation by ( 5 ) gives ( 5x + 5y = 250 ) while multiplying the second equation by ( 2 ) gives ( 6.22x + 5y = 276.84 ) . Subtracting the first from the second we find $$ 1.22x = 26.84 $$ or $$ x = frac26.841.22 = 22. $$ So there are ( 22 ) of the older pennies and hence there must be ( 28 ) of the newer ones in order to make a full roll of ( 50 ) . <p> One way to approach this problem would be to repeat the reasoning in part ( a ) , using the equation ( 3.11x + 2.50y = 131 ) instead of ( 3.11x + 2.50y = 138.42 ) . The solutions for ( x ) and ( y ) will not be whole numbers but the whole numbers of interest will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x ) and ( y ) . <p> Another method would be informed guess and check . From part ( a ) we know that with 22 of the heavier pennies the weight is ( 138.42 ) grams which is too much . With no heavier pennies , the weight will be ( 50 times 2.50 = 125 ) grams . The over estimate is off by a little more than the underestimate so the answer should be a little less than half way between the two . If we try ( 11 ) of the heavier pennies we get a total weight of $$ 11 times 3.11 + 39 times 2.50 = 131.71. $$ This is too much and the scale would read ( 132 ) grams . If we try ( 10 ) of the heavier pennies we find $$ 10 times 3.11+ 40 times 2.50 = 131.1 $$ so the scale would read ( 131 ) grams . We should also check what happens with ( 9 ) of the heavier pennies : $$ 9 times 3.11 + 41 times 2.50 = 130.49 $$ and the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale reads ( 131 ) grams we can conclude that there are ( 10 ) of the heavier pennies and ( 40 ) of the lighter ones . <p> Similar reasoning can be applied if the scale reads ( 134 ) grams . If there are ( 11 ) heavier pennies we saw that the weight is about ( 2.3 ) grams short of ( 134 ) grams . Each heavier penny increases the weight by a little over ( 0.6 ) grams so ( 14 ) heavier pennies should be about right for a weight of ( 134 ) grams : $$ 14 times 3.11 + 36 times 2.50 = 133.54. $$ So this is one possibility . If we try ( 15 ) heavier pennies we find $$ 15 times3.11 + 35 times 2.50 = 134.15. $$ We can check that ( 16 ) pennies will read ( 135 ) grams and ( 13 ) pennies would read ( 133 ) grams . So if the scale reads ( 134 ) grams , then we can not conclude exactly how many heavier pennies are in the roll : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> We know from part ( a ) that one possibility is that there are ( 22 ) of the heavier pennies and ( 28 ) lighter ones . This is still possible since each of the lighter pennies could , for example , weigh ( 2.50 ) grams , giving a total of ( 70 ) grams while the ( 22 ) heavier ones would contribute ( 68.42 ) grams . But if the lighter pennies weigh a little more than ( 2.5 ) grams then there could be more of them and if they weigh a little less than ( 2.5 ) grams there could be fewer . <p> The error in measurement for each lighter penny is ( .05 ) grams since the scale measures to the nearest tenth of a gram . So with ( 28 ) of the lighter pennies their possible weight could be off by ( 28 times 0.05 = 1.4 ) grams . Since the difference in weight between the heavier and lighter pennies is ( 0.61 ) grams , this is enough to compensate for ( 2 ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to compensate for ( 3 ) . So if the lighter pennies are known to weigh ( 2.5 ) grams , to the nearest tenth of a gram , then a roll of pennies of weight ( 138.4 ) grams could contain ( 26,27,28,29 , ) or ( 30 ) of the lighter pennies . If there were ( 26 ) of the lighter pennies , they would almost all have to be close to ( 2.45 ) grams in weight and similarly if there were ( 30 ) of the lighter pennies they would all have to be close to ( 2.55 ) grams in weight . <p> Solution : 2 : Single Equation <p> Each of the heavier pennies weighs ( 2.50 + 0.61 ) grams . So if there are ( x ) of the heavier pennies in the roll then the total weight of pennies in the roll is $$ 50 times 2.50 + 0.61x. $$ This is the same as ( 125 + 0.61x ) . So if the total weight of the roll is ( 138.42 ) grams then we have $$ 125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives $$ x = frac13.420.61 = 22 $$ so there are ( 22 ) of the heavier pennies and ( 28 ) of the lighter ones . <p> As in part ( a ) , the total weight of the pennies in the roll is $$ 125 + 0.61x $$ grams where ( x ) is the total number of heavier pennies in the roll . So if the scale reads ( 131 ) grams , to the nearest gram , this means that ( 0.61x ) must be ( 6 ) , to the nearest gram . This means that ( x = 10 ) so there are ten of the heavier pennies . If the scale reads ( 134 ) grams then we have , similarly , that ( 0.61x ) must be , rounded to the nearest unit , ( 9 ) . This is possible if ( x = 14 ) or if ( x = 15 ) . Thus in this case there either ( 14 ) or ( 15 ) of the heavier pennies.

There is a gas station at the exit she normally takes , and she wonders if she will have to get gas before then . She normally sets her cruise control at the speed limit of 70mph and the freeway portion of the drive takes about an hour and 15 minutes . Her car gets about 30 miles per gallon on the freeway , and gas costs ( 3.50 per gallon . <p> Describe an estimate that Felicia might do in her head while driving to decide how many gallons of gas she needs to make it to the gas station at the other end . <p> Assuming she makes it , how much does Felicia spend per mile on the freeway ? <h> Commentary <p> This task provides students the opportunity to make use of units to find the gas need ( N-Q.1 ) . It also requires them to make some sensible approximations ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) ) and to recognize that Felicia 's situation requires her to round up . Various answers to ( a ) are possible , depending on how much students think is a safe amount for Felicia to have left in the tank when she arrives at the gas station . The key point is for them to explain their choices . This task provides an opportunity for students to practice MP2 , Reason abstractly and quantitatively , and MP3 , Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : Felicia 's Drive <p> To estimate the amount of gas she needs , Felicia calculates the distance traveled at 70 mph for 1.25 hours . She might calculate ) $70cdot 1.25 = 70 + 0.25cdot 70 = 70 + 17.5 = 87.5 mbox miles. $$ Since 1 gallon of gas will take her 30 miles , 3 gallons of gas will take her 90 miles , a little more than she needs .

How many vehicles do you think were in the traffic jam ? Explain your thinking and show all calculations . <h> Commentary <p> This task , while involving relatively simple arithmetic , codes to all three standards in this cluster , and also offers students a good opportunity to practice modeling ( MP4 ) , since they must attempt to make reasonable assumptions about the average length of vehicles in the traffic jam and the space between vehicles . Teachers can encourage students to compare their solutions with other students . <p> In addition to giving practice with working with units ( N-Q.1 ) , the task gives students an opportunity to engage with N-Q.2 by working with a new unit appropriate to the question , namely the notion of the length occupied by a vehicle in a traffic jam , which consists of its length plus the gap to the next vehicle . <p> The task also provides students the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( N-Q.3 ) . Given the uncertainties in assumptions , it does not make sense to report the number of vehicles to any greater accuracy than 100s . <p> Finally , teachers should be conscious of possible interpretations of the problem , and limitations of the model . For example , students may not know the standard convention that a " two lane freeway " has two lanes total , as opposed to two lanes in each direction . The problem is also ambiguous as to whether the traffic jam affects both direction of traffic , or just one ( as assumed in the solution ) . Teachers can decide whether to make these conditions explicit to students , or just note that students who adopt different conventions may have answers that are , e.g. , larger by a factor of 2 or 4 .

On what day does the amount from the magic coins become more than 1,000,000 ?

If we look at day 4 again , we have ( 16 = 2 cdot 8 ) coins . The 8 coins were obtained because ( 8 = 2 cdot 4 ) coins and the 4 coins came from ( 4 = 2 cdot 2 ) coins . So on day 4 we could also say we have ( 16 = 2 cdot 8 = 2 cdot ( 2 cdot 4 ) = 2 cdot ( 2 cdot ( 2 cdot 2 ) ) = 24 ) coins .

Since this number is a lot bigger than 50,000 , we can conclude that it is to our advantage to choose the magical coin as our reward . The last number in the table is so large that it is hard to understand just how much bigger it is than 50 , 000 . To illustrate this , the followup question may be helpful . By either filling the table in systematically or by trial and error we find that on day 15 there are ( 215 ) or 32,768 coins . On the very next day we have ( 216 ) or 65,536 coins . So it will take just over two weeks for our magical coin to outgrow the fixed reward of 50,000 coins . In just four more days ( on the 20th day ) the number of coins will be ( 220 = 1,048,576 ) which is already over a million . A graph helps us to visualize how fast the exponential expression grows with each day . 
@@119689953 @8689953/ <h> A-REI Accurately weighing pennies I <p> In ( 1983 ) the composition of pennies in the United States was changed due , in part , to the rising cost of copper . Pennies minted after ( 1983 ) weigh ( 2.50 ) grams while the earlier copper pennies weigh ( 3.11 ) grams . <p> A roll of pennies contains ( 50 ) coins . If a particular roll of pennies weighs ( 138.42 ) grams , how many of the old heavier pennies and how many of the new lighter pennies does this roll contain ? <p> Suppose you measure a roll of pennies on a scale which only reads the weight to the nearest gram . The scale says that the roll of pennies weighs ( 131 ) grams . What can you conclude about the pennies in this roll ? What if the roll weighs ( 134 ) grams ? Explain . <p> Some references list the weight of the newer pennies as ( 2.5 ) grams instead of ( 2.50 ) grams . If you only knew that the measurement of ( 2.5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what can you conclude about the pennies in the roll if the scale reads ( 138.4 ) grams ? <h> Commentary <p> This problem involves solving a system of algebraic equations from a context : depending how the problem is interpreted , there may be one equation or two . The main work in parts ( a ) and ( b ) is in setting up the equation(s) appropriately . Question ( c ) is more subtle and it requires thinking carefully about the accuracy available in a particular measurement ( weight ) . The first two parts of this task could be used for instructional or assessment purposes while the third part should strictly be implemented for instructional purposes . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : 1 System of Equations <p> If we call ( x ) the number of older , heavier pennies in the roll and ( y ) the number of newer lighter pennies in the roll then we have the equation $$ x + y = 50 $$ since there are a total of ( 50 ) pennies in the roll . Each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newer pennies weighs ( 2.50 ) grams so the total weight of the pennies in the roll will be ( 3.11x + 2.50y ) giving us a second equation $$ 3.11x + 2.50y = 138.42. $$ <p> Multiplying the first equation by ( 5 ) gives ( 5x + 5y = 250 ) while multiplying the second equation by ( 2 ) gives ( 6.22x + 5y = 276.84 ) . Subtracting the first from the second we find $$ 1.22x = 26.84 $$ or $$ x = frac26.841.22 = 22. $$ So there are ( 22 ) of the older pennies and hence there must be ( 28 ) of the newer ones in order to make a full roll of ( 50 ) . <p> One way to approach this problem would be to repeat the reasoning in part ( a ) , using the equation ( 3.11x + 2.50y = 131 ) instead of ( 3.11x + 2.50y = 138.42 ) . The solutions for ( x ) and ( y ) will not be whole numbers but the whole numbers of interest will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x ) and ( y ) . <p> Another method would be informed guess and check . From part ( a ) we know that with 22 of the heavier pennies the weight is ( 138.42 ) grams which is too much . With no heavier pennies , the weight will be ( 50 times 2.50 = 125 ) grams . The over estimate is off by a little more than the underestimate so the answer should be a little less than half way between the two . If we try ( 11 ) of the heavier pennies we get a total weight of $$ 11 times 3.11 + 39 times 2.50 = 131.71. $$ This is too much and the scale would read ( 132 ) grams . If we try ( 10 ) of the heavier pennies we find $$ 10 times 3.11+ 40 times 2.50 = 131.1 $$ so the scale would read ( 131 ) grams . We should also check what happens with ( 9 ) of the heavier pennies : $$ 9 times 3.11 + 41 times 2.50 = 130.49 $$ and the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale reads ( 131 ) grams we can conclude that there are ( 10 ) of the heavier pennies and ( 40 ) of the lighter ones . <p> Similar reasoning can be applied if the scale reads ( 134 ) grams . If there are ( 11 ) heavier pennies we saw that the weight is about ( 2.3 ) grams short of ( 134 ) grams . Each heavier penny increases the weight by a little over ( 0.6 ) grams so ( 14 ) heavier pennies should be about right for a weight of ( 134 ) grams : $$ 14 times 3.11 + 36 times 2.50 = 133.54. $$ So this is one possibility . If we try ( 15 ) heavier pennies we find $$ 15 times3.11 + 35 times 2.50 = 134.15. $$ We can check that ( 16 ) pennies will read ( 135 ) grams and ( 13 ) pennies would read ( 133 ) grams . So if the scale reads ( 134 ) grams , then we can not conclude exactly how many heavier pennies are in the roll : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> We know from part ( a ) that one possibility is that there are ( 22 ) of the heavier pennies and ( 28 ) lighter ones . This is still possible since each of the lighter pennies could , for example , weigh ( 2.50 ) grams , giving a total of ( 70 ) grams while the ( 22 ) heavier ones would contribute ( 68.42 ) grams . But if the lighter pennies weigh a little more than ( 2.5 ) grams then there could be more of them and if they weigh a little less than ( 2.5 ) grams there could be fewer . <p> The error in measurement for each lighter penny is ( .05 ) grams since the scale measures to the nearest tenth of a gram . So with ( 28 ) of the lighter pennies their possible weight could be off by ( 28 times 0.05 = 1.4 ) grams . Since the difference in weight between the heavier and lighter pennies is ( 0.61 ) grams , this is enough to compensate for ( 2 ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to compensate for ( 3 ) . So if the lighter pennies are known to weigh ( 2.5 ) grams , to the nearest tenth of a gram , then a roll of pennies of weight ( 138.4 ) grams could contain ( 26,27,28,29 , ) or ( 30 ) of the lighter pennies . If there were ( 26 ) of the lighter pennies , they would almost all have to be close to ( 2.45 ) grams in weight and similarly if there were ( 30 ) of the lighter pennies they would all have to be close to ( 2.55 ) grams in weight . <p> Solution : 2 : Single Equation <p> Each of the heavier pennies weighs ( 2.50 + 0.61 ) grams . So if there are ( x ) of the heavier pennies in the roll then the total weight of pennies in the roll is $$ 50 times 2.50 + 0.61x. $$ This is the same as ( 125 + 0.61x ) . So if the total weight of the roll is ( 138.42 ) grams then we have $$ 125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives $$ x = frac13.420.61 = 22 $$ so there are ( 22 ) of the heavier pennies and ( 28 ) of the lighter ones . <p> As in part ( a ) , the total weight of the pennies in the roll is $$ 125 + 0.61x $$ grams where ( x ) is the total number of heavier pennies in the roll . So if the scale reads ( 131 ) grams , to the nearest gram , this means that ( 0.61x ) must be ( 6 ) , to the nearest gram . This means that ( x = 10 ) so there are ten of the heavier pennies . If the scale reads ( 134 ) grams then we have , similarly , that ( 0.61x ) must be , rounded to the nearest unit , ( 9 ) . This is possible if ( x = 14 ) or if ( x = 15 ) . Thus in this case there either ( 14 ) or ( 15 ) of the heavier pennies.

While students should be able to follow the logic its primary use should be to challenge them to think creatively about the problem . The first solution to ( b ) is more grounded in classroom practice and should likely be the one emphasized for the majority of students . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : System of Linear equations <p> To find the quadratic functions ( f(x) = ax2 + bx + c ) whose graphs contain the points ( ( 1,0 ) ) and ( ( 3,0 ) ) we can evaluate ( f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a+b+c = 0 , f(3) &amp;=&amp; 9a+3b+c = 0 . endeqnarray* Solving the first equation for ( c ) gives ( c = -a- b ) . Plugging this into the second equation gives $$ 9a+3b-a-b = 0 $$ or ( 8a+2b=0 ) which is the same as ( 4a+b = 0 ) . We can not determine ( a ) or ( b ) but for a given ( a ) we find that ( b = -4a ) and , plugging back into ( c = -a -b ) we get that ( c = -a-(-4a) = 3a ) . So the general form of a quadratic whose graph contains the points ( ( 1,0 ) ) and ( ( 3,0 ) ) is $$ fa(x) = ax2 -4ax +3a. $$ Plugging in ( x = 1,3 ) we verify that ( fa(1) = fa(3) = 0 ) . The list is complete because the argument above applies to any quadratic function ( f ) with ( f(1) = 0 ) and ( f(3) = 0 ) . <p> Note that ( fa(x) = a(x-1) ( x-3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we did in the first solution . <p> This argument also applies in the second setting , the only change being the values of the function at 1 and 3. begineqnarray* f(1) &amp;=&amp; a+b+c = 1 , f(3) &amp;=&amp; 9a+3b+c = 7. endeqnarray* As above in the solution to a , these two equations are insufficient to solve for all three variables but will allow us to determine two of the variables in terms of the third .

So the general form for a quadratic polynomial satisfying ( h(1) = 1 ) and ( h(3) = 7 ) is $$ h(x) = ax2 + ( 3-4a ) x + ( 3a-2 ) . $$ <p> Solution : Solution 2 <p> If the graph of ( y = f(x) = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,0 ) ) and ( ( 3,0 ) ) this means that ( f(1) = 0 ) and ( f(3) = 0 ) . One such quadratic polynomial is $$ f(x) = ( x-1 ) ( x-3 ) = x2 - 4x + 3. $$ Since multiplying the polynomial ( f(x) ) by a real number ( k ) will not influence the value of ( f(x) ) at ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) we find that the graph of $$ f(x) = k(x-1) ( x-3 ) = k ( x2 - 4x + 3 ) $$ also passes through ( ( 1,0 ) ) and ( ( 3,0 ) ) . Below are graphs of this parabola for ( k = 1,3 , -1 , ) and ( -3 ) : <p> To see that this list is complete , note that any quadratic ( ax2 + bx + c ) whose graph contains ( ( 1,0 ) ) and ( ( 3,0 ) ) must be divisible by ( ( x-1 ) ) and must be divisible by ( ( x-3 ) ) . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( ( 3,0 ) ) are those of the form $$ f(x) = k(x-1) ( x-3 ) $$ where ( k ) is a real number . The graphs of these parabolas each have a vertex somewhere on the line ( x = 2 ) . The constant ( k ) determines where the vertex is located and this in turn determines whether the parabola opens upward or downward and how flat or steep it is . <p> Here the given points ( ( 1,1 ) ) and ( ( 3,7 ) ) do not give any immediate insight into the choice of a quadratic . The ( x ) -coordinate grows by 2 moving from ( ( 1,1 ) ) to ( ( 3,7 ) ) while the ( y ) -coordinates grow by ( 6 ) . When ( x ) grows from ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) the function ( x2 ) grows by ( 8 ) ( ( 2 ) more than ( 6 ) ) while the function ( x ) grows by ( 2 ) . So if we consider ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ( x ) goes from ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) . Unfortunately the values of ( x2 -x ) at ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are ( 0 ) and ( 6 ) rather than ( 1 ) and ( 7 ) .

Let ( q(x) ) be a quadratic function with ( q(1) = 1 ) and ( q(3) = 7 ) . Notice that $$ ht(0) = tf(0) + ( 1-t ) g(0) = t(1) + ( 1-t ) ( -5 ) = 6t-5 $$ Choosing ( t0 = frac5 + q(0)6 ) we see that $$ ht0(0) = q(0). $$ We also know that ( ht0(1) = q(1) ) and ( ht0(3) = q(3) ) . Hence the quadratic function ( ht0(x) -q(x) ) takes the value 0 at the three real numbers 0,1,3 . This is only possible if $$ ht0(x) - q(x) = 0 $$ and so the collection of quadratic polynomials ( ht(x) ) is a complete list of all quadratics polynomials taking the value 1 when ( x = 1 ) and 7 when ( x = 3 ) . <p> Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x ) -coordinate of the vertex of the parabolas is not the same .

If the teacher prefers to give the measurements of the can in centimeters then students will not need to make a conversion in part ( c ) of this problem but this unit conversion is also good and important work for the students . <p> This task is suitable for instruction or for assessment although students will require access to a calculator .

There are also issues regarding how accurate the different measurements are and how this should be recorded . This is an issue for measuring the circumference and height of the can as well as the mass of the can . These inaccuracies are then perpetuated when the arithmetic is performed to estimate the thickness . In the end , however , the most vital hypothesis influencing the level of accuracy is probably the assumption that the thickness of the can is uniform : this is not true because the lips on the top and the bottom are thicker and the ' ' sides ' ' of the can are actually the thinnest part .

@@119689964 @8689964/ <h> G-MG How thick is a soda can II ? <p> Explain which measurements you will need to take as well as extra information that you may need in order to estimate the thickness of a soda can . You may assume that the can is made of aluminum . Because of the risk of injury , cutting the can and directly measuring its thickness is not permitted . <h> Commentary <p> This is a version of ' ' How thick is a soda can I ' ' which allows students to work independently and think about how they can determine how thick a soda can is . The teacher should explain clearly that the goal of this task is to come up with an ' ' indirect ' ' means of assessing how thick the can is , that is directly measuring its thickness is not allowed . Students should be supplied with cans to assist in this process . After allowing the students to think about this for a while , it would be good to have a discussion about what strategies students have developed and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this problem are surface area , weight , and density so the teacher may wish to discuss these if they are not brought up by the students . <p> If students have access to tape measures and relatively finely calibrated scales , then these can be used and would allow for a discussion about precision in these measurements . As far as the density of aluminum goes , the instructor may wish to give this information to students ( ( 2.70 ) grams per cubic centimeter ) . So the key pieces of information which the students may identify as being needed to estimate the thickness of the can are : <p> the surface area of the can , <p> the weight of the can , <p> the density of the can . <p> Assuming that the thickness of the can is uniform , the students would then use the formula : $$ rm density approx fracrm surface , , , rm area times rm thicknessrm weight $$ to find the approximate thickness . The reason why the ( approx ) is appropriate in this previous formula , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the thickness of the can is uniform and the ' ' edges ' ' of the can will also influence this relationship . Moreover , soda cans are not actually cylindrical as they are slightly tapered both at the top and bottom . <p> A second method for estimating the thickness of the can uses Archimedes ' principle , presented in ' ' Archimedes and the King 's crown , ' ' and this does not require the density . Archimedes ' method calculates the volume of aluminum in the can by submerging it in water in a calibrated beaker and measuring how much water is displaced . This is perhaps more appropriate and feasible in a chemistry class but the ideas can be discussed even if it is not possible to execute the measurements in math class . Most importantly , Archimedes ' method avoids knowing the density of aluminum and also the weight of the can . So using this method , the students would then use the formula $$ rm Volume approx rm surface , , , rm area times rm thickness $$ The ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and volume of the can are both estimates and because the where the top and bottom of the can are joined with the cylindrical shaped piece , closer modeling would be necessary to get an accurate formula . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : 1 Use density of aluminum <p> A picture of the soda can is given here . This can be shared with the students if they do not have access to soda cans or to the appropriate measuring equipment that they will need to estimate its thickness . <p> The only part of an aluminum can which gives us a visual sense for how thick the can might be is the opening from which we drink the soda . Feeling and observing this , it is quite sharp and clearly very thin , certainly too thin to be measured with a normal tape measure . The thickness of the can will , however , be proportional to how much aluminum is in the can and this , in turn , can be captured by weighing the can . In addition to the weight of the can , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , how much does a given amount of aluminum weigh ) and they will need to approximate the surface area of the can . <p> The surface of the can is made up of the top and bottom together with the cylindrical part of the can . In practice , the top and bottom are not flat but are well approximated by circles . According to the given information , the radius of these circles is about ( 1 frac316 ) inches . So the area is about ( pi times left ( 1 frac316right ) 2 ) square inches or about ( 4.4 ) square inches . If the cylindrical part of the can were made flat , it would be a rectangle with dimensions ( 4 frac34 ) inches by ( pi times 2 times 1 frac316 ) inches or about ( 35.4 ) square inches . So the total surface area of the can is about ( 44.2 ) square inches . <p> If there are about ( 15 ) grams of aluminum in the soda can and the density of aluminum is about ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $$ frac15 mbox grams2.70 mbox grams per cubic centimeter approx 5.6 mbox cubic centimeters $$ of aluminum in the soda can . <p> Since the amount of aluminum is given in cubic centimeters and the area of the soda can in square inches we need to make a conversion in order to estimate the approximate thickness of the can . There are about 2.54 centimeters per inch and so there are about ( ( 2.54 ) 2 approx 6.5 ) square centimeters per square inch . So $$ 44.2 mbox square inches approx 44.2 times 6.5 mbox square centimeters. $$ This is about ( 287.3 ) square centimeters . To find the approximate thickness of the can we know that $$ rm thickness times 287.3 mbox cm2 approx 5.6 mbox cm3. $$ This means that the approximate thickness of the can is about ( 0.02 ) centimeters or ( 0.2 ) millimeters . <p> If the teacher wishes to engage students in a discussion of precision of measurements and how results should be recorded , there are three measurements which are subject to error as well as the reported density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gram per cubic centimeter . The measurements of the can , if made with a tape measure marked to the nearest sixteenth of an inch , can be assumed to be accurate to within ( frac132 ) of an inch . This is about ( 2.5 ) percent of the measurement of the radius and seven tenths of one percent of the measurement for the height . Finding the approximate area of the top and bottom of the can requires squaring the radius which will roughly double the error to ( 5 ) percent . We have that ( 5 ) percent of ( 8.8 ) square inches is almost half a square inch . The error for the cylindrical part of the can will depend on the error for the height and the error for the circumference and will be a little more than ( 3 ) percent or a little more than one square inch . So the total possible error here is close to one and a half square inches . An appropriate way to record this would be ( 44 pm frac32 ) square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the thickness of the aluminum can . The can is not perfectly cylindrical and it has a tab to open the can : these will contribute to the error as well but the overall estimate of ( 0.2 ) mm for thickness should be good provided this thickness is uniform . <p> Solution : Solution 2 Use Archimedes ' principle <p> In order to estimate how thick the soda can is , we can estimate the surface area of the can and the volume of the aluminum in the can and then use the fact that the volume of aluminum in the can is approximately equal to the surface area of the can times its thickness . For the surface area , the method of the first solution can be used and we repeat this here . <p> The surface of the can is made up of the top and bottom together with the cylindrical part of the can . In practice , the top and bottom are not flat but are well approximated by circles . According to the given information , the radius of these circles is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about ( pi times left ( 1 frac316right ) 2 ) square inches or about ( 4.4 ) square inches . If the cylindrical part of the can were made flat , it would be a rectangle with dimensions ( 4 frac34 ) inches by ( pi times 2 times 1 frac316 ) inches or about ( 35.4 ) square inches . So the total surface area of the can is about ( 44.2 ) square inches . There are about 2.54 centimeters per inch and so there are about ( ( 2.54 ) 2 approx 6.5 ) square centimeters per square inch . So $$ 44.2 mbox square inches approx 44.2 times 6.5 mbox square centimeters. $$ This is about ( 287.3 ) square centimeters . <p> The volume of the can is not given and so this needs to be assessed by some indirect means . Using a technique dating back to Archimedes , if we submerge the can in water , then the amount of water displaced by the can will be equal to its volume . One way to do this would be to crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that in so doing we do not trap too much air within the can ) . Another method would be to carefully fill the can to the top with water and then the filled can will sink . The amount of water displaced by the aluminum in the can should be close to ( 5.6 ) cubic centimeters as was found in the first solution . Experimental values may differ , however , so suppose we find that the aluminum in the soda can displaces ( x ) cubic centimeters of water . Then using the equation $$ rm Volume approx rm surface , , , rm area times rm thickness $$ we can plug in ( x ) for the volume and ( 287.3 rm cm2 ) for the surface area and we find $$ rm thickness approx fracx287.3 rm , cm2. $$ <p> Notice that this method is quicker than the first and requires less information . On the other hand , it does require some lab equipment .

That line of sight is the tangent line to the curve of the earth . This tangent line touches the circle at a single point and is perpendicular to the radius at that point . <p> Because we do n't know how tall Milong is , we 'll need make a reasonable assumption about her height . Let 's assume her eyes are 5 feet above the surface of the ocean . According to Wikipedia , the radius of the earth is 3,959 miles or 3959 ( times ) 5280 = 20,924,640 feet . <p> Next , we can draw an idealized picture of Milong standing on the surface of the earth with her line of sight terminating at some point on the curve of the earth ( which we assume is a sphere ) .

@@119689967 @8689967/ <p> During the first two weeks of December , we conducted a series of workshops on building and converting K-12 textbooks in ePub 3.0 at the Central Institute of Educational Technology at NCERT in New Delhi , India . This was in continuation of the process assistance we have been providing the government body and world 's largest publisher with the largest known textbook digitization effort in the world . Our goal with this post is to share some elementary understanding of where some of the challenges lay , and more-so , the choices of workshops we made to try to fill some of these gaps . <p> Here 's some more context into our involvement : CIET has been spearheading really innovative initiatives at India 's NCERT , such as NROER . NCERT is the body responsible for the research and publishing of the national curriculum ( here , textbooks ) used in a large number of grades all throughout the country in public and private schools . One of CIET 's major undertakings is a project to convert every single textbook they have written in 4-7 languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over 400 textbooks , each written in multiple languages . Due to the relationship between CIET and NCERT , this is n't a one-time effort ; new non-ePub versions will continue to be released in 3-year cycles and the process will more-or-less be repeated . <p> The advantages of textbooks being in ePub 3.0 go well beyond the immediate utility of being mobile , web and e-reader-ready . The move to such a format is a move to openness and a move to the commons . This brings huge new possibilities with remixing and adaptation . Thus far , our work was limited to recommending the best process to the local team because of our inability to be on-the-ground for extended periods . <p> Now , we often use the phrase " conversion to digital " when we refer to such textbook conversion processes . The use of the word " digital " is interesting ; because are n't these mass produced print-layed textbooks in some digital publishing format to begin with ? In this case , we are working with thousands of PageMaker chapter files and hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print layouts are so fundamentally different from how the fluid web works , the best reusable digital artifacts that can be produced from these files are PDFs . Content in PDFs are very difficult to manipulate , even for the technical folk . PageMaker , or now Adobe InDesign , is accessible to a very minute segment of designers and publishers . And that 's why the need for conversion into something more open and re-usable turns out to be quintessential for remixing . We believe this has big implications on teaching and learning in the decades ahead . <h> Where CIET was at <p> Our first goal was to identify what the local team ( of about 12 people ) were doing to begin with , and then understand where they were struggling the most . It was instantly clear that the existing process was largely manual and assisted by existing ready-made open source tools out there . That said , the amount of work that the team had been able to pull off thus far was beyond impressive . Rigorous targets and the lack of the luxury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a lot done in little time . They made unscalable look like scalable . <p> Budgets apart from team salaries were non-existent ; so custom development to buy automations was not an option . Fortunately , almost every team member had a lightweight IT background , and had written a small amount of Java or PHP code in the past , so there was a small opportunity to automate . Without experienced software engineering talent to guide such efforts , however , this opportunity gets reduced to merely understanding how to debug repeating hairy issues and make minor tweaks using simple scripts . Which can also be extremely time-saving . <h> The Workshops <p> We ran the actual workshops all-day throughout the second week of our time there . These were conceptualized and prepared AFTER the first week of needs analysis , leaving very little time for perfecting them .

How many pennies would need to be in a stack in order to reach the moon ? <h> Commentary <p> This task can be made more hands-on by asking the students to determine about how many pennies are needed to make a stack one inch high . In addition , for part ( b ) students could be invited to research this question . Useful information which would need to be compiled to get total mintage figures can be found at Annual mintage of Lincoln pennies . From 1909 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Total mintage of Lincoln pennies . <p> The goal of this task is to give students a context to investigate large numbers and measurements . Students need to fluently convert units with very large numbers in order to successfully complete this task . The total number of pennies minted either in a single year or for the last century is phenomenally large and difficult to grasp . One way to assess how large this number is would be to consider how far all of these pennies would reach if we were able to stack them one on top of another : this is another phenomenally large number but just how large may well come as a surprise . In particular , before they start working on the problem , the teacher may wish to ask the students whether or not they think it would be possible to reach the moon with this giant stack of pennies . <p> Four solutions are offered to the problem stressing different mathematical ideas : <p> A division approach taking the distance from the earth to the moon and dividing by the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x ) denotes the number of pennies necessary to reach the moon . <p> A ratio approach which could be solved algebraically , linking to solution ( a ) , or through a ratio table . <p> Arithmetic with scientific notation . <p> The first of these solutions uses multiplication as well as division because there is conversion of units involved . Note that the second of these solutions leads naturally to the introduction of a function ( representing the height of a stack of ( x ) pennies ) and so , although it also strongly stresses ratio language , it would need to be adapted in order to be appropriate at the sixth grade level . As written , the answer to part ( c ) meets the 6-RP.3 standard . Students should eventually be comfortable with all three approaches . Note too that throughout the teacher needs to provide some guidance in terms of the level of accuracy with which results should be recorded : because the number of pennies minted is an estimate and the thickness of the pennies is an estimate , no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers ; this is important because it makes each successive calculation easier if numbers are rounded . <p> The number of pennies made in the last 100 years is about 100 times the number of pennies made in 2011 . The vast majority of these pennies , however , have been made in the last 40 years . In 1922 , for example , only a little over 7 million pennies were made while in 1982 the total exceeded a staggering 17 billion . <h> Solutions <p> Solution : 1 Arithmetic ( 6-NS.2 and 6-NS.3 ) <p> Five billion pennies , each ( frac116 ) of an inch thick , will make a stack $$ 5,000,000,000 times frac116 , , textinches $$ high . Dividing ( 5,000,000,000 ) by ( 16 ) gives a little more than ( 30,000,000 ) inches . We need to convert this to miles so we can begin by finding how many feet there are in ( 30,000,000 ) inches . This will be $$ 30,000,000 div 12 =2,500,000. $$ Finally , to find out how many miles there are in ( 2,500,000 ) feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ( 5280 ) feet in each mile : $$ 2,500,000 div 5280 approx 5000. $$ So the stack of pennies would be about ( 5000 ) miles high . <p> A stack of ( 500 ) billion pennies is the same as ( 100 ) stacks of ( 5 ) billion pennies so using the answer from part ( a ) , the stack of ( 500 ) billion pennies would be about ( 100 times 5000 = 500,000 ) miles high . <p> Here we need to perform the division ( 239,000 , , miles div frac116 inches ) . Because the units , miles and inches , are different we need to find out how many inches are in each mile ( or equivalently , convert the ( 239,000 ) miles to inches ) . We have <p> Multiplying this out gives ( 15,143,040,000 ) or about ( 15 ) billion inches . Now we can calculate $$ 15,000,000,000 div frac116 = 240,000,000,000. $$ So it takes about ( 240 ) billion pennies to make a stack high enough to reach the moon . <p> Solution : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 ) pennies to make a stack one inch high , with ( 5,000,000,000 ) pennies we could make a stack $$ frac5,000,000,00016 textinches $$ high . The question asks how many miles this is so we need to convert inches to miles . For this , we use the facts that there are ( 12 ) inches in a foot and ( 5280 ) feet in a mile : <p> Note that the exact value of the quotient above is a little more than ( 4932 ) miles but because ( 5,000,000,000 ) is an estimate for the number the number of pennies minted in ( 2011 ) it is apprpriate to list the height of the stack as about ( 5000 ) miles . <p> A stack of ( 500,000,000,000 ) pennies would reach ( 100 ) times as far as a stack of ( 5,000,000,000 ) pennies . So this would be about ( 100 times 5000 ) miles or about ( 500,000 ) miles . <p> So ( x ) is ( 16 times 239,000 times 5280 times 12 approx 240,000,000,000 ) . So it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a trillion ! ) to reach the moon . <p> Solution : 3 Ratio ( 6-RP.3 , 8-F.1 ) <p> Since the pennies being stacked all have the same thickness , the ratio of the number of pennies in a stack to the height of the stack does not depend on how many pennies are in the stack . In other words if ( a ) denotes the number of pennies in a stack and ( h ) is the function so that ( h(a) ) denotes the height of that stack then the ratios ( ( a:h(a) ) ) are equivalent for any positive number ( a ) of pennies . <p> Here we have ( a = 5,000,000,000 ) . According to the previous paragraph we need to find ( h(5,000,000) ) we need to solve the equation $$ left ( 1 : frac116 textinchright ) = left ( 5,000,000,000 : x , , textmiles right ) . $$ We have $$ left ( 1 : frac116 textinchright ) = left ( 5,000,000,000 : 5,000,000,000 times frac116 , , textinches right ) . $$ So to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frac5,000,000,00016 textinches ) to miles which can be done as in the previous solution : <p> So ( x ) , the height of the stack of ( 5,000,000,000 ) pennies , is about ( 5000 ) miles . <p> If we multiply the number of pennies in a stack by ( 10 ) , the height of the stack is also multiplied by ( 10 ) ( so that the ratio is the same ) . Since ( h(500,000,000,000) = 10h(50,000,000,000) ) and ( h(50,000,000,000) ) is about ( 5000 ) miles , we have that ( h(500,000,000,000) approx 500,000 ) miles . <p> Scientific notation is appropriate for this problem as the number of pennies involved is very large and nicely represented using exponential notation . Either of the above solutions can be adapted for the use of exponential notation and we have chosen here to use the first method . <p> One billion is one with ( 9 ) zeroes or ( 1 times 109 ) . So ( 5 ) billion pennies is ( 5 times 109 ) pennies . Since it takes ( 16 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 5 times 109 ) pennies we could make a stack $$ frac5 times 10916 textinches $$ high . The question asks how many miles this is so we need to convert inches to miles . For this , we use the facts that there are ( 12 ) inches in a foot and ( 5280 ) feet in a mile : <p> In the last step , we use the law of exponents $$ frac109106 = 109-6. $$ <p> A stack of ( 500,000,000,000 ) pennies is ( 5 times 1011 ) pennies or ( 100 ) times as many as the stack of ( 5 times 109 ) considered in part ( a ) . So this stack would reach ( 100 ) times as far as a stack of ( 5 times 109 ) pennies or about $$ 100 times 5 times 103 = 5 times 105 , , textmiles. $$ 
@@119689970 @8689970/ <h> Textures of Music 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To provide an introduction to texture <p> Texture is one of the basic elements of music . When you describe the texture of a piece of music , you are describing how much is going on in the music at any given moment . For example , the texture of the music might be thick or thin , or it may have many or few layers . It might be made up of rhythm only , or of a melody line with chordal accompaniment , or many interweaving melodies . Below you will find some of the formal terms musicians use to describe texture . <h> Terms that Describe Texture <p> There are many informal terms that can describe the texture of a piece of music ( thick , thin , bass-heavy , rhythmically complex , and so on ) , but the formal terms that are used to describe texture all describe the relationships of melodies and harmonies . Here are definitions and examples of the four main types of texture . For specific pieces of music that are good examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Monophonic <p> Monophonic music has only one melodic line , with no harmony or counterpoint . There may be rhythmic accompaniment , but only one line that has specific pitches . Monophonic music can also be called monophony . It is sometimes called monody , although the term " monody " can also refer to a particular type of solo song ( with instrumental accompaniment ) that was very popular in the 1600 's . <p> Examples of Monophony <p> One person whistling a tune <p> A single bugle sounding " Taps " <p> A group of people all singing a song together , without harmonies or instruments <p> A fife and drum corp , with all the fifes playing the same melody <h> Homophonic <p> Homophonic music can also be called homophony . More informally , people who are describing homophonic music may mention chords , accompaniment , harmony or harmonies . Homophony has one clearly melodic line ; it 's the line that naturally draws your attention . All other parts provide accompaniment or fill in the chords . In most well-written homophony , the parts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . They may follow many of the rules of well-written counterpoint , and they can sound quite different from the melody and be interesting to listen to by themselves . But when they are sung or played with the melody , it is clear that they are not independent melodic parts , either because they have the same rhythm as the melody ( i.e. are not independent ) or because their main purpose is to fill in the chords or harmony ( i.e. they are not really melodies ) . <p> Examples of Homophony <p> Choral music in which the parts have mostly the same rhythms at the same time is homophonic . Most traditional Protestant hymns and most " barbershop quartet " music is in this category . <p> A singer accompanied by a guitar picking or strumming chords . <p> A small jazz combo with a bass , a piano , and a drum set providing the " rhythm " background for a trumpet improvising a solo . <p> A single bagpipes or accordion player playing a melody with drones or chords . <h> Polyphonic <p> Polyphonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrapuntal music . If more than one independent melody is occurring at the same time , the music is polyphonic . <p> Examples of Polyphony <p> Rounds , canons , and fugues are all polyphonic . ( Even if there is only one melody , if different people are singing or playing it at different times , the parts sound independent . ) <p> Much Baroque music is contrapuntal , particularly the works of J.S. Bach . <p> Most music for large instrumental groups such as bands or orchestras is contrapuntal at least some of the time . <p> Music that is mostly homophonic can become temporarily polyphonic if an independent countermelody is added . Think of a favorite pop or gospel tune that , near the end , has the soloist " ad libbing " while the back-up singers repeat the refrain . <h> Heterophonic <p> A heterophonic texture is rare in Western music . In heterophony , there is only one melody , but different variations of it are being sung or played at the same time . <p> Heterophony can be heard in the Bluegrass , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen for the tune to be played by two instruments ( say fiddle and banjo ) at the same time , with each adding the embellishments , ornaments , and flourishes that are characteristic of the instrument . <p> Some Middle Eastern , South Asian , central Eurasian , and Native American music traditions include heterophony . Listen for traditional music ( most modern-composed music , even from these cultures , has little or no heterophony ) in which singers and/or instrumentalists perform the same melody at the same time , but give it different embellishments or ornaments . <h> Suggested Listening <p> Monophony <p> Any singer performing alone <p> Any orchestral woodwind or brass instrument ( flute , clarinet , trumpet , trombone , etc. ) performing alone . Here is an example from James Romig 's Sonnet 2 , played by John McMurtery . <p> A Bach unaccompanied cello suite <p> Gregorian chant <p> Most fife and drum music <p> Long sections of " The People that Walked in Darkness " aria in Handel 's " Messiah " are monophonic ( the instruments are playing the same line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " walking in darkness " ! <p> Monophony is very unusual in contemporary popular genres , but can be heard in Queen 's " We Will Rock You .

Why do some notes sound good together while other notes seem to clash with each other ? The answers to all of these questions have to do with the harmonic series . <h> Physics , Harmonics , and Color <p> Most musical notes are sounds that have a particular pitch .

Some other words that musicians use to describe the timbre of a sound are : reedy , brassy , piercing , mellow , hollow , focussed , transparent , breathy ( pronounced BRETH-ee ) or full . Listen to recordings of a violin and a viola . Although these instruments are quite similar , the viola has a noticeably " deeper " and the violin a noticeably " brighter " sound that is not simply a matter of the violin playing higher notes . Now listen to the same phrase played by an electric guitar , an acoustic guitar with twelve steel strings and an acoustic guitar with six nylon strings . The words musicians use to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the statement that , compared with each other , the first sound is mellow , the second bright , and the third rich . <p> Where do the harmonics , and the timbre , come from ? When a string vibrates , the main pitch you hear is from the vibration of the whole string back and forth . That is the fundamental , or first harmonic . But the string also vibrates in halves , in thirds , fourths , and so on . Each of these fractions also produces a harmonic . The string vibrating in halves produces the second harmonic ; vibrating in thirds produces the third harmonic , and so on . <p> NOTE : This method of naming and numbering harmonics is the most straightforward and least confusing , but there are other ways of naming and numbering harmonics , and this can cause confusion . Some musicians do not consider the fundamental to be a harmonic ; it is just the fundamental . In that case , the string halves will give the first harmonic , the string thirds will give the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in calculations , it is called the first partial , and the rest of the harmonics are the second , third , fourth partials and so on . Also , some musicians use the term overtones as a synonym for harmonics . For others , however , an overtone is any frequency ( not necessarily a harmonic ) that can be heard resonating with the fundamental . The sound of a gong or cymbals will include overtones that are n't harmonics ; that 's why the gong 's sound does n't seem to have as definite a pitch as the vibrating string does . If you are uncertain what someone means when they refer to " the second harmonic " or " overtones " , ask for clarification . <p> Figure 2 : The fundamental pitch is produced by the whole string vibrating back and forth . But the string is also vibrating in halves , thirds , quarters , fifths , and so on , producing harmonics . All of these vibrations happen at the same time , producing a rich , complex , interesting sound . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vibrating string , but the column of air can also vibrate in halves , thirds , fourths , and so on , of the fundamental , so the harmonic series will be the same . So why do different instruments have different timbres ? The difference is the relative loudness of all the different harmonics compared to each other . When a clarinet plays a note , perhaps the odd-numbered harmonics are strongest ; when a French horn plays the same note , perhaps the fifth and tenth harmonics are the strongest . This is what you hear that allows you to recognize that it is a clarinet or horn that is playing . The relative strength of the harmonics changes from note to note on the same instrument , too ; this is the difference you hear between the sound of a clarinet playing low notes and the same clarinet playing high notes . <h> The Harmonic Series <p> A harmonic series can have any note as its fundamental , so there are many different harmonic series . But the relationship between the frequencies of a harmonic series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly half the wavelength ( and twice the frequency ) of the fundamental ; the third harmonic always has exactly a third of the wavelength ( and so three times the frequency ) of the fundamental , and so on . <p> Figure 3 : The second harmonic has half the wavelength and twice the frequency of the first . The third harmonic has a third the wavelength and three times the frequency of the first . The fourth harmonic has a quarter the wavelength and four times the frequency of the first , and so on . Notice that the fourth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the second harmonic , and the sixth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the third harmonic . <p> Say someone plays a note , a middle C. Now someone else plays the note that is twice the frequency of the middle C. Since this second note was already a harmonic of the first note , the sound waves of the two notes reinforce each other and sound good together . If the second person played instead the note that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first note , the harmonic series of the two notes would not fit together at all , and the two notes would not sound as good together . There are many combinations of notes that share some harmonics and make a pleasant sound together . They are considered consonant . Other combinations share fewer or no harmonics and are considered dissonant or , when they really clash , simply " out of tune " with each other . The scales and harmonies of most of the world 's musics are based on these physical facts . <p> NOTE : In real music , consonance and dissonance also depend on the standard practices of a musical tradition , especially its harmony and tuning practices , but these are also often related to the harmonic series . <p> For example , a note that is twice the frequency of another note is one octave higher than the first note . So in the figure above , the second harmonic is one octave higher than the first ; the fourth harmonic is one octave higher than the second ; and the sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mathematical way to say this is " if two notes are an octave apart , the ratio of their frequencies is two to one ( 2:1 ) " . Although the notes themselves can be any frequency , the 2:1 ratio is the same for all octaves . Other frequency ratios between two notes also lead to particular pitch relationships between the notes , so we will return to the harmonic series later , after learning to name those pitch relationships , or intervals .

This is meant as an instructional task that gives students some practice working with transformations . Parts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure with 2-fold rotational symmetry , there are many easy ways to decompose it into 2 congruent pieces .

@@119689977 @8689977/ <h> Duration : Note Lengths in Written Music 212250 @qwx1072250 <p> To define and understand the duration of notes <p> To provide examples of the duration of notes and how components of a note illustrate the note lengths <h> The Shape of a Note <p> In standard notation , a single musical sound is written as a note . The two most important things a written piece of music needs to tell you about a note are its pitch - how high or low it is - and its duration - how long it lasts . <p> To find out the pitch of a written note , you look at the clef and the key signature , then see what line or space the note is on . The higher a note sits on the staff , the higher it sounds . To find out the duration of the written note , you look at the tempo and the time signature and then see what the note looks like . <p> Figure 1 : All of the parts of a written note affect how long it lasts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or space the head of the note is on . If the note does not have a head ( see Figure 2 ) , that means that it does not have one definite pitch . <p> Figure 2 : Notes without heads . If a note does not have head , it does not have one definite pitch . Such a note may be a pitchless sound , like a drum beat or a hand clap , or it may be an entire chord rather than a single note . <p> The head of the note may be filled in ( black ) , or not . The note may also have ( or not ) a stem , one or more flags , beams connecting it to other notes , or one or more dots following the head of the note . All of these things affect how much time the note is given in the music . <p> NOTE : A dot that is someplace other than next to the head of the note does not affect the rhythm . Other dots are articulation marks . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time it sounds ) , but do not affect the amount of time it must be given . ( The extra time when the note could be sounding , but is n't , becomes an unwritten rest . ) <h> The Length of a Note <p> Figure 3 <p> The simplest-looking note , with no stems or flags , is a whole note . All other note lengths are defined by how long they last compared to a whole note . A note that lasts half as long as a whole note is a half note . A note that lasts a quarter as long as a whole note is a quarter note . The pattern continues with eighth notes , sixteenth notes , thirty-second notes , sixty-fourth notes , and so on , each type of note being half the length of the previous type . ( There are no such thing as third notes , sixth notes , tenth notes , etc . ) <p> Figure 4 : Note lengths work just like fractions in arithmetic : two half notes or four quarter notes last the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often replaced by beams that connect the notes into easy-to-read groups . <p> You may have noticed that some of the eighth notes in Figure 4 do n't have flags ; instead they have a beam connecting them to another eighth note . If flagged notes are next to each other , their flags can be replaced by beams that connect the notes into easy-to-read groups . The beams may connect notes that are all in the same beat , or , in some vocal music , they may connect notes that are sung on the same text syllable . Each note will have the same number of beams as it would have flags . <p> Figure 5 : The notes connected with beams are easier to read quickly than the flagged notes . Notice that each note has the same number of beams as it would have flags , even if it is connected to a different type of note . The notes are often ( but not always ) connected so that each beamed group gets one beat . This makes the notes easier to read quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like fractions in arithmetic . In fact they work very much like fractions : two half notes will be equal to ( last as long as ) one whole note ; four eighth notes will be the same length as one half note ; and so on . <p> So how long does each of these notes actually last ? That depends on a couple of things . A written note lasts for a certain amount of time measured in beats . To find out exactly how many beats it takes , you must know the time signature . And to find out how long a beat is , you need to know the tempo . <p> Figure 7 : In any particular section of a piece of music , a half note is always twice as long as a quarter note . But how long each note actually lasts depends on the time signature and the tempo . <h> More about Stems <p> Whether a stem points up or down does not affect the note length at all . There are two basic ideas that lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be as easy as possible to read and understand . The other is that the notes should tend to be " in the staff " as much as reasonably possible . <p> Basic Stem Direction Rules <p> Single Notes - Notes below the middle line of the staff should be stem up . Notes on or above the middle line should be stem down . <p> Notes sharing a stem ( block chords ) - Generally , the stem direction will be the direction for the note that is furthest away from the middle line of the staff <p> Notes sharing a beam - Again , generally you will want to use the stem direction of the note farthest from the center of the staff , to keep the beam near the staff . <p> Different rhythms being played at the same time by the same player - Clarity requires that you write one rhythm with stems up and the other stems down . <p> Two parts for different performers written on the same staff - If the parts have the same rhythm , they may be written as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one part ( the " high " part or " first " part ) will point up and the stems for the other part will point down . This rule is especially important when the two parts cross ; otherwise there is no way for the performers to know that the " low " part should be reading the high note at that spot . <p> Figure 8 : Keep stems and beams in or near the staff , but also use stem direction to clarify rhythms and parts when necessary
