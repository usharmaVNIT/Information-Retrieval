They tell of Kino , the fisherman , and of his wife , Juana , and of the baby , Coyotito . And because the story has been told so often , it has taken root in every man 's mind . And , as with all retold tales that are in people 's hearts , there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in- between anywhere . <p> " If this story is a parable , perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it . In any case , they say in the town that ... " <p> Chapter 1 <p> Kino awakened in the near dark . The stars still shone and the day had drawn only a pale wash of light in the lower sky to the east . The roosters had been crowing for some time , and the early pigs were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see whether anything to eat had been overlooked . Outside the brush house in the tuna clump , a covey of little birds chittered and flurried with their wings . <p> Kino 's eyes opened , and he looked first at the lightening square which was the door and then he looked at the hanging box where Coyotito slept . And last he turned his head to Juana , his wife , who lay beside him on the mat , her blue head shawl over her nose and over her breasts and around the small of her back . Juana 's eyes were open too . Kino could never remember seeing them closed when he awakened . Her dark eyes made little reflected stars . She was looking at him as she was always looking at him when he awakened . <p> Kino heard the little splash of morning waves on the beach . It was very good- Kino closed his eyes again to listen to his music . Perhaps he alone did this and perhaps all of his people did it . His people had once been great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did or heard became a song . That was very long ago . The songs remained ; Kino knew them , but no new songs were added . That does not mean that there were no personal songs . In Kino 's head there was a song now , clear and soft , and if he had been able to speak of it , he would have called it the Song of the Family . <p> His blanket was over his nose to protect him from the dank air . His eyes flicked to a rustle beside him . It was Juana arising , almost soundlessly . On her hard bare feet she went to the hanging box where Coyotito slept , and she leaned over and said a little reassuring word . Coyotito looked up for a moment and closed his eyes and slept again . Juana went to the fire pit and uncovered a coal and fanned it alive while she broke little piesh over it . <p> Now Kino got up and wrapped his blanket about his head and nose and shoulders . He slipped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn . <p> Outside the door he squatted down and gathered the blanket ends about his knees . He saw the specks of Gulf clouds flame high in the air . And a goat came near and sniffed at him and stared with its cold yellow eyes . Behind him Juana 's fire leaped into flame and threw spears of light through the chinks of the brush-house wall and threw a wavering square of light out the door . A late moth blustered in to find the fire . The Song of the Family came now from behind Kino . And the rhythm of the family song was the grinding stone where Juana worked the corn for the morning cakes . <p> The dawn came quickly now , a wash , a glow , a lightness , and then an explosion of fire as the sun arose out of the Gulf . Kino looked down to cover his eyes from the glare . He could hear the pat of the corncakes in the house and the rich smell of them on the cooking plate . The ants were busy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little dusty quick ants . Kino watched with the detachment of God while a dusty ant frantically tried to escape the sand trap an ant lion had dug for him . A thin , timid dog came close and , at a soft word from Kino , curled up , arranged its tail neatly over its feet , and laid its chin delicately on the pile . It was a black dog with yellow-gold spots where its eyebrows should have been . It was a morning like other mornings and yet perfect among mornings . <p> Kino heard the creak of the rope when Juana took Coyotito out of his hanging box and cleaned him and hammocked him in her shawl in a loop that placed him close to her breast . Kino could see these things without looking at them . Juana sang softly an ancient song that had only three notes and yet endless variety of interval . And this was part of the family song too . It was all part . Sometimes it rose to an aching chord that caught the throat , saying this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whole . <p> Across the brush fence were other brush houses , and the smoke came from them too , and the sound of breakfast , but those were other songs , their pigs were other pigs , their wives were not Juana . Kino was young and strong and his black hair hung over his brown forehead . His eyes were warm and fierce and bright and his mustache was thin and coarse . He lowered his blanket from his nose now , for the dark poisonous air was gone and the yellow sunlight fell on the house . Near the brush fence two roosters bowed and feinted at each other with squared wings and neck feathers ruffed out . It would be a clumsy fight . They were not game chickens . Kino watched them for a moment , and then his eyes went up to a flight of wild doves twinkling inland to the hills . The world was awake now , and Kino arose and went into his brush house . <p> As he came through the door Juana stood up from the glowing fire pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she combed her black hair and braided it in two braids and tied the ends with thin green ribbon . Kino squatted by the fire pit and rolled a hot corncake and dipped it in sauce and ate it . And he drank a little pulque and that was breakfast . That was the only breakfast he had ever known outside of feast days and one incredible fiesta on cookies that had nearly killed him . When Kino had finished , Juana came back to the fire and ate her breakfast . They had spoken once , but there is not need for speech if it is only a habit anyway . Kino sighed with satisfaction- and that was conversation . <p> The sun was warming the brush house , breaking through its crevices in long streaks . And one of the streaks fell on the hanging box where Coyotito lay , and on the ropes that held it . It was a tiny movement that drew their eyes to the hanging box . Kino and Juana froze in their positions . Down the rope that hung the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His stinging tail was straight out behind him , but he could whip it up in a flash of time . <p> Kino 's breath whistled in his nostrils and he opened his mouth to stop it . And then the startled look was gone from him and the rigidity from his body . In his mind a new song had come , the Song of Evil , the music of the enemy , of any foe of the family , a savage , secret , dangerous melody , and underneath , the Song of the Family cried plaintively . The scorpion moved delicately down the rope toward the box . Under her breath Juana repeated an ancient magic to guard against such evil , and on top of that she muttered a Hail Mary between clenched teeth . But Kino was in motion . His body glided quietly across the room , noiselessly and smoothly . His hands were in front of him , palms down , and his eyes were on the scorpion . Beneath it in the hanging box Coyotito laughed and reached up his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within reach of it . It stopped , and its tail rose up over its back in little jerks and the curved thorn on the tail 's end glistened . <p> Kino stood perfectly still . He could hear Juana whispering the old magic again , and he could hear the evil music of the enemy . He could not move until the scorpion moved , and it felt for the source of the death that was coming to it . Kino 's hand went forward very slowly , very smoothly . The thorned tail jerked upright . And at that moment the laughing Coyotito shook the rope and the scorpion fell . <p> Kino 's hand leaped to catch it , but it fell past his fingers , fell on the baby 's shoulder , landed and struck . Then , snarling , Kino had it , had it in his fingers , rubbing it to a paste in his hands . He threw it down and beat it into the earth floor with his fist , and Coyotito screamed with pain in his box . But Kino beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a moist place in the dirt . His teeth were bared and fury flared in his eyes and the Song of the Enemy roared in his ears . <p> But Juana had the baby in her arms now . She found the puncture with redness starting from it already . She put her lips down over the puncture and sucked hard and spat and sucked again while Coyotito screamed . <p> Kino hovered ; he was helpless , he was in the way . <p> The screams of the baby brought the neighbors . Out of their brush houses they poured- Kino 's brother Juan Tomas and his fat wife Apolonia and their four children crowded in the door and blocked the entrance , while behind them others tried to look in , and one small boy crawled among legs to have a look . And those in front passed the word back to those behind- " Scorpion . The baby has been stung . " <p> Juana stopped sucking the puncture for a moment . The little hole was slightly enlarged and its edges whitened from the sucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard lymphatic mound . And all of these people knew about the scorpion . An adult might be very i 'll from the sting , but a baby could easily die from the poison . First , they knew , would come swelling and fever and tightened throat , and then cramps in the stomach , and then Coyotito might die if enough of the poison had gone in . But the stinging pain of the bite was going away . Coyotito 's screams turned to moans . <p> Kino had wondered often at the iron in his patient , fragile wife . She , who was obedient and respectful and cheerful and patient , she could arch her back in child pain with hardly a cry . She could stand fatigue and hunger almost better than Kino himself . In the canoe she was like a strong man . And now she did a most surprising thing . <p> " The doctor , " she said . " Go to get the doctor . " <p> The word was passed out among the neighbors where they stood close packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they repeated among themselves , " Juana wants the doctor . " A wonderful thing , a memorable thing , to want the doctor . To get him would be a remarkable thing . The doctor never came to the cluster of brush houses . Why should he , when he had more than he could do to take care of the rich people who lived in the stone and plaster houses of the town . <p> " He would not come , " the people in the yard said . <p> " He would not come , " the people in the door said , and the thought got into Kino . <p> " The doctor would not come , " Kino said to Juana . <p> She looked up at him , her eyes as cold as the eyes of a lioness . This was Juana 's first baby- this was nearly everything there was in Juana 's world . And Kino saw her determination and the music of the family sounded in his head with a steely tone . <p> " Then we will go to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged her dark blue shawl over her head and made of one end of it a sling to hold the moaning baby and made of the other end of it a shade over his eyes to protect him from the light . The people in the door pushed against those behind to let her through . Kino followed her . They went out of the gate to the rutted path and the neighbors followed them . <p> The thing had become a neighborhood affair . They made a quick soft- footed procession into the center of the town , first Juana and Kino , and behind them Juan Tomas and Apolonia , her big stomach jiggling with the strenuous pace , then all the neighbors with the children trotting on the flanks . And the yellow sun threw their black shadows ahead of them so that they walked on their own shadows . <p> They came to the place where the brush houses stopped and the city of stone and plaster began , the city of harsh outer walls and inner cool gardens where a little water played and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They heard from the secret gardens the singing of caged birds and heard the splash of cooling water on hot flagstones . The procession crossed the blinding plaza and passed in front of the church . It had grown now , and on the outskirts the hurrying newcomers were being softly informed how the baby had been stung by a scorpion , how the father and mother were taking it to the doctor . <p> And the newcomers , particularly the beggars from the front of the church who were great experts in financial analysis , looked quickly at Juana 's old blue skirt , saw the tears in her shawl , appraised the green ribbon on her braids , read the age of Kino 's blanket and the thousand washings of his clothes , and set them down as poverty people and went along to see what kind of drama might develop . The four beggars in front of the church knew everything in the town . They were students of the expressions of young women as they went in to confession , and they saw them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They knew every little scandal and some very big crimes . They slept at their posts in the shadow of the church so that no one crept in for consolation without their knowledge . And they knew the doctor . They knew his ignorance , his cruelty , his avarice , his appetites , his sins . <p> They knew his clumsy abortions and the little brown pennies he gave sparingly for alms . They had seen his corpses go into the church . And , since early Mass was over and business was slow , they followed the procession , these endless searchers after perfect knowledge of their fellow men , to see what the fat lazy doctor would do about an indigent baby with a scorpion bite . <p> The scurrying procession came at last to the big gate in the wall of the doctor 's house . They could hear the splashing water and the singing of caged birds and the sweep of the long brooms on the flagstones . And they could smell the frying of good bacon from the doctor 's house . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people . This doctor was of a race which for nearly four hundred years had beaten and starved and robbed and despised Kino 's race , and frightened it too , so that the indigene came humbly to the door . And as always when he came near to one of this race , Kino felt weak and afraid and angry at the same time . Rage and terror went together . He could kill the doctor more easily than he could talk to him , for all of the doctor 's race spoke to all of Kino 's race as though they were simple animals . And as Kino raised his right hand to the iron ring knocker in the gate , rage swelled in him , and the pounding music of the enemy beat in his ears , and his lips drew tight against his teeth- but with his left hand he reached to take off his hat . The iron ring pounded against the gate . <p> Kino took off his hat and stood waiting . Coyotito moaned a little in Juana 's arms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better to see and hear . <p> After a moment the big gate opened a few inches . Kino could see the green coolness of the garden and little splashing fountain through the opening . The man who looked out at him was one of his own race . Kino spoke to him in the old language . " The little one- the first born- has been poisoned by the scorpion , " Kino said . " He requires the skill of the healer . " <p> The gate closed a little , and the servant refused to speak in the old language . " A little moment , " he said . " I go to inform myself , " and he closed the gate and slid the bolt home . The glaring sun threw the bunched shadows of the people blackly on the white wall . <p> In his chamber the doctor sat up in his high bed . He had on his dressing gown of red watered silk that had come from Paris , a little tight over the chest now if it was buttoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate pot and a tiny cup of eggshell china , so delicate that it looked silly when he lifted it with his big hand , lifted it with the tips of thumb and forefinger and spread the other three fingers wide to get them out of the way . His eyes rested in puffy little hammocks of flesh and his mouth drooped with discontent . He was growing very stout , and his voice was hoarse with the fat that pressed on his throat . Beside him on a table was a small Oriental gong and a bowl of cigarettes . The furnishings of the room were heavy and dark and gloomy . The pictures were religious , even the large tinted photograph of his dead wife , who , if Masses willed and paid for out of her own estate could do it , was in Heaven . The doctor had once for a short time been a part of the great world and his whole subsequent life was memory and longing for France . " That , " he said , " was civilized living " - by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to keep a mistress and eat in restaurants . He poured his second cup of chocolate and crumbled a sweet biscuit in his fingers . The servant from the gate came to the open door and stood waiting to be noticed . <p> " Yes ? " the doctor asked . <p> " It is a little Indian with a baby . He says a scorpion stung it . " <p> The doctor put his cup down gently before he let his anger rise . " Have I nothing better to do than cure insect bites for ' little Indians ' ? I am a doctor , not a veterinary . " <p> " Yes , Patron , " said the servant . <p> " Has he any money ? " the doctor demanded . " No , they never have any money . I , I alone in the world am supposed to work for nothing- and I am tired of it . See if he has any money ! " <p> At the gate the servant opened the door a trifle and looked out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old language . <p> " Have you money to pay for the treatment ? " <p> Now Kino reached into a secret place somewhere under his blanket . He brought out a paper folded many times . Crease by crease he unfolded it , until at last there came to view eight small misshapen seed pearls , as ugly and gray as little ulcers , flattened and almost valueless . The servant took the paper and closed the gate again , but this time he was not gone long . He opened the gate just wide enough to pass the paper back . <p> " The doctor has gone out , " he said . " He was called to a serious case . " And he shut the gate quickly out of shame . <p> And now a wave of shame went over the whole procession . They melted away . The beggars went back to the church steps , the stragglers moved off , and the neighbors departed so that the public shaming of Kino would not be in their eyes . <p> For a long time Kino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slowly he put his suppliant hat on his head . Then , without warning , he struck the gate a crushing blow with his fist . He looked down in wonder at his split knuckles and at the blood that flowed down between his fingers .

@@89755312 @5255312/ <p> The town lay on a broad estuary , its old yellow plastered buildings hugging the beach . And on the beach the white and blue canoes that came from Nayarit were drawn up , canoes preserved for generations by a hard shell-like waterproof plaster whose making was a secret of the fishing people . They were high and graceful canoes with curving bow and stern and a braced section midships where a mast could be stepped to carry a small lateen sail . <p> The beach was yellow sand , but at the water 's edge a rubble of shell and algae took its place . Fiddler crabs bubbled and sputtered in their holes in the sand , and in the shallows little lobsters popped in and out of their tiny homes in the rubble and sand . The sea bottom was rich with crawling and swimming and growing things . The brown algae waved in the gentle currents and the green eel grass swayed and little sea horses clung to its stems . Spotted botete , the poison fish , lay on the bottom in the eel-grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On the beach the hungry dogs and the hungry pigs of the town searched endlessly for any dead fish or sea bird that might have floated in on a rising tide . <p> Although the morning was young , the hazy mirage was up . The uncertain air that magnified some things and blotted out others hung over the whole Gulf so that all sights were unreal and vision could not be trusted ; so that sea and land had the sharp clarities and the vagueness of a dream . Thus it might be that the people of the Gulf trust things of the spirit and things of the imagination , but they do not trust their eyes to show them distance or clear outline or any optical exactness . Across the estuary from the town one section of mangroves stood clear and telescopically defined , while another mangrove clump was a hazy black-green blob . Part of the far shore disappeared into a shimmer that looked like water . There was no certainty in seeing , no proof that what you saw was there or was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places were that way , and it was not strange to them . A copper haze hung over the water , and the hot morning sun beat on it and made it vibrate blindingly . <p> The brush houses of the fishing people were back from the beach on the right-hand side of the town , and the canoes were drawn up in front of this area . <p> Kino and Juana came slowly down to the beach and to Kino 's canoe , which was the one thing of value he owned in the world . It was very old . Kino 's grandfather had brought it from Nayarit , and he had given it to Kino 's father , and so it had come to Kino . It was at once property and source of food , for a man with a boat can guarantee a woman that she will eat something . It is the bulwark against starvation . And every year Kino refinished his canoe with the hard shell-like plaster by the secret method that had also come to him from his father . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always did . He laid his diving rock and his basket and the two ropes in the sand by the canoe . And he folded his blanket and laid it in the bow . <p> Juana laid Coyotito on the blanket , and she placed her shawl over him so that the hot sun could not shine on him . He was quiet now , but the swelling on his shoulder had continued up his neck and under his ear and his face was puffed and feverish . Juana went to the water and waded in . She gathered some brown seaweed and made a flat damp poultice of it , and this she applied to the baby 's swollen shoulder , which was as good a remedy as any and probably better than the doctor could have done . But the remedy lacked his authority because it was simple and did n't cost anything . The stomach cramps had not come to Coyotito . Perhaps Juana had sucked out the poison in time , but she had not sucked out her worry over her first-born . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prayed that they might find a pearl with which to hire the doctor to cure the baby , for the minds of people are as unsubstantial as the mirage of the Gulf . <p> Now Kino and Juana slid the canoe down the beach to the water , and when the bow floated , Juana climbed in , while Kino pushed the stern in and waded beside it until it floated lightly and trembled on the little breaking waves . Then in coordination Juana and Kino drove their double- bladed paddles into the sea , and the canoe creased the water and hissed with speed . The other pearlers were gone out long since . In a few moments Kino could see them clustered in the haze , riding over the oyster bed . <p> Light filtered down through the water to the bed where the frilly pearl oysters lay fastened to the rubbly bottom , a bottom strewn with shells of broken , opened oysters . This was the bed that had raised the King of Spain to be a great power in Europe in past years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated the churches for his soul 's sake . The gray oysters with ruffles like skirts on the shells , the barnacle- crusted oysters with little bits of weed clinging to the skirts and small crabs climbing over them . An accident could happen to these oysters , a grain of sand could lie in the folds of muscle and irritate the flesh until in self-protection the flesh coated the grain with a layer of smooth cement . But once started , the flesh continued to coat the foreign body until it fell free in some tidal flurry or until the oyster was destroyed . For centuries men had dived down and torn the oysters from the beds and ripped them open , looking for the coated grains of sand . Swarms of fish lived near the bed to live near the oysters thrown back by the searching men and to nibble at the shining inner shells . But the pearls were accidents , and the finding of one was luck , a little pat on the back by God or the gods or both . <p> Kino had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a basket . He stripped off his shirt and trousers and laid his hat in the bottom of the canoe . The water was oily smooth . He took his rock in one hand and his basket in the other , and he slipped feet first over the side and the rock carried him to the bottom . The bubbles rose behind him until the water cleared and he could see . Above , the surface of the water was an undulating mirror of brightness , and he could see the bottoms of the canoes sticking through it . <p> Kino moved cautiously so that the water would not be obscured with mud or sand . He hooked his foot in the loop on his rock and his hands worked quickly , tearing the oysters loose , some singly , others in clusters . He laid them in his basket . In some places the oysters clung to one another so that they came free in lumps . <p> Now , Kino 's people had sung of everything that happened or existed . They had made songs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea in calm , to the light and the dark and the sun and the moon , and the songs were all in Kino and in his people- every song that had ever been made , even the ones forgotten . And as he filled his basket the song was in Kino , and the beat of the song was his pounding heart as it ate the oxygen from his held breath , and the melody of the song was the gray- green water and the little scuttling animals and the clouds of fish that flitted by and were gone . But in the song there was a secret little inner song , hardly perceptible , but always there , sweet and secret and clinging , almost hiding in the counter-melody , and this was the Song of the Pearl That Might Be , for every shell thrown in the basket might contain a pearl . Chance was against it , but luck and the gods might be for it . And in the canoe above him Kino knew that Juana was making the magic of prayer , her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to tear the luck out of the gods ' hands , for she needed the luck for the swollen shoulder of Coyotito . And because the need was great and the desire was great , the little secret melody of the pearl that might be was stronger this morning . Whole phrases of it came clearly and softly into the Song of the Undersea . <p> Kino , in his pride and youth and strength , could remain down over two minutes without strain , so that he worked deliberately , selecting the largest shells . Because they were disturbed , the oyster shells were tightly closed . A little to his right a hummock of rubbly rock stuck up , covered with young oysters not ready to take . Kino moved next to the hummock , and then , beside it , under a little overhang , he saw a very large oyster lying by itself , not covered with its clinging brothers . The shell was partly open , for the overhang protected this ancient oyster , and in the lip-like muscle Kino saw a ghostly gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat out a heavy rhythm and the melody of the maybe pearl shrilled in his ears . Slowly he forced the oyster loose and held it tightly against his breast . He kicked his foot free from the rock loop , and his body rose to the surface and his black hair gleamed in the sunlight . He reached over the side of the canoe and laid the oyster in the bottom . <p> Then Juana steadied the boat while he climbed in . His eyes were shining with excitement , but in decency he pulled up his rock , and then he pulled up his basket of oysters and lifted them in . Juana sensed his excitement , and she pretended to look away . It is not good to want a thing too much . It sometimes drives the luck away . You must want it just enough , and you must be very tactful with God or the gods . But Juana stopped breathing . Very deliberately Kino opened his short strong knife . He looked speculatively at the basket . Perhaps it would be better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the basket , cut the muscle , searched the folds of flesh , and threw it in the water . <p> Then he seemed to see the great oyster for the first time . He squatted in the bottom of the canoe , picked up the shell and examined it . The flutes were shining black to brown , and only a few small barnacles adhered to the shell . Now Kino was reluctant to open it . What he had seen , he knew , might be a reflection , a piece of flat shell accidently drifted in or a complete illusion . In this Gulf of uncertain light there were more illusions than realities . <p> But Juana 's eyes were on him and she could not wait . She put her hand on Coyotito 's covered head . " Open it , " she said softly . <p> Kino deftly slipped his knife into the edge of the shell . Through the knife he could feel the muscle tighten hard . He worked the blade lever- wise and the closing muscle parted and the shell fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsided . Kino lifted the flesh , and there it lay , the great pearl , perfect as the moon . It captured the light and refined it and gave it back in silver incandescence . It was as large as a sea-gull 's egg . It was the greatest pearl in the world . Juana caught her breath and moaned a little . And to Kino the secret melody of the maybe pearl broke clear and beautiful , rich and warm and lovely , glowing and gloating and triumphant . In the surface of the great pearl he could see dream forms . He picked the pearl from the dying flesh and held it in his palm , and he turned it over and saw that its curve was perfect . Juana came near to stare at it in his hand , and it was the hand he had smashed against the doctor 's gate , and the torn flesh of the knuckles was turned grayish white by the sea water . <p> Instinctively Juana went to Coyotito where he lay on his father 's blanket . She lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Kino , " she cried shrilly . <p> He looked past his pearl , and he saw that the swelling was going out of the baby 's shoulder , the poison was receding from its body . Then Kino 's fist closed over the pearl and his emotion broke over him . He put back his head and howled . His eyes rolled up and he screamed and his body was rigid . The men in the other canoes looked up , startled , and then they dug their paddles into the sea and raced toward Kino 's canoe .

@@89755316 @5255316/ <p> The late moon arose before the first rooster crowed . Kino opened his eyes in the darkness , for he sensed movement near him , but he did not move . Only his eyes searched the darkness , and in the pale light of the moon that crept through the holes in the brush house Kino saw Juana arise silently from beside him . He saw her move toward the fireplace . So carefully did she work that he heard only the lightest sound when she moved the fireplace stone . And then like a shadow she glided toward the door . She paused for a moment beside the hanging box where Coyotito lay , then for a second she was black in the doorway , and then she was gone . <p> And rage surged in Kino . He rolled up to his feet and followed her as silently as she had gone , and he could hear her quick footsteps going toward the shore . Quietly he tracked her , and his brain was red with anger . She burst clear out of the brush line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then she heard him coming and she broke into a run . Her arm was up to throw when he leaped at her and caught her arm and wrenched the pearl from her . He struck her in the face with his clenched fist and she fell among the boulders , and he kicked her in the side . In the pale light he could see the little waves break over her , and her skirt floated about and clung to her legs as the water receded . <p> Kino looked down at her and his teeth were bared . He hissed at her like a snake , and Juana stared at him with wide unfrightened eyes , like a sheep before the butcher . She knew there was murder in him , and it was all right ; she had accepted it , and she would not resist or even protest . And then the rage left him and a sick disgust took its place . He turned away from her and walked up the beach and through the brush line . His senses were dulled by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife out and lunged at one dark figure and felt his knife go home , and then he was swept to his knees and swept again to the ground . Greedy fingers went through his clothes , frantic fingers searched him , and the pearl , knocked from his hand , lay winking behind a little stone in the pathway . It glinted in the soft moonlight . <p> Juana dragged herself up from the rocks on the edge of the water . Her face was a dull pain and her side ached . She steadied herself on her knees for a while and her wet skirt clung to her . There was no anger in her for Kino . He had said , " I am a man , " and that meant certain things to Juana . It meant that he was half insane and half god . It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea . Juana , in her woman 's soul , knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet it was this thing that made him a man , half insane and half god , and Juana had need of a man ; she could not live without a man . Although she might be puzzled by these differences between man and woman , she knew them and accepted them and needed them . Of course she would follow him , there was no question of that . Sometimes the quality of woman , the reason , the caution , the sense of preservation , could cut through Kino 's manness and save them all . She climbed painfully to her feet , and she dipped her cupped palms in the little waves and washed her bruised face with the stinging salt water , and then she went creeping up the beach after Kino . <p> A flight of herring clouds had moved over the sky from the south . The pale moon dipped in and out of the strands of clouds so that Juana walked in darkness for a moment and in light the next . Her back was bent with pain and her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the moon was covered , and when it looked through she saw the glimmer of the great pearl in the path behind the rock . She sank to her knees and picked it up , and the moon went into the darkness of the clouds again . Juana remained on her knees while she considered whether to go back to the sea and finish her job , and as she considered , the light came again , and she saw two dark figures lying in the path ahead of her . She leaped forward and saw that one was Kino and the other a stranger with dark shiny fluid leaking from his throat . <p> Kino moved sluggishly , arms and legs stirred like those of a crushed bug , and a thick muttering came from his mouth . Now , in an instant , Juana knew that the old life was gone forever . A dead man in the path and Kino 's knife , dark-bladed beside him , convinced her . All of the time Juana had been trying to rescue something of the old peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , and there was no retrieving it . And knowing this , she abandoned the past instantly . There was nothing to do but to save themselves . <p> Her pain was gone now , her slowness . Quickly she dragged the dead man from the pathway into the shelter of the brush . She went to Kino and sponged his face with her wet skirt . His senses were coming back and he moaned . <p> " They have taken the pearl . I have lost it . Now it is over , " he said . " The pearl is gone . " <p> Juana quieted him as she would quiet a sick child . " Hush , " she said . <p> " Here is your pearl . I found it in the path . Can you hear me now ? Here is your pearl . Can you understand ? You have killed a man . We must go away . They will come for us , can you understand ? We must be gone before the daylight comes . " <p> " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save my life . " <p> " Do you remember yesterday ? " Juana asked . " Do you think that will matter ? Do you remember the men of the city ? Do you think your explanation will help ? " <p> Kino drew a great breath and fought off his weakness . " No , " he said . " You are right . " And his will hardened and he was a man again . <p> " Go to our house and bring Coyotito , " he said , " and bring all the corn we have . I will drag the canoe into the water and we will go . " <p> He took his knife and left her . He stumbled toward the beach and he came to his canoe . And when the light broke through again he saw that a great hole had been knocked in the bottom . And a searing rage came to him and gave him strength . Now the darkness was closing in on his family ; now the evil music filled the night , hung over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his grandfather , plastered over and over , and a splintered hole broken in it . This was an evil beyond thinking . The killing of a man was not so evil as the killing of a boat . For a boat does not have sons , and a boat can not protect itself , and a wounded boat does not heal . There was sorrow in Kino 's rage , but this last thing had tightened him beyond breaking . He was an animal now , for hiding , for attacking , and he lived only to preserve himself and his family . He was not conscious of the pain in his head . He leaped up the beach , through the brush line toward his brush house , and it did not occur to him to take one of the canoes of his neighbors . Never once did the thought enter his head , any more than he could have conceived breaking a boat . <p> The roosters were crowing and the dawn was not far off . Smoke of the first fires seeped out through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cooking corncakes was in the air . Already the dawn birds were scampering in the bushes . The weak moon was losing its light and the clouds thickened and curdled to the southward . The wind blew freshly into the estuary , a nervous , restless wind with the smell of storm on its breath , and there was change and uneasiness in the air . <p> Kino , hurrying toward his house , felt a surge of exhilaration . Now he was not confused , for there was only one thing to do , and Kino 's hand went first to the great pearl in his shirt and then to his knife hanging under his shirt . <p> He saw a little glow ahead of him , and then without interval a tall flame leaped up in the dark with a crackling roar , and a tall edifice of fire lighted the pathway . Kino broke into a run ; it was his brush house , he knew . And he knew that these houses could burn down in a very few moments . And as he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her arms and Kino 's shoulder blanket clutched in her hand . The baby moaned with fright , and Juana 's eyes were wide and terrified . Kino could see the house was gone , and he did not question Juana . He knew , but she said , " It was torn up and the floor dug- even the baby 's box turned out , and as I looked they put the fire to the outside . " <p> The fierce light of the burning house lighted Kino 's face strongly . <p> " Who ? " he demanded . <p> " I do n't know , " she said . " The dark ones . " <p> The neighbors were tumbling from their houses now , and they watched the falling sparks and stamped them out to save their own houses . Suddenly Kino was afraid . The light made him afraid . He remembered the man lying dead in the brush beside the path , and he took Juana by the arm and drew her into the shadow of a house away from the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considered and then he worked among the shadows until he came to the house of Juan Tomas , his brother , and he slipped into the doorway and drew Juana after him . Outside , he could hear the squeal of children and the shouts of the neighbors , for his friends thought he might be inside the burning house . <p> The house of Juan Tomas was almost exactly like Kino 's house ; nearly all the brush houses were alike , and all leaked light and air , so that Juana and Kino , sitting in the corner of the brother 's house , could see the leaping flames through the wall . They saw the flames tall and furious , they saw the roof fall and watched the fire die down as quickly as a twig fire dies . They heard the cries of warning of their friends , and the shrill , keening cry of Apolonia , wife of Juan Tomas . She , being the nearest woman relative , raised a formal lament for the dead of the family . <p> Apolonia realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her house to get her fine new one . As she rummaged in a box by the wall , Kino 's voice said quietly , " Apolonia , do not cry out . We are not hurt . " <p> " How do you come here ? " she demanded . <p> " Do not question , " he said . " Go now to Juan Tomas and bring him here and tell no one else . This is important to us , Apolonia . " <p> She paused , her hands helpless in front of her , and then , " Yes , my brother-in-law , " she said . <p> In a few moments Juan Tomas came back with her . He lighted a candle and came to them where they crouched in a corner and he said , " Apolonia , see to the door , and do not let anyone enter . " He was older , Juan Tomas , and he assumed the authority . " Now , my brother , " he said . " I was attacked in the dark , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed a man . " <p> " Who ? " asked Juan Tomas quickly . <p> " I do not know . It is all darkness- all darkness and shape of darkness . " <p> " It is the pearl , " said Juan Tomas . " There is a devil in this pearl . You should have sold it and passed on the devil . Perhaps you can still sell it and buy peace for yourself . " <p> And Kino said , " Oh , my brother , an insult has been put on me that is deeper than my life . For on the beach my canoe is broken , my house is burned , and in the brush a dead man lies . Every escape is cut off . You must hide us , my brother . " <p> And Kino , looking closely , saw deep worry come into his brother 's eyes and he forestalled him in a possible refusal . " Not for long , " he said quickly . " Only until a day has passed and the new night has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hide you , " said Juan Tomas . <p> " I do not want to bring danger to you , " Kino said . " I know I am like a leprosy . I will go tonight and then you will be safe . " <p> " I will protect you , " said Juan Tomas , and he called , " Apolonia , close up the door . Do not even whisper that Kino is here . " <p> They sat silently all day in the darkness of the house , and they could hear the neighbors speaking of them . Through the walls of the house they could watch their neighbors raking through the ashes to find the bones . Crouching in the house of Juan Tomas , they heard the shock go into their neighbors ' minds at the news of the broken boat . Juan Tomas went out among the neighbors to divert their suspicions , and he gave them theories and ideas of what had happened to Kino and to Juana and to the baby . To one he said , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil that was on them . " And to another , " Kino would never leave the sea . Perhaps he found another boat . " And he said , " Apolonia is i 'll with grief . " <p> And in that day the wind rose up to beat the Gulf and tore the kelps and weeds that lined the shore , and the wind cried through the brush houses and no boat was safe on the water . Then Juan Tomas told among the neighbors , " Kino is gone . If he went to the sea , he is drowned by now . " And after each trip among the neighbors Juan Tomas came back with something borrowed . He brought a little woven straw bag of red beans and a gourd full of rice . He borrowed a cup of dried peppers and a block of salt , and he brought in a long working knife , eighteen inches long and heavy , as a small ax , a tool and a weapon . And when Kino saw this knife his eyes lighted up , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The wind screamed over the Gulf and turned the water white , and the mangroves plunged like frightened cattle , and a fine sandy dust arose from the land and hung in a stifling cloud over the sea . The wind drove off the clouds and skimmed the sky clean and drifted the sand of the country like snow . <p> Then Juan Tomas , when the evening approached , talked long with his brother . " Where will you go ? " <p> " To the north , " said Kino . " I have heard that there are cities in the north . " <p> " Avoid the shore , " said Juan Tomas . " They are making a party to search the shore . The men in the city will look for you . Do you still have the pearl ? " <p> " I have it , " said Kino . " And I will keep it . I might have given it as a gift , but now it is my misfortune and my life and I will keep it . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimpered and Juana muttered little magics over him to make him silent . <p> " The wind is good , " said Juan Tomas . " There will be no tracks . " <p> They left quietly in the dark before the moon had risen . The family stood formally in the house of Juan Tomas . Juana carried Coyotito on her back , covered and held in by her head shawl , and the baby slept , cheek turned sideways against her shoulder . The head shawl covered the baby , and one end of it came across Juana 's nose to protect her from the evil night air . Juan Tomas embraced his brother with the double embrace and kissed him on both cheeks . " Go with God , " he said , and it was like a death . " You will not give up the pearl ? " <p> " This pearl has become my soul , " said Kino . " If I give it up I shall lose my soul . Go thou also with God . "

In case there was ever any doubt , she 's definitlely aspiring to be a girly-girl , and will walk around the house with a purse on her arm , trying to steal her moms makeup. - She has a particular fondness for jewelery , watches , and cell-phones. - She also says hello , bye-bye , baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nose , clock , tick-tock , Grandad , and meow ( which she pronounces miamee ) . <p> Facebook : - A few weeks ago , I found one of my old friends from elementary school in Belgium on facebook that led to another and another , until we 've almost got enough for a 5th grade class reunion. - I 've reconnected with some great childhood friends , and had to brush up on my long dormant French in the process. - Thank God for Google translator and Babel Fish to pick up the slack . <p> Brewing : - While my brothers were in town last week , we brewed our first batch of " Locke Bros Beer " all together theyve been brewing for almost a year , and- started earlier this fall. - This was my fourth batch total , and it looks to be a Strong Belgian-style Golden Ale. - We have n't named it yet , though. - - I 'm almost out of the Christmas Beer I brewed in December , called IncarnationAle. - It got plenty of good reviews , though , except for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bottle along with the beer ! - Thanks to Philip Lotspeich , Drew Ludwig , and Loren Crow , who each ( independently ) suggested the same name . <p> Search for a Church : - As an inquirer on the " ordination track " I 'm under care of my home church and presbytery , which means that well remain members of Faithbridge Presbyterian Church in Frisco , Tx during my entire time at seminary. - Still , we 've been looking for a place to worship on Sunday mornings , and it has n't  been easy. - Most of the Presbyterian churches we 've visited in this part of the country are very " high church " traditional , and almost identical in architecture , aesthetics , liturgy and demographics. - Plus , they all seemed to have everything all worked out. - Coming from a new church development , we werent used to that. - Some did n't  seem too welcoming , and some did n't  have much in the way of nursery/Sunday school for Abby and Grady. - But I think we finally found a place we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NJ. - Its about a 45 minute drive north of us , and the one service starts at 9:30am , but the church is very warm , friendly , multicultural , and there are a LOT of four year-old boys for Grady to play with. - The pastors name also happens to be Neal Neal Presa , and I 've had a chance to get to know him a little via facebook , lunch , and a few other conversations that 's important to me. - More importantly , we felt like MPC is a place we can help and contribute , and a place that isnt afraid to be creative and even a little " wheels off " as my pastor/mentor/friend , Philip Lotspeich , likes to say . <p> New Years Resolution : - In short , I do n't  have one yet. - Last years was the first I ever kept throughout the whole year , and it was an enjoyable experience I think I 'll keep observing last years resolution ( to only buy clothes at second-hand stores like Goodwill or Salvation Army ) , just not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with something new. - Something that , while making a difference in my life , also helps to make a small difference in the larger world. - I 'm giving myself until the end of January to come up with something , so any realistic ( taking me into account ) suggestions are welcome . <p> Admittedly , calling people assholes is not the best way to start a conversation , but for better or worse , I did have a lot of conversations last week : With PhD students , with fellow MDiv students , with former students , faculty members , staff members , bloggers , anonymous emailers and letter writers , and also with the Dean of Students . <p> Many brought up the fact that , while there was some truth to what I said , it was the manner in which it was said that generated most of the controversy . This sentiment is not lost or wasted on me . Blogging is a balancing act . It is confessional : striving to capture the authentic emotions of the moment ( even frustrated angry ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting enough for people to actually read it . But unlike a diary or a newspaper , it is also conversational : striving to draw people into the conversation in a way that shows respect for all . Obviously , I 'm still working on that last part . <p> I can also acknowledge that the post in question was a rather truncated viewpoint on what is certainly a complicated issuecommunities and relationships are always about more than gimmicky labels , limited experiences , and painting with broad strokes . Certainly , moving beyond those things is a step in the right direction . So I wanted to offer this additional insight in light of my experiences resulting from last weeks blog post . <p> I wrote a blog post about PhD Students at Princeton Theological Seminary . I said some pretty disparaging things about PhD Students at Princeton Theological Seminary . I got a lot of different responses , but here are the ones that stand out most in my mind : <p> A PhD student who sat next to me on the shuttle this week , and listened patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful insight from the other side . <p> Another PhD student , who made it a point to let me know he had been praying for me . <p> Another PhD student , who picked me up and took me on an errand run while coaching and preparing me for all possible angles &amp; outcomes in my meeting with the dean . <p> And finally a PhD student who sent an email to the dean saying " If he goes down , I want to go down with him . " <p> If those are the kind of things PhD students at Princeton Theological Seminary will do to go out of their way for a first-year MDiv student , then the only word that comes to my mind is " Grace . " <p> For what its worth , that word applies to my meeting with the dean as well . I spent all Friday morning reading the student handbook , noting ( to my dismay ) all the ways in which I might legitimately be chastised , penalized , or censored . My undergraduate years , and my all-too-frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations that ended in penance for me . Instead , the dean explained the tense emotions of the community in light of another recent incident ( that I had known about , but not considered when writing my post ) , explained that the Seminary had no interest in micro-managing or censoring student blogs , but asked me very nicely if I might consider toning things down as they work toward reconciliation among the community. - I am entirely willing to get on board and work toward that goal . <p> Are there still assholes at Princeton Theological Seminary ? To be sure , and some days I 'm one of them . But perhaps where assholes abound , grace abounds even more . This asshole , for one , is grateful for that . <p> This has all the makings of one of those posts that I 'll regret later on , but nevertheless <p> Ive been an M.Div student at Princeton Seminary for five months now , and while that 's hardly enough time to make a definitive study of the people and culture here , some impressions are certainly forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stark , mostly unspoken , dichotomy between masters level students and PhD students. - I 'll make the early disclaimer that by no means have I met all the PhD students at the seminary. - But I think by now Ive met enough of them to see a pattern : They all seem to fall into one of three broad categories : <p> Assholes You do n't  even have to ask them if they 're PhD students. - You know. - And even if you did ask , its doubtful they would deign to respond. - When they do speak to you , its either because they are correcting you , or because they 're being paid to speak to you as Preceptors ( Teaching Assistants ) . - They know just about everything there is to know , unless in the presence of an actual professor , in which case they suddenly become the most delightful , congenial people in the room. - The idea that an MDiv student might know anything worthwhile is preposterous nevermind that as a " second career " student , I 'm actually older than many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both church and academic settings. - They are condescending both in and out of class . Fortunately , the genuine assholes are not nearly as numerous as the next category <p> Wannabe Assholes These are PhD students who , perhaps through insecurity , indecision , or apathy ( I 'm not sure which , possibly all of the above ) do n't  fit into categories 1 or 3. - Maybe they 're trying to be more humane assholes . They are the ones who will strike up a friendly conversation with you as long as no one else is around , but then ignore you when in the presence of others . They may not correct you in person , but from a distance , you can overhear their opinions of MDiv students easily enough . They do n't  *tell* you that your **28;0;TOOLONG is insignificant , but they still think it ( and usually do a poor job of disguising their thoughts ) . - In my limited experience , this is the largest category of PhD students at Princeton Seminary . <p> Human Beings Although I can count this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the few PhD students who make my experience here interesting and worthwhile. - They treat other students as peers , genuinely listen to and consider their thoughts , and go out of their way to make new MDiv students feel welcome and part of community life. - One in particular actually reached out to me and my family several months before we arrived on campus , and has continued to offer thoughtful and kind guidance in both academic and community matters. - They do not flaunt their intelligence at the expense of others , and are just as accessible in and out of the classroom. - They are a credit to their institution , and I only wish they were the rule , not the exception . <p> I have had all of the above as both acquaintances and Preceptors. - If you 're reading this as a PhD student at Princeton Seminary , and you happen to ask me which category you fall in , I 'll probably tell you " category 3. " - But there 's a 33% chance I 'm lying to save face for both of us. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could n't really be in category 1 , because you would n't waste time reading the blog of a mere MDiv student ( unless for the purpose of admonishing me about this blog post , or correcting my flawed and ingorant perspective ) . Instead of asking me , I 'd suggest asking yourself how you *really* percieve the students you teach and interact with in community , and if your actions reflect your perceptions . <p> I 'm resisting the temptation to draw conclusions about Doctoral work as a whole , but it does seem to me that perhaps the " PhD " as the pinnacle of academic achievement in our culture is likely to reflect its shortcomings the cutthroat competition , the jockeying for position and influence , the arrogance ( I know a few things about arrogance ) and narrow-minded suspicion required to stake out a small patch of intellectual territory and rabidly defend it against all intruders ( read " my precioussss " ) these are all characteristics conducive to climbing the ivory tower , but they are not conducive to genuine education , learning , or sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so at a seminary . <p> Anyhow , I 've got three years to change my mind on all of this , and I suspect that the PhD students in closest proximity will be the most influential in whatever final conclusions I come to. - Prove me wrong , Princeton. - Prove me wrong . 218027 @qwx838027 <p> Ive been having serious website issues in the past two weeks , and I noticed my feed subscriptions via feedburner dropped by about 30%. - While I could be cynical and attribute it to my last post about John McCain , I suspect it actually has more to do with what looks like a broken rss feed . <p> So if you subscribe to this in a feedreader , or if you get it via email could you do me a really huge favor and drop me a quick **27;30;TOOLONG to let me know that the feed is still coming through ?

But I 've always been a little uncomfortable with charging an hourly rate for a project that is n't clearly defined , or worried that I 'm charging too much ( or too little ) money for the type of services I 'm providing , or the types of people I 'm providing them to .

A flat rate for some very specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Im especially hoping to help small organizations or individuals who currently have little or no web presence , and I 'm pretty good at working patiently with people who are not too technically inclined . <p> Of course , that probably does n't  apply to most people reading this blog but you can still help me by passing on the word to anyone you know who might be looking for some inexpensive , simple and straightforward web work . More information can be found on the $300 Websites tab at the top of my blog . Thanks in advance for anyone you send my way ! 218027 @qwx838027 <p> This post was inspired by Pastor Ellen ( one of my last remaining Methodist Pastors ) who emailed me the following question as she prepares for a class : <p> Did Jesus know who he was and what he was going to do on earth ? At what point did he know if he did ? How does that connect w/fully man and fully God ? <p> Its a question that were dealing with right now in my Systematic Theology class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church History Class . And once again , I 'm on the verge of throwing up my arms and yelling , " WHO CARES ? " <p> Ok , its not that I do n't  really care . I think maybe I just do n't  care quite as much as most of Christendom throughout history . <p> I think were a little over-obsessed with the whole " Who was Jesus " question . Maybe we miss the boat sometimes when we spend all our time , energy , intellect , councils , and creeds trying to figure out the nature of Jesus humanity and divinity , and to what extent , and in what way , and when , and . <p> Jesus did n't  really tell us that we had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out who he was. - In- fact , of all his many teachings and acts , Jesus only brought up the question once. - But he did spend a LOT of time telling us other things we should do , like " feed my sheep " and " love one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples certainly did n't  acknowledge him as divine , or messiah , or much of anything else when they first chose to follow him unlike today , where we expect people to confess him as divine savior as a precursor to following him. - I imagine that Jesus disciples followed him because he seemed somehow interesting or compelling to them or maybe because they had heard about how awesome he was from others. - Some probably even followed him for the wrong reasons entirely . <p> I wonder if you really have to understand who Jesus is to recognize the value in what he told us to do , and then to just do it. - And then , long into your journey , if you decide , like Peter , that Jesus is the Son of God , good for you. - If , on the other hand , you stick with Jesus own preferred designation of himself ( Son of Man ) great ! - Jesus did n't  criticize or disown the other disciples who did n't  ( or couldnt ) answer the question. - But please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creeds , theological tomes , or debates while we could actually be doing the work Jesus asked us to dowhoever he was/is . <p> Ive been a loyal fan since I was in high school when I played the song Always With Me , Always With You so many times I wore out and broke my cassette tape ( I realize Im dating myself here ) Surfing With the Alien album . <p> I have to admit , though , some of your albums ( the new CD versions I bought as soon as CDs became popular ) had been gathering a little dust on the shelf . But when I heard the new Coldplay song Viva La Vida , and heard people saying Coldplay stole it from you , I dutifully took out Is There Love in Space , dusted it off , and listened to If I Could Fly again . I do admit , they have a lot of similarities . But mostly , I was just glad for an excuse to listen to you againI even got on the web to see what you 're up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity around your song and Coldplays is a good thing . <p> But then I read that you were suing them . And that 's where you lost me , " Saint " Joe ( suing your neighbor is equally as unsaintly as stealing from him ) . Because I 'm not sure what suing another music group will ever accomplish , except for making you look bad . Heres what I mean : <p> When Coldplay first landed on my radar , I heard their song Clocks on the radio and immediately thought it sounded almost exactly like a song I wrote and recorded years ago with my high school garage band , right down to the repeating triplet piano part ( which in our version was voiced by background vocals ) . Now , in my case , its obvious that there 's no way Coldplay could have possibly copied the song from us , as we only made a handful of demo tapes of the recording for our family and friends . But it does show how two separate musicians can come up with remarkably similar chord progressions and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction was " Yeah , they must have good musical sense , cause I did that , too ! " <p> So unless you think they deliberately sat down and said " Hey , how can we turn this Joe Satriani song into our own song " ( which I think is highly unlikely , given the originality of most of what they do ) I 'm left asking myself why on earth you would want to sue them ? Is it for the publicity ? Because you 'd have that even without suing them . Is it the money ? Because the best way to make money as a musician should always be by writing and performing great stuff , not worrying about what " other " people are doing , and certainly not worrying about songs you wrote five years ago . Or worse are you one of those musicians who thinks you have sole , eternal ownership of a certain way some notes are arranged on a piece of paper ? I hope not , because if those sorts of musicians are successful ( and I count Lars Ulrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of creativity and growth in the music industry , not a new beginning . <p> I really , really hope you 'll consider backing down from your lawsuit , and recognizing Coldplays song for what it is : a good song that owes a debt not to you , but to whatever inspirational muse you 're both in debt to . And I hope you realize that before you lose too many fans in a new generation that overwhelmingly and unstoppably has radically new views on copyright and music ownership. - If you want to be around and relevant in the future , take a page from Radioheads playbook not Metallicas . <p> Despite all this , I 'll still probably go see you in concert if you 're ever in the New Jersey area . But now I 'll probably be a lot more hesitant to take my son a burgeoning 4-year-old musician in his own right with me . Ill still listen to your albums , but I 'm not sure how much money I 'll want to spend on them , when you seem to want to collect money in a different way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about who I think is the greatest guitar player of all timeI do n't  know what I 'll tell him . Because to me , greatness is about more than just technical skill . Great musicians are the ones who , in addition to precision and creativity , acknowledge at the end of the day that we do n't  own the music . Its the music that owns us . <p> When I left teaching behind several years ago , I made a commitment to myself not to leave Shakespeare behind as well. - Shortly afterward , I successfully auditioned for and then played the role of Friar Laurence in a Frisco Community Theater production of Romeo and Juliet. - So when I arrived here in Princeton , and was told that the seminary was undertaking a student production of Shakespeares The Tempest , how could I resist ? - I auditioned for the role of Caliban , and found out yesterday that I got the part . <p> From the start , I was interested most in the character of Caliban because he is one of Shakespeares most complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster " he evokes ( if played well ) a full range of emotions from the audience/reader : - laughter , disgust , sympathy , and even wonder. - He has been treated by various productions as villain , clown , and even tragic hero the noble savage who is the victim of colonialism and slavery. - And like the timeless characters of Mordred and Judas , he betrays his master and teacher . <p> Personally , I think of him along the same lines of J.R.R. Tolkiens character of Gollum. - In fact , I ca n't help but wonder if Tolkien drew upon Caliban for inspiration. - The Tempest is one of only two Shakespearean plays ( the other being A Midsummernights Dream ) that are considered " fantasy , " and as such might have been a great interest to Tolkien , the " father " of modern fantasy literature. - - When one reads ( or watches the film versions of ) Lord of the Rings , one does n't  quite know whether to love , hate , fear , pity , or laugh at Gollum ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In any case , its certainly a fascinating role , and a challenging one to play well. - Rehearsals start next week , and performances will be April 2-4 @8:00 in Scheide Hall here on Campus , and then a matinee performance Sunday , April 5th at 3:00. - Hope to see you there , my precioussssesss <p> Last month , during Jan Term , I had an interesting conversation at a lunch-gathering with my Pseudo-Dionysius professor , Dr. Paul Rorem and a few other students . We started off talking about the inauguration , and I mentioned that I would be watching and " twittering " it along with 50 or so of my closest twitter friends . This comment shifted the conversation instantly to the subject of twitter , and my twittering " habit . " What follows is more of an approximation of our conversation than a transcription : <p> ROREM : So do you also twitter during sermons at church ? ME : Yes , and sometimes during interesting class lectures , too.ROREM : But do n't  you find that to be a distraction from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some times , but I also think of it as an enhancement . Its broadcasting the sermon/lecture/speech to a wider audience , and bringing more voices back into the discussion.ROREM : So when you 're in the middle of a really interesting novel , do you stop to twitter that ? Does n't  it break the flow of the story ? ME : I do sometimes twitter when reading a novel . And I also use my cell phone to look up words or concepts I 'm unfamiliar with . In that case , my focus has already been broken by my own ignorance , and looking something up instantaneously actually restores my focus . <p> I did n't  have a good response to the part about twittering while reading a novel , but in the days since that conversation , and especially today , I think I have one now ironically drawing from a medieval tradition I 've studied in at least two of Dr. Rorems classes over the course of the past semester : Scholia . <p> Scholia are basically marginal notes in an ancient manuscript . They were often corrections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sometimes they also served as commentary on the content of the manuscript itself expounding , elaborating , or even disputing a section of the manuscript . The scholia themselves were then copied along with the text by successive copyists , and sometimes played an important role in the acceptance or understanding of the original . For historical purposes , they also provide insight into how a text was received in a particular era or by a particular person . <p> Now , I write notes all the time in the margins of the books that I read for seminary AND for enjoyment including novels . Steinbecks Grapes of Wrath is perhaps the most marked up book I own . But those notes are primarily intended for me . Even if they were intended for others , I 'd have to pass the book around to one person at a time . And if I want to know what someone else thinks about that particular book , the best I can hope for is an essay or a book review not a play-by-play commentary on every page . Granted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the footnotes ( aka commentary ) seem to represent one perspective , usually scholarly , and almost always Christian . I think that in many ways , the enriching , broadening , yet detail-oriented aspects of the practice of Scholia have been undervalued in the modern age . <p> Enter Twitter . If you do n't  already know about twitter , watch this . If you 're already on Twitter follow me ! While twitter was intended as a way for people to answer the basic question " what are you doing " it has ( in my opinion ) evolved considerably . The first time I realized this was during last summers Presbyterian General Assembly . I couldnt be there in person , but I watched the live video feed of the event , excited about Bruce Reyes-Chow standing for moderator of the PCUSA . I was also logged into twitter , as were most of my Presbyterian twitter-friends some who were at the event , and others like me from afar . Not only were we witnessing denominational history , we were commenting on it . Not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments in response to certain specific sections of speeches and events . What 's more , we were sharing those comments with one another , and even commenting on comments . We were writing in the margins of an historical event ! <p> Later , we all did the same with the U.S. Presidential debates , and just recently , with the inauguration . And of course , it was n't just Presbyterians commenting in the margins of Barack Obamas historic inauguration it was millions of twitterers across the world kings , scholars , and peasants alike . Assuming that these " tweets " are somehow preserved in the ether ( which I think is about as likely as the preservation of velum and papyrus over centuries ) consider what an immense wealth of historical information and perspective they provide . Among the marginal comments can be found explanation , reaction , criticism , defense , and elaboration of just about every line of text , as well as comments pertaining to the visual , audio , and other perceptible aspects of the event from those who witnessed it in person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today in my Systematic Theology class , my professor said something interesting , and I immediately pulled out my cell phone to twitter about it . I remembered Dr. Rorems question about being distracted from what would be said next . But I also saw several of my classmates taking notes on the lecture , and wondered if their note-taking distracted them from what would be said next . Perhaps . But unlike their paper notes ( or even laptop-word processor notes ) that will most likely be shelved after the final exam , or serve to benefit at most one person I am filled with the hope that like the scholia of old , my comments in the margins of todays lecture/novel/text/event will be shared in both community and in perpetuity . That seems worth a slight distraction . <p> I could n't resist the opportunity to blog about todays historic inauguration of Barack Obama . If I did n't  , I might regret it later . Of course , with that said , all inaugurations are historic , just for different reasons . Anyhow , here are some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week I was having lunch with my church history professor , Dr. Paul Rorem , and some students from my Pseud0-Dionysius class . We were talking about our different plans for watching the inauguration , and so I mentioned that I would most likely be both watching and " tweeting " it with 30 or 40 of my closest twitter friends ( which I did ) . It was an interesting conversation , and I 'll blog more about it later this week , but for today , suffice it to say that the inauguration confirmed a theory Ive been working on about Twitter as Scholia basically a running commentary on important events in our culture and society , not unlike the notes that medieval monks and theologians wrote in the margins of scriptures and other important texts . <p> Grady and Presidential " Powers " : - Walking my four-year-old son to school this morning , I brought up the subject of the inauguration , since during the election he had announced his- support for Arack Obama ( despite my own preferences ) . - - He still likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a grasp on what exactly a president is. - So I thought I would help clarify with a little analogy : <p> DADDY : - Do you remember the character Ajihad , in the book were reading ( Christopher Paolinis Eragon ) ? GRADY : Yes , Daddy. - He s the leader of the Varden.DADDY : - Ok , that 's kind of like a President. - Barack Obama is our countrys new leader , like Ajihad was for the Varden.GRADY : Oh . - thinks about it some- So what does Barack Obama fight with , then ? <p> And that 's how you can tell you 've been reading too many fantasy novels to your son ( if that 's possible ) . - Still , I should have told him the President fights with a magic spell book called " The Constitution , " and with a sword called " The Executive Order . " I hear it can slice a Congressman in half with a single stroke . Oh , and let 's not forget the shield of " Presidential Privilege " and the helmet of " Plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Reagan and Bush seemed to have wielded them often enough <p> Obamas Speech : - There was much to like in Obamas inauguration speech , but I did n't  think he " hit it out of the park . " - Perhaps because everyone was comparing him to JFK and MLK , I was expecting more. - Kennedys inauguration speech and MLKs " I Have a Dream " speech still send shivers up my spine. - Obamas speech was good , and he delivered it well , but it wo n't go down in history as one of the great speeches of all time. - His speech during the campaign about race , on the other hand , actually might . <p> here 's the part of todays speech I liked best : <p> To the people of poor nations , we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow ; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds . And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty , we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to effect . For the world has changed , and we must change with it . <p> I hope he can keep that pledge , and that congress will help him do it. - I also like that he called on all those who " enjoy relative plenty " to join in the effort. - I think we could do no better than to start with our neighbor to the immediate south , Mexico. - I noticed that he did n't  say anything about immigration reform , but that 's not too surprising Bush saw the border as a " homeland security " issue , but Obamas speech overall gives me hope hell see it through the more compassionate lens of " love for neighbor . " <p> here 's my least favorite part of the speech : <p> We will not apologize for our way of life , nor will we waver in its defense , and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents , we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and can not be broken ; you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sometimes I do think we should apologize for our American way of life especially when it involves invading innocent countries because we " suspect " them of terrorism , or polluting the environment to assuage our rampant consumerism. - And let 's not forget that we , too , are guilty of slaughtering millions of innocents . I would have been more comfortable if he had said " we will defeat you with our ideals , our integrity , and commitment to justice . " - But he didnt. - He just ended that paragraph there , letting Conservative hawks assume he meant , " If you mess with America , well still kick your ass . " - And who knows ? Maybe that 's exactly what he meant. - Considering what I read my son , I 'm probably not one to judge . <p> The overall tone of the speech , continuing themes from his campaign , was one of reconciliation and hope. - And I certainly think he s an improvement over our last president. - Obamas election and inauguration are long deserved triumphs for African-Americans and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day , I must remind myself ( and everyone else ) that he s not a savior , not a messiah. - Just a man , confined within the limits of a two-party system , an enormous bureaucracy , and a plethora of special interest groups. - I hope he can navigate all of these things well , and I do n't  mind being pleasantly surprised . So congratulations to the USA , and to you , President Obama. - I will earnestly place my hope in you , but ( I hope you 'll understand ) not my faith. - In fact , I think wed be a little better off if all of us placed a little more hope in our country , and a little less faith . <p> God Bless America ? I found it fascinating that Rick Warren led the nation in the inaugural prayer , and that Bishop TD Jakes preached the private inaugural sermon this morning. - Sadly , the ministerial voice most absent was the one I find myself most often in agreement with : - Jeremiah Wright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these two more conservative pastors is not a preview of changing beliefs or politics. - I understand the political expediency that required Obama to distance himself from Wright , but I hope the reconciliation in the air extends to Obamas long-time pastor , too. - Jeremiah Wright got fried over a brief clip from a sermon that was taken entirely out of context. - But I think my closing sentiments echo his true message a bit better : - May God Bless America : - South AmericaCentral America MexicoCanada And may the United Sates of America stop worrying so much about getting blessed , and start worrying about how we can bless those around us . Despite Wrights absence , I sensed his influence in parts of Obamas speech. - And so , I too , have hope today . 218027 @qwx838027 218026 @qwx838026 218024 @qwx838024 218028 @qwx838028

When one is bitten on the chest there is not much that can be done . <p> Mama Torres had three children , two undersized black ones of twelve and fourteen , Emilio and Rosy , whom Mama kept fishing on the rocks below the farm when the sea was kind and when the truant officer was in some distant part of Monterey County . And there was PepT , the tall smiling son of nineteen , a gentle , affectionate boy , but very lazy . PepT had a tall head , pointed at the top , and from its peak coarse black hair grew down like a thatch all around . Over his smiling little eyes Mama cut a straight bang so he could see . PepT had sharp Indian cheekbones and an eagle nose , but his mouth was as sweet and shapely as a girl 's mouth , and his chin was fragile and chiseled . He was loose and gangling , all legs and feet and wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine and brave , but she never told him so . She said , " Some lazy cow must have got into thy father 's family , else how could I have a son like thee . " And she said , " When I carried thee , a sneaking lazy coyote came out of the brush and looked at me one day . That must have made thee so . " <p> PepT smiled sheepishly and stabbed at the ground with his knife to keep the blade sharp and free from rust . It was his inheritance , that knife , his father 's knife . The long heavy blade folded back into the black handle . There was a button on the handle . When PepT pressed the button , the blade leaped out ready for use . The knife was with PepT always , for it had been his father 's knife . <p> One sunny morning when the sea below the cliff was glinting and blue and the white surf creamed on the reef , when even the stone mountains looked kindly , Mama Torres called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a labor for thee . " <p> There was no answer . Mama listened . From behind the barn she heard a burst of laughter . She lifted her full long skirt and walked in the direction of the noise . <p> PepT was sitting on the ground with his back against a box . His white teeth glistened . Oneither side of him stood the two black ones , tense and expectant . Fifteen feet away a redwood post was set in the ground . PepT 's right hand lay limply in his lap , and in the palm the big black knife rested . The blade was closed back into the handle . PepT looked smiling at the sky . <p> Suddenly Emilio cried , " Ya ! " <p> PepT 's wrist flicked like the head of a snake . The blade seemed to fly open in midair , and with a thump the point dug into the redwood post , and the black handle quivered . The three burst into excited laughter . Rosy ran to the post and pulled out the knife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settled the knife carefully in his listless palm again . He grinned self-consciously at the sky . <p> " Ya ! " <p> The heavy knife lanced out and sunk into the post again . Mama moved forward like a ship and scattered the play . <p> " All day you do foolish things with the knife , like a toy baby , " she stormed . " Get up on thy huge feet that eat up shoes . Get up ! " She took him by one loose shoulder and hoisted at him . PepT grinned sheepishly and came halfheartedly to his feet . " Look ! " Mama cried . " Big lazy , you must catch the horse and put on him thy father 's saddle . You must ride to Monterey . The medicine bottle is empty . There is no salt . Go thou now , Peanut ! Catch the horse . " <p> A revolution took place in the relaxed figure of PepT . " To Monterey , me ? Alone ? Sf , Mama . " <p> She scowled at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will buy candy . No , I will give you only enough for the medicine and the salt . " <p> PepT smiled . " Mama , you will put the hatband on the hat ? " <p> She relented then . " Yes , PepT . You may wear the hatband . " <p> His voice grew insinuating . " And the green handkerchief , Mama ? " <p> " Yes , if you go quickly and return with no trouble , the silk green handkerchief will go . If you make sure to take off the handkerchief when you eat so no spot may fall on it . " <p> " Si , Mama . I will be careful . I am a man . " <p> " Thou ? A man ? Thou art a peanut . " <p> He went to the rickety barn and brought out a rope , and he walked agilely enough up the hill to catch the horse . <p> When he was ready and mounted before the door , mounted on his father 's saddle that was so old that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Mama brought out the round black hat with the tooled leather band , and she reached up and knotted the green silk handkerchief about his neck . PepT 's blue denim coat was much darker than his jeans , for it had been washed much less often . <p> Mama handed up the big medicine bottle and the silver coins . " That for the medicine , " she said , " and that for the salt . That for a candle to burn for the papa . That for dulces for the little ones . Our friend Mrs. Rodriguez will give you dinner and maybe a bed for the night . When you go to the church , say only ten paternosters and only twenty-five Ave Marias . Oh ! I know , big coyote . You would sit there flapping your mouth over Aves all day while you looked at the candles and the holy pictures . That is not good devotion to stare at the pretty things . " <p> The black hat , covering the high pointed head and black thatched hair of PepT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse well . Mama thought how handsome he was , dark and lean and tall . " I would not send thee now alone , thou little one , except for the medicine , " she said softly . " It is not good to have no medicine , for who knows when the toothache will come , or the sadness of the stomach . These things are . " <p> " Adios , Mama , " PepT cried . " I will come back soon . You may send me often alone . I am a man . " <p> " Thou art a foolish chicken . " <p> He straightened his shoulders , flipped the reins against the horse 's shoulder , and rode away . He turned once and saw that they still watched him . Emilio and Rosy and Mama . PepT grinned with pride and gladness and lifted the tough buckskin horse to a trot . <p> When he had dropped out of sight over a little dip in the road , Mama turned to the black ones , but she spoke to herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It will be a nice thing to have a man in the house again . " Her eyes sharpened on the children . " Go to the rocks now . The tide is going out . There will be abalones5 to be found . " She put the iron hooks into their hands and saw them down the steep trail to the reefs . She brought the smooth stone metate6 to the doorway and sat grinding her corn to flour and looking occasionally at the road over which PepT had gone . The noonday came and then the afternoon , when the little ones beat the abalones on a rock to make them tender and Mama patted the tortillas to make them thin . They ate dinner as the red sun was plunging down toward the ocean . They sat on the doorsteps and watched a big white moon come over the mountaintops . <p> Mama said , " He is now at the house of our friend Mrs. Rodriguez . She will give him nice things to eat and maybe a present . " <p> Emilio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Monterey for medicine . Did PepT come to be a man today ? " <p> Mama said wisely , " A boy gets to be a man when a man is needed . Remember this thing . I have known boys forty years old because there was no need for a man : " <p> Soon afterward they retired , Mama in her big oak bed on one side of the room , Emilio and Rosy in their boxes full of straw and sheepskins on the other side of the room . <p> The moon went over the sky and the surf roared on the rocks . The roosters crowed the first call . The surf subsided to a whispering surge against the reef . The moon dropped toward the sea . The roosters crowed again . <p> The moon was near down to the water when PepT rode on a winded horse to his home flat . His dog bounced out and circled the horse , yelping-with pleasure . PepT slid off the saddle to the ground . The weathered little shack was silver in the moonlight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and east . Against the east the piling mountains were misty with light ; their tops melted into the sky . <p> PepT walked wearily up the three steps and into the house . It was dark inside . There was a rustle in the comer . <p> Mama cried out from her bed . " Who comes ? PepT , is it thou ? " <p> " Sf , Mama : " <p> " Did you get the medicine ? " <p> " Sf , Mama " <p> " Well , go to sleep , then . I thought you would be sleeping at the house of Mrs. Rodriguez . " PepT stood silently in the dark room . " Why do you stand there , PepT ? Did you drink wine ? " <p> " Sf , Mama " <p> " Well , go to bed then and sleep out the wine . " <p> His voice was tired and patient , but very firm . " ' Light the candle , Mama . I must go away into the mountains . " <p> " ' What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck a sulfur match and held the little blue burr until the flame spread up the stick . She set light to the candle on the floor beside her bed . " Now , PepT , what is this you say ? " She looked anxiously into his face . <p> He was changed . The fragile quality seemed to have gone from his chin . His mouth was less full than it had been , the lines of the lip were straighter , but in his eyes the greatest change had taken place . There was no laughter in them anymore , nor any bashfulness . They were sharp and bright and purposeful . <p> He told her in a tired monotone , told her everything just as it had happened . A few people came into the kitchen of Mrs. Rodriguez . There was wine to drink . PepT drank wine . The little quarrelthe man started toward PepT and then the knifeit went almost by itself . It flew , it darted before PepT knew it . As he talked , Mama 's face grew stern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a man now , Mama . The man said names to me I could not allow . " <p> Mama nodded . " Yes , thou art a man , my poor little PepT . Thou art a man . I have seen it coming on thee . I have watched you throwing the knife into the post , and I have been afraid . " For a moment her face had softened , but now it grew stern again . " Come ! We must get you ready . Go . Awaken Emilio andRosy . Go quickly . " <p> PepT stepped over to the corner where his brother and sister slept among the sheepskins . He leaned down and shook them gently . " Come , Rosy ! Come , Emilio ! The Mama says you must arise . " <p> The little black ones sat up and rubbed their eyes in the candlelight . Mama was out of bed now , her long black skirt over her nightgown . " Emilio , " she cried . " Go up and catch the other horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emilio put his legs in his overalls and stumbled sleepily out the door . <p> " You heard no one behind you on the road ? " Mama demanded . <p> " No , Mama . I listened carefully . No one was on the road . " <p> Mama darted like a bird about the room . From a nail on the wall she took a canvas bag and threw it on the floor . She stripped a blanket from her bed and rolled it into a tight tube and tied the ends with string . From a box beside the stove she lifted a flour sack half full of black string jerky . " Your father 's black coat , PepT . Here , put it on . " <p> PepT stood in the middle of the floor watching her activity . She reached behind the door and brought out the rifle , a long 38-56 , worn shiny the whole length of the barrel . PepT took it from her and held it in the crook of his elbow . Mama brought a little leather bag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , " she warned . " You must not waste them . " <p> " Put on the saddle from the other horse . Tie on the blanket . Here , tie the jerky to the saddle horn . " <p> Still PepT stood silently watching his mother 's frantic activity . His chin looked hard , and his sweet mouth was drawn and thin . His little eyes followed Mama about the room almost suspiciously . <p> Rosy asked softly , " Where goes PepT ? " <p> Mama 's eyes were fierce . " PepT goes on a journey . PepT is a man now . He has a man 's thing to do . " <p> PepT straightened his shoulders . His mouth changed until he looked very much like Mama . <p> At last the preparation was finished . The loaded horse stood outside the door . The water bag dripped a line of moisture down the bay shoulder . <p> The moonlight was being thinned by the dawn , and the big white moon was near down to the sea . The family stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my son ! Do not stop until it is dark again . Do not sleep even though you are tired . Take care of the horse in order that he may not stop of weariness . Remember to be careful with the bullets-there are only ten . Do not fill thy stomach with jerky or it will make thee sick . Eat a little jerky and fill thy stomach with grass . When thou comest to the high mountains , if thou seest any of the dark watching men , go not near to them nor try to speak to them . And forget not thy prayers . " She put her lean hands on PepT 's shoulders , stood on her toes and kissed him formally on both cheeks , and PepT kissed her on both cheeks . Then he went to Emilio and Rosy and kissed both of their cheeks . <p> PepT turned back to Mama . He seemed to look for a little softness , a little weakness in her . His eyes were searching , but Mama 's face remained fierce . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be caught like a chicken . " <p> PepT pulled himself into the saddle . " I am a man , " he said . <p> It was the first dawn when he rode up the hill toward the little canyon which let a trail into the mountains . Moonlight and daylight fought with each other , and the two warring qualities made it difficult to see . Before PepT had gone a hundred yards , the outlines of his figure were misty ; and long before he entered the canyon , he had become a gray , indefinite shadow . <p> Mama stood stiffly in front of her doorstep , and on either side of her stood Emilio and Rosy . They cast furtive glances at Mama now and then . <p> When the gray shape of PepT melted into the hillside and disappeared , Mama relaxed . She began the high , whining keen of the death wail . " Our beautiful--our brave , " she cried . " Our protector , our son is gone . " Emilio and Rosy moaned beside her . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formal wail . It rose to a high piercing whine and subsided to a moan . Mama raised it three times and then she turned and went into the house and shut the door . <p> Emilio and Rosy stood wondering in the dawn . They heard Mama whimpering in the house . They went out to sit on the cliff above the ocean . They touched shoulders . " When did PepT come to be a man ? " Emilio asked <p> " Last night , " said Rosy . " Last night in Monterey . " The ocean clouds turned red with the sun that was behind the mountains . <p> " We will have no breakfast , " said Emilio . " Mama will not want to cook . " Rosy did not answer him . " Where is PepT gone ? " he asked . <p> Rosy looked around at him . She drew her knowledge from the quiet air . " He has gone on a journey . He will never come back . " <p> " Is he dead ? Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean again . A little steamer , drawing a line of smoke , sat on the edge of the horizon . " He is not dead , " Rosy explained . " Not yet . " <p> PepT rested the big rifle across the saddle in front of him . He let the horse walk up the hill and he did n't look back . The stony slope took on a coat of short brush so that PepT found the entrance to a trail and entered it . <p> When he came to the canyon opening , he swung once in his saddle and looked back , but the houses were swallowed in the misty light . PepT jerked forward again . The high shoulder of the canyon closed in on him . His horse stretched out its neck and sighed and settled to the trail . <p> It was a well-worn path , dark soft leaf-mold earth strewn with broken pieces of sandstone . The trail rounded the shoulder of the canyon and dropped steeply into the bed of the stream . In the shallows the water ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round stones on the bottom were as brown as rust with sun moss . In the sand along the edges of the stream the tall , rich wild mint grew , while in the water itself the cress , old and tough , had gone to heavy seed . <p> The path went into the stream and emerged on the other side . The horse sloshed into the water and stopped . PepT dropped his bridle and let the beast drink of the running water . <p> Soon the canyon sides became steep and the first giant sentinel redwoods guarded the trail , great round red trunks bearing foliage as green and lacy as ferns . Once PepT was among the trees , the sun was lost . A perfumed and purple light lay in the pale green of the underbrush . Gooseberry bushes and blackberries and tall ferns lined the stream , and overhead the branches of the redwoods met and cut off the sky . <p> PepT drank from the water bag , and he reached into the flour sack and brought out a black string of jerky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough meat parted . He chewed slowly and drank occasionally from the water bag . His little eyes were slumberous and tired , but the muscles of his face were hard-set . The earth of the trail was black now . It gave up a hollow sound under the walking hoofbeats . <p> The stream fell more sharply . Little waterfalls splashed on the stones . Five-fingered ferns hung over the water and dropped spray from their fingertips . PepT rode half over his saddle , dangling one leg loosely . He picked a bay leaf from a tree beside the way and put it into his mouth for a moment to flavor the dry jerky . He held the gun loosely across the pommel . <p> Suddenly he squared in his saddle , swung the horse from the trail and kicked it hurriedly up behind a big redwood tree . He pulled up the reins tight against the bit to keep the horse from whinnying . His face was intent and his nostrils quivered a little . <p> A hollow pounding came down the trail , and a horseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white stubble beard . His horse put down his head and blubbered at the trail when it came to the place where PepT had turned off . " Hold up ! " said the man , and he pulled up his horse 's head . <p> When the last sound of the hoofs died away , PepT came back into the trail again . He did not relax in the saddle any more . He lifted the big rifle and swung the lever to throw a shell into the chamber , and then he let down the hammer to half cock . <p> The trail grew very steep . Now the redwood trees were smaller and their tops were dead , bitten dead where the wind reached them . The horse plodded on ; the sun went slowly overhead and started down toward the afternoon . <p> Where the stream came out of a side canyon , the trail left it . PepT dismounted and watered his horse and filled up his water bag . As soon as the trail had parted from the stream , the trees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaparral edged the trail . And the soft black earth was gone , too , leaving only the light tan broken rock for the trail bed . Lizards scampered away into the brush as the horse rattled over the little stones . <p> PepT turned in his saddle and looked back . He was in the open now : he could be seen from a distance . As he ascended the trail the country grew more rough and terrible and dry . The way wound about the bases of great square rocks . Little gray rabbits skittered in the brush . A bird made a monotonous high creaking . Eastward the bare rock mountaintops were pale and powder-dry under the dropping sun . The horse plodded up and up the trail toward the little v in the ridge which was the pass . <p> PepT looked suspiciously back every minute or so , and his eyes sought the tops of the ridges ahead . Once , on a white barren spur , he saw a black figure for a moment ; but he looked quickly away , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who the watchers were , nor where they lived , but it was better to ignore them and never to show interest in them . They did not bother one who stayed on the trail and minded his own business . <p> The air was parched and full of light dust blown by the breeze from the eroding mountains . PepT drank sparingly from his bag and corked it tightly and hung it on the horn again . The trail moved up the dry shale hillside , avoiding rocks , dropping under clefts , climbing in and out of old water scars . When he arrived at the little pass he stopped and looked back for a long time . No dark watchers were to be seen now . The trail behind was empty . Only the high tops of the redwoods indicated where the stream flowed . <p> PepT rode on through the pass . His little eyes were nearly closed with weariness , but his face was stern , relentless , and manly . The high mountain wind coasted sighing through the pass and whistled on the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , a red-tailed hawk sailed over close to the ridge and screamed angrily . PepT went slowly through the broken jagged pass and looked down on the other side . <p> The trail dropped quickly , staggering among broken rock . At the bottom of the slope there was a dark crease , thick with brush , and on the other side of the crease a little flat , in which a grove of oak trees grew . A scar of green grass cut across the flat . And behind the flat another mountain rose , desolate with dead rocks and starving little black bushes . PepT drank from the bag again , for the air was so dry that it encrusted his nostrils and burned his lips . He put the horse down the trail . The hoofs slipped and struggled on the steep way , starting little stones that rolled off into the brush . The sun was gone behind the westward mountain now , but still it glowed brilliantly on the oaks and on the grassy flat . The rocks and the hillsides still sent up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sun . <p> PepT looked up to the top of the next dry withered ridge . He saw a dark form against the sky , a man 's figure standing on top of a rock , and he glanced away quickly not to appear curious . When a moment later he looked up again , the figure was gone . <p> Downward the trail was quickly covered . Sometimes the horse floundered for footing , sometimes set his feet and slid a little way . They came at last to the bottom where the dark chaparral was higher than PepT 's head . He held up his rifle on one side and his arm on the other to shield his face from the sharp brittle fingers of the brush . <p> Up and out of the crease he rode , and up a little cliff . The grassy flat was before him , and the round comfortable oaks . For a moment he studied the trail down which he had come , but there was no movement and no sound from it . Finally he rode out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper end of the damp he found a little spring welling out of the earth and dropping into a dug basin before it seeped out over the flat . <p> PepT filled his bag first , and then he let the thirsty horse drink out of the pool . He led the horse to the clump of oaks , and in the middle of the grove , fairly protected from sight on all sides , he took off the saddle and the bridle and laid them on the ground . The horse stretched his jaws sideways and yawned . PepT knotted the lead rope about the horse 's neck and tied him to a sapling among the oaks , where he could graze in a fairly large circle . <p> When the horse was gnawing hungrily at the dry grass , PepT went to the saddle and took a black string of jerky from the sack and strolled to an oak tree on the edge of the grove , from under which he could watch the trail . He sat down in the crisp dry oak leaves and automatically felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had no knife . He leaned back on his elbow and gnawed at the tough strong meat . His face was blank , but it was a man 's face . <p> The bright evening light washed the eastern ridge , but the valley was darkening . Doves flew down from the hills to the spring , and the quail came running out of the brush and joined them , calling clearly to one another . <p> Out of the corner of his eye PepT saw a shadow grow out of the bushy crease . He turned his head slowly . A big spotted wildcat was creeping toward the spring , belly to the ground , moving like thought . <p> PepT cocked his rifle and edged the muzzle slowly around . Then he looked apprehensively up the trail and dropped the hammer again . From the ground beside him he picked an oak twig and threw it toward the spring . The quail flew up with a roar and the doves whistled away.The big cat stood up ; for a long moment he looked at PepT with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gulch . <p> The dusk gathered quickly in the deep valley . PepT muttered his prayers , put his head down on his arm and went instantly to sleep . <p> The moon came up and filled the valley with cold blue light , and the wind swept rustling down from the peaks . The owls worked up and down the slopes looking for rabbits . Down in the brush of the gulch a coyote gabbled . The oak trees whispered softly in the night breeze . <p> PepT started up , listening . His horse had whinnied . The moon was just slipping behind the western ridge , leaving the valley in darkness behind it . PepT sat tensely gripping his rifle . From far up the trail he heard an answering whinny and the crash of shod hoofs on the broken rock . He jumped to his feet , ran to his horse and led it under the trees . He threw on the saddle and cinched it tight for the steep trail , caught the unwilling head and forced the bit into the mouth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sack of jerky were there . Then he mounted and turned up the hill . <p> It was velvet-dark . The horse found the entrance to the trail where it left the flat , and started up , stumbling and slipping on the rocks . PepT 's hand rose up to his head . His hat was gone . He had left it under the oak tree . <p> The horse had struggled far up the trail when the first change of dawn came into the air , a steel grayness as light mixed thoroughly with dark . Gradually the sharp snaggled edge of the ridge stood out above them , rotten granite tortured and eaten by the winds of time . PepT had dropped his reins on the horn , leaving direction to the horse . The brush grabbed at his legs in the dark until one knee of his jeans was ripped . <p> Gradually the light flowed down over the ridge . The starved brush and rocks stood out in the half-light , strange and lonely in high perspective . Then there came warmth into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see nothing in the darker valley below . The sky turned blue over the coming sun . In the waste of the mountainside , the poor dry brush grew only three feet high . Here and there , big outcroppings of unrotted granite stood up like moldering houses . PepT relaxed a little . He drank from his water bag and bit off a piece of jerky . A single eagle flew over , high in the light . <p> Without warning PepT 's horse screamed and fell on its side . He was almost down before the rifle crash echoed up from the valley . From a hole behind the struggling shoulder , a stream of bright crimson blood pumped and stopped and pumped and stopped . The hoofs threshed on the ground . PepT lay half stunned beside the horse . He looked slowly down the hill . A piece of sage clipped off beside his head and another crash echoed up from side to side of the canyon . PepT flung himself frantically behind a bush . <p> He crawled up the hill on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle up off the ground and pushed it ahead of him . He moved with the instinctive care of an animal . Rapidly he wormed his way toward one of the big outcroppings of granite on the hill above him . Where the brush was high he doubled up and ran ; but where the cover was slight he wriggled forward on his stomach , pushing the rifle ahead of him . In the last little distance there was no cover at all . PepT poised and then he darted across the space and flashed around the corner of the rock . <p> He leaned panting against the stone . When his breath came easier he moved along behind the big rock until he came to a narrow split that offered a thin section of vision down the hill . PepT lay on his stomach and pushed the rifle barrel through the slit and waited . <p> The sun reddened the western ridges now . Already the buzzards were settling down toward the place where the horse lay . A small brown bird scratched in the dead sage leaves directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew back toward the rising sun . <p> PepT saw a little movement in the brush far below . His grip tightened on the gun . A little brown doe stepped daintily out on the trail and crossed it and disappeared into the brush again . For a long time PepT waited . Far below he could see the little flat and the oak trees and the slash of green . Suddenly his eyes flashed back at the trail again . A quarter of a mile down there had been a quick movement in the chaparral . The rifle swung over . The front sight nestled in the v of the rear sight . PepT studied for a moment and then raised the rear sight a notch . The little movement in the brush came again . The sight settled on it . PepT squeezed the trigger . The explosion crashed down the mountain and up the other side , and came rattling back . The whole side of the slope grew still . No more movement . And then a white streak cut into the granite of the slit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from below . PepT felt a sharp pain in his right hand . A sliver of granite was sticking out from between his first and second knuckles and the point protruded from his palm . Carefully he pulled out the sliver of stone . The wound bled evenly and gently . No vein or artery was cut . <p> PepT looked into a little dusty cave in the rock and gathered a handful of spider web , and he pressed the mass into the cut , plastering the soft web into the blood . The flow stopped almost at once . <p> The rifle was on the ground . PepT picked it , up , levered a new shell into the chamber . And then he slid into the brush on his stomach . Far to the right he crawled , and then up the hill , moving slowly and carefully , crawling to cover and resting and then crawling again . <p> In the mountains the sun is high in its arc before it penetrates the gorges . The hot face looked over the hill and brought instant heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reflected from them and rose up quivering from the earth again , and the rocks and bushes seemed to quiver behind the air . <p> PepT crawled in the general direction of the ridge peak , zigzagging for cover . The deep cut between his knuckles began to throb . He crawled close to a rattlesnake before he saw it , and when it raised its dry head and made a soft beginning whir , he backed up and took another way . The quick gray lizards flashed in front of him , raising a tiny line of dust . He found another mass of spider web and pressed it against his throbbing hand . <p> PepT was pushing the rifle with his left hand now . Little drops of sweat ran to the ends of his coarse black hair and rolled down his cheeks . His lips and tongue were growing thick and heavy . His lips writhed to draw saliva into his mouth . His little dark eyes were uneasy and suspicious . Once when a gray lizard paused in front of him on the parched ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stone . <p> When the sun slid past noon he had not gone a mile . He crawled exhaustedly a last hundred yards to a patch of high sharp manzanita , crawled desperately , and when the patch was reached he wriggled in among the tough gnarly trunks and dropped his head on his left arm . There was little shade in the meager brush , but there was cover and safety . PepT went to sleep as he lay and the sun beat on his back . A few little birds hopped close to him and peered and hopped away . PepT squirmed in his sleep and he raised and dropped his wounded hand again and again . <p> The sun went down behind the peaks and the cool evening came , and then the dark . A coyote yelled from the hillside . PepT started awake and looked about with misty eyes . His hand was swollen and heavy ; a little thread of pain ran up the inside of his arm and settled in a pocket in his armpit . He peered about and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon had not yet risen . PepT stood up in the dark . The coat of his father pressed on his arm . His tongue was swollen until it nearly filled his mouth . He wriggled out of the coat and dropped it in the brush , and then he struggled up the hill , falling over rocks and tearing his way through the brush . The rifle knocked against stones as he went . Little dry avalanches of gravel and shattered stone went whispering down the hill behind him . <p> After a while the old moon came up and showed the jagged ridgetop ahead of him . By moonlight PepT , traveled more easily . He bent forward so that his throbbing arm hung away from his body . The journey uphill was made in dashes and rests , a frantic rush up a few yards and then a rest . The wind coasted down the slope , rattling the dry stems of the bushes . <p> The moon was at meridian when PepT came at last to the sharp backbone of the ridgetop . On the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wearing winds . The way was on solid rock . He clambered to the top and looked down on the other side . There was a draw like the last below him , misty with moonlight , brushed- with dry struggling sage and chaparral . On the other side the hill rose up sharply and at the top the jagged rotten teeth of the mountain showed against the sky . At the bottom of the cut the brush was thick and dark . <p> PepT stumbled down the hill . His throat was almost closed with thirst . At first he tried to run , but immediately he fell and rolled . After that he went more carefully . The moon was just disappearing behind the mountains when he came to the bottom . He crawled into the heavy brush , feeling with his fingers for water . There was no water in the bed of the stream , only damp earth . PepT laid his gun down and scooped up a handful of mud and put it in his mouth , and then he spluttered and scraped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud drew at his mouth like a poultice . He dug a hole in the stream bed with his fingers , dug a little basin to catch water ; but before it was very deep his head fell forward on the damp ground and he slept . <p> The dawn came and the heat of the day fell on the earth , and still PepT slept . Late in the afternoon his head jerked up . He looked slowly around . His eyes were slits of weariness . Twenty feet away in the heavy brush a big tawny mountain lion stood looking at him . Its long thick tall waved gracefully ; its ears were erect with interest , not laid back dangerously . The lion squatted down on its stomach and watched him . <p> PepT looked at the hole he had dug in the earth . A half-inch of muddy water had collected in the bottom . He tore the sleeve from his hurt arm , with his teeth ripped out a little square , soaked it in the water and put it in his mouth . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Still the lion sat and watched him . The evening came down but there was no movement on the hills . No birds visited the dry bottom of the cut . PepT looked occasionally at the lion . The eyes of the yellow beast drooped as though he were about to sleep . He yawned and his long thin red tongue curled out . Suddenly his head jerked around and his nostrils quivered . His big tail lashed . He stood up and slunk like a tawny shadow into the thick brush . <p> A moment later PepT heard the sound , the faint far crash of horses ' hoofs on gravel . And he heard something else , a high whining yelp of a dog . <p> PepT took his rifle in his left hand and he glided into the brush almost as quietly as the lion had . In the darkening evening he crouched up the hill toward the next ridge . Only when the dark came did he stand up . His energy was short . Once it was dark he fell over the rocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moved on and on up the hill , climbing and scrambling over the broken hillside . <p> When he was far up toward the top , he lay down and slept for a little while . The withered moon , shining on his face , awakened him . He stood up and moved up the hill . Fifty yards away he stopped and turned back , for he had forgotten his rifle . He walked heavily down and poked about in the brush , but he could not find his gun . At last he lay down to rest . The pocket of pain in his armpit had grown more sharp . His arm seemed to swell out and fall with every heartbeat . There was no position lying down where the heavy arm did not press against his armpit . <p> With the effort of a hurt beast , PepT got up and moved again toward the top of the ridge . He held his swollen arm away from his body with his left hand . Up the steep hill he dragged himself , a few steps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he was nearing the top . The moon showed the uneven sharp back of it against the sky . <p> PepT 's brain spun in a big spiral up and away from him . He slumped to the ground and lay still . The rock ridgetop was only a hundred feet above him . <p> The moon moved over the sky . PepT half turned on his back . His tongue tried to make words , but only a thick hissing came from between his lips . <p> When the dawn came , PepT pulled himself up . His eyes were sane again . He drew his great puffed arm in front of him and looked at the angry wound . The black line ran up from his wrist to his armpit . Automatically he reached in his pocket for the big black knife , but it was not there . His eyes searched the ground . He picked up a sharp blade of stone and scraped at the wound , sawed at the proud flesh and then squeezed the green juice out in big drops . Instantly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His whole right side shuddered at the pain , but the pain cleared his head . <p> In the gray light he struggled up the last slope to the ridge and crawled over and lay down behind a line of rocks . Below him lay a deep canyon exactly like the last , waterless and desolate . There was no flat , no oak trees , not even heavy brush in the bottom of it . And on the other side a sharp ridge stood up , thinly brushed with starving sage , littered with broken granite . Strewn over the hill there were giant outcroppings , and on the top the granite teeth stood out against the sky . <p> The new day was light now . The flame of the sun came over the ridge and fell on PepT where he lay on the ground . His coarse black hair was littered with twigs and bits of spider web . His eyes had retreated back into his head . Between his lips the tip of his black tongue showed . <p> He sat up and dragged his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and moaning in his throat . He threw back his head and looked up into the pale sky . A big black bird circled nearly out of sight , and far to the left another was sailing near . <p> He lifted his head to listen , for a familiar sound had come to him from the valley he had climbed out of ; it was the crying yelp of hounds , excited and feverish , on a trail . <p> PepT bowed his head quickly . He tried to speak rapid words but only a thick hiss carne from his lips . He drew a shaky cross on his breast with his left hand . It was a long struggle to get to his feet . He crawled slowly and mechanically to the top of a big rock on the ridge peak . Once there , he arose slowly , swaying to his feet , and stood erect . Far below he could see the dark brush where he had slept . He braced his feet and stood there , black against the morning sky . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stone flew up and a bullet droned off into the next gorge . The hollow crash echoed up from below . PepT looked down for a moment and then pulled himself straight again . <p> His body jarred back . His left hand fluttered helplessly toward his breast . The second crash sounded from below . PepT swung forward arid toppled from the rock . His body struck and rolled over and over , starting a little avalanche . And when at last he stopped against a bush , the avalanche slid slowly down and covered up his head . 
@@89755330 @5255330/ 218026 @qwx838026 <p> This is a blog long overdue . I meant to write it last week , after Howard Dean announced his withdrawal from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination . <p> In years past , I have considered myself to be a " professional-amateur political hack , " if such an oxymoron can exist . Ive been involved in politics for many years . I 've worked on congressional , senatorial , and gubernatorial campaigns . I was the president of Young Democrats in college , and was elected Student Body President my senior year ( to my knowledge the only liberal ever elected at right-wing ORU ) . <p> What I 'm trying to say , is that unlike a lot of Dean supporters who were inspired to get involved in electoral politics for the first time , I 've been through all of this before . What Dean was to many of you , Bill Clinton was to me in 1992 , when I first became eligible to vote . He was young , eloquent , passionate about his beliefs , and came accross as a visionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him that way ( actually , I do anyhowbut that 's another blog ) . Even though he won , I still remember the crushing despair I felt in 1994 ( Newt Gingrichs so-called " Republican Revolution " ) when every single candidate I had poured my blood , sweat , and tears into was defeated . I know how you feel . <p> I liked him too . Like , you I thought ( and think ) he was the best choice to beat Bush . And I think I know why we liked him too . It was n't really the policies , or the internet , or his record , although they were all good . It was because he had CHARISMAthat spark of romantic idealism that inspires people ; stirrs them up . Clinton had it . Kennedy had it . Shooteven though I disagree with everything he ever said , Ronald Reagan had it . And Teddy Roosevelt , if you 're looking for another Repub . John Kerry ? I 'm not sure . At least , I have n't seen it yet . Bush ? Never in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many of you are disillusioned . You 're considering Ralph Nader , or worse yet , just dropping out of presidential politics altogether , like the McGovernites of 72 . <p> But remember , even though you were new to this whole whirlwind of idealism and hopeDean wasnt . Howard Dean was the Governor of Vermont . To rise to a post of that stature means he had to work his way up through the ranks , dealing with self-promoting , self-comprimising politicians . And defeatif not of his candidacies , at least of some of his ideas . But he kept going . He did n't  drop out of politics , and you should n't either . <p> Please , please follow his example . And here 's where its really going to hurt : Follow his example in November too , when Howard Dean , as he has promised , will vote for the Democratic nominee for Presidentwhoever that turns out to be . I do n't  know , but I 'm pretty sure that the reason he has pledged to do this is because he s learned the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics : Leaderseven great onescome and go , but it is the party that lives on . Yes , the Democratic party is often slower to act as a whole than some of its parts , I realize this . But I believe that it has carried the country in the right direction , if slower than some might have wanted . <p> Dean and the first-timers he inspired are like young lovepassionately burningand brief . Believe me , as a high school teacher , I see it every day . But those of us who have been with the Democratic party for a long time have a deep and abiding committment , not unlike a marriage . You have to work at it . Sometimes its not what you dreamed about , but sometimes it will still surprise you , and always it will be worth it in the end . <p> I do n't  know if John Kerry will be the next nominee , or if hell be the next president . Even though he s not my favorite , if he s elected I do n't  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from an affluent background , and was actually pretty moderate and non-committal in his campaign speeches against Nixon . The two of them did n't  disagree on a single major issue . In foreign policy , he was conservative . He only barely won the election . But when he took up the office of president , he filled the shoes many thought he could n't . I believe that at least in part , it was because he belonged to the right party , and ascribed to a platform that was sometimes even more progressive than he . That platform is still out there , and once the dust settles from election promises and positioning , a Democratic president will always be a Democratic president , and that will always be better than a Republican one . Besides , in the next four years , the Supreme Court will be up for grabs , and that will affect the country for years and years to come . <p> I know this has been long , and if you 're still reading , there must be a reason . Dean is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your spark , and they will find another day , another candidate . But while you 're at it , keep your vote with the Democratic party , too . 218027 @qwx838027 <p> I made a post about this article before , and its still not my favorite , but I 'm re-posting it because I want you to read it .

We went through our 2oth Invitational Competition to place 2nd , 3rd , and 4th with our three individual teams . We went determined and motivated to District Competition , and made history by taking first place for the very first time ever in Sunset 's history . We then worked even harder , as we worked through a Winter break , where we not only worked on the 7 subjects , but we added speech , impromptu , and interview . Then regionals came . <p> On January 19 , we gave out our speeches and went through an interview . The next day we went through several hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored by having two individuals medal , in Jonathan Vines , and Leonel Garcia .

We started out in the summer with a group of 40 , of whom which 15 stood up to the challenge and made the district team . After a let down at invitational competition your very own Sunset Academic Decathlon came back with a vengence and made its way into the history books . Sunset , for the very first time ever , won the Academic Decathlon District competition placing first in the Super Quiz Relay and first overall . Our scholastic division did a fantastic job by sweeping it in taking the gold , silver , and bronze medals for overall individual scorer , however . Our honors and varsity divisions did nothing less , they too stepped up and helped bring Sunset to victory . Honorable mention goes to all the district team members for all of their hard work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Jonathan Vines , Anabel Simental , Juan Carlos Gonzalez , Leonel Garcia , Jovani Alejandro , Vanesha Reed , Karina Gonzalez , Lisette Padilla , Martin Rodriguez , Efrain Esparza , Jackie Fernandez , Andrew Lopez , Angelica Beltran , and Gustavo Vargas all competed this Saturday , and congratulations goes to every single one of them for their achievements . <h> Sunday , November 26 , 2006 <h> Review of Social Science , In Video Form <p> Okay , so we are gearing up for District competition , and we are trying to do every little thing that would help with that . Here is a video telling us the history of Communist China . It is out of the normal educational video sure , but hey , if it gives you the knowledge right ? Well here you go , enjoy ! <p> This one is a broad one . Compliments of Leonel <p> For more information about China and more Social Science visit Youtube and you can find more videos on this . <p> I also found the song " Revolution " by The Beatles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd like . <h> Saturday , November 11 , 2006 <h> The Finale <p> Well we had a wonderful year of competitive outbreak among our decathletes this year . A bunch of new faces , and some returning ones were in the mix . We officially started in the Summer , and now we have ended our yearly competition of weekly tests and ranks . We had a very promising year . Returning Decathletes surpassed their total scores from a year ago , and the new ones did very well . In this finale of ranks Noemi Beltran re-emerged as the number one ranked decathlete . This makes two consecutive years in which Noemi was able to achieve this , however props needs to be given to Leonel Garcia for finishing very close . As for the rest of the seniors , they did a great job year long . A recognition does need to be given out to all of those seniors who were in the mix this year , whether they were new or old , thanks seniors . Okay so without further ado , here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 21 , 2006 <h> Dime Week ( Or Week Ten ) <p> We are getting closer and closer to Invitationals competition as we keep on testing . This week we went over SQW and SOC , and we had the pleasure of previewing a couple of speeches as well . We are in our last couple of weeks decathletes , Invitationals is just around the corner , and this is no time for slacking off . Ranks are still changing , and congratulations to Jovani and Noemi for moving up in what seemed to be a settled area of ranks . And here are your ranks . <h> Friday , October 13 , 2006 <h> Nueve and the Milestones <p> Several things happened this week as per previous year scores being surpassed . Among them , Vanesha Reed , Sophia Ramirez , Gisela Gonzalez , and Jesus Velazquez have beaten their total scores from last year , while we are still two tests away from the total number we took last year ( 27 to 29 ) . Vanesha destroyed hers by almost 2,000 points . Also , Noemi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranked one , two , and three respectively ) have all passed their previous year scores . <p> However , there are two even bigger milestones to which I 'm referring . <p> One is the fact that all of the top five ranked Decathletes have beaten the Number One score from last year ( 19,890 ) . Once again , we are still two tests short of last year 's total , so this is a great accomplishment . <p> The other milestone is the 20,000 point mark reached by all of the top three Decathletes this week . Yet again I remind you that we have only taken 27 tests . <p> A special recognition goes to Noemi Beltran who , by way of two gold medals and one silver on this week 's tests has closed the gap between 4th and 5th place from almost 400 points to a mere 20 points ( or the equivalent of one question on an actual Acadec test ) . <h> Saturday , October 07 , 2006 <h> Week The Eight <p> Well it has been eight weeks already . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it is hard not to say so when you have veterans who have already surpassed their total scores from last year with the testing not over yet . Congratulations goes to Anabel , Lucio , Leonel , Agustin O. , Karina , Samuel , Rebecca ( or Becky ) , and myself ( funny I 'm congratulating myself , heh ) , who have all passed their total scores from last year with many more veterans to do the same very soon A special mention , Vanesha is 100 points away from passing her total from last year . Ranks keep on tightening up , the race for the number one spot in particular . Okay , well enough of me telling you how we have been doing and how we are compared to last year , here are the scores . <p> We are getting closer and closer to our first competition decathletes , which is November 11th . Yet another week of hard work approaches us , and it only gets funner , for it 's time for plenty of super quiz . <h> Sunday , October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how we had gotten to 20 tests , but since we 're at 21 , I wrote that instead . We 're taking about 3 tests a week ; in 3 more weeks we will have eclipsed the total number of tests we took last year ( 29 ) in preparation for invitational . It is interesting to note that many of the returning decathletes have already surpassed their total scores after 21 tests from last year ; for instance , I 've surpassed mine by about 2,500 points . And Juan Carlos tells me he is about 500 points away from surpassing his total score from all 29 tests last year , which is a tremendous improvement . He should have that by the end of this week . The point of this is that the core of returning veterans for this year has made a huge leap in test scores , and Sunset is well on its way to doing things that have n't been done before ( including , but not limited to , winning district ) . Anyway , enough of that . Onward with the scores :

@@89755367 @5255367/ <p> It is wonderful the way a little town keeps track of itself and of all its units . If every single man and woman , child and baby , acts and conducts itself in a known pattern and breaks no walls and differs with no one and experiments in no way and is not sick and does not endanger the ease and peace of mind or steady unbroken flow of the town , then that unit can disappear and never be heard of . But let one man step out of the regular thought or the known and trusted pattern , and the nerves of the townspeople ring with nervousness and communication travels over the nerve lines of the town . Then every unit communicates to the whole . Thus , in La Paz , it was known in the early morning through the whole town that Kino was going to sell his pearl that day . It was known among the neighbors in the brush huts , among the pearl fishermen ; it was known among the Chinese grocery-store owners ; it was known in the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it crept in among the nuns ; the beggars in front of the church spoke of it , for they would be there to take the tithe of the first fruits of the luck . The little boys knew about it with excitement , but most of all the pearl buyers knew about it , and when the day had come , in the offices of the pearl buyers , each man sat alone with his little black velvet tray , and each man rolled the pearls about with his fingertips and considered his part in the picture . <p> It was supposed that the pearl buyers were individuals acting alone , bidding against one another for the pearls the fishermen brought in . And once it had been so . But this was a wasteful method , for often , in the excitement of bidding for a fine pearl , too great a price had been paid to the fishermen . This was extravagant and not to be countenanced . Now there was only one pearl buyer with many hands , and the men who sat in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer , how high they would bid , and what method each one would use . And although these men would not profit beyond their salaries , there was excitement among the pearl buyers , for there was excitement in the hunt , and if it be a man 's function to break down a price , then he must take joy and satisfaction in breaking it as far down as possible . For every man in the world functions to the best of his ability , and no one does less than his best , no matter what he may think about it . Quite apart from any reward they might get , from any word of praise , from any promotion , a pearl buyer was a pearl buyer , and the best and happiest pearl buyer was he who bought for the lowest prices . <p> The sun was hot yellow that morning , and it drew the moisture from the estuary and from the Gulf and hung it in shimmering scarves in the air so that the air vibrated and vision was insubstantial . A vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision of a mountain that was over two hundred miles away , and the high slopes of this mountain were swaddled with pines and a great stone peak arose above the timber line . And the morning of this day the canoes lay lined up on the beach ; the fishermen did not go out to dive for pearls , for there would be too much happening , too many things to see , when Kino went to sell the great pearl . <p> In the brush houses by the shore Kino 's neighbors sat long over their breakfasts , and they spoke of what they would do if they had found the pearl . And one man said that he would give it as a present to the Holy Father in Rome . Another said that he would buy Masses for the souls of his family for a thousand years . Another thought he might take the money and distribute it among the poor of La Paz ; and a fourth thought of all the good things one could do with the money from the pearl , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could perform if one had money . All of the neighbors hoped that sudden wealth would not turn Kino 's head , would not make a rich man of him , would not graft onto him the evil limbs of greed and hatred and coldness . For Kino was a well-liked man ; it would be a shame if the pearl destroyed him . " That good wife Juana , " they said , " and the beautiful baby Coyotito , and the others to come . What a pity it would be if the pearl should destroy them all . " <p> For Kino and Juana this was the morning of mornings of their lives , comparable only to the day when the baby had been born . This was to be the day from which all other days would take their arrangement . Thus they would say , " It was two years before we sold the pearl , " or , " It was six weeks after we sold the pearl . " Juana , considering the matter , threw caution to the winds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his baptism , when there would be money for his baptism . And Juana combed and braided her hair and tied the ends with two little bows of red ribbon , and she put on her marriage skirt and waist . The sun was quarter high when they were ready . Kino 's ragged white clothes were clean at least , and this was the last day of his raggedness . For tomorrow , or even this afternoon , he would have new clothes . <p> The neighbors , watching Kino 's door through the crevices in their brush houses , were dressed and ready too . There was no self-consciousness about their joining Kino and Juana to go pearl selling . It was expected , it <p> was an historic moment , they would be crazy if they did n't go . It would <p> be almost a sign of unfriendship . <p> Juana put on her head shawl carefully , and she draped one long end under her right elbow and gathered it with her right hand so that a hammock hung under her arm , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head shawl so that he could see everything and perhaps remember . Kino put on his large straw hat and felt it with his hand to see that it was properly placed , not on the back or side of his head , like a rash , unmarried , irresponsible man , and not flat as an elder would wear it , but tilted a little forward to show aggressiveness and seriousness and vigor . There is a great deal to be seen in the tilt of a hat on a man . Kino slipped his feet into his sandals and pulled the thongs up over his heels . The great pearl was wrapped in an old soft piece of deerskin and placed in a little leather bag , and the leather bag was in a pocket in Kino 's shirt . He folded his blanket carefully and draped it in a narrow strip over his left shoulder , and now they were ready . <p> Kino stepped with dignity out of the house , and Juana followed him , carrying Coyotito . And as they marched up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The houses belched people ; the doorways spewed out children . But because of the seriousness of the occasion , only one man walked with Kino , and that was his brother , Juan Tomas . <p> Juan Tomas cautioned his brother . " You must be careful to see they do not cheat you , " he said . <p> And , " Very careful , " Kino agreed . <p> " We do not know what prices are paid in other places , " said Juan Tomas . " How can we know what is a fair price , if we do not know what the pearl buyer gets for the pearl in another place . " <p> " That is true , " said Kino , " but how can we know ? We are here , we are not there . " <p> As they walked up toward the city the crowd grew behind them , and Juan Tomas , in pure nervousness , went on speaking . <p> " Before you were born , Kino , " he said , " the old ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls . They thought it would be better if they had an agent who took all the pearls to the capital and sold them there and kept only his share of the profit . " <p> Kino nodded his head . " I know , " he said . " It was a good thought . " " And so they got such a man , " said Juan Tomas , " and they pooled the pearls , and they started him off . And he was never heard of again and the pearls were lost . Then they got another man , and they started him off , and he was never heard of again . And so they gave the whole thing up and went back to the old way . " <p> " I know , " said Kino . " I have heard our father tell of it . It was a good idea , but it was against religion , and the Father made that very clear . The loss of the pearl was a punishment visited on those who tried to leave their station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woman is like a soldier sent by God to guard some part of the castle of the Universe . And some are in the ramparts and some far deep in the darkness of the walls . But each one must remain faithful to his post and must not go running about , else the castle is in danger from the assaults of Hell . " <p> " I have heard him make that sermon , " said Juan Tomas . " He makes it every year . " <p> The brothers , as they walked along , squinted their eyes a little , as they and their grandfathers and their great-grandfathers had done for four hundred years , since first the strangers came with argument and authority and gunpowder to back up both . And in the four hundred years Kino 's people had learned only one defense- a slight slitting of the eyes and a slight tightening of the lips and a retirement . Nothing could break down this wall , and they could remain whole within the wall . <p> The gathering procession was solemn , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who showed a tendency to scuffle , to scream , to cry out , to steal hats and rumple hair , were hissed to silence by their elders . So important was this day that an old man came to see , riding on the stalwart shoulders of his nephew . The procession left the brush huts and entered the stone and plaster city where the streets were a little wider and there were narrow pavements beside the building . And as before , the beggars joined them as they passed the church ; the grocers looked out at them as they went by ; the little saloons lost their customers and the owners closed up shop and went along . And the sun beat down on the streets of the city and even tiny stones threw shadows on the ground . <p> The news of the approach of the procession ran ahead of it , and in their little dark offices the pearl buyers stiffened and grew alert . They got out papers so that they could be at work when Kino appeared , and they put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let an inferior pearl be seen beside a beauty . And word of the loveliness of Kino 's pearl had come to them . The pearl buyers ' offices were clustered together in one narrow street , and they were barred at the windows , and wooden slats cut out the light so that only a soft gloom entered the offices . <p> A stout slow man sat in an office waiting . His face was fatherly and benign , and his eyes twinkled with friendship . He was a caller of good mornings , a ceremonious shaker of hands , a jolly man who knew all jokes and yet who hovered close to sadness , for in the midst of a laugh he could remember the death of your aunt , and his eyes could become wet with sorrow for your loss . This morning he had placed a flower in a vase on his desk , a single scarlet hibiscus , and the vase sat beside the black velvet-lined pearl tray in front of him . He was shaved close to the blue roots of his beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His door stood open to the morning , and he hummed under his breath while his right hand practiced legerdemain . He rolled a coin back and forth over his knuckles and made it appear and disappear , made it spin and sparkle . The coin winked into sight and as quickly slipped out of sight , and the man did not even watch his own performance . The fingers did it all mechanically , precisely , while the man hummed to himself and peered out the door . Then he heard the tramp of feet of the approaching crowd , and the fingers of his right hand worked faster and faster until , as the figure of Kino filled the doorway , the coin flashed and disappeared . <p> " Good morning , my friend , " the stout man said . " What can I do for you ? " <p> Kino stared into the dimness of the little office , for his eyes were squeezed from the outside glare . But the buyer 's eyes had become as steady and cruel and unwinking as a hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in greeting . And secretly , behind his desk , his right hand practiced with the coin . <p> " I have a pearl , " said Kino . And Juan Tomas stood beside him and snorted a little at the understatement . The neighbors peered around the doorway , and a line of little boys clambered on the window bars and looked through . Several little boys , on their hands and knees , watched the scene around Kino 's legs . <p> " You have a pearl , " the dealer said . " Sometimes a man brings in a dozen . Well , let us see your pearl . We will value it and give you the best price . " And his fingers worked furiously with the coin . <p> Now Kino instinctively knew his own dramatic effects . Slowly he brought out the leather bag , slowly took from it the soft and dirty piece of deerskin , and then he let the great pearl roll into the black velvet tray , and instantly his eyes went to the buyer 's face . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change , but the secret hand behind the desk missed in its precision . The coin stumbled over a knuckle and slipped silently into the dealer 's lap . And the fingers behind the desk curled into a fist . When the right hand came out of hiding , the forefinger touched the great pearl , rolled it on the black velvet ; thumb and forefinger picked it up and brought it near to the dealer 's eyes and twirled it in the air . <p> Kino held his breath , and the neighbors held their breath , and the whispering went back through the crowd . " He is inspecting it- No price has been mentioned yet- They have not come to a price . " <p> Now the dealer 's hand had become a personality . The hand tossed the great pearl back in the tray , the forefinger poked and insulted it , and on the dealer 's face there came a sad and contemptuous smile . <p> " I am sorry , my friend , " he said , and his shoulders rose a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It is a pearl of great value , " Kino said . <p> The dealer 's fingers spurned the pearl so that it bounced and rebounded softly from the side of the velvet tray . <p> " You have heard of fool 's gold , " the dealer said . " This pearl is like fool 's gold . It is too large . Who would buy it ? There is no market for such things . It is a curiosity only . I am sorry . You thought it was a thing of value , and it is only a curiosity . " <p> Now Kino 's face was perplexed and worried . " It is the Pearl of the World , " he cried . " No one has ever seen such a pearl . " <p> " On the contrary , " said the dealer , " it is large and clumsy . As a curiosity it has interest ; some museum might perhaps take it to place in a collection of seashells . I can give you , say , a thousand pesos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the crowd as they heard his price . And the dealer felt a little tremor of fear . <p> " Do not blame me , " he said quickly . " I am only an appraiser . Ask the others . Go to their offices and show your pearl- or better , let them come here , so that you can see there is no collusion . Boy , " he called . And when his servant looked through the rear door , " Boy , go to such a one , and such another one and such a third one . Ask them to step in here and do not tell them why . Just say that I will be pleased to see them . " And his right hand went behind the desk and pulled another coin from his pocket , and the coin rolled back and forth over the knuckles . <p> Kino 's neighbors whispered together . They had been afraid of something like this . The pearl was large , but it had a strange color . They had been suspicious of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pesos was not to be thrown away . It was comparative wealth to a man who was not wealthy . And suppose Kino took a thousand pesos . Only yesterday he had nothing . <p> But Kino had grown tight and hard . He felt the creeping of fate , the circling of wolves , the hover of vultures . He felt the evil coagulating about him , and he was helpless to protect himself . He heard in his ears the evil music . And on the black velvet the great pearl glistened , so that the dealer could not keep his eyes from it . <p> The crowd in the doorway wavered and broke and let the three pearl dealers through . The crowd was silent now , fearing to miss a word , to fail to see a gesture or an expression . Kino was silent and watchful . He felt a little tugging at his back , and he turned and looked in Juana 's eyes , and when he looked away he had renewed strength . The dealers did not glance at one another nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have put a value on this pearl . The owner here does not think it fair . I will ask you to examine this- this thing and make an offer . Notice , " he said to Kino , " I have not mentioned what I have offered . " <p> The first dealer , dry and stringy , seemed now to see the pearl for the first time . He took it up , rolled it quickly between thumb and forefinger , and then cast it contemptuously back into the tray . " Do not include me in the discussion , " he said dryly . " I will make no offer at all . I do not want it . This is not a pearl- it is a monstrosity . " <p> His thin lips curled . <p> Now the second dealer , a little man with a shy soft voice , took up the pearl , and he examined it carefully . He took a glass from his pocket and inspected it under magnification . Then he laughed softly . <p> " Better pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know these things . This is soft and chalky , it will lose its color and die in a few months . <p> Look- " He offered the glass to Kino , showed him how to use it , and Kino , who had never seen a pearl 's surface magnified , was shocked at the strange-looking surface . <p> The third dealer took the pearl from Kino 's hands . " One of my clients likes such things , " he said . " I will offer five hundred pesos , and perhaps I can sell it to my client for six hundred . " <p> Kino reached quickly and snatched the pearl from his hand . He wrapped it in the deerskin and thrust it inside his shirt . <p> The man behind the desk said , " I 'm a fool , I know , but my first offer stands . I still offer one thousand . What are you doing ? " he asked , as Kino thrust the pearl out of sight . <p> " I am cheated , " Kino cried fiercely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go , perhaps even to the capital . " <p> Now the dealers glanced quickly at one another . They knew they had played too hard ; they knew they would be disciplined for their failure , and the man at the desk said quickly , " I might go to fifteen hundred . " But Kino was pushing his way through the crowd . The hum of talk came to him dimly , his rage blood pounded in his ears , and he burst through and strode away . Juana followed , trotting after him . <p> When the evening came , the neighbors in the brush houses sat eating their corncakes and beans , and they discussed the great theme of the morning . They did not know , it seemed a fine pearl to them , but they had never seen such a pearl before , and surely the dealers knew more about the value of pearls than they . " And mark this , " they said . " Those dealers did not discuss these things . Each of the three knew the pearl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before ? " <p> " If that is so , then all of us have been cheated all of our lives . " <p> Perhaps , some argued , perhaps it would have been better if Kino took the one thousand five hundred pesos . That is a great deal of money , more than he has ever seen . Maybe Kino is being a pigheaded fool . Suppose he should really go to the capital and find no buyer for his pearl . He would never live that down . <p> And now , said other fearful ones , now that he had defied them , those buyers will not want to deal with him at all . Maybe Kino has cut off his own head and destroyed himself . <p> And others said , Kino is a brave man , and a fierce man ; he is right . From his courage we may all profit . These were proud of Kino . In his house Kino squatted on his sleeping mat , brooding . He had buried his pearl under a stone of the fire hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tules of his sleeping mat until the crossed design danced in his head . He had lost one world and had not gained another . And Kino was afraid . Never in his life had he been far from home . He was afraid of strangers and of strange places . He was terrified of that monster of strangeness they called the capital . It lay over the water and through the mountains , over a thousand miles , and every strange terrible mile was frightening . But Kino had lost his old world and he must clamber on to a new one . For his dream of the future was real and never to be destroyed , and he had said " I will go , " and that made a real thing too . To determine to go and to say it was to be halfway there . <p> Juana watched him while he buried his pearl , and she watched him while she cleaned Coyotito and nursed him , and Juana made the corncakes for supper . <p> Juan Tomas came in and squatted down beside Kino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Kino demanded , " What else could I do ? They are cheats . " <p> Juan Tomas nodded gravely . He was the elder , and Kino looked to him for wisdom . " It is hard to know , " he said . " We do know that we are cheated from birth to the overcharge on our coffins . But we survive . You have defied not the pearl buyers , but the whole structure , the whole way of life , and I am afraid for you . " <p> " What have I to fear but starvation ? " Kino asked . <p> But Juan Tomas shook his head slowly . " That we must all fear . But suppose you are correct- suppose your pearl is of great value- do you think then the game is over ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " I do n't know , " said Juan Tomas , " but I am afraid for you . It is new ground you are walking on , you do not know the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , " said Kino . <p> " Yes , " Juan Tomas agreed . " That you must do . But I wonder if you will find it any different in the capital . Here , you have friends and me , your brother . There , you will have no one . " <p> " What can I do ? " Kino cried . " Some deep outrage is here . My son must have a chance . That is what they are striking at . My friends will protect me . " <p> " Only so long as they are not in danger or discomfort from it , " said Juan Tomas . He arose , saying , " Go with God . " <p> And Kino said , " Go with God , " and did not even look up , for the words had a strange chill in them . <p> Long after Juan Tomas had gone Kino sat brooding on his sleeping mat . A lethargy had settled on him , and a little gray hopelessness . Every road seemed blocked against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy . His senses were burningly alive , but his mind went back to the deep participation with all things , the gift he had from his people . He <p> heard every little sound of the gathering night , the sleepy complaint of <p> settling birds , the love agony of cats , the strike and withdrawal of little <p> waves on the beach , and the simple hiss of distance . And he could smell <p> the sharp odor of exposed kelp from the receding tide . The little flare <p> of the twig fire made the design on his sleeping mat jump before his <p> entranced eyes . <p> Juana watched him with worry , but she knew him and she knew she could help him best by being silent and by being near . And as though she too could hear the Song of Evil , she fought it , singing softly the melody of the family , of the safety and warmth and wholeness of the family . <p> She held Coyotito in her arms and sang the song to him , to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat of the dark music . <p> Kino did not move nor ask for his supper . She knew he would ask when he wanted it . His eyes were entranced , and he could sense the wary , watchful evil outside the brush house ; he could feel the dark creeping things waiting for him to go out into the night . It was shadowy and dreadful , and yet it called to him and threatened him and challenged him . His right hand went into his shirt and felt his knife ; his eyes were wide ; he stood up and walked to the doorway . <p> Juana willed to stop him ; she raised her hand to stop him , and her mouth opened with terror . For a long moment Kino looked out into the darkness and then he stepped outside . Juana heard the little rush , the grunting struggle , the blow . She froze with terror for a moment , and then her lips drew back from her teeth like a cat 's lips . She set Coyotito down on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , but it was over by then . Kino lay on the ground , struggling to rise , and there was no one near him . Only the shadows and the strike and rush of waves and the hiss of distance . But the evil was all about , hidden behind the brush fence , crouched beside the house in the shadow , hovering in the air . <p> Juana dropped her stone , and she put her arms around Kino and helped him to his feet and supported him into the house . Blood oozed down from his scalp and there was a long deep cut in his cheek from ear to chin , a deep , bleeding slash . And Kino was only half conscious . He shook his head from side to side . His shirt was torn open and his clothes half pulled off . Juana sat him down on his sleeping mat and she wiped the thickening blood from his face with her skirt . She brought him pulque to drink in a little pitcher , and still he shook his head to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> " I do n't know , " Kino said . " I did n't see . " <p> Now Juana brought her clay pot of water and she washed the cut on his face while he stared dazed ahead of him . <p> " Kino , my husband , " she cried , and his eyes stared past her . " Kino , can you hear me ? " <p> " I hear you , " he said dully . <p> " Kino , this pearl is evil . Let us destroy it before it destroys us . Let us crush it between two stones .

Amy Robinson , the U.S. Director for Pasos De Fe , I have participated in a ride-along with a US Border Patrol agent , met with an immigration attorney for an " Immigration Law 101 " briefing , read some excellentbooks , crossed the border several times into Juarez , Mexico , participated in the opening of a community center , and visited many culturally relevant places ( museums , markets , churches , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and worshiping communities along the way . <p> And I 'm far from finished with any of these things yet. - But my illustrious supervisor has asked me to write some reflections in light of my experiences about pastoral ministry in a border community. - So , the next three posts , over the next three days , will explore three border/immigration related topics , each one in connection with a biblical narrative : <p> At this summers PC(USA) General Assembly , I was frequently asked the question " What church do you belong to ? " This question always gave me some pause , and I 'm not sure I ever figured out the best way to answer , other than saying " Which one ? " At the moment , I belong to four different church communities with varying degrees of " membership . " <h> The Four Churches I Love <p> Faithbridge Presbyterian Church. - On paper , my connection here is strongest , but in actuality and function , the connection here is the most tenuous. - Faithbridge is the church I was a member of when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remain " under care " of until after seminary. - That said , we now live 1,500 miles away from this church , have no family and few connections there , and I have n't heard from my " session liaison " in well over a year. - Faithbridge played a large part in my decision to enter ministry ( for which I 'm eternally grateful ) , but its hard for me to consider myself a " member " there , even though of all four churches , this is where my membership officially resides . <p> Middlesex Presbyterian Church . This is where my family attends every Sunday morning in New Jersey , and we are " affiliate members " here. - - I consider the pastor here , Dr. Neal Presa , as " my " pastor , and the congregation is an extended family that looks out for and cares for me and my family , and we participate actively in the life of the church. - However , even though this church is a lot closer than Faithbridge , we still live 45 minutes away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week. - We spend long chunks of time away from this church in the summer and over the Christmas holidayssome of the most important times in the life of a church. - I also realize that this is a temporary family for us , as my time at seminary will come to an end , and we have no deep roots or family in New Jersey . <p> First Presbyterian Church of Second Life . This is the online community I helped organize a little over a year ago that meets in the virtual world of Second Life. - It is probably the most cutting-edge and innovative of all my church communities , and there is a great excitement among those who participate. - My wife and I can participate in this church wherever we travel , and even worship together when we are in separate cities. - There is a very real , very embodied community in this church , that has deepened my faith and my relationship with others. - However , because our denominational polity still lags behind the technology , this church can not yet be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way ( yet ) for my children to actively participate with us. - Many members of this community are also members at other , geographically-based churches . <p> First Presbyterian Church of El Paso. - This is the church where I 'm currently serving as a summer pastoral intern. - On one hand , this church is entirely new to me and to my family ( and has been very welcoming ) , but on the other hand , El Paso is my hometown , where my wife and I- grew up , met , and married . We have more family here than anywhere else , and will almost certainly return here after seminary. - I am not a member of First Presbyterian , bu t shortly after my arrival , I was given two things : An email address ( neal@firstpres-ep.org ) and a- very professionally made and nice-looking hard-plastic , magnetic name tag. - These things may sound trivial , and yet one ( the name tag ) is traditionally recognized in church culture as an unofficial sign of membership , and the other ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership in the digital culture of my generation. - For this and many other reasons ( like the fact that the pastor is a former college English professor , and that the father of my high-school best friend is an elder here ) I feel very much " at home " here . <h> Serial Monogamy vs . Polygamy <p> While monogamous relationships have long been the ideal in Western culture , many sociologists have noted the recent trend toward " serial monogamy " in other words , people are likely to have multiple amorous relationships over the course of a lifetime , but in sequence , not all at once. - Church membership has seen a similar trend : - For most , - the era where a person might be baptized , married , and buried all in the same church community is long gone. - Still , in the 20th century , church members were generally committed to only one church at at time in a given location serial monogamy . <p> So does that make me a polygamist when it comes to my own church membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where my membership resides by seeking to fulfill spiritual needs elsewhere , or by contributing my time &amp; talents elsewhere ? - Perhaps this is where the metaphor breaks down , but I do feel a certain guilt in the fact that I " need " not just one alternate church community , but no less than four ! <p> Each of these church communities , to some degree , offers something necessary and good for my faith journey. - I like to think that I have something to contribute to each of them as well. - And yet all also have shortcomings yes , all churches have " shortcomings " but here I do not mean the sort that results from human failing or lack of effort the shortcomings in this case are all hurdles of geography , technology , or institutional structure. - They are shortcomings for which no solution currently exists , other than " polygamous " or at least " promiscuous " notions of church membership . <h> Toward Post-Modern Membership <p> So , in case you had n't  noticed yet , fixed boundaries are rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-modern world , and classic notions of membership seem to be built on expectations of exclusive fealty. - Contrast this with membership in the very post-modern world of the internet : - I have " officially joined " facebook , twitter , Second Life , Google , Wikipedia , FourSquare , Presbymergent , BrightKite , Amazon.com , Ebay , ReverbNation , Pandora , YouTube , Yelp , and hundreds of other " social networks . " - In fact , I was required to join each of them before I could " fully " participate in the life of their respective communities . This is a fixed boundary of sorts. - And yet it is fluid : - None of them seemed to object to my membership in of any of the others in fact , the really smart ( and successful ) ones have found ways to actually help me integrate my participation accross platforms so that the unique strengths of each community can benefit the others. - This is the paradigm of " membership " that I think most people in my generation embrace , whether consciously or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church membership took a page from the Web2.0 playbook ? - I think the greatest fear that might be voiced is one against fragmentation and confusion. - Promiscuous membership might indeed play into our existing consumerist tendencies. - And yet , is " church collecting " really worse than " church hopping ? " - - Another fear might be that members would be " stretched thin " too involved at too many places to be of any use to one. - - - This is certainly a valid fear. - But I think that here again , skillful integration might be the key. - Most aspects of our lives are balancing acts to begin with , and church communities that find ways to complement and contribute to one another are more likely to survive than those who prefer their members live in isolated fidelity to one community. - I participate in the Amazon.com community far less frequently than I do in the twitter community , but when I need an objective and detailed book review , 140 characters does n't  quite cut it. - But once I find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on twitter for others to follow and thus value is added to both communities . <h> Epilogue <p> I would love to say that from here I will now ride happily into the sunset with my four beautiful church communities in tow and live happily ever after but I acknowledge were not quite there yet. - I suspect that my membership promiscuity still makes some people uncomfortable , in some communities more than others. - But I also see hopeful potential- in an expanding understanding of " membership " for me , for my family , and especially for a denomination in dire need of new approaches and new forms of collaboration. - After all , the one thing my four church communities have in common is that they all share a common name , " Presbyterian . " <p> This one draws from the lectionary passage ( Amos 7:7-17 ) as well as a few scattered reflections from General Assembly 219 and my personal angst over the ongoing " numbers crisis " in the PC(USA) .

The doctor looked past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris and a waiter was just opening a bottle of wine . <p> The news came early to the beggars in front of the church , and it made them giggle a little with pleasure , for they knew that there is no almsgiver in the world like a poor man who is suddenly lucky . Kino has found the Pearl of the World . In the town , in little offices , sat the men who bought pearls from the fishers . They waited in their chairs until the pearls came in , and then they cackled and fought and shouted and threatened until they reached the lowest price the fisherman would stand . But there was a price below which they dared not go , for it had happened that a fisherman in despair had given his pearls to the church . And when the buying was over , these buyers sat alone and their fingers played restlessly with the pearls , and they wished they owned the pearls . For there were not many buyers really- there was only one , and he kept these agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The news came to these men , and their eyes squinted and their fingertips burned a little , and each one thought how the patron could not live forever and someone had to take his place . And each one thought how with some capital he could get a new start . <p> All manner of people grew interested in Kino- people with things to sell and people with favors to ask . Kino had found the Pearl of the World . The essence of pearl mixed with essence of men and a curious dark residue was precipitated . Every man suddenly became related to Kino 's pearl , and Kino 's pearl went into the dreams , the speculations , the schemes , the plans , the futures , the wishes , the needs , the lusts , the hungers , of everyone , and only one person stood in the way and that was Kino , so that he became curiously every man 's enemy . The news stirred up something infinitely black and evil in the town ; the black distillate was like the scorpion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness when love is withheld . The poison sacs of the town began to manufacture venom , and the town swelled and puffed with the pressure of it . <p> But Kino and Juana did not know these things . Because they were happy and excited they thought everyone shared their joy . Juan Tomas and Apolonia did , and they were the world too . In the afternoon , when the sun had gone over the mountains of the Peninsula to sink in the outward sea , Kino squatted in his house with Juana beside him . And the brush house was crowded with neighbors . Kino held the great pearl in his hand , and it was warm and alive in his hand . And the music of the pearl had merged with the music of the family so that one beautified the other . The neighbors looked at the pearl in Kino 's hand and they wondered how such luck could come to any man . <p> And Juan Tomas , who squatted on Kino 's right hand because he was his brother , asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich man ? " Kino looked into his pearl , and Juana cast her eyelashes down and arranged her shawl to cover her face so that her excitement could not be seen . And in the incandescence of the pearl the pictures formed of the things Kino 's mind had considered in the past and had given up as impossible . In the pearl he saw Juana and Coyotito and himself standing and kneeling at the high altar , and they were being married now that they could pay . He spoke softly , " We will be married- in the church . " In the pearl he saw how they were dressed- Juana in a shawl stiff with newness and a new skirt , and from under the long skirt Kino could see that she wore shoes . It was in the pearl- the picture glowing there . He himself was dressed in new white clothes , and he carried a new hat- not of straw but of fine black felt- and he too wore shoes- not sandals but shoes that laced . But Coyotito- he was the one- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little yachting cap such as Kino had seen once when a pleasure boat put into the estuary . All of these things Kino saw in the lucent pearl and he said , " We will have new clothes . " <p> And the music of the pearl rose like a chorus of trumpets in his ears . Then to the lovely gray surface of the pearl came the little things Kino wanted : a harpoon to take the place of one lost a year ago , a new harpoon of iron with a ring in the end of the shaft ; and- his mind could hardly make the leap- a rifle- but why not , since he was so rich . And Kino saw Kino in the pearl , Kino holding a Winchester carbine . It was the wildest daydreaming and very pleasant . His lips moved hesitantly over this- " A rifle , " he said . " Perhaps a rifle . " <p> It was the rifle that broke down the barriers . This was an impossibility , and if he could think of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it is said that humans are never satisfied , that you give them one thing and they want something more . And this is said in disparagement , whereas it is one of the greatest talents the species has and one that has made it superior to animals <p> that are satisfied with what they have . <p> The neighbors , close pressed and silent in the house , nodded their heads at his wild imaginings . And a man in the rear murmured , " A rifle . He will have a rifle . " <p> But the music of the pearl was shrilling with triumph in Kino . Juana looked up , and her eyes were wide at Kino 's courage and at his imagination . And electric strength had come to him now the horizons were kicked out . In the pearl he saw Coyotito sitting at a little desk in a school , just as Kino had once seen it through an open door . And Coyotito was dressed in a jacket , and he had on a white collar , and a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big piece of paper . Kino looked at his neighbors fiercely . " My son will go to school , " he said , and the neighbors were hushed . Juana caught her breath sharply . Her eyes were bright as she watched him , and she looked quickly down at Coyotito in her arms to see whether this might be possible . <p> But Kino 's face shone with prophecy . " My son will read and open the books , and my son will write and will know writing . And my son will make numbers , and these things will make us free because he will know- he will know and through him we will know . " And in the pearl Kino saw himself and Juana squatting by the little fire in the brush hut while Coyotito read from a great book . " This is what the pearl will do , " said Kino . And he had never said so many words together in his life . And suddenly he was afraid of his talking . His hand closed down over the pearl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a man is afraid who says , " I will , " without knowing . <p> Now the neighbors knew they had witnessed a great marvel . They knew that time would now date from Kino 's pearl , and that they would discuss this moment for many years to come . If these things came to pass , they would recount how Kino looked and what he said and how his eyes shone , and they would say , " He was a man transfigured . Some power was given to him , and there it started . You see what a great man he has become , starting from that moment . And I myself saw it . " <p> And if Kino 's planning came to nothing , those same neighbors would say , " There it started . A foolish madness came over him so that he spoke foolish words . God keep us from such things . Yes , God punished Kino because he rebelled against the way things are . You see what has become of him . And I myself saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down at his closed hand and the knuckles were scabbed over and tight where he had struck the gate . <p> Now the dusk was coming . And Juana looped her shawl under the baby so that he hung against her hip , and she went to the fire hole and dug a coal from the ashes and broke a few twigs over it and fanned a flame alive . The little flames danced on the faces of the neighbors . They knew they should go to their own dinners , but they were reluctant to leave . <p> The dark was almost in , and Juana 's fire threw shadows on the brush walls when the whisper came in , passed from mouth to mouth . " The Father is coming- the priest is coming . " The men uncovered their heads and stepped back from the door , and the women gathered their shawls about their faces and cast down their eyes . Kino and Juan Tomas , his brother , stood up . The priest came in- a graying , aging man with an old skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people , and he treated them like children . <p> " Kino , " he said softly , " thou art named after a great man- and a great Father of the Church . " He made it sound like a benediction . " Thy namesake tamed the desert and sweetened the minds of thy people , didst thou know that ? It is in the books . " <p> Kino looked quickly down at Coyotito 's head , where he hung on Juana 's hip . Some day , his mind said , that boy would know what things were in the books and what things were not . The music had gone out of Kino 's head , but now , thinly , slowly , the melody of the morning , the music of evil , of the enemy , sounded , but it was faint and weak . And Kino looked at his neighbors to see who might have brought this song in . <p> But the priest was speaking again . " It has come to me that thou hast found a great fortune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it out , and the priest gasped a little at the size and beauty of the pearl . And then he said , " I hope thou wilt remember to give thanks , my son , to Him who has given thee this treasure , and to pray for guidance in the future . " <p> Kino nodded dumbly , and it was Juana who spoke softly . " We will , Father . And we will be married now . Kino has said so . " She looked at the neighbors for confirmation , and they nodded their heads solemnly . The priest said , " It is pleasant to see that your first thoughts are good thoughts . God bless you , my children . " He turned and left quietly , and the people let him through . <p> But Kino 's hand had closed tightly on the pearl again , and he was glancing about suspiciously , for the evil song was in his ears , shrilling against the music of the pearl . <p> The neighbors slipped away to go to their houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay pot of boiled beans over the little flame . <p> Kino stepped to the doorway and looked out . As always , he could smell the smoke from many fires , and he could see the hazy stars and feel the damp of the night air so that he covered his nose from it . The thin dog came to him and threshed itself in greeting like a windblown flag , and Kino looked down at it and did n't see it . He had broken through the horizons into a cold and lonely outside . He felt alone and unprotected , and scraping crickets and shrilling tree frogs and croaking toads seemed to be carrying the melody of evil . Kino shivered a little and drew his blanket more tightly against his nose . He carried the pearl still in his hand , tightly closed in his palm , and it was warm and smooth against his skin . <p> Behind him he heard Juana patting the cakes before she put them down on the clay cooking sheet . Kino felt all the warmth and security of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from behind him like the purring of a kitten . But now , by saying what his future was going to be like , he had created it . A plan is a real thing , and things projected are experienced . A plan once made and visualized becomes a reality along with other realities- never to be destroyed but easily to be attacked . Thus Kino 's future was real , but having set it up , other forces were set up to destroy it , and this he knew , so that he had to prepare to meet the attack . And this Kino knew also- that the gods do not love men 's plans , and the gods do not love success unless it comes by accident . He knew that the gods take their revenge on a man if he be successful through his own efforts . Consequently Kino was afraid of plans , but having made one , he could never destroy it . And to meet the attack , Kino was already making a hard skin for himself against the world . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Standing in the door , he saw two men approach ; and one of them carried a lantern which lighted the ground and the legs of the men . They turned in through the opening of Kino 's brush fence and came to his door . And Kino saw that one was the doctor and the other the servant who had opened the gate in the morning . The split knuckles on Kino 's right hand burned when he saw who they were . <p> The doctor said , " I was not in when you came this morning . But now , at the first chance , I have come to see the baby . " <p> Kino stood in the door , filling it , and hatred raged and flamed in back of his eyes , and fear too , for the hundreds of years of subjugation were cut deep in him . <p> " The baby is nearly well now , " he said curtly . <p> The doctor smiled , but his eyes in their little lymph-lined hammocks did not smile . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sting has a curious effect . There will be apparent improvement , and then without warning- pouf ! " He pursed his lips and made a little explosion to show how quick it could be , and he shifted his small black doctor 's bag about so that the light of the lamp fell upon it , for he knew that Kino 's race love the tools of any craft and trust them . " Sometimes , " the doctor went on in a liquid tone , " sometimes there will be a withered leg or a blind eye or a crumpled back . Oh , I know the sting of the scorpion , my friend , and I can cure it . " <p> Kino felt the rage and hatred melting toward fear . He did not know , and perhaps this doctor did . And he could not take the chance of putting his certain ignorance against this man 's possible knowledge . He was trapped as his people were always trapped , and would be until , as he had said , they could be sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not take a chance- not with the life or with the straightness of Coyotito . He stood aside and let the doctor and his man enter the brush hut . <p> Juana stood up from the fire and backed away as he entered , and she covered the baby 's face with the fringe of her shawl . And when the doctor went to her and held out his hand , she clutched the baby tight and looked at Kino where he stood with the fire shadows leaping on his face . <p> Kino nodded , and only then did she let the doctor take the baby . " Hold the light , " the doctor said , and when the servant held the lantern high , the doctor looked for a moment at the wound on the baby 's shoulder . He was thoughtful for a moment and then he rolled back the baby 's eyelid and looked at the eyeball . He nodded his head while Coyotito struggled against him . <p> " It is as I thought , " he said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come look ! " He held the eyelid down . " See- it is blue . " <p> And Kino , looking anxiously , saw that indeed it was a little blue . And he did n't know whether or not it was always a little blue . But the trap was set . He could n't take the chance . <p> The doctor 's eyes watered in their little hammocks . " I will give him something to try to turn the poison aside , " he said . And he handed the baby to Kino . <p> Then from his bag he took a little bottle of white powder and a capsule of gelatine . He filled the capsule with the powder and closed it , and then around the first capsule he fitted a second capsule and closed it . Then he worked very deftly . He took the baby and pinched its lower lip until it opened its mouth . His fat fingers placed the capsule far back on the baby 's tongue , back of the point where he could spit it out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pulque and gave Coyotito a drink , and it was done . He looked again at the baby 's eyeball and he pursed his lips and seemed to think . <p> At last he handed the baby back to Juana , and he turned to Kino . " I think the poison will attack within the hour , " he said . " The medicine may save the baby from hurt , but I will come back in an hour . Perhaps I am in time to save him . " He took a deep breath and went out of the hut , and his servant followed him with the lantern . <p> Now Juana had the baby under her shawl , and she stared at it with anxiety and fear . Kino came to her , and he lifted the shawl and stared at the baby . He moved his hand to look under the eyelid , and only then saw that the pearl was still in his hand . Then he went to a box by the wall , and from it he brought a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then went to the corner of the brush house and dug a little hole with his fingers in the dirt floor , and he put the pearl in the hole and covered it up and concealed the place . And then he went to the fire where Juana was squatting , watching the baby 's face . <p> The doctor , back in his house , settled into his chair and looked at his watch . His people brought him a little supper of chocolate and sweet cakes and fruit , and he stared at the food discontentedly . <p> In the houses of the neighbors the subject that would lead all conversations for a long time to come was aired for the first time to see how it would go . The neighbors showed one another with their thumbs how big the pearl was , and they made little caressing gestures to show how lovely it was . From now on they would watch Kino and Juana very closely to see whether riches turned their heads , as riches turn all people 's heads . Everyone knew why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was very well understood . <p> Out in the estuary a tight-woven school of small fishes glittered and broke water to escape a school of great fishes that drove in to eat them . And in the houses the people could hear the swish of the small ones and the bouncing splash of the great ones as the slaughter went on . The dampness arose out of the Gulf and was deposited on bushes and cacti and on little trees in salty drops . And the night mice crept about on the ground and the little night hawks hunted them silently . The skinny black puppy with flame spots over his eyes came to Kino 's door and looked in . He nearly shook his hind quarters loose when Kino glanced up at him , and he subsided when Kino looked away . The puppy did not enter the house , but he watched with frantic interest while Kino ate his beans from the little pottery dish and wiped it clean with a corncake and ate the cake and washed the whole down with a drink of pulque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Juana spoke sharply . " Kino . " He glanced at her and then got up and went quickly to her for he saw fright in her eyes . He stood over her , looking down , but the light was very dim . He kicked a pile of twigs into the fire hole to make a blaze , and then he could see the face of Coyotito . <p> The baby 's face was flushed and his throat was working and a little thick drool of saliva issued from his lips . The spasm of the stomach muscles began , and the baby was very sick . <p> Kino knelt beside his wife . " So the doctor knew , " he said , but he said it for himself as well as for his wife , for his mind was hard and suspicious and he was remembering the white powder . Juana rocked from side to side and moaned out the little Song of the Family as though it could ward off the danger , and the baby vomited and writhed in her arms . Now uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his head and nearly drove out Juana 's song . <p> The doctor finished his chocolate and nibbled the little fallen pieces of sweet cake . He brushed his fingers on a napkin , looked at his watch , arose , and took up his little bag . <p> The news of the baby 's illness traveled quickly among the brush houses , for sickness is second only to hunger as the enemy of poor people . And some said softly , " Luck , you see , brings bitter friends . " And they nodded and got up to go to Kino 's house . The neighbors scuttled with covered noses through the dark until they crowded into Kino 's house again . They stood and gazed , and they made little comments on the sadness that this should happen at a time of joy , and they said , " All things are in God 's hands . " The old women squatted down beside Juana to try to give her aid if they could and comfort if they could not . <p> Then the doctor hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old women like chickens . He took the baby and examined it and felt its head . " The poison it has worked , " he said . " I think I can defeat it . I will try my best . " He asked for water , and in the cup of it he put three drops of ammonia , and he pried open the baby 's mouth and poured it down . The baby spluttered and screeched under the treatment , and Juana watched him with haunted eyes . The doctor spoke a little as he worked . " It is lucky that I know about the poison of the scorpion , otherwise- " and he shrugged to show what could have happened . But Kino was suspicious , and he could not take his eyes from the doctor 's open bag , and from the bottle of white powder there . Gradually the spasms subsided and the baby relaxed under the doctor 's hands . And then Coyotito sighed deeply and went to sleep , for he was very tired with vomiting . <p> The doctor put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get well now , " he said . " I have won the fight . " And Juana looked at him with adoration . The doctor was closing his bag now . He said , " When do you think you can pay this bill ? " He said it even kindly . <p> " When I have sold my pearl I will pay you , " Kino said . <p> " You have a pearl ? A good pearl ? " the doctor asked with interest . <p> And then the chorus of the neighbors broke in . " He has found the Pearl of the World , " they cried , and they joined forefinger with thumb to show how great the pearl was . <p> " Kino will be a rich man , " they clamored . " It is a pearl such as one has never seen . " <p> The doctor looked surprised . " I had not heard of it . Do you keep this pearl in a safe place ? Perhaps you would like me to put it in my safe ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drawn taut . " I have it secure , " he said . " Tomorrow I will sell it and then I will pay you . " <p> The doctor shrugged , and his wet eyes never left Kino 's eyes . He knew the pearl would be buried in the house , and he thought Kino might look toward the place where it was buried . " It would be a shame to have it stolen before you could sell it , " the doctor said , and he saw Kino 's eyes flick involuntarily to the floor near the side post of the brush house . <p> When the doctor had gone and all the neighbors had reluctantly returned to their houses , Kino squatted beside the little glowing coals in the fire hole and listened to the night sound , the soft sweep of the little waves on the shore and the distant barking of dogs , the creeping of the breeze through the brush house roof and the soft speech of his neighbors in their houses in the village . For these people do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk a little and then go to sleep again . And after a while Kino got up and went to the door of his house . <p> He smelled the breeze and he listened for any foreign sound of secrecy or creeping , and his eyes searched the darkness , for the music of evil was sounding in his head and he was fierce and afraid . After he had probed the night with his senses he went to the place by the side post where the pearl was buried , and he dug it up and brought it to his sleeping mat , and under his sleeping mat he dug another little hole in the dirt floor and buried his pearl and covered it up again . <p> And Juana , sitting by the fire hole , watched him with questioning eyes , and when he had buried his pearl she asked , " Who do you fear ? " <p> Kino searched for a true answer , and at last he said , " Everyone . " And he could feel a shell of hardness drawing over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeping mat , and Juana did not put the baby in his box tonight , but cradled him on her arms and covered his face with her head shawl . And the last light went out of the embers in the fire hole . <p> But Kino 's brain burned , even during his sleep , and he dreamed that Coyotito could read , that one of his own people could tell him the truth of things . And in his dream , Coyotito was reading from a book as large as a house , with letters as big as dogs , and the words galloped and played on the book . And then darkness spread over the page , and with the darkness came the music of evil again , and Kino stirred in his sleep ; and when he stirred , Juana 's eyes opened in the darkness . And then Kino awakened , with the evil music pulsing in him , and he lay in the darkness with his ears alert . <p> Then from the corner of the house came a sound so soft that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furtive movement , a touch of a foot on earth , the almost inaudible purr of controlled breathing . Kino held his breath to listen , and he knew that whatever dark thing was in his house was holding its breath too , to listen . For a time no sound at all came from the corner of the brush house . Then Kino might have thought he had imagined the sound . But Juana 's hand came creeping over to him in warning , and then the sound came again ! the whisper of a foot on dry earth and the scratch of fingers in the soil . <p> And now a wild fear surged in Kino 's breast , and on the fear came rage , as it always did . Kino 's hand crept into his breast where his knife hung on a string , and then he sprang like an angry cat , leaped striking and spitting for the dark thing he knew was in the corner of the house . He felt cloth , struck at it with his knife and missed , and struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then his head crashed with lightning and exploded with pain . There was a soft scurry in the doorway , and running steps for a moment , and then silence . <p> Kino could feel warm blood running down from his forehead , and he could hear Juana calling to him . " Kino ! Kino ! " And there was terror in her voice . Then coldness came over him as quickly as the rage had , and he said , " I am all right . The thing has gone . " <p> He groped his way back to the sleeping mat . Already Juana was working at the fire . She uncovered an ember from the ashes and shredded little pieces of cornhusk over it and blew a little flame into the cornhusks so that a tiny light danced through the hut . And then from a secret place Juana brought a little piece of consecrated candle and lighted it at the flame and set it upright on a fireplace stone . She worked quickly , crooning as she moved about . She dipped the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kino 's bruised forehead . " It is nothing , " Kino said , but his eyes and his voice were hard and cold and a brooding hate was growing in him . <p> Now the tension which had been growing in Juana boiled up to the surface and her lips were thin . " This thing is evil , " she cried harshly . " This pearl is like a sin ! It will destroy us , " and her voice rose shrilly . " Throw it away , Kino . Let us break it between stones . Let us bury it and forget the place . Let us throw it back into the sea . It has brought evil . Kino , my husband , it will destroy us . " And in the firelight her lips and her eyes were alive with her fear . <p> But Kino 's face was set , and his mind and his will were set . " This is our one chance , " he said . " Our son must go to school . He must break out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will destroy us all , " Juana cried . " Even our son . " <p> " Hush , " said Kino . " Do not speak any more . In the morning we will sell the pearl , and then the evil will be gone , and only the good remain . Now hush , my wife . " His dark eyes scowled into the little fire , and for the first time he knew that his knife was still in his hands , and he raised the blade and looked at it and saw a little line of blood on the steel . For a moment he seemed about to wipe the blade on his trousers but then he plunged the knife into the earth and so cleansed it . <p> The distant roosters began to crow and the air changed and the dawn was coming . The wind of the morning ruffled the water of the estuary and whispered through the mangroves , and the little waves beat on the rubbly beach with an increased tempo . Kino raised the sleeping mat and dug up his pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> And the beauty of the pearl , winking and glimmering in the light of the little candle , cozened his brain with its beauty . So lovely it was , so soft , and its own music came from it- its music of promise and delight , its guarantee of the future , of comfort , of security . Its warm lucence promised a poultice against illness and a wall against insult . It closed a door on hunger . And as he stared at it Kino 's eyes softened and his face relaxed . He could see the little image of the consecrated candle reflected in the soft surface of the pearl , and he heard again in his ears the lovely music of the undersea , the tone of the diffused green light of the sea bottom . Juana , glancing secretly at him , saw him smile . And because they were in some way one thing and one purpose , she smiled with him . 
@@89755382 @5255382/ <p> Do n't  worry , that was n't my answer . But reflecting on things a few hours later , and as a progressive educator , what I *wish* I would have said is : <p> " What do you think , Grady ? What makes you ask that question ? " <p> Of course , I did n't  think fast enough to come back with that response either . Instead , what I actually fumbled through was something more like : <p> " I do n't  know , Grady . Some people believe that Jesus is God , and other people do n't  . " <p> And then I tried to explain why some people do , and others do n't  , until I found I was rambling at a level that was probably over his head , and quickly killing an otherwise perfect theological father/son opportunity for dialogue . <p> If you 're a new reader to this blog , and you 're still in shock over the fact that I do n't  unquestionably and unwaveringly acknowledge the divinity of Christwelcome to my blog , where heresy and orthodoxy share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other implements of the Inquisition at the door before you enter were a little bit sensitive about that here ) . <p> If anything , my two weeks studying Greek at seminary so far have reinforced my belief that we who call ourselves Christians know a whole lot less than some of us are comfortable with . here 's a case in point : During the second day of class , we were reading the Lords Prayer in the original Greek ( wellas close as we can actually get to the original , which is n't really that close ) , and our professor stops at passage that loosely translates as " give us this day our daily bread . " Only , he points to the word that we translate as daily , and says , " Nobody really knows what this word means . It only occurs two places in the New Testament ( both times in the Lords Prayer ) and nowhere else in ancient Greek literature . The word Daily is just a guess . " <p> So for all we know , Jesus could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would certainly appreciate a daily ration of that . Now , I know that some people argue that its possible to be certain of the " big picture " despite small translation issues , and minor variances in manuscripts . I myself believe this is mostly true , although it seems to me ( as an English major and student of language in general ) that sometimes those " little " things can be pretty significant . <p> Back to Gradys question . Is Jesus God ? A google search on this question quickly turns up five dozen websites that all offer some variation of Josh McDowells " Liar , Lunatic , or Lord " proposition basically the idea that <p> Jesus " said " he was God , and <p> for someone to make such a claim , he would have to be <p> a liar , <p> crazy , or <p> telling the truth <p> Even though I once used that whole shpiel ( as a very young youth director ) , Ive come to think its a ridiculous oversimplification and quite counterproductive . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit loopy as are most talented and passionate people who change history . But my bigger issue with the liar , lunatic , lord proposition is much more simple : Did Jesus actually ever say that he *was* God ? In the gospel of Mark ( the oldest of the gospels ) he does not . In fact , Jesus favorite title for himself in all the gospels is not " Son of God " but rather " Son of Man " in other words , Jesus himself preferred for us to focus on his humanity , not his divinity ( well , according to Matthew , Mark , and Luke , at least ) . <p> The most oft quoted gospel for establishing the divinity of Jesus is the gospel of John , which was written much later , when " institutional Christianity " was already well underway , and after Paul ( who came onto the scene *after* the death of Jesus ) had already fleshed out the basic theology/christology adopted by the early church. - Even there , the most solid reference ( in John ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( John 10:30 KJV ) . But is this the only way to translate that phrase ? I have n't broached this passage in the original Greek yet , but as we learn , I keep running into passages that can be reasonably translated in more than one way , sometimes making a striking difference in the ultimate meaning. - Heres another translation of that same- passage : " I and the Father are one heart and mind " ( MSG ) . I often think that of my relationship with Grady despite the 30 years that separate us , sometimes we think and act a lot alike. - One might say we " share a brain . " But I certainly do n't  think that Grady is me , and I am Grady . And I think a reasonable person listening to Jesus say these words would NOT have instantly thought him a liar , lunatic , OR even a deityunless it were someone already looking for words to trip him up with ( like the Pharisees ) . <p> Speaking of " looking for words to trip one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disclaimer that what I 'm writing here represents exploration and journey for me , theologically not something set in stone , that I believe unwaveringly , yesterday , today , and forever . ( And yes , this paragraph is specifically addressed to my Committee on Preparation for Ministry ) . <p> In the end , this is an issue that is far from resolved , at least for me . I do n't  judge others who have already settled on an answer to this one I have good friends on both sides. - Maybe Grady and I can explore this question together . <p> Later on that night , Grady asked another theological question : <p> " Daddy , why did people kill Jesus ? " <p> I had a lot more fun answering this one . We talked about power , authority , money , and all the other things Jesus called into question . Whether Jesus was God or not , I AM pretty certain that Woody Guthrie had it right : If Jesus showed up today , preaching the same stuff he did 2000 years agowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mostly mean Christians . <p> On my second day of class , I missed the bus ( actually its a shuttle , but saying I missed the bus sounds more dramatic ) . - Amy drove me to the seminary , and we got stuck in traffic , so I walked into class ten minutes late. - And then my preceptor ( its a Princeton thing , I 'll talk about it later ) made a remark about punctuality , glancing my way <p> But before I feel really sorry for myself , I must note the irony of the situation , and the hundreds of Sunset High School students who- if any of them still actually read this blog would be cheering right about now and saying , " Now you know how it feels , Mr. Locke ! " <p> So yeah , I was a bit of a jerk when it came to issuing tardy passes in my days as a high school teacher. - And yeah , I guess what comes around goes around. - I 'm ok with that. - Tomorrow I 'm taking the early bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy the study of Greek. - Having majored in English , learned French as a child growing up in Belgium , and studied Anglo-Saxon just so I could read Beowulf I must have a thing for languages , or at least I 'm able to convince myself that I do. - Well know tomorrow our first quiz- is over the Greek alphabet , and conjugation of verbs in the Present Active Indicative. - And twelve vocabulary words ( mostly verbs ) . - I 'd type them here , but I have n't quite learned to do Greek characters on my keyboard ( anyone ? ) . <p> I 'm far less confident about another thing I 'll be doing tomorrow playing French horn as part of an ensemble for our first chapel service of the summer. - Not sure how I got wrapped up in that. - Yes I am ; I searched out the music director , told him what I played , and volunteered to help in any way I could what a total band geek ! . I 'm playing horn on two songs , and piano on one. - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly. - My fingers and my embouchure were slightly less cooperative , though. - But I enjoyed the brief diversion from things academic , and might be inclined to make this music thing a habit . <p> This afternoon , after studying with a few friends , studying on my own , and practicing tomorrows music in a practice room , I wandered down to the bus stop to catch my ride home . <p> And I missed the last bus home . <p> Again . <p> And Amy had to come pick me up . <p> Again . <p> On our anniversary , no less . 218027 @qwx838027 <p> So classes start this Monday . Well , one at least my Greek class . And from what Ive heard , that should be enough : Its a ten-week course , and due to the " intensity " of it all , students are highly discouraged from working part-time jobs or anything that might distract . I 've got my textbooks already : <p> A plethora of other Greek books , dictionaries , and flash cards graciously passed down and piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Lotspeich and Glen Hunihan . <p> So far , I 've met two other students in my class : One of them has taken Greek before at a different school , and the other has been studying furiously all summer long . No pressure . <p> Actually , pressure is something I 'm starting to feel here , and not just about Greek . On one hand , the people we 've met have been astonishingly welcoming and friendly , going out of their way to make us feel loved and at home . I get the sense that at least here in CRW ( the seminary apartment complex ) everyone kind of functions as one big extended family . But as soon as the conversations turn to academics , the tone changes , the eyes shift , and suddenly I feel like I 'm back in undergrad running for student body president again . Only this time , *everyone* is running . And already ten miles down the road ( sorry for the mixed metaphor ) . <p> A lot of the pressure seems to be about getting into a PhD program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intention of going that route , but then get swept up in it anyhow . Ive been told that to get into a decent PhD program , I 'll need to maintain a 3.8 or higher GPA , which means that A minuses are a bad , bad thing . I 've also gathered that in addition to an M.Div , I 'll probably need another more specialized masters degree to be considered by any top-tier school , and that my planned MA in Christian Education might not be " serious " enough for PhD work . Oh , and since I 'm in my thirties already , if I wait too much longer to get a PhD , I might have a hard time getting accepted , since a younger candidate would be a better investment and have more years of productive reasearch/teaching in the field . <p> How much of this is true , and how much is exaggeration and/or hype ? I do n't  know yet . I was mostly just happy to be back in school again . I remember when I was in high school , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good college ( yes , I went to one of *those* high schools ) . And then in undergraduate , everyone seemed to be motivated to achieve so they could get into a good graduate program . Now that I 'm finally here ( ten years later ) this is familiar everyone is still focused on " what comes next . " To borrow a programming metaphor , I wonder if that 's a feature , or a bug , in our culture ? Perhaps both , to some extent . <p> I talked to my brother , Jeff , on the phone the other night , and he helped me put a lot of things into perspective . Because seriously , who really needs a PhD to start a micro-brewery monastery ? I 've always thought I would go on to get one someday , but if I do , I think it will be on my own terms , and for the sake of the knowledge , not the image . By striving hard to " achieve " and outdo those around me in this competitive academic environment , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing " what everyone else is doing . " And Ive never been about conformity , now have I ? <p> Time to go study some Greek . Everyone else here may be looking for a grade , a spotlight , or even the ability to read the New Testament a more original form . Not me I just want to be able to read Homers Odyssey in its original language <p> Well , we 've survived a week here in Princeton , and it has n't  even seemed that difficult ( yet ) . - Of course , Summer Greek has n't  started yet , tuition bills and grocery bills and other bills havent found their way to our new address yet , and we have n't really looked inside all the boxes stacked against the walls yet. - Still , its been a great first. - Someone ( I cant remember who , now ) asked me if it felt " surreal , " and that is indeed the best way to describe it. - But I 've never been one for one-word summaries , so here 's the more verbose version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the last stretch of our Journey past Philadelphia and into Princeton , we picked up our keys , signed our lease , and found ourselves in an empty apartment waiting for our stuff to arrive . <p> Saturday We slept in , then Grady and I went to the " Dinky " trains station ( that 's really what they call it ) to pick up my sister , and Gradys Aunt Emily. - Em treated us to lunch at Chilis ( yes , they have those here ) , then we went back to our empty apartment , and took turns cleaning and playing with kids. - For awhile , Emily and I sat on the front steps watching Grady play soccer in the front yard with Matthew , a little boy who lives above us. - When we realized how late it was , we rushed Emily back to the train station , explored Princeton a little more , and then called it a night . <p> Sunday We woke up early in the morning to go to church New York City ! - Our first trip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NYC , at first we thought we were lost , but it turned out we werent. - A subway trip brought us to Columbia University , where our friends John and Annie Feighery are PhD students. - Our kids played with their kids , we all went to play in a water-fountain-park near their apartment , had an excellent New-Mexico style dinner , and then to Central Park for a free concert by French/Israeli singer , Yael Naim. - By the time we got back to the Feigherys apartment , kids and adults were exhausted and ready to crash. - Click here for the rest of the pictures ( taken by Annie ) of our NYC trip . <p> Monday Got up early to say goodbye to the Feigherys and catch a train back to Princeton. - When we got back , I made a trip to the seminary campus , where I filled out paperwork for financial aid , and then bought my first two textbooks for my Summer Greek course . Cost about $50 for both , which actually is not that bad. - Yet. - That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookout with a few other seminary families . Afterwards , Andrew took me on a quick tour of Princeton and a stop at Triumph brewery for some growlers ( 1 growler = approx 4 pints ) , which we enjoyed later that evening with a few friends and some deep theological discussion. - Well , maybe more interesting than deep . <p> Tuesday Our stuff was supposed to arrive Monday , but somehow got stuck in Pennsylvania , so we spent most of Tuesday waiting for it. - We did make a quick trip to Babies R Us to cash in on a present from Amys parents : A new play-saucer for Abby ( which came in really handy the next day while we were all unloading furniture ) . - Finally our stuff arrived , and we did a little unloading before it got dark . Some friends we had met the previous night , Nate and Janel , were kind enough to invite us over for dinner . <p> Wednesday John &amp; Aidan caught a train down from NYC to help us unload , and two sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey &amp; Rachel ) also pitched in making the unloading of the truck complete in an amazing two hours. - Following my mothers advice , I made sure I had beer for the movers I would have provided them with some good Texas Shiner Bock , but it seems nowhere to be found here in New Jersey , so I opted for Stella Artois instead ( hey , its Belgian ) . Afterwards , the Lockes took the Feigherys ( 2/5ths of them , anyhow ) to lunch at the local WaWa. - The What ? ? ? - Actually its a chain of convenience stores. - I know , not too fancy , but apparently they 're well known for their hoagie sandwiches , and we were feeling experimental. - In true New Jersey fashion , you go in , punch your order on a computer screen , and never have to talk to a single person ! Later , John and Aidan caught the train back to NYC , and we began the piling of boxes ( of which there is no end ) . <p> Thursday After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relaxed for most of the day. - Somewhere in the midst of it , Abby spoke what may have been her first word ? - Were really not sure. - She was looking at Grady , and out of the blue started saying " bubba , bubba " ( or it might have been bababababa ) . - The thing is , when we say it to her now , shell repeat it. - So its reproducible , but were not sure if it really has meaning attached to Grady , her brother. - That evening , we made our first family trip to the grocery store , and I discovered Chimay Cheese in the specialty cheeses section ! - The trip took longer than we expected , and so we grabbed some Chinese take-home on the way out , and had a late , improvised dinner to finish out the week . <p> That 's pretty much it. - If you 're still reading , you must either be incredibly interested in our family , related to us , or else in serious need of switching off the monitor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more Locke family adventures in Seminary. - If you do n't  want to bother with checking back , just enter your email address in the " subscribe " box to the right , and you can receive email updates on our journey. - If nothing else , it might be slightly more interesting than spam ! <p> Its been several weeks now , and I meant to do this sooner , but here are the audio recordings from my last Sunday at Faithbridge : <p> My Last Sermon and my least prepared one at that , too. - I have n't listened to the recording yet , so let me know if it comes out ok . <p> Shine For You this is a song I wrote for Faithbridge several years ago , and performed one last time with the praise team. - A lot of kids from the youth group also joined us for this one , playing guitar , bass , drums , and ( my favorite ) flute . <p> Mr. Preacher Man this is a spoof of Billy Joels " Piano Man , " written/arranged by Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorate " my time at Faithbridge. - The words are a little hard to hear , but absolutely hilarious ( and all true ) . <p> For Presbyterians , General Assembly is part family reunion , part mega-convention , and part election day .

Ive been tagged by Sarah Glass and Carol Howard-Merritt ( whose blogs are both phenomenal and well worth visiting ) in this meme started by Bruce Reyes-Chow , the Barack Obama of the Presbyterian world , and hopefully the next moderator ( which is kind of like a cross between the Queen of England and the Ambassador to the Middle East ) of the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) . <p> What is your earliest memory of being distinctly Presbyterian ? It was last summer , actually at least seven years *after* I actually joined a presbyterian church , and two years *after* I decided to go to seminary and pursue ordination in the PCUSA : I was at the Presbyterian Evangelism Conference in Nashville , and I bought a baseball cap with the PC(USA) logo embossed on it . Branding is a big part of our culture , is n't it ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On what issue/question should the PC(USA) spend LESS energy and time ? I 'm going to have to second Ryan on this one and say the ordination process . Yes , its probably because I 'm going through it right now , but geez 500 questions about my finances , my eating habits , my sex life , my parents , my bowel movements , all so I can pass a psychological evaluation that qualifies me to INQUIRE about going into ordained ministry ? ? ? ? WTFWJD ? ? ? Probably not pursue ordination in the PC(USA) , I 'm guessing <p> On what issue/question should the PC(USA) spend MORE energy and time ? How about considering ways to start and support intentional communities ? I think Rick Ufford-Chase is doing something with this , and I 'm hugely inspired by Shane Claibornes urban monasticism . <p> If you could have the PC(USA) focus on one passage of scripture for a entire year , what would it be ? I could sit and think of a few , but nothing I could come up with could possibly top Sarahs suggestion of Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just jump on that bandwagon . <p> If the PC(USA) were an animal what would it be and why ? A turtle . The Presbyterian Church is slow to change directions , but its steady and persistent once it does . It has a tough shell that can withstand great pressure , but sometimes we withdraw into it a bit much . Actually , maybe the PCUSA is kind of like Molly , my pet turtle . She only has three legs , so she goes in circles a lot . But I still love her tremendously . Turtles are also a pretty humble sort , and I think Presbyterians have that capacity . And at least in cartoon stereotypes , the turtle is always the nerdy , geekish creature definitely Presbyterian . <p> Extra Credit : Jesus shows up at General Assembly this year , what does he say to the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) ? Once again forgoing originality ( because its highly overrated ) , I 'm going to have to echo Carol here and say that Jesus always confounds me too , so I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that turned our pre-conceived notions and policies completely upside down , and it would probably be completely misunderstood by most .

Heres hoping that some would have the grace and humility to lay down our denominational priorities , and follow him out into the world . <p> One more thing : As fast ( and fun ) as this thing is spreading across the world of Presbyterian bloggers , I 'm thinkin the guy who started it must be pretty visionary , pretty good at " starting things " and pretty in tune with presbyterian culture and the larger culture were part of .

Yours would be the same girls . <p> This crew did not name or come over in the Mary Ruth.On the nose of the ship her name is written , and under it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who Mary Ruth was , nor what memories are celebrated.She was named when they got her , and they would not think of changing her name.In some way it would be bad luck . <p> A rumor has swept through the airfields that some powerful group in America has protested about the names of the ships and that an order is about to be issued removing these names and substituting the names of towns and rivers.It is to be hoped that this is not true.Some of the best writing of the war has been on the noses of bombers.The names are highly personal things , and the ships grow to be people.Change the name of Bomb Boogie to St. Louis , or Mary Ruth of Mobile Memories to Wichita , or the Volga Virgin to Davenport , and you will have injured the ship.The name must be perfect and must be approved by every member of the crew.The names must not be changed.There is enough dullness in the war as it is . <p> Mary Ruths crew sit on their bunks and discuss the hard luck of Bomb Boogie.Bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission is an abortion.They bring her in and go over her and test her and take her on test runs.She is perfect and then she starts on an operational flight , and her engines go bad or her landing gear gives trouble.Something always happens to Bomb Boogie.She never gets to her target.It is something no one can understand.Four days ago she started out and never got as far as the coast of England before one of her engines conked out and she had to return . <p> One of the waist gunners strolls out , but in a minute he is back . " Were alerted for tomorrow , " he says . " I hope it is n't Kiel.There was a hell of a lot of red flak at Kiel . " <p> " The guy with the red beard is there , " says Brown , the tail gunner . " He looked right at me.I drew down on him and my guns jammed . " <p> " Let 's go eat , " the turret gunner says . <p> NEWS FROM HOME <p> Bomber station in england , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and daylight-saving time keeps them light until eleven-thirty.After mess we take the Army bus into town.It is an ancient little city which every American knows about as soon as he can read.The buildings on the narrow streets are Tudor , Stuart , Georgian , and even some Norman.The paving stones are worn smooth and the flagstones of the sidewalks are grooved by ages of strollers.It is a town to stroll in.American soldiers , Canadians , Royal Air Force men , and many of Great Britains women soldiers walk through the streets.But Britain drafts its women and they are really in the Army , driver-mechanics , dispatch riders , trim and hard in their uniforms . <p> The crew of the Mary Ruth ends up at a little pub , overcrowded and noisy.They edge their way in to the bar , where the barmaids are drawing beer as fast as they can.In a moment this crew has found a table and they have the small glasses of pale yellow fluid in front of them.It is curious beer.Most of the alcohol has been taken out of it to make munitions.It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The bomber crew is solemn.Men who are alerted for operational missions are usually solemn , but tonight there is some burden on this crew.There is no way of knowing how these things start.All at once a crew will feel fated.Then little things go wrong.Then they are uneasy until they take off for their mission.When the uneasiness is running it is the waiting that hurts . <p> They sip the flat , tasteless beer.One of them says , " I saw a paper from home at the Red Cross in London . " It is quiet.The others look at him across their glasses.A mixed group of pilots and ATS girls at the other end of the pub have started a song.It is astonishing how many of the songs are American . " Youd Be So Nice to Come Home to , " they sing.And the beat of the song is subtly changed.It has become an English song . <p> The waist gunner raises his voice to be heard over the singing . " It seems to me that we are afraid to announce our losses.It seems almost as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.I never saw anything the country couldnt take . " <p> The ball-turret gunner wipes his mouth with the back of his hand . " We do n't  hear much , " he says , " its a funny thing , but the closer you get to action the less you read papers and war news.I remember before I joined up I used to know everything that was happening.I knew what Turkey was doing.I even had maps with pins and I drew out campaigns with colored pencils.Now I have n't looked at a paper in two weeks . " <p> The first man went on , " This paper I saw had some funny stuff in it.It seemed to think that the war was nearly over . " <p> " I wish the Jerries thought that , " the tail gunner says . " I wish you could get Goerings yellow noses and them damned flak gunners convinced of that . " <p> " Well anyway , " the waist gunner says , " I looked through that paper pretty close.It seems to me that the folks at home are fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won and we 've just got started on ours.I wish theyd get in the same war were in.I wish theyd print the casualties and tell them what its like.I think maybe that theyd like to get in the same war were in if they could get it to do . " <p> The tail gunner comes from so close to the border of Kentucky he talks like a Kentuckian . " I read a very nice piece in a magazine about us , " he says . " This piece says we 've got nerves of steel.We never get scared.All we want in the world is just to fly all the time and get a crack at Jerry.I never heard anything so brave as us.I read it three or four times to try and convince myself that I ai n't  scared . " <p> " There was almost solid red flak over Bremen last Thursday , " the radio man says . " Get much more and we can walk home over solid flak.I hate that red flak.We sure took a pasting Thursday . " <p> " Well , we did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gunners . " We got the nose knocked out of our ship , but that was an accident.One of the gunners in a ship high on ahead tossed out some shell casings and they came right through the nose.Theyve got her nearly fixed up now . " <p> " But anyway , " the first man says doggedly , " I wish theyd tell them at home that the war is n't over and I wish they would n't think were so brave.I do n't  want to be so brave.Shall we have another beer ? " <p> " What for ? Says the tail gunner . " This stuff has n't  got even enough character for you to dislike it.Im going back to wipe my guns.Then I wo n't have to do it in the morning . " <p> They stand up and file slowly out of the pub.It is still daylight.The pigeons are flying about the tower of an old Gothic church , a kind of architecture especially suited to nesting pigeons . <p> The hotel taken over by the Red Cross is crowded with men in from the flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we pile in.The crew looks automatically at the sky.It is clear , with little puffs of white cloud suspended in the light of a sun that has already gone down . <p> " Looks like it might be a clear day , " the radio man says . " That 's good for us and its good for them to get at us . " <p> The bus rattles back toward the field.The tail gunner muses . " I hope old Red Beard has got a bad cold , " he says . " I did n't  like the look in his eye the last time . " <p> ( Red Beard is an enemy fighter pilot who comes so close that you can almost see his face . ) <h> SUPERSTITION <p> Bomber station in england , June 30 , 1943It is a bad night in the barracks , such a night as does not happen very often.It is impossible to know how it starts.Nerves are a little thin and no one is sleepy.The tail gunner of the other outfit in the room gets down from his upper bunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter ? " the man on the lower bunk asks . <p> " I lost my medallion , " the tail gunner says . <p> No one asks what it was , a St. Christopher or a good-luck piece.The fact of the matter is that it is his medallion and he has lost it.Everyone gets up and looks.They move the double-decker bunk out from the wall.They empty all the shoes.They look behind the steel lockers.They insist that the gunner go through all his pockets.It is n't a good thing for a man to lose his medallion.Perhaps there has been an uneasiness before.This sets it.The uneasiness creeps all through the room.It takes the channel of being funny.They tell jokes ; they rag one another.They ask shoe sizes of one another to outrage their uneasiness . " What size shoes you wear , Brown ? I get them if you conk out . " The thing runs bitterly through the room . <p> And then the jokes stop.There are many little things you do when you go out on a mission.You leave the things that are to be sent home if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your photographs and the letter you wrote , and your ring.Theyre under your pillow , and you do n't  make up your bunk.That must be left unmade so that you can slip right in when you get back.No one would think of making up a bunk while its owner is on a mission.You go out clean-shaven too , because you are coming back , to keep your date.You project your mind into the future and the things you are going to do then . <p> In the barracks they tell of presentiments they have heard about.There was the radio man who one morning folded his bedding neatly on his cot and put his pillow on top.And he folded his clothing into a neat parcel and cleared his locker.He had never done anything like that before.And sure enough , he was shot down that day . <p> The tail gunner still has n't  found his medallion.He has gone through his pockets over and over again.The brutal talk goes on until one voice says , " For Gods sake shut up.Its after midnight.Weve got to get some sleep . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the blackout curtains are drawn tight.A man speaks in the darkness . " I wish I was in that ship by now . " He knows that he will be all right when the mission starts.Its this time of waiting that hurts , and tonight it has been particularly bad . <p> It is quiet in the room , and then there is a step , and then a great clatter.A new arrival trying to get to his bunk in the dark has stumbled over the gun rack.The room breaks into loud curses.Everyone curses the new arrival.They tell him where he came from and where they hope he will go.It is a fine , noisy outburst , and the tension goes out of the room.The evil thing has gone . <p> You are conscious , lying in your bunk , of a droning sound that goes on and on.It is the Royal Air Force going out for the night bombing again.There must be hundreds of thema big raid.The sound has been going on all evening and it goes on for another hour.Hundreds of Lancasters , with hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go out . <p> You can not call the things that happen to bombing crews superstition.Tension and altitude do strange things to a man.At 30,000 feet , the body is living in a condition it was not born to withstand.A man is breathing oxygen from a tube and his eyes and ears are working in the reduced pressure.It is little wonder , then , that he sometimes sees things that are not there and does not see things that are there.Gunners have fired on their own ships and others have poured great bursts into empty air , thinking they saw a swastika.The senses are not trustworthy.And the sky is treacherous with flak.The flak bursts about you and sometimes the fragments come tearing through your ship.The fighters stab past you , flaring with their guns.And , if you happen to see little visions now and then , why that 's bound to happen.And if on your intensified awareness , small incidents are built up with meanings , why , such things always happen under tension.Ghosts have always ridden through skies and if your body and nerves are strained with altitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barrack room is very silent.From a corner comes a light snore.Someone is talking in his sleep.First a sentence mumbled and then , " Helen , let 's go in the Ferris wheel now . " <p> There is secret sound from the far wall , and then a tiny clink of metal.The tail gunner is still feeling through his pockets for his medallion . <h> WAITING <p> Bomber station in england , July 4 , 1943The field is deserted after the ships have left.The ground crew go into barracks to get some sleep , because they have been working most of the night.The flag hangs limply over the administration building.In the hangars repair crews are working over ships that have been injured.Bomb Boogie is brought in to be given another overhaul and Bomb Boogies crew goes disgustedly back to bed . <p> The crews own a small number of small dogs.These dogs , most of which are of uncertain or , at least , ambiguous breed , belong to no one man.The ship usually owns each one , and the crew is very proud of him.Now these dogs wander disconsolately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station.The morning passes slowly.The squadron was due over the target at 9:52 . It was due home at 12:43 . As 9:50 comes and passes you have the ships in your mind.Now the flak has come up at them.Perhaps now a swarm of fighters has hurled itself at them.The thing happens in your mind.Now , if everything has gone well and there have been no accidents , the bomb bays are open and the ships are running over the target.Now they have turned and are making the run for home , keeping the formation tight , climbing , climbing to avoid the flak.It is 10 oclock , they should be started back10:20 , they should be seeing the ocean by now . <p> The crew last night had told a story of the death of a Fortress , and it comes back to mind . <p> It was a beautiful day , they said , a picture day with big clouds and a very blue sky.The kind of day you see in advertisements for air travel back at home.The formation was flying toward St. Nazaire and the air was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said.Then the flak came up , they said , and some Messerschmitts parked off out of range and began to pot at them with their cannon.They did n't  see where the Fortress up ahead was hit.Probably in the controls , because they did not see her break up at all . <p> They all agree that what happened seemed to happen very slowly.The Fortress slowly nosed up and up until she tried to climb vertically and , of course , she couldnt do that.Then she slipped in slow motion , backing like a falling leaf , and she balanced for a while and then her nose edged over and she started , nose down , for the ground . <p> The blue sky and the white clouds made a picture of it.The crew could see the gunner trying to get out and then he did , and his parachute fluffed open.And the ball-turret gunnerthey could see him flopping about.The bombardier and navigator blossomed out of the nose and the waist gunners followed them.Mary Ruths crew was yelling , " Get out , you pilots . " The ship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the co-pilot were lost.The y stayed with the ship too long and thenthe ship was so far down that they could hardly see it.It must have been almost to the ground when two little puffs of white , first one and then the second , shot out of her.And the crew yelled with relief.And then the ship hit the ground and exploded.Only the tail gunner and ball-turret man had seen the end.They explained it over the intercom . <p> Beside the no. 1 hangar there is a little mound of earth covered with short , heavy grass.At 12:15 the ground men begin to congregate on it and sweat out the homecoming.Rumor comes with the crew chief that they have reported , but it is rumor.A small dog , which might be a gray Scottie if his ears did n't  hang down and his tail bend the wrong way , comes to sit on the little mound.He stretches out and puts his whiskery muzzle on his outstretched paws.He does not close his eyes and his ears twitch.All the ground crews are there now , waiting for their ships.It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog raises his head.His body begins to tremble all over.The crew chief has a pair of field glasses.He looks down at the dog and then aims his glasses to the south . <p> " Ca n't see anything yet , " he says.The little dog continues to shudder and a high whine comes from him . <p> And here they come.You can just see the dots far to the south.The formation is good , but one ship flies alone and ahead . " Can you see her number ? Who is she ? " The lead ship drops altitude and comes in straight for the field.From her side two little rockets break , a red one and a white one.The ambulance , they call it the meat wagon , starts down the runway.There is a hurt man on that ship . <p> The main formation comes over the field and each ship peels to circle for a landing , but the lone ship drops and the wheels strike the ground and the Fortress lands like a great bug on the runway.But the moment her wheels are on the ground there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dog seems hardly to touch the ground.He streaks across the field toward the landed ship.He knows his own ship.One by one the Fortresses land and the ground crews check off the numbers as they land.Mary Ruth is there.Only one ship is missing and she landed farther south , with short fuel tanks.There is a great sigh of relief on the mound.The mission is over . <h> Part II:Africa <h> ALGIERS <p> Algiers , ( Via London ) , August 28 , 1943Algiers is a fantastic city now.Always a place of strange mixtures , it has been brought to a nightmarish mess by the influx of British and American troops and their equipment.Now jeeps and staff cars nudge their way among camels and horse-drawn cars.The sunshine is blindingly white on the white city , and when there is no breeze from the sea the heat is intense . <p> The roads are lined with open wagons loaded high with fresh-picked grapes , with military convoys , with Arabs on horseback , with Canadians , Americans , Free French native troops in tall red hats.The uniforms are of all colors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been issued American uniforms since they had none of their own.You never know when you approach Americana Khaki that it will not clothe an Arab or a Senegalese . <p> The languages spoken in the streets are fascinating.Rarely is one whole conversation carried out in just one language.Our troops do not let language difficulties stand in their way.Thus you may see a soldier speaking in broad Georgia accents conversing with a Foreign Legionnaire and a burnoosed Arab.He speaks cracker , with a sour French word thrown in here and there , but his actual speech is with his hands.He acts out his conversation in detail . <p> His friends listen and watch and they answer him in Arabic or French and pantomime their meaning , and oddly enough they all understand one another.The spoken language is merely the tonal background to a fine bit of acting.Out of it comes a manual pidgin that is becoming formalized.The gesture for a drink is standard.Gestures of friendship and anger and love have also become standard . <p> The money is a definite problem.A franc is worth two cents.It is paper money and comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred , and one thousand franc notes.The paper used is a kind of blotting paper that wads up and tears easily . <p> Carried in the pocket , it becomes wet and gummy with perspiration , and when taken out of the pocket often falls to pieces in your hands.In some stores they will not accept torn money , which limits the soldier , because most of the money he has is not only torn but wadded and used until the numbers on it are almost unrecognizable.A wad of money feels like a handful of warm wilted lettuce.In addition there are many American bills , the so-called invasion money , which is distinguished from home money by having a gold seal printed on its face.These bills feel cool and permanent compared with the Algerian money . <p> A whole new tourist traffic has set up here.A soldier may buy baskets , bad rugs , fans , paintings on cloth , just as he can at Coney Island.Many GIs with a magpie instinct will never be able to get home , such is their collection of loot.They have bits of battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helmets , in addition to their colored baskets and rugs.In each case the collector has someone at home in mind when he makes the purchases.Grandma would love this Algerian shawl , and this Italian bayonet is just the thing to go over Uncle Charleys fireplace , along with the French bayonet he brought home from the last war.Suddenly there will come the order to march with light combat equipment , and the little masses of collections will have to be left with instructions to forward that will never be carried out.Americans are great collectors.The next station will start the same thing all over again . <p> The terraces of the hotels are crowded at five oclock.This is the time when people gather to get a drink and to look at one another.There is no hard liquor.Cooled wine and lemonade and orange wine are the standard drinks.There is some beer made of peanuts , which does have a definite peanut flavor.The wine is good and light and cooling , a little bit of a shock to a palate used to bourbon whisky , but acceptable . <p> On these terraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet dates.The French women here have done remarkably well.Their shoes have thick wooden soles , but are attractive , and the few clothes they have are clean and well kept.Since there is little material for dyeing the hair or bleaching it , a new fashion seems to have started.One lock of the hair is bleached and combed back over the unbleached part.It has a strange and not unattractive effect . <p> About five oclock the streets are invaded by little black Wog boys with bundles of newspapers.They shriek , " Stahsn Straipes.Stahsn Straipes . " The Army newspaper is out again.This is the only news most of our men get.In fact , little news comes here.New York and London are much better informed than this station , which is fairly close to action.But it seems to be generally true that the closer to action you get , the more your interest in the over-all picture diminishes . <p> Soldiers here are not so much interested in the trend of war as the soldiers are in training camps at home.Here the qualities of the mess , the animosities with the sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world at war . <p> This is a mad , bright , dreamlike place.It is probable that our soldiers will remember it as a whirl of color and a polyglot babble.The heat makes your head a little vague , so that impressions run together and blot one another up.Outlines are hazy.It will be a curious memory when the soldiers try to sort it out to tell about after the war , and it will not be strange if they improvise a bit . <h> A WATCH CHISELER <p> A north african post ( Via London ) , August 31 , 1943It was well after midnight.The sergeant of MPs and his lieutenant drove in a jeep out of Sidi Belle Road from Oran.The sergeant had carved the handles of his gun from the Plexiglass from the nose of a bomber ad he had begun to carve figures in it during off times with his pocket knife.It was a soft African night with abundant stars.The lieutenant was quite young and sensible enough to depend a good deal on his sergeant.The jeep leaped and rattled over cobblestones . " Let 's go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sandwich , " the lieutenant said . " Turn around at the next corner . " <p> At that moment a weapons carrier came roaring in from the country , going nearly sixty miles an hour.It flashed by the jeep and turned the corner on two wheels . " Jeezus , " said the sergeant , " shall I go after him ? " <p> " Run him down , " said the lieutenant . <p> The sergeant wheeled the jeep around and put his foot to the floor.Around the corner he could see the tail lights in the distance and he seemed to gain on it rapidly.The weapons carrier was stopped , pulled up beside a field.The jeep skidded to a stop and the sergeant leaped out with the lieutenant after him . <p> Three men were sitting in the weapons carrier , three in the front seat.They were quite drunk.The sergeant flashed his light in the back.There were two empty wine bottles on the floor of the truck . " Get out , " said the sergeant.As the men got out he frisked each one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees.The three soldiers looked a little bedraggled . <p> " Who was driving that car ?

" The small fat soldier rushed the words out . <p> " Thatll be enough out of you , " the sergeant said . " You do n't  have to tell your friends the alibi.Where did you dump the stuff ? " <p> " What stuff , Sergeant ? I do n't  know what stuff you mean . " <p> " You know what I mean all right.Shall I take a look about , sir ?

" <p> " We ai n't  done anything wrong , Sarge.What you going to take us in for ? Guy named Willie just asked " <p> " Shut up and get in , " said the sergeant . <p> The three piled uncomfortably into the back seat of the jeep.The sergeant got behind the wheel and the lieutenant loosened his gun in its holster and sat on the little front seat with his body screwed around to face the three.Only the little man wanted to talk.The jeep rattled into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MP station , jumped up on the sidewalk , and parked bumper against the building.Inside , brilliant lights were blinding after the blacked-out streets.A sergeant and a first lieutenant sat behind a big , high desk and looked over at the three ranged in front of them . <p> " Take off your dog tags and put them up here , " said the sergeant . He began to make notes on a pad from the dog tags . " Put everything in your pockets in this box .

" Oh , you dirty bastards , " he said . <h> THE BONE YARD <p> A north african post ( Via London ) , September 5 , 1943On the edge of a North African city there is a huge used tank yard.It is n't only tanks , either.It is a giant bone yard , where wrecked tanks and trucks and artillery are brought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turrets and broken tracks , with engines gone to pieces.There are trucks that have fallen into shell holes.There are hundreds of wrecked motorcycles and many broken and burned-out pieces of artillery , the debris of months of bitter fighting in the desert . <p> On the edge of this great bone yard are the reconditioning yards and the rebuilding lines.Into the masses of wrecked equipment the Army inspectors go.They look over each piece of equipment and tag it . Perhaps this tank , with a German .88 hole drilled neatly through the turret , will go into the fight again with a turret from the one next to it , which has had the tracks shot from under it.Most of the tanks will run again , but those which are beyond repair will furnish thousands of spare parts to take care of the ones which are running.This plant is like the used-car lots in American cities , where you can , for a small price , buy the gear or wheel which keeps your car running . <p> The engines are removed from the wrecked trucks and put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linings of the motors rebored , with new rings , tested and ready to go finally into the paint room , where they are resprayed with green paint.Housings , gears , clutch plates are cleaned with steam , inspected , and placed in bins , ready to be drawn again as spare parts.One whole end of the yard is piled high with repaired tires.Hundreds of men work in this yard , putting the wrecked equipment back to work . <p> Here is an acre of injured small artillery , 20- and 37-mm.anti-tank guns.Some of them have been fired so long that their barrels have burned out.Some of them have only a burst tire or a bent trail.These are sorted and put ready for repair.The barrels are changed for new ones , and the old ones got to the scrap pile.For when everything usable has been made use of there is still a great pile of twisted steel which can be used as nothing but scrap metal.But the ships which bring supplies to the Army from home are going back.They take their holds full of this scrap to go into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting to see the same American who , a few months ago , was tinkering with engines in a small-town garage now tinkering with the engine of a General Grant tank.And the man has n't  changed a bit.He is still the intent man who is good with engines.He is n't even dressed very much differently , for the denim work clothes are very like the overalls he has been wearing for years.Beside these men work the French and the Arabs.They are learning from our men how to take care of the machinery that they may use.They learn quickly but without many words , for most of our men can not speak the language of the men who are helping them.It is training by sign language and it seems to work very well . <p> The wrecked equipment comes in in streams from the battlefields.Modern war is very hard on its tools.While in this war fewer men are killed , more equipment than ever is wrecked , for it seems almost to be weapon against weapon rather than man against man . <p> But there are many sad little evidences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splash of blood against the steel side of the turret.And in this burned-out tank a large piece of singed cloth and a charred and curled shoe.And the insides of a tank are full of evidences of the men who ran it , penciled notes written on the walls , a telephone number , a sketch of a profile on the steel armor plate.Probably every vehicle in the whole Army has a name , usually the name of a girl but sometimes a brave name like Hun Chaser.That one got badly hit.And there is a tank with no track and with the whole top of the turret shot away by a heavy shell , but on her skirt in front is still her name and she is called Lucky Girl.Every one of these vehicles lying in the wreck yard has some tremendous story , but in many of the cases the story died with the driver and the crew . <p> There are little tags tied to the barrels of the guns.One says : " The recoil slaps sideways . " I 'm scared of it . " And another says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " And in a little while these guns , refitted and painted , with their camouflage , will be back in the fight again . <p> There is hammering in the yard , and fizz of welders and hiss of steam pipes.The men are stripped to the waist , working under the hot African sun , their skins burned nearly black.The little cranes run excitedly about , carrying parts , stacking engines , tearing the hopeless jobs to pieces for their usable parts . <h> Part III:Italy <h> INVASION ( part 1 ) <p> Somewhere in the mediterranean theater , October 3 , 1943On the iron floors of the LCIs , which stands for Landing Craft Infantry , the men sit about and for a time they talk and laugh and make jokes to cover the great occasion.They try to reduce this great occasion to something normal , something ordinary , something they are used to.They rag one another , accuse one another of being scared , they repeat experiences of recent days , and then gradually silence creeps over them and they sit silently because the hugeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are green troops.They have been trained to a fine point , hardened and instructed , and they lack only one thing to make them soldiers , enemy fire , and they will never be soldiers until they have it.No one , least of all themselves , knows what they will do when the terrible thing happens.No man there knows whether he can take it , knows whether he will run away or stick , or lose his nerve and go to pieces , or will be a good soldier.There is no way of knowing and probably that one thing bothers you more than anything else . <p> And that is the difference between green troops and soldiers.Tomorrow at this time these men , those who are living , will be different.They will know then what they cant know tonight.They will know how they face fire.Actually there is little danger.They are going to be good soldiers , for they do not know that this is the night before the assault.There is no way for any man to know it . <p> In the moonlight on the iron deck they look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strange and every man is cut off from faces of their friends for the dead.Who will be alive tomorrow night ? I will , for one.No one ever gets killed in the war.Couldnt possibly.There would be no war if anyone got killed.But each man , in this last night in the moonlight , looks strangely at the others and sees death there.This is the most terrible time of all.This night before the assault by the new green troops.They will never be like this again . <p> Every man builds in his mind what it will be like , but it is never what he thought it would be.When he designs the assault in his mind he is alone and cut off from everyone.He is alone in the moonlight and the crowded men about him are strangers in this time.It will not be like this.The fire and the movement and the exertion will make him a part of these strangers sitting about him , and they will be a part of him , but he does not know that now.This is a bad time , never to be repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible , and it is no contradiction that every one of them is to be killed.Every one is in a way dead already.And nearly every man has written his letter and left it somewhere to be posted if he is killed.The letters , some misspelled , some illiterate , some polished and full of attitudes , and some meager and tight.All say the same thing.They all say : " I wish I had told you , and I never did , I never could.Some obscure and impish thing kept me from ever telling you , and only now , when it is too late , can I tell you.Ive thought these things , " the letters say , " but when I started to speak something cut me off.Now I can say it , but do n't  let it be a burden on you.I just know that it was always so , only I did n't  say it . " In every letter that is the message.The piled-up reticences go down in the last letters.The letters to wives , and mothers , and sisters , and fathers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone , letters sometimes to comparative strangers . <p> The great ships move through the night though they are covered now , and the engines make no noise.Orders are given in soft voices and the conversation is quiet.Somewhere up ahead the enemy is waiting and he is silent too.Does he know we are coming , and does he know when and in what number ? Is he lying low with his machine guns ready and his mortars set on the beaches , and his artillery in the hills ? What is he thinking now ? Is he afraid or confident ? <p> The officers know H-hour now.The moon is going down.H-hour is 3:30 , just after the moon has set and the shore is black.The convoy is to moonward of the shore.Perhaps with glasses the enemy can see the convoy against the setting moon , but ahead where we are going there is only a misty pearl-like grayness.The moon goes down into the ocean and ships that have been beside you and all around you disappear into the blackness and only the tiny shielded position-lights show where they are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness and the silence , and one man begins to whistle softly just to be sure he is there . <h> INVASION ( part 2 ) <p> Somewhere in the mediterranean theater , October 3 , 1943There is a good beach at Salerno , and a very good landing at Red Beach No. 2 . The ducks were coming loaded ashore and running up out of the water and joining the lines of trucks , and the pontoon piers were out in the water with large landing cars up against them.Along the beach the bulldozers were at work pushing up sand ramps for the trucks to land on and just back of the beach were the white tapes that mean land mines have not been cleared out . <p> There are little bushes on the sand dunes at Red Beach , south of the Sele River , and in a hole in the sand buttressed by sandbags a soldier sat with a leather-covered steel telephone beside him.His shirt was off and his back was dark with sunburn.His helmet lay in the bottom of the hole and his rifle was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.He had staked a shelter half on a pole to shade him from the sun , and he had spread bushes on top of that to camouflage it.Beside him was a water can and an empty C-ration can to drink out of . <p> The soldier said , " Sure you can have a drink.Here , I 'll pour it for you . " He tilted the water can over the tin cup . " I hate to tell you what it tastes like , " he said . <p> I took a drink . " Well , does n't  it ? " he said . <p> " It sure does , " I said . <p> Up in the hills the .88s were popping and the little bursts threw sand about.His face was streaked where the sweat had run down through the dirt , and his hair and his eyebrows were sunburned almost white.But there was a kind of gaiety about him.His telephone buzzed and he answered it and said , " Has n't  come through yet , sir , no sir I 'll tell him . " He clicked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked.And then , without waiting for an answer , he went on . " I came in just before dawn yesterday.I was n't with the very first , but right in the second . " He seemed to be very glad about it . " It was hell , " he said , " it was bloody hell . " He seemed to be gratified at the hell it was , and that was right.The great question had been solved for him.He had been under fire.He knew now what he would do under fire.He would never have to go through that uncertainty again . " I got pretty near up to there , " he said , and pointed to two beautiful Greek temples about a mile away . " And then I got sent back here for beach communications.When did you say you got ashore ? " And again he did n't  wait for an answer . <p> " It was dark as hell , " he said , " and we were just waiting out there . " He pointed to the sea where the mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sneak ashore we were nuts , " he said . " They were waiting for us.They knew just where we were going to land.They had machine guns in the sand dunes and .88s on the hills . <p> " We were out there all packed in an LCI , and then all hell broke loose.The sky was full of it and the star shells lighted it up and the tracers crisscrossed and the noisewe saw the assault go in , and then one of them hit a surf mine and went up , and in the light you could see them go flying about.I could see the boats land and the guys go wiggling and running , and then maybe thered be a lot of white lines and some of them would waddle about and collapse and some would hit the beach . <p> " It did n't  seem like men getting killed , more like a picture , like a moving picture.We were pretty crowded up in there , though , and then all of a sudden it came on me that this was n't a moving picture.Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I got kind of scared , but what I wanted to do mostly was move around.I did n't  like being cooped up there where you could n't get away or get down close to the ground . <p> " Well , the firing would stop and then it would get pitch black even then , and it was just beginning to get light too , but the .88s sort of winked on the hills like messages , and the shells were bursting all around us.They had lots of .88s and they shot at everything.I was just getting real scared when we got the order to move in , and I swear that is the longest trip I ever took , that mile to the beach.I thought wed never get there.I figured that if I was only on the beach I could dig down and get out of the way.There was too damned many of us there in that LCI.I wanted to spread out.That one that hit the mine was still burning when we went on by it.Then we bumped the beach and the ramps went down and I hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute I was on the beach I felt better.It did n't  seem like everybody was shooting at me and I got up to that line of brush and flopped down and some other guys flopped down beside me and then we got feeling a little foolish.We stood up and moved on.Didnt say anything to each other , we just moved on.It was coming daylight then and the flashes of the guns werent so bright.I felt a little like I was drunk.The ground heaved around under my feet and I was dull.I guess that was because of the firing.My ears are n't  so good yet.I guess we moved up too far because I got sent back here . " He laughed openly . " I might have gone on right into Rome if someone had n't  sent me back.I guess I might have walked right up that hill there . " <p> The cruisers began firing on the hill and the .88s fired back.From over near the hill came the heavy thudding of .50-caliber machine guns.The soldier felt pretty good.He knew what he could do now.He said , " When did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part 3 ) <p> Mediterranean theater , October 6 , 1943You cant see much of a battle.Those paintings reproduced in history books which show long lines of advancing troops are either idealized or else times and battles have changed.The account in the morning papers of the battle of yesterday was not seen by the correspondent , but was put together from reports . <p> What the correspondent really saw was dust and the nasty burst of shells , low bushes and slit trenches.He lay on his stomach , if he had any sense , and watched ants crawling among the little sticks on the sand dune , and his nose was so close to the ants that their progress was interfered with by it . <p> Then he saw an advance.Not straight lines of men marching into cannon fire , but little groups scuttling like crabs from bits of cover to other cover , while the high chatter of machine guns sounded , and the deep proom of shellfire . <p> Perhaps the correspondent scuttled with them and hit the ground again.His report will be of battle plan and tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counterattack.But these are some of the things he probably really saw : <p> He might have seen the splash of dirt and dust that is a shell burst , and a small Italian girl in the street with her stomach blown out , and he might have seen an American soldier standing over a twitching body , crying.He probably saw many dead mules , lying on their sides , reduced to pulp.He saw the wreckage of houses , with torn beds hanging like shreds out of the spilled hole in a plaster wall.There were red carts and the stalled vehicles of refugees who did not get away . <p> The stretcher-bearers come back from the lines , walking in off step , so that the burden will not be jounced too much , and the blood dripping from the canvas , brother and enemy in the stretchers , so long as they are hurt.And the walking wounded coming back with shattered arms and bandaged heads , the walking wounded struggling painfully to the rear . <p> He would have smelled the sharp cordite in the air and the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of dust will be in his nose and the stench of men and animals killed yesterday and the day before.Then a whole building is blown up and an earthy , sour smell comes from its walls.He will smell his own sweat and the accumulated sweat of an army.When his throat is dry he will drink the warm water from his canteen , which tastes of disinfectant . <p> While the correspondent is writing for you of advances and retreats , his skin will be raw from the woolen clothes he has not taken off for three days , and his feet will be hot and dirty and swollen from not having taken off his shoes for days.He will itch from last nights mosquito bites and from todays sand-fly bites.Perhaps he will have a little sand-fly fever , so that his head pulses and a red rim comes into his vision.His head may ache from the heat and his eyes burn with the dust.The knee that was sprained when he leaped ashore will grow stiff and painful , but it is no wound and can not be treated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will write , while the lines of trucks churn the road to deep dust and truck drivers hunch over their wheels.And off to the right the burial squads are scooping slits in the sandy earth.Their charges lie huddled on the ground and before they are laid in the sand , the second of the two dog tags is detached so that you know that that man with that Army serial number is dead and out of it . <p> These are the things he sees while he writes of tactics and strategy and names generals and in print decorates heroes.He takes a heavily waxed box from his pocket.That is his dinner.Inside there are two little packets of hard cake which have the flavor of dog biscuits.There is a tin can of cheese and a roll of vitamin-charged candy , an envelope of lemon powder to make the canteen water taste less bad , and a tiny package of four cigarettes . <p> That is dinner , and it will keep him moving for several more hours and keep his stomach working and his heart pumping.And if the line has advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sidle up to him , cringing and sniffling , their noses ringed with flies , and these children will whine for one of the hard biscuits and some of the vitamin candy.They will cry for candy : " **28;59;TOOLONG , okay , shank you , good-by . " And if he gives the candy to one , the ground will spew up more dirty , buglike children , and they will scream shrilly , " Caramelacaramela . " The correspondent will get the communiquT and will write your morning dispatch on his creaking , dust-filled portable : " General Clarks 5th Army advanced two kilometers against heavy artillery fire yesterday . <h> WELCOME <p> Somewhere in the mediterranean war theater , October 14 , 1943The Italian people may greet conquering American and British troops with different methods in different parts of the country , but they act always with enthusiasm that amounts to violence.One of their methods makes soldiers a little self-conscious until they get used to it.Great crowds of people stand on the sidewalks as the troops march by and simply applaud by clapping their hands as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling self-consciously , half soldiers and half actors . <p> But this hand-clapping is the most restrained thing that they do.The soldiers get most embarrassed when they are overwhelmed by Italian men who rush up to them , overpower them with embraces , and plant great wet kisses on their cheeks , crying a little as they do it.A soldier hates to push them away , but he is not used to being kissed by men , and all he can do is to blush and try to get away as quick as possible . <p> A third method of showing enthusiasm at being conquered is to throw any fruit or vegetable which happens to be in season at the occupying troops.In Sicily the grapes were ripe and many a soldier got a swipe across the face with a heavy bunch of grapes tossed with the best will in the world . <p> The juice ran down inside their shirts , and after a march of a few blocks troops would be pretty well drenched in grape juice , which , incidentally , draws flies badly , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making them not throw grapes . <p> One of the most ridiculous and most dangerous occupations , however , was the investment and capture of the island of Ischia.There the people , casting about for some vegetable or floral tribute , found that the most prominent and showy flower of the season was the pink amaryllis.This is not a pleasant flower at the best , but in the hands of an enthusiastic Italian crowd it can almost be a lethal weapon . <p> A reasonable-sized bunch of amaryllis , with big , thick stems , may weigh four pounds.In a short drive through the streets of the city of Ischia , some of the troops were nearly beaten to death with flowers , while one naval officer was knocked clear out of a car by a well-aimed bouquet of these terrible flowers.His friends proposed him for a Purple Heart , and wrote a report on his bravery in action . " Under a deadly hail of amaryllis , " the report said , " Lieutenant Commander So-and-So fought his way through the street , although badly wounded by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed by an opponent armed with amaryllis . <p> The pressures on the Italians must have been enormous.They seem to go to pieces emotionally when the war is really and truly over for them.Groups of them simply stand and crymen , women , and children.They want desperately to do something for the troops and they have n't much to work with.Bottles of wine , flowers , any kind of little gift.They rush to the churches and pray , and then , being afraid to miss something , they rush back to watch more troops.The Italian soldiers in Italy respond instantly to an order to deliver their arms.They pile their rifles up in the streets so quickly that you have the idea they are greatly relieved to get the damned things out of their hands once and for all . <p> But whatever may have been true about the Fascist government , it is instantly obvious that the Italian little people were never our enemies.Whole towns could not put on such acts if they did not mean it.But in nearly every community you will find a fat and sleek man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wears the silver dagger with the gold tip on the scabbard , which indicates that he was one who marched on Rome with Mussolini . <p> In a country which has been hungry this man is well fed and beautifully dressed.He has been living on these people since Fascism came here , and he has not done badly for himself.On the surrender of a community he is usually the first to offer to help in the government.He will do anything to help if only he can just keep his graft and his power . <p> It is to be hoped that he is never permitted either to help or to stay in his position.Indeed , our commanders are usually visited by committees of townspeople and farmers who ask that the local Fascist be removed and kept under wraps . <p> They know that if he ever gets power again he will avenge himself on them.They hate him and want to be rid of him.And if you ask if they were Fascists , most Italians will reply , " Sure , you were a Fascist or you did n't  get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family starved . " And whether or not this is true , they seem to believe it thoroughly . <p> As the conquest goes on up the length of Italy , the crops are going to change.Some soldiers are already feeling an apprehension for the cabbage districts and the potato harvest , if they too are used as thrown tokens of love and admiration .

Ive been tagged by Sarah Glass and Carol Howard-Merritt ( whose blogs are both phenomenal and well worth visiting ) in this meme started by Bruce Reyes-Chow , the Barack Obama of the Presbyterian world , and hopefully the next moderator ( which is kind of like a cross between the Queen of England and the Ambassador to the Middle East ) of the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) . <p> What is your earliest memory of being distinctly Presbyterian ? It was last summer , actually at least seven years *after* I actually joined a presbyterian church , and two years *after* I decided to go to seminary and pursue ordination in the PCUSA : I was at the Presbyterian Evangelism Conference in Nashville , and I bought a baseball cap with the PC(USA) logo embossed on it . Branding is a big part of our culture , is n't it ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On what issue/question should the PC(USA) spend LESS energy and time ? I 'm going to have to second Ryan on this one and say the ordination process . Yes , its probably because I 'm going through it right now , but geez 500 questions about my finances , my eating habits , my sex life , my parents , my bowel movements , all so I can pass a psychological evaluation that qualifies me to INQUIRE about going into ordained ministry ? ? ? ? WTFWJD ? ? ? Probably not pursue ordination in the PC(USA) , I 'm guessing <p> On what issue/question should the PC(USA) spend MORE energy and time ? How about considering ways to start and support intentional communities ? I think Rick Ufford-Chase is doing something with this , and I 'm hugely inspired by Shane Claibornes urban monasticism . <p> If you could have the PC(USA) focus on one passage of scripture for a entire year , what would it be ? I could sit and think of a few , but nothing I could come up with could possibly top Sarahs suggestion of Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just jump on that bandwagon . <p> If the PC(USA) were an animal what would it be and why ? A turtle . The Presbyterian Church is slow to change directions , but its steady and persistent once it does . It has a tough shell that can withstand great pressure , but sometimes we withdraw into it a bit much . Actually , maybe the PCUSA is kind of like Molly , my pet turtle . She only has three legs , so she goes in circles a lot . But I still love her tremendously . Turtles are also a pretty humble sort , and I think Presbyterians have that capacity . And at least in cartoon stereotypes , the turtle is always the nerdy , geekish creature definitely Presbyterian . <p> Extra Credit : Jesus shows up at General Assembly this year , what does he say to the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) ? Once again forgoing originality ( because its highly overrated ) , I 'm going to have to echo Carol here and say that Jesus always confounds me too , so I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that turned our pre-conceived notions and policies completely upside down , and it would probably be completely misunderstood by most . In fact , I think after hearing from Jesus ( would we even recognize him ? ) , we 'd probably move to strip him of his credentials and have him escorted from the building . Heres hoping that some would have the grace and humility to lay down our denominational priorities , and follow him out into the world . <p> One more thing : As fast ( and fun ) as this thing is spreading across the world of Presbyterian bloggers , I 'm thinkin the guy who started it must be pretty visionary , pretty good at " starting things " and pretty in tune with presbyterian culture and the larger culture were part of .

@@89755409 @5255409/ <p> The wind blew fierce and strong , and it pelted them with bits of sticks , sand , and little rocks . Juana and Kino gathered their clothing tighter about them and covered their noses and went out into the world . The sky was brushed clean by the wind and the stars were cold in a black sky . The two walked carefully , and they avoided the center of the town where some sleeper in a doorway might see them pass . For the town closed itself in against the night , and anyone who moved about in the darkness would be noticeable . Kino threaded his way around the edge of the city and turned north , north by the stars , and found the rutted sandy road that led through the brushy country toward Loreto where the miraculous Virgin has her station . <p> Kino could feel the blown sand against his ankles and he was glad , for he knew there would be no tracks . The little light from the stars made out for him the narrow road through the brushy country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet behind him . He went quickly and quietly , and Juana trotted behind him to keep up . <p> Some ancient thing stirred in Kino . Through his fear of dark and the devils that haunt the night , there came a rush of exhilaration ; some animal thing was moving in him so that he was cautious and wary and dangerous ; some ancient thing out of the past of his people was alive in him . The wind was at his back and the stars guided him . The wind cried and whisked in the brush , and the family went on monotonously , hour after hour . They passed no one and saw no one . At last , to their right , the waning moon arose , and when it came up the wind died down , and the land was still . <p> Now they could see the little road ahead of them , deep cut with sand- drifted wheel tracks . With the wind gone there would be footprints , but they were a good distance from the town and perhaps their tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel rut , and Juana followed in his path . One big cart , going to the town in the morning , could wipe out every trace of their passage . <p> All night they walked and never changed their pace . Once Coyotito awakened , and Juana shifted him in front of her and soothed him until he went to sleep again . And the evils of the night were about them . The coyotes cried and laughed in the brush , and the owls screeched and hissed over their heads . And once some large animal lumbered away , crackling the undergrowth as it went . And Kino gripped the handle of the big working knife and took a sense of protection from it . <p> The music of the pearl was triumphant in Kino 's head , and the quiet melody of the family underlay it , and they wove themselves into the soft padding of sandaled feet in the dust . All night they walked , and in the first dawn Kino searched the roadside for a covert to lie in during the day . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing where deer might have lain , and it was curtained thickly with the dry brittle trees that lined the road . And when Juana had seated herself and had settled to nurse the baby , Kino went back to the road . He broke a branch and carefully swept the footprints where they had turned from the roadway . And then , in the first light , he heard the creak of a wagon , and he crouched beside the road and watched a heavy two-wheeled cart go by , drawn by slouching oxen . And when it had passed out of sight , he went back to the roadway and looked at the rut and found that the footprints were gone . And again he swept out his traces and went back to Juana . <p> She gave him the soft corncakes Apolonia had packed for them , and after a while she slept a little . But Kino sat on the ground and stared at the earth in front of him . He watched the ants moving , a little column of them near to his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the column climbed over his instep and continued on its way , and Kino left his foot there and watched them move over it . <p> The sun arose hotly . They were not near the Gulf now , and the air was dry and hot so that the brush cricked with heat and a good resinous smell came from it . And when Juana awakened , when the sun was high , Kino told her things she knew already . <p> " Beware of that kind of tree there , " he said , pointing . " Do not touch it , for if you do and then touch your eyes , it will blind you . And beware of the tree that bleeds . See , that one over there . For if you break it the red blood will flow from it , and it is evil luck . " And she nodded and smiled a little at him , for she knew these things . <p> " Will they follow us ? " she asked . " Do you think they will try to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Kino . " Whoever finds us will take the pearl . Oh , they will try . " <p> And Juana said , " Perhaps the dealers were right and the pearl has no value . Perhaps this has all been an illusion . " <p> Kino reached into his clothes and brought out the pearl . He let the sun play on it until it burned in his eyes . " No , " he said , " they would not have tried to steal it if it had been valueless . " <p> " Do you know who attacked you ? Was it the dealers ? " <p> " I do not know , " he said . " I did n't see them . " <p> He looked into his pearl to find his vision . " When we sell it at last , I will have a rifle , " he said , and he looked into the shining surface for his rifle , but he saw only a huddled dark body on the ground with shining blood dripping from its throat . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great church . " And in the pearl he saw Juana with her beaten face crawling home through the night . " Our son must learn to read , " he said frantically . And there in the pearl Coyotito 's face , thick and feverish from the medicine . <p> And Kino thrust the pearl back into his clothing , and the music of the pearl had become sinister in his ears , and it was interwoven with the music of evil . <p> The hot sun beat on the earth so that Kino and Juana moved into the lacy shade of the brush , and small gray birds scampered on the ground in the shade . In the heat of the day Kino relaxed and covered his eyes with his hat and wrapped his blanket about his face to keep the flies off , and he slept . <p> But Juana did not sleep . She sat quiet as a stone and her face was quiet . Her mouth was still swollen where Kino had struck her , and big flies buzzed around the cut on her chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Coyotito awakened she placed him on the ground in front of her and watched him wave his arms and kick his feet , and he smiled and gurgled at her until she smiled too . She picked up a little twig from the ground and tickled him , and she gave him water from the gourd she carried in her bundle . <p> Kino stirred in a dream , and he cried out in a guttural voice , and his hand moved in symbolic fighting . And then he moaned and sat up suddenly , his eyes wide and his nostrils flaring . He listened and heard only the cricking heat and the hiss of distance . <p> " What is it ? " Juana asked . <p> " Hush , " he said . <p> " You were dreaming . " <p> " Perhaps . " But he was restless , and when she gave him a corncake from her store he paused in his chewing to listen . He was uneasy and nervous ; he glanced over his shoulder ; he lifted the big knife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kino said , " Keep him quiet . " <p> " What is the matter ? " Juana asked . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> He listened again , an animal light in his eyes . He stood up then , silently ; and crouched low , he threaded his way through the brush toward the road . But he did not step into the road ; he crept into the cover of a thorny tree and peered out along the way he had come . And then he saw them moving along . His body stiffened and he drew down his head and peeked out from under a fallen branch . In the distance he could see three figures , two on foot and one on horseback . But he knew what they were , and a chill of fear went through him . Even in the distance he could see the two on foot moving slowly along , bent low to the ground . Here , one would pause and look at the earth , while the other joined him . They were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn sheep in the stone mountains . They were as sensitive as hounds . Here , he and Juana might have stepped out of the wheel rut , and these people from the inland , these hunters , could follow , could read a broken straw or a little tumbled pile of dust . Behind them , on a horse , was a dark man , his nose covered with a blanket , and across his saddle a rifle gleamed in the sun . <p> Kino lay as rigid as the tree limb . He barely breathed , and his eyes went to the place where he had swept out the track . Even the sweeping might be a message to the trackers . He knew these inland hunters . In a country where there was little game they managed to live because of their ability to hunt , and they were hunting him . They scuttled over the ground like animals and found a sign and crouched over it while the horseman waited . <p> The trackers whined a little , like excited dogs on a warming trail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it ready . He knew what he must do . If the trackers found the swept place , he must leap for the horseman , kill him quickly and take the rifle . That was his only chance in the world . And as the three drew nearer on the road , Kino dug little pits with his sandaled toes so that he could leap without warning , so that his feet would not slip . He had only a little vision under the fallen limb . <p> Now Juana , back in her hidden place , heard the pad of the horse 's hoofs , and Coyotito gurgled . She took him up quickly and put him under her shawl and gave him her breast and he was silent . <p> When the trackers came near , Kino could see only their legs and only the legs of the horse from under the fallen branch . He saw the dark horny feet of the men and their ragged white clothes , and he heard the creak of leather of the saddle and the clink of spurs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the horseman stopped . The horse flung his head up against the bit and the bit-roller clicked under his tongue and the horse snorted . Then the dark trackers turned and studied the horse and watched his ears . <p> Kino was not breathing , but his back arched a little and the muscles of his arms and legs stood out with tension and a line of sweat formed on his upper lip . For a long moment the trackers bent over the road , and then they moved on slowly , studying the ground ahead of them , and the horseman moved after them . The trackers scuttled along , stopping , looking , and hurrying on . They would be back , Kino knew . They would be circling and searching , peeping , stopping , and they would come back sooner or later to his covered track . <p> He slid backward and did not bother to cover his tracks . He could not ; too many little signs were there , too many broken twigs and scuffed places and displaced stones . And there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trackers would find his trail , he knew it . There was no escape , except in flight . He edged away from the road and went quickly and silently to the hidden place where Juana was . She looked up at him in question . <p> " Trackers , " he said . " Come ! " <p> And then a helplessness and a hopelessness swept over him , and his face went black and his eyes were sad . " Perhaps I should let them take me . " Instantly Juana was on her feet and her hand lay on his arm . " You have the pearl , " she cried hoarsely . " Do you think they would take you back alive to say they had stolen it ? " <p> His hand strayed limply to the place where the pearl was hidden under his clothes . " They will find it , " he said weakly . <p> " Come , " she said . " Come ! " <p> And when he did not respond . " Do you think they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little one here live ? " <p> Her goading struck into his brain ; his lips snarled and his eyes were fierce again . " Come , " he said . " We will go into the mountains . Maybe we can lose them in the mountains . " <p> Frantically he gathered the gourds and the little bags that were their property . Kino carried a bundle in his left hand , but the big knife swung free in his right hand . He parted the brush for Juana and they hurried to the west , toward the high stone mountains . They trotted quickly through the tangle of the undergrowth . This was panic flight . Kino did not try to conceal his passage he trotted , kicking the stones , knocking the telltale leaves from the little trees . The high sun streamed down on the dry creaking earth so that even the vegetation ticked in protest . But ahead were the naked granite mountains , rising out of erosion rubble and standing monolithic against the sky . And Kino ran for the high place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This land was waterless , furred with the cacti which could store water and with the great-rooted brush which could reach deep into the earth for a little moisture and get along on very little . And underfoot was not soil but broken rock , split into small cubes , great slabs , but none of it water-rounded . Little tufts of sad dry grass grew between the stones , grass that had sprouted with one single rain and headed , dropped its seed , and died . Horned toads watched the family go by and turned their little pivoting dragon heads . And now and then a great jackrabbit , disturbed in his shade , bumped away and hid behind the nearest rock . The singing heat lay over this desert country , and ahead the stone mountains looked cool and welcoming . <p> And Kino fled . He knew what would happen . A little way along the road the trackers would become aware that they had missed the path , and they would come back , searching and judging , and in a little while they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From there it would be easy for them- these little stones , the fallen leaves and the whipped branches , the scuffed places where a foot had slipped . Kino could see them in his mind , slipping along the track , whining a little with eagerness , and behind them , dark and half disinterested , the horseman with the rifle . His work would come last , for he would not take them back . Oh , the music of evil sang loud in Kino 's head now , it sang with the whine of heat and with the dry ringing of snake rattles . It was not large and overwhelming now , but secret and poisonous , and the pounding of his heart gave it undertone and rhythm . <p> The way began to rise , and as it did the rocks grew larger . But now Kino had put a little distance between his family and the trackers . Now , on the first rise , he rested . He climbed a great boulder and looked back over the shimmering country , but he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the brush . Juana had squatted in the shade of the boulder . She raised her bottle of water to Coyotito 's lips ; his little dried tongue sucked greedily at it . She looked up at Kino when he came back ; she saw him examine her ankles , cut and scratched from the stones and brush , and she covered them quickly with her skirt . Then she handed the bottle to him , but he shook his head . Her eyes were bright in her tired face . Kino moistened his cracked lips with his tongue . <p> " Juana , " he said , " I will go on and you will hide . I will lead them into the mountains , and when they have gone past , you will go north to Loreto or to Santa Rosalia . Then , if I can escape them , I will come to you . It is the only safe way . " <p> She looked full into his eyes for a moment . " No , " she said . " We go with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said harshly . " You will put the little one in more danger if you go with me . " <p> " No , " said Juana . <p> " You must . It is the wise thing and it is my wish , " he said . <p> " No , " said Juana . <p> He looked then for weakness in her face , for fear or irresolution , and there was none . Her eyes were very bright . He shrugged his shoulders helplessly then , but he had taken strength from her . When they moved on it was no longer panic flight . <p> The country , as it rose toward the mountains , changed rapidly . Now there were long outcroppings of granite with deep crevices between , and Kino walked on bare unmarkable stone when he could and leaped from ledge to ledge . He knew that wherever the trackers lost his path they must circle and lose time before they found it again . And so he did not go straight for the mountains any more ; he moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left a sign and then went toward the mountains over bare stone again . And the path rose steeply now , so that he panted a little as he went . <p> The sun moved downward toward the bare stone teeth of the mountains , and Kino set his direction for a dark and shadowy cleft in the range . If there were any water at all , it would be there where he could see , even in the distance , a hint of foliage . And if there were any passage through the smooth stone range , it would be by this same deep cleft . It had its danger , for the trackers would think of it too , but the empty water bottle did not let that consideration enter . And as the sun lowered , Kino and Juana struggled wearily up the steep slope toward the cleft . <p> High in the gray stone mountains , under a frowning peak , a little spring bubbled out of a rupture in the stone . It was fed by shade- preserved snow in the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dry algae were on its bottom . But nearly always it gushed out , cold and clean and lovely . In the times when the quick rains fell , it might become a freshet and send its column of white water crashing down the mountain cleft , but nearly always it was a lean little spring . It bubbled out into a pool and then fell a hundred feet to another pool , and this one , overflowing , dropped again , so that it continued , down and down , until it came to the rubble of the upland , and there it disappeared altogether . There was n't much left of it then anyway , for every time it fell over an escarpment the thirsty air drank it , and it splashed from the pools to the dry vegetation . The animals from miles around came to drink from the little pools , and the wild sheep and the deer , the pumas and raccoons , and the mice- all came to drink . And the birds which spent the day in the brushland came at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain cleft . Beside this tiny stream , wherever enough earth collected for root-hold , colonies of plants grew , wild grape and little palms , maidenhair fern , hibiscus , and tall pampas grass with feathery rods raised above the spike leaves . And in the pool lived frogs and water-skaters , and waterworms crawled on the bottom of the pool . Everything that loved water came to these few shallow places . The cats took their prey there , and strewed feathers and lapped water through their bloody teeth . The little pools were places of life because of the water , and places of killing because of the water , too . <p> The lowest step , where the stream collected before it tumbled down a hundred feet and disappeared into the rubbly desert , was a little platform of stone and sand . Only a pencil of water fell into the pool , but it was enough to keep the pool full and to keep the ferns green in the underhang of the cliff , and wild grape climbed the stone mountain and all manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small sandy beach through which the pool flowed , and bright green watercress grew in the damp sand . The beach was cut and scarred and padded by the feet of animals that had come to drink and to hunt . The sun had passed over the stone mountains when Kino and Juana struggled up the steep broken slope and came at last to the water . From this step they could look out over the sunbeaten desert to the blue Gulf in the distance . They came utterly weary to the pool , and Juana slumped to her knees and first washed Coyotito 's face and then filled her bottle and gave him a drink . And the baby was weary and petulant , and he cried softly until Juana gave him her breast , and then he gurgled and clucked against her . Kino drank long and thirstily at the pool . For a moment , then , he stretched out beside the water and relaxed all his muscles and watched Juana feeding the baby , and then he got to his feet and went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he searched the distance carefully . His eyes set on a point and he became rigid . Far down the slope he could see the two trackers ; they were little more than dots or scurrying ants and behind them a larger ant . <p> Juana had turned to look at him and she saw his back stiffen . <p> " How far ? " she asked quietly . <p> " They will be here by evening , " said Kino . He looked up the long steep chimney of the cleft where the water came down . " We must go west , " he said , and his eyes searched the stone shoulder behind the cleft . And thirty feet up on the gray shoulder he saw a series of little erosion caves . He slipped off his sandals and clambered up to them , gripping the bare stone with his toes , and he looked into the shallow caves . They were only a few feet deep , wind-hollowed scoops , but they sloped slightly downward and back . Kino crawled into the largest one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the outside . Quickly he went back to Juana . <p> " You must go up there . Perhaps they will not find us there , " he said . Without question she filled her water bottle to the top , and then Kino helped her up to the shallow cave and brought up the packages of food and passed them to her . And Juana sat in the cave entrance and watched him . She saw that he did not try to erase their tracks in the sand . <p> Instead , he climbed up the brush cliff beside the water , clawing and tearing at the ferns and wild grape as he went . And when he had climbed a hundred feet to the next bench , he came down again . He looked carefully at the smooth rock shoulder toward the cave to see that there was no trace of passage , and last he climbed up and crept into the cave beside Juana . <p> " When they go up , " he said , " we will slip away , down to the lowlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . You must see that he does not cry . " <p> " He will not cry , " she said , and she raised the baby 's face to her own and looked into his eyes and he stared solemnly back at her . <p> " He knows , " said Juana . <p> Now Kino lay in the cave entrance , his chin braced on his crossed arms , and he watched the blue shadow of the mountain move out across the brushy desert below until it reached the Gulf , and the long twilight of the shadow was over the land . <p> The trackers were long in coming , as though they had trouble with the trail Kino had left . It was dusk when they came at last to the little pool . And all three were on foot now , for a horse could not climb the last steep slope . From above they were thin figures in the evening . The two trackers scurried about on the little beach , and they saw Kino 's progress up the cliff before they drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and the trackers squatted near him , and in the evening the points of their cigarettes glowed and receded . And then Kino could see that they were eating , and the soft murmur of their voices came to him . <p> Then darkness fell , deep and black in the mountain cleft . The animals that used the pool came near and smelled men there and drifted away again into the darkness . <p> He heard a murmur behind him . Juana was whispering , " Coyotito . " She was begging him to be quiet . Kino heard the baby whimper , and he knew from the muffled sounds that Juana had covered his head with her shawl . <p> Down on the beach a match flared , and in its momentary light Kino saw that two of the men were sleeping , curled up like dogs , while the third watched , and he saw the glint of the rifle in the match light . And then the match died , but it left a picture on Kino 's eyes . He could see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and the third squatting in the sand with the rifle between his knees . <p> Kino moved silently back into the cave . Juana 's eyes were two sparks reflecting a low star . Kino crawled quietly close to her and he put his lips near to her cheek . <p> " There is a way , " he said . <p> " But they will kill you . " <p> " If I get first to the one with the rifle , " Kino said , " I must get to him first , then I will be all right . Two are sleeping . " <p> Her hand crept out from under her shawl and gripped his arm . " They will see your white clothes in the starlight . " <p> " No , " he said . " And I must go before moonrise . " <p> He searched for a soft word and then gave it up . " If they kill me , " he said , " lie quietly . And when they are gone away , go to Loreto . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " There is no choice , " he said . " It is the only way . They will find us in the morning . " <p> Her voice trembled a little . " Go with God , " she said . <p> He peered closely at her and he could see her large eyes . His hand fumbled out and found the baby , and for a moment his palm lay on Coyotito 's head . And then Kino raised his hand and touched Juana 's cheek , and she held her breath . <p> Against the sky in the cave entrance Juana could see that Kino was taking off his white clothes , for dirty and ragged though they were they would show up against the dark night . His own brown skin was a better protection for him . And then she saw how he hooked his amulet neck-string about the horn handle of his great knife , so that it hung down in front of him and left both hands free . He did not come back to her . For a moment his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent , and then he was gone . <p> Juana moved to the entrance and looked out . She peered like an owl from the hole in the mountain , and the baby slept under the blanket on her back , his face turned sideways against her neck and shoulder . She could feel his warm breath against her skin , and Juana whispered her combination of prayer and magic , her Hail Marys and her ancient intercession , against the black unhuman things . <p> The night seemed a little less dark when she looked out , and to the east there was a lightening in the sky , down near the horizon where the moon would show . And , looking down , she could see the cigarette of the man on watch . <p> Kino edged like a slow lizard down the smooth rock shoulder . He had turned his neck-string so that the great knife hung down from his back and could not clash against the stone . His spread fingers gripped the mountain , and his bare toes found support through contact , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not slip . For any sound , a rolling pebble or a sigh , a little slip of flesh on rock , would rouse the watchers below . Any sound that was not germane to the night would make them alert . But the night was not silent ; the little tree frogs that lived near the stream twittered like birds , and the high metallic ringing of the cicadas filled the mountain cleft . And Kino 's own music was in his head , the music of the enemy , low and pulsing , nearly asleep . But the Song of the Family had become as fierce and sharp and feline as the snarl of a female puma . The family song was alive now and driving him down on the dark enemy . The harsh cicada seemed to take up its melody , and the twittering tree frogs called little phrases of it . <p> And Kino crept silently as a shadow down the smooth mountain face . One bare foot moved a few inches and the toes touched the stone and gripped , and the other foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand a little downward , and then the other hand , until the whole body , without seeming to move , had moved . Kino 's mouth was open so that even his breath would make no sound , for he knew that he was not invisible . If the watcher , sensing movement , looked at the dark place against the stone which was his body , he could see him . Kino must move so slowly he would not draw the watcher 's eyes . It took him a long time to reach the bottom and to crouch behind a little dwarf palm . His heart thundered in his chest and his hands and face were wet with sweat . He crouched and took great slow long breaths to calm himself . <p> Only twenty feet separated him from the enemy now , and he tried to remember the ground between . Was there any stone which might trip him in his rush ? He kneaded his legs against cramp and found that his muscles were jerking after their long tension . And then he looked apprehensively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments now , and he must attack before it rose . He could see the outline of the watcher , but the sleeping men were below his vision . It was the watcher Kino must find- must find quickly and without hesitation . Silently he drew the amulet string over his shoulder and loosened the loop from the horn handle of his great knife . <p> He was too late , for as he rose from his crouch the silver edge of the moon slipped above the eastern horizon , and Kino sank back behind his bush . <p> It was an old and ragged moon , but it threw hard light and hard shadow into the mountain cleft , and now Kino could see the seated figure of the watcher on the little beach beside the pool . The watcher gazed full at the moon , and then he lighted another cigarette , and the match illumined his dark face for a moment . There could be no waiting now ; when the watcher turned his head , Kino must leap . His legs were as tight as wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmuring cry . The watcher turned his head to listen and then he stood up , and one of the sleepers stirred on the ground and awakened and asked quietly , " What is it ? " <p> " I do n't know , " said the watcher . " It sounded like a cry , almost like a human- like a baby . " <p> The man who had been sleeping said , " You ca n't tell . Some coyote bitch with a litter . I 've heard a coyote pup cry like a baby . " <p> The sweat rolled in drops down Kino 's forehead and fell into his eyes and burned them . The little cry came again and the watcher looked up the side of the hill to the dark cave . <p> " Coyote maybe , " he said , and Kino heard the harsh click as he cocked the rifle . <p> " If it 's a coyote , this will stop it , " the watcher said as he raised the gun . <p> Kino was in mid-leap when the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great knife swung and crunched hollowly . It bit through neck and deep into chest , and Kino was a terrible machine now . He grasped the rifle even as he wrenched free his knife . His strength and his movement and his speed were a machine . He whirled and struck the head of the seated man like a melon . The third man scrabbled away like a crab , slipped into the pool , and then he began to climb frantically , to climb up the cliff where the water penciled down . His hands and feet threshed in the tangle of the wild grapevine , and he whimpered and gibbered as he tried to get up . But Kino had become as cold and deadly as steel . Deliberately he threw the lever of the rifle , and then he raised the gun and aimed deliberately and fired . He saw his enemy tumble backward into the pool , and Kino strode to the water . In the moonlight he could see the frantic eyes , and Kino aimed and fired between the eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some signal was trying to get through to his brain . Tree frogs and cicadas were silent now . And then Kino 's brain cleared from its red concentration and he knew the sound- the keening , moaning , rising hysterical cry from the little cave in the side of the stone mountain , the cry of death . <p> **25;89;TOOLONG <p> Everyone in La Paz remembers the return of the family ; there may be some old ones who saw it , but those whose fathers and whose grandfathers told it to them remember it nevertheless . It is an event that happened to everyone . <p> It was late in the golden afternoon when the first little boys ran hysterically in the town and spread the word that Kino and Juana were coming back . And everyone hurried to see them . The sun was settling toward the western mountains and the shadows on the ground were long . And perhaps that was what left the deep impression on those who saw them . <p> The two came from the rutted country road into the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and Juana behind , as usual , but side by side . The sun was behind them and their long shadows stalked ahead , and they seemed to carry two towers of darkness with them . Kino had a rifle across his arm and Juana carried her shawl like a sack over her shoulder . And in it was a small limp heavy bundle . The shawl was crusted with dried blood , and the bundle swayed a little as she walked . Her face was hard and lined and leathery with fatigue and with the tightness with which she fought fatigue . And her wide eyes stared inward on herself . She was as remote and as removed as Heaven . Kino 's lips were thin and his jaws tight , and the people say that he carried fear with him , that he was as dangerous as a rising storm . The people say that the two seemed to be removed from human experience ; that they had gone through pain and had come out on the other side ; that there was almost a magical protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them crowded back and let them pass and did not speak to them . <p> Kino and Juana walked through the city as though it were not there . Their eyes glanced neither right nor left nor up nor down , but stared only straight ahead . Their legs moved a little jerkily , like well-made wooden dolls , and they carried pillars of black fear about them . And as they walked through the stone and plaster city brokers peered at them from barred windows and servants put one eye to a slitted gate and mothers turned the faces of their youngest children inward against their skirts . Kino and Juana strode side by side through the stone and plaster city and down among the brush houses , and the neighbors stood back and let them pass . Juan Tomas raised his hand in greeting and did not say the greeting and left his hand in the air for a moment uncertainly . <p> In Kino 's ears the Song of the Family was as fierce as a cry . He was immune and terrible , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burned square where their house had been without even looking at it . They cleared the brush that edged the beach and picked their way down the shore toward the water . And they did not look toward Kino 's broken canoe . <p> And when they came to the water 's edge they stopped and stared out over the Gulf . And then Kino laid the rifle down , and he dug among his clothes , and then he held the great pearl in his hand . He looked into its surface and it was gray and ulcerous . Evil faces peered from it into his eyes , and he saw the light of burning . And in the surface of the pearl he saw the frantic eyes of the man in the pool . And in the surface of the pearl he saw Coyotito lying in the little cave with the top of his head shot away . And the pearl was ugly ; it was gray , like a malignant growth . And Kino heard the music of the pearl , distorted and insane . Kino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Juana and held the pearl out to her . She stood beside him , still holding her dead bundle over her shoulder . She looked at the pearl in his hand for a moment and then she looked into Kino 's eyes and said softly , " No , you . " And Kino drew back his arm and flung the pearl with all his might . Kino and Juana watched it go , winking and glimmering under the setting sun . They saw the little splash in the distance , and they stood side by side watching the place for a long time . <p> And the pearl settled into the lovely green water and dropped toward the bottom . The waving branches of the algae called to it and beckoned to it . The lights on its surface were green and lovely . It settled down to the sand bottom among the fern-like plants . Above , the surface of the water was a green mirror . And the pearl lay on the floor of the sea . A crab scampering over the bottom raised a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone .

On the broad , level land floor the gang plows bit deep and left the black earth shining like metal where the shares had cut . On the foothill ranches across the Salinas River , the yellow stubble fields seemed to be bathed in pale cold sunshine , but there was no sunshine in the valley now in December .

Behind her stood the neat white farm house with red geraniums close-banked around it as high as the windows . It was a hard-swept looking little house , with hard-polished windows , and a clean mud-mat on the front steps . <p> Elisa cast another glance toward the tractor shed .

It was an old spring-wagon , with a round canvas top on it like the cover of a prairie schooner . It was drawn by an old bay horse and a little gray-and-white burro . A big stubble-bearded man sat between the cover flaps and drove the crawling team . Underneath the wagon , between the hind wheels , a lean and rangy mongrel dog walked sedately . Words were painted on the canvas in clumsy , crooked letters . " Pots , pans , knives , sisors , lawn mores , Fixed . " Two rows of articles , and the triumphantly definitive " Fixed " below . The black paint had run down in little sharp points beneath each letter . <p> Elisa , squatting on the ground , watched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't  pass . It turned into the farm road in front of her house , crooked old wheels skirling and squeaking . The rangy dog darted from between the wheels and ran ahead . Instantly the two ranch shepherds flew out at him . Then all three stopped , and with stiff and quivering tails , with taut straight legs , with ambassadorial dignity , they slowly circled , sniffing daintily . The caravan pulled up to Elisas wire fence and stopped . Now the newcomer dog , feeling outnumbered , lowered his tail and retired under the wagon with raised hackles and bared teeth . <p> The man on the wagon seat called out , " That 's a bad dog in a fight when he gets started . " <p> Elisa laughed . I see he is . How soon does he generally get started ? " <p> The man caught up her laughter and echoed it heartily . " Sometimes not for weeks and weeks , " he said . He climbed stiffly down , over the wheel . The horse and the donkey drooped like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very big man . Although his hair and beard were graying , he did not look old . His worn black suit was wrinkled and spotted with grease . The laughter had disappeared from his face and eyes the moment his laughing voice ceased . His eyes were dark , and they were full of the brooding that gets in the eyes of teamsters and of sailors . The calloused hands he rested on the wire fence were cracked , and every crack was a black line . He took off his battered hat . <p> " I 'm off my general road , maam , " he said . " Does this dirt road cut over across the river to the Los Angeles highway ? " <p> Elisa stood up and shoved the thick scissors in her apron pocket . " Well , yes , it does , but it winds around and then fords the river . I do n't  think your team could pull through the sand . " <p> He replied with some asperity , " It might surprise you what them beasts can pull through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> He smiled for a second . " Yes . When they get started . " <p> " Well , " said Elisa , " I think you 'll save time if you go back to the Salinas road and pick up the highway there . " <p> He drew a big finger down the chicken wire and made it sing . " I ai n't  in any hurry , maam . I go from Seattle to San Diego and back every year . Takes all my time . About six months each way . I aim to follow nice weather . " <p> Elisa took off her gloves and stuffed them in the apron pocket with the scissors . She touched the under edge of her mans hat , searching for fugitive hairs . " That sounds like a nice kind of a way to live , " she said . <p> He leaned confidentially over the fence . " Maybe you noticed the writing on my wagon . I mend pots and sharpen knives and scissors . You got any of them things to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing like that . " Her eyes hardened with resistance . <p> " Scissors is the worst thing , " he explained . " Most people just ruin scissors trying to sharpen em , but I know how . I got a special tool . Its a little bobbit kind of thing , and patented . But it sure does the trick . " <p> " No . My scissors are all sharp . " <p> " All right , then . Take a pot , " he continued earnestly , " a bent pot , or a pot with a hole . I can make it like new so you do n't  have to buy no new ones . That 's a saving for you . <p> " No , " she said shortly . " I tell you I have nothing like that for you to do . " <p> His face fell to an exaggerated sadness . His voice took on a whining undertone . " I ai n't  had a thing to do today . Maybe I wont have no supper tonight . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway clear from Seattle to San Diego . They save their things for me to sharpen up because they know I do it so good and save them money . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Elisa said irritably . " I have n't anything for you to do . " <p> His eyes left her face and fell to searching the ground . They roamed about until they came to the chrysanthemum bed where she had been working . " What 's them plants , maam ? " <p> The irritation and resistance melted from Elisas face . " Oh , those are chrysanthemums , giant whites and yellows . I raise them every year , bigger than anybody around here . " <p> " Kind of a long-stemmed flower ? Looks like a quick puff of colored smoke ? " he asked . <p> " Thats it . What a nice way to describe them . " <p> " They smell kind of nasty till you get used to them , " he said . <p> " Its a good bitter smell , " she retorted , " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . " I like the smell myself . " <p> " I had ten-inch blooms this year , " she said . <p> The man leaned farther over the fence . " Look . I know a lady down the road a piece , has got the nicest garden you ever seen . Got nearly every kind of flower but no chrysanthemums . Last time I was mending a copper-bottom washtub for her ( that 's a hard job but I do it good ) , she said to me , If you ever run acrost some nice chrysanthemums I wish you 'd try to get me a few seeds. That 's what she told me . " <p> Elisas eyes grew alert and eager . " She could n't have known much about chrysanthemums . You can raise them from seed , but its much easier to root the little sprouts you see there . " <p> " Oh , " he said . " I spose I cant take none to her , then . " <p> " Why yes you can , " Elisa cried . " I can put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right along with you . Theyll take root in the pot if you keep them damp . And then she can transplant them . " <p> " Shed sure like to have some , maam . You say they 're niceones ? " <p> " Beautiful , " she said . " Oh , beautiful . " Her eyes shone . She tore off the battered hat and shook out her dark pretty hair . " Ill put them in a flower pot , and you can take them right with you . Come into the yard . " <p> While the man came through the picket fence Elisa ran excitedly along the geranium-bordered path to the back of the house . And she returned carrying a big red flower pot . The gloves were forgotten now . She kneeled on the ground by the starting bed and dug up the sandy soil with her fingers and scooped it into the bright new flower pot . Then she picked up the little pile of shoots she had prepared . With her strong fingers she pressed them into the sand and tamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " I 'll tell you what to do , " she said . " You remember so you can tell the lady . " <p> " Yes , I 'll try to remember . " <p> " Well , look . These will take root in about a month . Then she must set them out , about a foot apart in good rich earth like this , see ? " She lifted a handful of dark soil for him to look at . " Theyll grow fast and tall . Now remember this . In July tell her to cut them down , about eight inches from the ground . " <p> " Before they bloom ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , before they bloom . " Her face was tight with eagerness . " Theyll grow right up again . About the last of September the buds will start . " <p> She stopped and seemed perplexed . " Its the budding that takes the most care , " she said hesitantlv . " I do n't  know how to tell you . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a little , and she seemed to be listening . " Ill try to tell you , " she said . " Did you ever hear of planting hands ? " <p> " Ca n't say I have , ma am . <p> " Well , I can only tell you what it feels like . Its when you 're picking off the buds you do n't  want . Everything goes right down into your fingertips . You watch your fingers work . They do it themselves . You can feel how it is . They pick and pick the buds . They never make a mistake . They 're with the plant . Do you see ? Your fingers and the plant . You can feel that , right up your arm . They know . They never make a mistake . You can feel it . When you 're like that you cant do anything wrong . Do you see that ? Can you understand that ? " <p> She was kneeling on the ground looking up at him . Her breast swelled passionately . <p> The mans eyes narrowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Sometimes in the night in the wagon there " <p> Elisas voice grew husky . She broke in on him . " I 've never lived as you do , but I know what you mean . When the night is darkwhy , the stars are sharp-pointed , and there 's quiet . Why , you rise up and up ! Every pointed star gets driven into your body . Its like that . Hot and sharp andlovely . " <p> Kneeling there , her hand went out toward his legs in the greasy black trousers . Her hesitant fingers almost touched the cloth . Then her hand dropped to the ground . She crouched low like a fawning dog . <p> He said , " Its nice , just like you say . Only when you do n't  have no dinner , it ai n't  . " <p> She stood up then , very straight , and her face was ashamed . She held the flower pot out to him and placed it gently in his arms . " Here . Put it in your wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I can find something for you to do . " <p> At the back of the house she dug in the can pile and found two old and battered aluminum saucepans . She carried them back and gave them to him . " Here , maybe you can fix these . " <p> His manner changed . He became professional . " Good as new I can fix them . " At the back of his wagon he set a little anvil , and out of an oily tool box dug a small machine hammer . Elisa came through the gate to watch him while he pounded out the dents in the kettles . His mouth grew sure and knowing . At a difficult part of the work he sucked his under-lip . <p> " You sleep right in the wagon ? " Elisa asked . <p> " Right in the wagon , maam . Rain or shine I 'm dry as a cow in there . " <p> It must be nice , " she said . " It must be very nice . I wish women could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right kind of a life for a woman . <p> Her upper lip raised a little , showing her teeth . " How do you know ? How can you tell ? " she said . <p> " Oh , fifty centsll do . I keep my prices down and my work good . That 's why I have all them satisfied customers up and down the highway . " <p> Elisa brought him a fifty-cent piece from the house and dropped it in his hand . " You might be surprised to have a rival some time . I can sharpen scissors , too . And I can beat the dents out of little pots . I could show you what a woman might do . " <p> He put his hammer back in the oily box and shoved the little anvil out of sight . " It would be a lonely life for a woman , maam , and a scary life , too , with animals creeping under the wagon all night . " He climbed over the singletree , steadying himself with a hand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picked up the lines . " Thank you kindly , maam , " he said . " I 'll do like you told me ; I 'll go back and catch the Salinas road . " <p> " Mind , " she called , " if you 're long in getting there , keep the sand damp . " <p> " Sand , maam ? Sand ? Oh , sure . You mean around the chrysanthemums . Sure I will . " He clucked his tongue . The beasts leaned luxuriously into their collars . The mongrel dog took his place between the back wheels . The wagon turned and crawled out the entrance road and back the way it had come , along the river . <p> Elisa stood in front of her wire fence watching the slow progress of the caravan . Her shoulders were straight , her head thrown back , her eyes half-closed , so that the scene came vaguely into them . Her lips moved silently , forming the words " Good-byegood-bye . " Then she whispered , " That 's a bright direction . There 's a glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shook herself free and looked about to see whether anyone had been listening . Only the dogs had heard . They lifted their heads toward her from their sleeping in the dust , and then stretched out their chins and settled asleep again . Elisa turned and ran hurriedly into the house . <p> **************** <p> In the kitchen she reached behind the stove and felt the water tank . It was full of hot water from the noonday cooking . In the bathroom she tore off her soiled clothes and flung them into the corner . And then she scrubbed herself with a little block of pumice , legs and thighs , loins and chest and arms , until her skin was scratched and red . When she had dried herself she stood in front of a mirror in her bedroom and looked at her body . She tightened her stomach and threw out her chest . She turned and looked over her shoulder at her back . <p> After a while she began to dress , slowly . She put on her newest underclothing and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her prettiness . She worked carefully on her hair , pencilled her eyebrows and rouged her lips . <p> Before she was finished she heard the little thunder of hoofs and the shouts of Henry and his helper as they drove the red steers into the corral . She heard the gate bang shut and set herself for Henrys arrival . <p> His step sounded on the porch . He entered the house calling , " Elisa , where are you ? " <p> When she heard him splashing in the tub , Elisa laid his dark suit on the bed , and shirt and socks and tie beside it . She stood his polished shoes on the floor beside the bed . Then she went to the porch and sat primly and stiffly down . She looked toward the river road where the willow-line was still yellow with frosted leaves so that under the high gray fog they seemed a thin band of sunshine . This was the only color in the gray afternoon . She sat unmoving for a long time . Her eyes blinked rarely . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie inside his vest as he came . Elisa stiffened and her face grew tight . Henry stopped short and looked at her . " Whywhy , Elisa . You look so nice ! " <p> He looked bewildered . " You 're playing some kind of a game , " he said helplessly . " Its a kind of a play . You look strong enough to break a calf over your knee , happy enough to eat it like a watermelon . " <p> For a second she lost her rigidity . " Henry ! Do n't  talk like that . You did n't  know what you said . " She grew complete again . " I 'm strong , " she boasted . " I never knew before how strong . " <p> Henry looked down toward the tractor shed , and when he brought his eyes back to her , they were his own again . " I 'll get out the car . You can put on your coat while I 'm starting . " <p> Elisa went into the house . She heard him drive to the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to put on her hat . She pulled it here and pressed it there . When Henry turned the motor off she slipped into her coat and went out . <p> **************** <p> The little roadster bounced along on the dirt road by the river , raising the birds and driving the rabbits into the brush . Two cranes flapped heavily over the willow-line and dropped into the river-bed . <p> Far ahead on the road Elisa saw a dark speck . She knew . <p> She tried not to look as they passed it , but her eyes would not obey . She whispered to herself sadly , " He might have thrown them off the road . That would n't have been much trouble , not very much . But he kept the pot , " she explained . " He had to keep the pot . That 's why he could n't get them off the road . " <p> The roadster turned a bend and she saw the caravan ahead . She swung full around toward her husband so she could not see the little covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In a moment it was over . The thing was done . She did not look back . She said loudly , to be heard above the motor , " It will be good , tonight , a good dinner . " <p> " Now you 're changed again , " Henry complained . He took one hand from the wheel and patted her knee . " I ought to take you in to dinner oftener . It would be good for both of us . We get so heavy out on the ranch . " <p> " Henry , " she asked , " could we have wine at dinner ? " <p> " Sure we could . Say ! That will be fine . " <p> She was silent for a while ; then she said , " Henry , at those prize fights , do the men hurt each other very much ? " <p> " Sometimes a little , not often . Why ? " <p> " Well , I 've read how they break noses , and blood runs down their chests . Ive read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He looked around at her . " What 's the matter , Elisa ? I did n't  know you read things like that . " He brought the car to a stop , then turned to the right over the Salinas River bridge . <p> " Do any women ever go to the fights ? " she asked . <p> " Oh , sure , some . What 's the matter , Elisa ? Do you want to go ? I do n't  think you 'd like it , but I 'll take you if you really want to go . " <p> She relaxed limply in the seat . " Oh , no . No . I do n't  want to go . I 'm sure I do n't  . " Her face was turned away from him . " It will be enough if we can have wine . It will be plenty . " She turned up her coat collar so he could not see that she was crying weaklylike an old woman .

@@89755444 @5255444/ <p> One end of the great barn was piled high with new hay and over the pile hung the four-taloned Jackson fork suspended from its pulley . The hay came down like a mountain slope to the other end of the barn , and there was a level place as yet unfilled with the new crop . At the sides the feeding racks were visible , and between the slats the heads of horses could be seen . <p> It was Sunday afternoon . The resting horses nibbled the remaining wisps of hay , and they stamped their feet and they bit the wood of the mangers and rattled the halter chains . The afternoon sun sliced in through the cracks of the barn walls and lay in bright lines on the hay . There was the buzz of flies in the air , the lazy afternoon humming . <p> From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the playing peg and the shouts of men , playing , encouraging , jeering . But in the barn it was quiet and humming and lazy and warm . <p> Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hay beside a packing case under a manger in the end of the barn that had not been filled with hay . Lennie sat in the hay and looked at a little dead puppy that lay in front of him . Lennie looked at it for a long time , and then he put out his huge hand and stroked it , stroked it clear from one end to the other . <p> And Lennie said softly to the puppy , " Why do you got to get killed ? You ai n't so little as mice . I did n't bounce you hard . " He bent the pup 's head up and looked in its face , and he said to it , " Now maybe George ai n't gon na let me tend no rabbits , if he fin 's out you got killed . " <p> He scooped a little hollow and laid the puppy in it and covered it over with hay , out of sight ; but he continued to stare at the mound he had made . He said , " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide in the brush . Oh ! no . This ai n't . I 'll tell George I foun ' it dead . " <p> He unburied the puppy and inspected it , and he stroked it from ears to tail . He went on sorrowfully , " But he 'll know . George always knows . He 'll say , ' You done it . Do n't try to put nothing over on me . ' An ' he 'll say , ' Now jus ' for that you do n't get to tend no rabbits ! ' " <p> Suddenly his anger arose . " God damn you , " he cried . " Why do you got to get killed ? You ai n't so little as mice . " He picked up the pup and hurled it from him . He turned his back on it . He sat bent over his knees and he whispered , " Now I wo n't get to tend the rabbits . Now he wo n't let me . " He rocked himself back and forth in his sorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron stake , and then a little chorus of cries . Lennie got up and brought the puppy back and laid it on the hay and sat down . He stroked the pup again . You was n't big enough , he said . " They tol ' me and tol ' me you was n't . I di' n't know you 'd get killed so easy . " He worked his fingers on the pup 's limp ear . " Maybe George wo n't care , " he said . " This here God damn little son-of-a-bitch was n't nothing to George . " Curley 's wife came around the end of the last stall . She came very quietly , so that Lennie did n't see her . She wore her bright cotton dress and the mules with the red ostrich feathers . Her face was made up and the little sausage curls were all in place . She was quite near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her . <p> In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his fingers . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What you got there , sonny boy ? " <p> Lennie glared at her . " George says I ai n't to have nothing to do with you- talk to you or nothing . " <p> She laughed . " George giving you orders about everything ? " <p> Lennie looked down at the hay . " Says I ca n't tend no rabbits if I talk to you or anything . " <p> She said quietly , " He 's scared Curley 'll get mad . Well , Curley got his arm in a sling- an ' if Curley gets tough , you can break his other han ' . You did n't put nothing over on me about gettin ' it caught in no machine . " <p> But Lennie was not to be drawn . " No , sir . I ai n't gon na talk to you or nothing .

Why ca n't I talk to you ? I never get to talk to nobody . I get awful lonely . " <p> Lennie said , " Well , I ai n't supposed to talk to you or nothing . " <p> " I get lonely , " she said . " You can talk to people , but I ca n't talk to nobody but Curley . Else he gets mad . How 'd you like not to talk to anybody ? " <p> " Well , he said if I done any more bad things he ai n't gon na let me tend the rabbits . " <p> She moved closer to him and she spoke soothingly . " Do n't you worry about talkin ' to me . Listen to the guys yell out there . They got four dollars bet in that tenement . None of them ai n't gon na leave till it 's over . " <p> Her face grew angry . " Wha 's the matter with me ?

I tell you I ai n't used to livin ' like this . I coulda made somethin ' of myself . " She said darkly , " Maybe I will yet . " And then her words tumbled out in a passion of communication , as though she hurried before her listener could be taken away . " I lived right in Salinas , " she said . " Come there when I was a kid . Well , a show come through , an ' I met one of the actors . He says I could go with that show . But my ol ' lady would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen . But the guy says I coulda . If I 'd went , I would n't be livin ' like this , you bet . " Lennie stroked the pup back and forth . " We gon na have a little place- an ' rabbits , " he explained . <p> She went on with her story quickly , before she should be interrupted . " ' Nother time I met a guy , an ' he was in pitchers . Went out to the Riverside Dance Palace with him . He says he was gon na put me in the movies . Says I was a natural . Soon 's he got back to Hollywood he was gon na write to me about it . " She looked closely at Lennie to see whether she was impressing him . " I never got that letter , " she said . " I always thought my ol ' lady stole it . Well , I was n't gon na stay no place where I could n't get nowhere or make something of myself , an ' where they stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , an ' she says no . So I married Curley .

I don ' like Curley . He ai n't a nice fella . " And because she had confided in him , she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside him . " Coulda been in the movies , an ' had nice clothes- all them nice clothes like they wear . An ' I coulda sat in them big hotels , an ' had pitchers took of me . When they had them previews I coulda went to them , an ' spoke in the radio , an ' it wouldn'ta cost me a cent because I was in the pitcher . An ' all them nice clothes like they wear . Because this guy says I was a natural . She looked up at Lennie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hand to show that she could act . The fingers trailed after her leading wrist , and her little finger stuck out grandly from the rest . <p> Lennie sighed deeply . From outside came the clang of a horseshoe on metal , and then a chorus of cheers . " Somebody made a ringer , " said Curley 's wife . <p> Now the light was lifting as the sun went down , and the sun streaks climbed up the wall and fell over the feeding racks and over the heads of the horses . <p> Lennie said , " Maybe if I took this pup out and throwed him away George would n't never know . An ' then I could tend the rabbits without no trouble . " <p> Curley 's wife said angrily , " Do n't you think of nothing but rabbits ? " <p> " We gon na have a little place , " Lennie explained patiently . " We gon na have a house an ' a garden and a place for alfalfa , an ' that alfalfa is for the rabbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fulla alfalfa and then I take it to the rabbits . " <p> She asked , " What makes you so nuts about rabbits ? " <p> Lennie had to think carefully before he could come to a conclusion . He moved cautiously close to her , until he was right against her . " I like to pet nice things . Once at a fair I seen some of them long-hair rabbits . An ' they was nice , you bet . Sometimes I 've even pet mice , but not when I could n't get nothing better . " <p> Curley 's wife moved away from him a little . " I think you 're nuts , " she said . <p> She was a little bit reassured . " Well , who do n't ? " she said . " Ever'body likes that . I like to feel silk an ' velvet . Do you like to feel velvet ? " <p> Lennie chuckled with pleasure . " You bet , by God , " he cried happily . " An ' I had some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lady was- my own Aunt Clara . She give it right to me- ' bout this big a piece . I wisht I had that velvet right now . " A frown came over his face . " I lost it , " he said . " I ai n't seen it for a long time . " <p> Curley 's wife laughed at him . " You 're nuts , " she said . " But you 're a kinda nice fella . Jus ' like a big baby . But a person can see kinda what you mean . When I 'm doin ' my hair sometimes I jus ' set an ' stroke it ' cause it 's so soft . " To show how she did it , she ran her fingers over the top of her head . " Some people got kinda coarse hair , " she said complacently . " Take Curley . His hair is jus ' like wire . But mine is soft and fine . ' Course I brush it a lot . That makes it fine . Here- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put it on her head . Feel right aroun ' there an ' see how soft it is . <p> " Look out , now , you 'll muss it . " And then she cried angrily , " You stop it now , you 'll mess it all up . " She jerked her head sideways , and Lennie 's fingers closed on her hair and hung on . " Let go , " she cried . " You let go ! " <p> Lennie was in a panic . His face was contorted . She screamed then , and Lennie 's other hand closed over her mouth and nose . " Please do n't , " he begged . " Oh ! Please do n't do that . George 'll be mad . " <p> She struggled violently under his hands . Her feet battered on the hay and she writhed to be free ; and from under Lennie 's hand came a muffled screaming . Lennie began to cry with fright . " Oh ! Please do n't do none of that , " he begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . He ai n't gon na let me tend no rabbits . " He moved his hand a little and her hoarse cry came out . Then Lennie grew angry . " Now do n't , " he said . " I do n't want you to yell . You gon na get me in trouble jus ' like George says you will . Now do n't you do that . " And she continued to struggle , and her eyes were wild with terror . He shook her then , and he was angry with her . " Do n't you go yellin ' , " he said , and he shook her ; and her body flopped like a fish . And then she was still , for Lennie had broken her neck . <p> He looked down at her , and carefully he removed his hand from over her mouth , and she lay still . " I do n't want to hurt you , " he said , but George 'll be mad if you yell . When she did n't answer nor move he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it drop . For a moment he seemed bewildered . And then he whispered in fright , " I done a bad thing . I done another bad thing . " <p> He pawed up the hay until it partly covered her . From outside the barn came a cry of men and the double clang of shoes on metal . For the first time Lennie became conscious of the outside . He crouched down in the hay and listened . " I done a real bad thing , " he said . " I should n't of did that . George 'll be mad . An ' ... he said ... an ' hide in the brush till he come . He 's gon na be mad . In the brush till he come . Tha 's what he said . " Lennie went back and looked at the dead girl . The puppy lay close to her . Lennie picked it up . " I 'll throw him away , " he said . " It 's bad enough like it is . " He put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn wall and peered out between the cracks , toward the horseshoe game . And then he crept around the end of the last manger and disappeared . <p> The sun streaks were high on the wall by now , and the light was growing soft in the barn . Curley 's wife lay on her back , and she was half covered with hay . <p> It was very quiet in the barn , and the quiet of the afternoon was on the ranch . Even the clang of the pitched shoes , even the voices of the men in the game , seemed to grow more quiet . The air in the barn was dusky in advance of the outside day . A pigeon flew in through the open hay door and circled and flew out again . Around the last stall came a shepherd bitch , lean and long , with heavy , hanging dugs . Halfway to the packing box where the puppies were she caught the dead scent of Curley 's wife , and the hair arose along her spine . She whimpered and cringed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppies . <p> Curley 's wife lay with a half-covering of yellow hay . And the meanness and the plannings and the discontent and the ache for attention were all gone from her face . She was very pretty and simple , and her face was sweet and young . Now her rouged cheeks and her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very lightly . The curls , tiny little sausages , were spread on the hay behind her head , and her lips were parted . <p> As happens sometimes , a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment . And sound stopped and movement stopped for much , much more than a moment . <p> Then gradually time awakened again and moved sluggishly on . The horses stamped on the other side of the feeding racks and the halter chains clinked . Outside , the men 's voices became louder and clearer . <p> From around the end of the last stall old Candy 's voice came . Lennie , he called . " Oh , Lennie ! You in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do , Lennie . " Old Candy appeared around the end of the last stall . " Oh , Lennie ! " he called again ; and then he stopped , and his body stiffened . He rubbed his smooth wrist on his white stubble whiskers . " I di' n't know you was here , " he said to Curley 's wife . <p> When she did n't answer , he stepped nearer . " You oughten to sleep out here , " he said disapprovingly ; and then he was beside her and- " Oh , Jesus Christ ! " He looked about helplessly , and he rubbed his beard . And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the barn . <p> But the barn was alive now . The horses stamped and snorted , and they chewed the straw of their bedding and they clashed the chains of their halters . In a moment Candy came back , and George was with him . <p> George said , " What was it you wanted to see me about ? " <p> Candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter with her ? " he asked . He stepped closer , and then he echoed Candy 's words . " Oh , Jesus Christ ! " He was down on his knees beside her . He put his hand over her heart . And finally , when he stood up , slowly and stiffly , his face was as hard and tight as wood , and his eyes were hard . <p> Candy said , " What done it ? " <p> George looked coldly at him . " Ai n't you got any idear ? " he asked . And Candy was silent . " I should of knew , " George said hopelessly . " I guess maybe way back in my head I did . " <p> Candy asked , " What we gon na do now , George ? What we gon na do now ? " <p> George was a long time in answering . " Guess ... we got ta tell the ... guys . I guess we got ta get ' i 'm an ' lock ' i 'm up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the poor bastard 'd starve . " And he tried to reassure himself . " Maybe they 'll lock ' i 'm up an ' be nice to ' im . " <p> Candy said , " He 's such a nice fella . I didn ' think he 'd do nothing like this . " <p> George still stared at Curley 's wife . " Lennie never done it in meanness , " he said . " All the time he done bad things , but he never done one of ' em mean . " He straightened up and looked back at Candy . " Now listen . We got ta tell the guys . They got to bring him in , I guess . They ai n't no way out . Maybe they wo n't hurt ' im . He said " sharply , " I ai n't gon na let ' em hurt Lennie . Now you listen . The guys might think I was in on it . I 'm gon na go in the bunkhouse . Then in a minute you come out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along and make like I never seen her . Will you do that ? So the guys wo n't think I was in on it ? " <p> Candy said , " Sure , George . Sure I 'll do that . " <p> " O.K. Give me a couple minutes then , and you come runnin ' out an ' tell like you jus ' found her . I 'm going now . " George turned and went quickly out of the barn . <p> Old Candy watched him go . He looked helplessly back at Curley 's wife , and gradually his sorrow and his anger grew into words . " You God damn tramp " , he said viciously . " You done it , di' n't you ? I s'pose you 're glad . Ever'body knowed you 'd mess things up . You was n't no good . You ai n't no good now , you lousy tart . " He sniveled , and his voice shook . " I could of hoed in the garden and washed dishes for them guys . " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repeated the old words : " If they was a circus or a baseball game ... we would of went to her ... jus ' said ' ta hell with work , ' an ' went to her . Never ast nobody 's say so . An ' they 'd of been a pig and chickens ... an ' in the winter ... the little fat stove ... an ' the rain comin ' ... an ' us jes ' settin ' there . " His eyes blinded with tears and he turned and went weakly out of the barn , and he rubbed his bristly whiskers with his wrist stump . <p> Outside the noise of the game stopped . There was a rise of voices in question , a drum of running feet and the men burst into the barn . Slim and Carlson and young Whit and Curley , and Crooks keeping back out of attention range . Candy came after them , and last of all came George . George had put on his blue denim coat and buttoned it , and his black hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced around the last stall . Their eyes found Curley 's wife in the gloom , they stopped and stood still and looked . <p> Then Slim went quietly over to her , and he felt her wrist . One lean finger touched her cheek , and then his hand went under her slightly twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck . When he stood up the men crowded near and the spell was broken . <p> Curley came suddenly to life . " I know who done it , " he cried . " That big son-of-a-bitch done it . I know he done it . Why- ever'body else was out there playin ' horseshoes . He worked himself into a fury . " " I 'm gon na get him . I 'm going for my shotgun . I 'll kill the big son-of-a-bitch myself . I 'll shoot ' im in the guts . Come on , you guys . " He ran furiously out of the barn . Carlson said , " I 'll get my Luger , " and he ran out too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hat was so far down on his forehead that his eyes were covered . <p> Slim went on , " Maybe like that time in Weed you was tellin ' about . " <p> Again George nodded . <p> Slim sighed . " Well , I guess we got to get him . Where you think he might of went ? " <p> It seemed to take George some time to free his words . " He- would of went south , " he said . " We come from north so he would of went south . " <p> " I guess we got ta get ' im , " Slim repeated . <p> George stepped close . " Couldn ' we maybe bring him in an ' they 'll lock him up ? He 's nuts , Slim . He never done this to be mean . " <p> Slim nodded . " We might , " he said . " If we could keep Curley in , we might . But Curley 's gon na want to shoot ' im . Curley 's still mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an ' strap him down and put him in a cage . That ai n't no good , George . " <p> " I know , " said George , " I know . " <p> Carlson came running in . " The bastard 's stole my Luger , " he shouted . It ai n't in my bag . Curley followed him , and Curley carried a shotgun in his good hand . Curley was cold now . <p> " All right , you guys , " he said . " The nigger 's got a shotgun . You take it , Carlson . When you see ' um , do n't give ' i 'm no chance . Shoot for his guts . That 'll double ' i 'm over . " <p> Curley 's face reddened . " I 'm goin ' , " he said . " I 'm gon na shoot the guts outa that big bastard myself , even if I only got one hand . I 'm gon na get ' im . " <p> Slim turned to Candy . " You stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better get goin ' . " <p> They moved away . George stopped a moment beside Candy and they both looked down at the dead girl until Curley called , " You George ! You stick with us so we do n't think you had nothin ' to do with this . " George moved slowly after them , and his feet dragged heavily . <p> And when they were gone , Candy squatted down in the hay and watched the face of Curley 's wife . " Poor bastard , " he said softly . <p> The sound of the men grew fainter . The barn was darkening gradually and , in their stalls , the horses shifted their feet and rattled the halter chains . Old Candy lay down in the hay and covered his eyes with his arm .

Because of some stuff happening in my life right now , I was feeling shorn of power , shorn of favor , and shorn of identity . Like Samson , it was mostly a situation brought on by my own arrogance and/or stupidity , but also like Samson , there was a certain amount of betrayal involved . <p> So what did I do ? <p> I cut off my beloved long hair of course . I 'm an English major : I believe in symbolism . Today I am more tame , more owned , perhaps more humble ( though that 's always a stretch ) , but hopefully also more dependent on God now than on my own abilities or the judgments of others . <p> P.S.

I 'm just wondering , though , was n't the long hair a GOOD thing for Samson and did n't  cutting it symbolize a break from faithfulness ? <p> As a fellow longhair , I grieve whatever circumstances led to your cut . <p> I began growing out my hair in my early 30s , which surprised some people . I did n't  know how it would go over with the congregation I was serving at the time . Then one of the " little old ladies " told me how much she liked it , so I kept growing it . <p> My hair was down to my shoulder blades when I *had* to cut it . My ten-month old son was yanking it unmercifully . I grieved deeply . <p> My daughter was a year old when I began growing out my hair again . I had been " shorn " for three years and was serving a church in a military community . It took them about 4 or 5 months to realize that I was actually growing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most people were fine with it . A few were downright obnoxious . There had been problems in that church for decades ( as the EP warned me before I became their pastor ) , but those obnoxious few made my hair into a major issue . I took a lot of hell from them , but I refused to cut my hair . Two folks from COM even suggested I cut my hair , and I said , " No . Theyll simply do what theyve always done and latch on to something else to fight about . This is n't about my hair . Its about their desire to control everyone else in the church . " <p> When I came to my present pastorate my hair was nearly to my elbows , always kept neat and clean . I had to cut it back twice , finally up to my shoulders , because of damage from too much chlorine in the water supply . Once again , I grieved , but I found better haircare products .

Samson figured out that trick . Neal , you 're still a longhair . ( It sounds like you are too , Adam . ) They cant take that spiritual essence away from you .

@@89755449 @5255449/ <h> The Murder <h> by John Steinbeck <p> This happened a number of years ago in Monterey County , in central California . The Caon del Castillo is one of those valleys in the Santa Lucia range1 which lie between its many spurs and ridges2 . From the main Caon del Castillo a number of little arroyos3 cut back into the mountains , oak-wooded canyons , heavily brushed with poison oak and sage . At the head of the canyon there stands a tremendous stone castle , buttressed and towered like those strongholds the Crusaders4 put up in the path of their conquests . Only a close visit to the castle shows it to be a strange accident of time and water and erosion working on soft , stratified sandstone5 . In the distance the ruined battlements , the gates , the towers , even the arrow slits , require little imagination to make out . <p> Below the castle , on the nearly level floor of the canyon , stand the old ranch house , a weathered and mossy barn and a warped feeding-shed for cattle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinges , squeal and bang on nights when the wind courses down from the castle . Not many people visit the house . Sometimes a crowd of boys tramp through the rooms , peering into empty closets and loudly defying the ghosts they deny . <p> Jim Moore , who owns the land , does not like to have people about the house . He rides up from his new house , farther down the valley , and chases the boys away . He has put " No Trespassing " signs on his fences to keep curious and morbid people out . Sometimes he thinks of burning the old house down , but then a strange and powerful relation with the swinging doors , the blind and desolate windows , forbids the destruction . <p> If he should burn the house he would destroy a great and important piece of his life . He knows that when he goes to town with his plump and still pretty wife , people turn and look at his retreating back with awe and some admiration . <p> **************** <p> Jim Moore was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew every grained and weathered board of the barn , every smooth , worn manger-rack6 . His mother and father were both dead when he was thirty . He celebrated his majority7 by raising a beard . He sold the pigs and decided never to have any more . At last he bought a fine Guernsey bull to improve his stock , and he began to go to Monterey on Saturday nights , to get drunk and to talk with the noisy girls of the Three Star . <p> Within a year Jim Moore married Jelka Sepic , a Jugo-Slav girl , daughter of a heavy and patient farmer of Pine Canyon . Jim was not proud of her foreign family , of her many brothers and sisters and cousins , but he delighted in her beauty . Jelka had eyes as large and questioning as a doe 's eyes . Her nose was thin and sharply faceted , and her lips were deep and soft . Jelka 's skin always startled Jim , for between night and night he forgot how beautiful it was . She was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Jim often thought with disgust of her father 's advice on the wedding day . The old man , bleary and bloated8 with festival beer , elbowed Jim in the ribs and grinned suggestively , so that his little dark eyes almost disappeared behind puffed and wrinkled lids . <p> " Do n't be big fool , now , " he said . Jelka is Slav girl . He's9 not like American girl . If he is bad , beat him . If he 's good too long , beat him too . I beat his mama . Papa beat my mama . Slav girl ! He s not like a man10 that do n't beat hell out of him . " <p> I would n't beat Jelka , " Jim said . <p> The father giggled and nudged him again with his elbow . " Do n't be big fool , " he <p> warned . Sometime you see . " He rolled back to the beer barrel . <p> Jim found soon enough that Jelka was not like American girls . She was very quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then with soft short replies . She learned her husband as she learned passages of Scripture.After they had been married a while , Jim never wanted for any habitual thing11 in the house but Jelka had it ready for him before he could ask . She was a fine wife , but there was no companionship in her . She never talked . Her great eyes followed him , and when he smiled , sometimes she smiled too , a distant and covered12 smile . Her knitting and mending and sewing were interminable . There she sat , watching her wise hands , and she seemed to regard with wonder and pride the little white hands that could do such nice and useful things . She was so much like an animal that sometimes Jim patted her head and neck under the same impulse that made him stroke a horse . <p> In the house Jelka was remarkable . No matter what time Jim came in from the hot dry range13 or from the bottom farm land , his dinner was exactly , steaming ready for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes close when he needed them , and filled his cup when it was empty . <p> Early in the marriage he told her things that happened on the farm , but she smiled at him as a foreigner does who wishes to be agreeable even though he does n't understand . <p> The stallion cut himself on the barbed wire , " he said . <p> And she replied Yes , " with a downward inflection that had neither question nor interest . <p> He realized before long that he could not get in touch with her in any way . If she had a life apart14 , it was so remote as to be beyond his reach . The barrier in her eyes was not one that could be removed , for it was neither hostile nor intentional . <p> At night he stroked her straight black hair and her unbelievably smooth golden shoulders , and she whimpered a little with pleasure . Only in the climax of his embrace did she seem to have a life apart , fierce and passionate . And then immediately she lapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ever talk to me ? " he demanded . Do n't you want to talk to me ? " <p> Yes , " she said . What do you want me to say ? " She spoke the language of his race out of a mind that was foreign to his race . <p> When a year had passed , Jim began to crave the company of women , the chattery exchange of small talk , the shrill pleasant insults , the shame-sharpened vulgarity15 . He began to go again to town , to drink and to play with the noisy girls of the Three Star . They liked him there for his firm , controlled face and for his readiness to laugh . <p> Where 's your wife ? " they demanded . <p> Home in the barn , " he responded . It was a never-failing joke . <p> Saturday afternoons he saddled a horse and put a rifle in the scabbard in case he should see a deer . Always he asked : You do n't mind staying alone ? " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked : " Suppose someone should come ? " <p> Her eyes sharpened for a moment , and then she smiled . " I would send them away , " she said . <p> " I 'll be back about noon tomorrow . Its too far to ride in the night . " He felt that she knew where he was going , but she never protested nor gave any sign of disapproval . " You should have a baby , " he said . <p> Her face lighted up . Some time God will be good , " she said eagerly . <p> He was sorry for her loneliness . If only she visited with the other women of the canyon she would be less lonely , but she had no gift for visiting . Once every month or so she put horses to the buckboard16 and went to spend an afternoon with her mother , and with the brood of brothers and sisters and cousins who lived in her father 's house . <p> " A fine time you 'll have , " Jim said to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole afternoon . You 'll giggle with that big grown cousin of yours with the embarrassed face . If I could find any fault with you , I 'd call you a damn foreigner . " He remembered how she blessed the bread with the sign of the cross before she put it in the oven , how she knelt at the bedside every night , how she had a holy picture tacked to the wall in the closet . <p> **************** <p> One Saturday in a hot dusty June , Jim cut oats in the farm flat17 . The day was long . It was after six o'clock when the mower tumbled18 the last band of oats . He drove the clanking machine up into the barnyard and backed it into the implement shed , and there he unhitched the horses and turned them out to graze on the hills over Sunday . When he entered the kitchen Jelka was just putting his dinner on the table . He washed his hands and face and sat down to eat . <p> " I 'm tired , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 'll be a full moon . " <p> Her soft eyes smiled . <p> " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , " he said . " If you would like to go , I 'll hitch up a rig19 and take you with me . " <p> She smiled again and shook her head . " No , the stores would be closed . I would rather stay here . " <p> " Well , all right , I 'll saddle the horse then . I did n't think I was going . The stocks all turned out . Maybe I can catch a horse easy . Sure you do n't want to go ? " <p> " If it was early , and I could go to the storesbut it will be ten o'clock when you get there . " <p> " Oh , nowell , anyway , on horseback I 'll make it a little after nine . " <p> Her mouth smiled to itself , but her eyes watched him for the development of a wish . Perhaps because he was tired from the long day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? " <p> " Thinking about ? I remember , you used to ask that nearly every day when we were first married . " <p> " But what are you ? " he insisted irritably . <p> " OhI 'm thinking about the eggs under the black hen . " She got up and went to the big calendar on the wall . They will hatch tomorrow or maybe Monday . " <p> It was almost dusk when he had finished shaving and putting on his blue serge suit and his new boots . Jelka had the dishes washed and put away . As Jim went through the kitchen he saw that she had taken the lamp to the table near the window , and that she sat beside it knitting a brown wool sock . <p> " Why do you sit there tonight ? " he asked . " You always sit over here . You do funny things sometimes . " <p> Her eyes arose slowly from her flying hands . The moon , " she said quietly . You said it would be full tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But you 're silly . You ca n't see it from that window . I thought you knew direction better than that . " <p> She smiled remotely . " I will look out of the bedroom window , then . " <p> Jim put on his black hat and went out . Walking through the dark empty barn , he took a halter20 from the rack . On the grassy sidehill he whistled high and shrill . The horses stopped feeding and moved slowly in towards him , and stopped twenty feet away.Carefully he approached his bay gelding21 and moved his hand from its rump along its side and up and over its neck . The halterstrap clicked in its buckle . Jim turned and led the horse back to the barn . He threw his saddle on and cinched it tight , put his silver-bound bridle over the stiff ears , buckled the throat latch , knotted the tie-rope about the gelding 's neck and fastened the neat coil-end to the saddle string . Then he slipped the halter and led the horse to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern hills . The full moon would rise before the valley had completely lost the daylight . <p> In the kitchen Jelka still knitted by the window . Jim strode to the corner of the room and took up his 30-30 carbine22 . As he rammed cartridges into the magazine23 , he said : " The moon glow is on the hills . If you are going to see it rise , you better go outside now . It 's going to be a good red one at rising . " <p> " In a moment , " she replied , when I come to the end here . " He went to her and patted her sleek head . <p> " Good night . I 'll probably be back by noon tomorrow . " Her dusky black eyes followed him out of the door . <p> Jim thrust the rifle into his saddle-scabbard , and mounted and swung his horse down the canyon . On his right , from behind the blackening hills , the great red moon slid rapidly up . The double light of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trees and gave a mysterious new perspective to the hills . The dusty oaks shimmered and glowed , and the shade under them was black as velvet . A huge , long legged shadow of a horse and half a man rode to the left and slightly ahead of Jim . From the ranches near and distant came the sound of dogs tuning up for a night of song . And the roosters crowed , thinking a new dawn had come too quickly . Jim lifted the gelding to a trot . The spattering hoof-steps echoed back from the castle behind him . He thought of blonde May at the Three Star at Monterey . " Ill be late . Maybe someone else 'll have her , " he thought . The moon was clear of the hills now . <p> Jim had gone a mile when he heard the hoofbeats of a horse coming towards him.A horseman cantered up and pulled to a stop . That you , Jim ? " <p> " Yes . Oh , hello , George . " <p> " I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youyou know the springboard24 at the upper end of my land ? " <p> " Yes , I know . " <p> " Well , I was up there this afternoon . I found a dead campfire and a calf 's head and feet . The skin was in the fire , half burned , but I pulled it out and it had your brand25 . <p> " The hell , " said Jim . How old was the fire ? " <p> " The ground was still warm in the ashes . Last night , I guess . Look , Jim , I ca n't go up with you . I 've got to go to town , but I thought I 'd tell you , so you could take a look around . " <p> Jim asked quietly , " Any idea how many men ? " <p> " No . I did n't look close . " <p> " Well , I guess I better go up and look . I was going to town too . But if there are thieves working , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through your land if you do n't mind , George . " <p> " I 'd go with you , but I 've got to go to town . You got a gun with you ? " <p> " Oh yes , sure . Here under my leg . Thanks for telling me . " <p> " That 's all right . Cut through any place you want . Good night . " The neighbor turned his horse and cantered back in the direction from which he had come . <p> For a few moments Jim sat in the moonlight , looking down at his stilted shadow . <p> He pulled his rifle from its scabbard , levered a cartridge into the chamber , and held the gun across the pommel of his saddle . He turned left from the road , went up the little ridge , through the oak grove , over the grassy hogback26 and down the other side into the next canyon . <p> In half an hour he had found the deserted camp . He turned over the heavy , leathery calf 's head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long it had been dead . He lighted a match and looked at his brand on the half-burned hide . At last he mounted his horse again , rode over the bald grassy hills and crossed into his own land . <p> A warm summer wind was blowing on the hilltops . The moon , as it quartered up the sky , lost its redness and turned the color of strong tea . Among the hills the coyotes were singing , and the dogs at the ranch houses below joined them with broken-hearted howling . The dark green oaks below and the yellow summer grass showed their colors in the moonlight . <p> Jim followed the sound of the cowbells to his herd , and found them eating quietly , and a few deer feeding with them . He listened for the sound of hoofbeats or the voices of men on the wind . <p> It was after eleven when he turned his horse towards home . He rounded the west tower of the sandstone castle , rode through the shadow and out into the moonlight again.Below , the roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window cast back a streak of reflection . <p> The feeding horses lifted their heads as Jim came down through the pasture . Their eyes glinted redly when they turned their heads . <p> Jim had almost reached the corral fencehe heard a horse stamping in the barn . His hand jerked the gelding down . He listened . It came again , the stamping from the barn . Jim lifted his rifle and dismounted silently . He turned his horse loose and crept towards the barn . <p> In the blackness he could hear the grinding of the horse 's teeth as it chewed hay . He moved along the barn until he came to the occupied stall . After a moment of listening he scratched a match on the butt of his rifle . A saddled and bridled horse was tied in the stall . The bit27 was slipped under the chin and the cinch28 loosened . The horse stopped eating and turned its head towards the light . <p> Jim blew out the match and walked quickly out of the barn . He sat on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts came so slowly that he put them into words and said them under his breath . <p> " Shall I look through the window ? No . My head would throw a shadow in the room . " <p> He regarded the rifle in his hand . Where it had been rubbed and , handled , the black gun finish had worn off , leaving the metal silvery . <p> At last he stood up with decision and moved towards the house . At the steps , an extended foot tried each board tenderly before he put his weight on it . The three ranch dogs came out from under the house and shook themselves , stretched and sniffed , wagged their tails and went back to bed . <p> The kitchen was dark , but Jim knew where every piece of furniture was . He put out his hand and touched the corner of the table , a chair back , the towel hanger , as he went along . He crossed the room so silently that even he could hear only his breath and the whisper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch in his pocket . The bedroom door stood open and spilled a patch of moonlight on the kitchen floor . Jim reached the door at last and peered through . <p> The moonlight lay on the white bed . Jim saw Jelka lying on her back , one soft bare arm flung across her forehead and eyes . He could not see who the man was , for his head was turned away . Jim watched , holding his breath . Then Jelka twitched in her sleep and the man rolled his head and sighedJelka 's cousin , her grown , embarrassed cousin . <p> Jim turned and quickly stole back across the kitchen and down the back steps . He walked up the yard to the water-trough again , and sat down on the edge of it . The moon was white as chalk , and it swam in the water , and lighted the straws and barley dropped by the horses ' mouths . Jim could see the mosquito wrigglers , tumbling up and down , end over end , in the water , and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the trough . <p> He cried a few dry , hard , smothered sobs30 , and wondered why , for his thought was of the grassed hilltops and of the lonely summer wind whisking along . <p> His thoughts turned to the way his mother used to hold a bucket to catch the throat blood when his father killed a pig . She stood as far away as possible and held the bucket at arms ' -length to keep her clothes from getting spattered . <p> Jim dipped his hand into the trough and stirred the moon to broken , swirling streams of light . He wetted his forehead with his damp hands and stood up . This time he did not move so quietly , but he crossed the kitchen on tiptoe and stood in the bedroom door . Jelka moved her arm and opened her eyes a little . Then the eyes sprang wide , then they glistened with moisture . Jim looked into her eyes ; his face was empty of expression.A little drop ran out of Jelka 's nose and lodged in the hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jim cocked the rifle . The steel click sounded through the house . The man on the bed stirred uneasily in his sleep . Jim 's hands were quivering . He raised the gun to his shoulder and held it tightly to keep from shaking . Over the sights he saw the little white square between the man 's brows and hair . The front sight wavered a moment and then came to rest . <p> The gun crash tore the air . Jim , still looking down the barrel , saw the whole bed jolt under the blow . A small , black , bloodless hole was in the man 's forehead . But behind , the hollow-point took brain and bone and splashed them on the pillow . <p> Jelka 's cousin gurgled in his throat . His hands came crawling out from under the covers like big white spiders , and they walked for a moment , then shuddered and fell quiet . <p> Jim looked slowly back at Jelka . Her nose was running . Her eyes had moved from him to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold puppy . <p> Jim turned in panic . His boot heels beat on the kitchen floor , but outside , he moved slowly towards the water-trough again . There was a taste of salt in his throat , and his heart heaved painfully . He pulled his hat off and dipped his head into the water . Then he leaned over and vomited on the ground . In the house he could hear Jelka moving about . She whimpered like a puppy . Jim straightened up , weak and dizzy . <p> He walked tiredly through the corral and into the pasture . His saddled horse came at his whistle . Automatically he tightened the cinch , mounted and rode away , down the road to the valley . The squat black shadow traveled under him . The moon sailed high and white . The uneasy dogs barked monotonously . <p> **************** <p> At daybreak a buckboard and pair31 trotted up to the ranch yard , scattering the chickens . A deputy sheriff and a coroner sat in the seat . Jim Moore half reclined against his saddle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy sheriff set the brake and wrapped the lines around it . The men dismounted . <p> Jim asked , " Do I have to go in ? I 'm too tired and wrought up32 to see it now . " <p> Jim sauntered away towards the water-trough . " Say , " he called , kind of clean up a little , will you ? You know . " <p> The men went on into the house . <p> In a few minutes they emerged , carrying the stiffened body between them . It was wrapped in a comforter . They eased it up into the wagon-box . Jim walked back towards them . " Do I have to go in with you now ? " <p> " Where 's your wife , Mr. Moore ? " the deputy sheriff demanded . <p> " I do n't know , " he said wearily . " She 's somewhere around . " <p> " You 're sure you did n't kill her too ? " <p> " No . I did n't touch her . I 'll find her and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want me to go in with you now . " <p> " We 've got your statement , " the coroner said . " And by God , we 've got eyes , have n't we , Will ? Of course there 's a technical charge of murder against you , but it 'll be dismissed.Always is in this part of the country . Go kind of light on your wife , Mr. Moore . " <p> " I wo n't hurt her , " said Jim . <p> He stood and watched the buckboard jolt away . He kicked his feet reluctantly in the dust . The hot June sun showed its face over the hills and flashed viciously on the bedroom window . <p> Jim went slowly into the house , and brought out a nine-foot , loaded bull whip . He crossed the yard and walked into the barn . And as he climbed the ladder to the hay-loft , he heard the high , puppy whimpering start . <p> When Jim came out of the barn again , he carried Jelka over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Her hair was littered with bits of hay . The back of her shirtwaist was streaked with blood . <p> Jim wetted his bandana at the pipe and washed her bitten lips , and washed her face and brushed back her hair . Her dusty black eyes followed every move he made . <p> " You hurt me , " she said . " You hurt me bad . " <p> He nodded gravely . " Bad as I could without killing you . " <p> The sun shone hotly on the ground . A few blowflies buzzed about , looking for the blood . <p> Jelka 's thickened lips tried to smile . " Did you have any breakfast at all ? " <p> " No , " he said . " None at all . " <p> " Well , then , I 'll fry you up some eggs . " She struggled painfully to her feet . <p> " No . I 'll do it myself . " Her voice had a peculiarresonance in it . Her dark eyes dwelt warmly on him for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jim waited , sitting on the edge of the water-trough . He saw the smoke start out of the chimney and sail straight up into the air . In a few moments Jelka called him from the kitchen door . <p> " Come , Jim . Your breakfast . " <p> Four fried eggs and four thick slices of bacon lay on a warmed plate for him . " The coffee will be ready in a minute , " she said . <p> " Wo n't you eat ? " <p> " No . Not now . My mouth 's too sore . " <p> He ate his eggs hungrily and then looked up at her . Her black hair was combed smooth . She had on a fresh white shirtwaist .

Its not just the learning curve , though , its also the technologyon the part of the user as well . I often get frustrated in SL because it uses a lot of graphics , and sometimes the forum just does n't  materialize properly . <p> Thing is , the virtual conferences I have seen have also had a remarkable lack of diversity in its speakers . The Nines was very heavily skewed toward white men , with very little consideration for women and people of color . This is n't unique to virtual conferences , but I was disappointed because it seems like a virtual conference provides the perfect ( and less expensive ) opportunity to be more intentional about speakers . <p> The other thing about The Nines that was hard for me is that it was a very passive forum . The speakers talked , mostly non-stop for all those hours , but there was n't any opportunity to ask questions , process , talk to other folks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the conferences have got to get better about creating community and incorporating live feedback . <p> Just my two thoughts . I probably wo n't attend a virtual conference that fails to provide a diverse panel of speakers , with regard to race , gender , sexual orientation , and theological perspective . <p> Good points all although , while the nines had some elements of virtuality , I think it was also missing the greater sense of " embodiment " that conferences in virtual worlds ( like Second life ) have to offer . <p> That said , what will it mean in a virtual conference when we have the ability to " choose " our gender , ethnicity , age , and appearance ? I 'm not saying that a male choosing a female avatar is sufficient to count for diversity in a virtual conference but I do think virtual conferences ( and by extension virtual worlds ) also present unique opportunities for people to " walk in the shoes " of others and experience diversity in a new light . <p> Unfortunately , the " tech-world " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white , middle-class male . So I 'm not surprised that the convergence of church conferences and virtual reality would look the same . <p> Still , a few studies have shown that Second Life has slightly greater appeal to women than men . My own experiences have borne this out ( of those friends I know in both " real life " and Second life , more are women than men ) . So if we forge our future conferences in the world of Second Life , I wonder if that might not give women an inherent advantage ?

I 'd seen the trailer for the new Beowulf movie before , but for some reason last night I really started thinking about it for the first time . <p> I taught Beowulf to high school freshmen for many years , and have a great love and respect for the story ( or else I would not have taught it ) .

We all know what damage " blockbuster " movies can do to a good story . And casting Angelina Jolie as a " sexy " Grendels mother certainly indicates an intention to change the plot somewhat . <p> Nevertheless , after the trailer dialogue was over , and the hard-rock music kicked in over slow motion flashes of arrows raining downa warrior leaping through the air with upraised sworda dragon striking out I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I dared to be excited . <p> The fact that Neil Gaiman who also wrote Stardust , American Gods , Anansi Boys is credited for the screenplay does give some reassurance that even if it is n't very true to the original , it will be a deep and well-written script . And perhaps " sticking to the original " is overrated , too . <p> That 's because the greatest ancient stories like Beowulf , the Arthurian legend , and the Illiad transcend their bards , and become the property of everyone . They are the original open-source / folk literature . They are retold in every generation , and each retelling reveals more about the generation in which it is told than the one in which it was originally written . Tolkien was a great reteller of the story of Beowulf : its characters , plots , landscapes , and culture were the inspiration for Middle Earth and many stories , including Lord of the Rings .

" I wonder if this is perhaps a timely message for an American culture that , like the heroes of the original epic , are relentlessly driven by ambition , wealth , fame , and power .

The Ebionites are described as emphasizing the oneness of God and the humanity of Jesus as the biological son of both Mary and Joseph , who by virtue of his righteousness , was chosen by God to be the messianic " prophet like Moses " ( foretold in Deuteronomy 18:14 " 22 ) when he was anointed with the holy spirit at his baptism .

" Its not that simple . In fact , it took the best theologians in the early church almost a century of going back and forth before settling on a position ( which still was not unanimously agreed upon , and was suspect even then of having been a largely political position influenced by the Roman Empire ) .

" Ive been really stressing lately in my church history class over the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early councils and creeds . While I cant completely deny that Jesus is God , I 've had a hard time affirming it outright . I 'm beginning to realize that perhaps this is because for a long time now , I 've been far more enthralled with Jesus favorite title for himself ( Son of Man ) than with our favorite title for him ( Son of God ) . Im captivated by his humanity more than by his " divinity . " Its the idea of " Joe the God " or perhaps more accurately " Joe the Messiah " that really moves me , and I sense I 'm not alone in this either . <p> here 's a thought : The early church " fathers " struggled to find a balance between Christs divinity and his humanity . Is it possible that in our own time the pendulum has swung to far to the " divinity " side , to the point where people like me feel a strong need to advocate and emphasize Chriss humanity ? Yes , I know I sometimes take this to the extreme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in order to bring balance to the force . Oops , wrong universehows that for syncretism ? ! <p> Back to politics and a nod to the other point of view : A few months ago , long before the rise of " Joe the Plumber " my friend Trait Thompson made a case against looking for a " Joe Six Pack " to lead the nation , arguing that instead we need an FDR or a Thomas Jefferson . Its a great post , and you should read it . Ironically , we both like John McCain , but ( obviously ) come at it from different angles , as we always have ( Its great to have friends across the aisle , btw ) . <p> So I wonder if those who yearn for strong or exemplary leadership in our government are more drawn to the image of Jesus as " Son of God . " Drawing Augustine into the equation ( just for fun ) , I wonder if perhaps those who , like him , view mankind as depraved and fallen are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conversely , perhaps those with a pre ( or post ) Augustinian view of things , who see mankind as " made in the image of God " and therefore intrinsically good , look internally to humanity for our salvationcasting Jesus as the " peoples Messiah " or " Son of Man . " <p> If this is the case , following the threads begun in the age of Enlightenment , through the democratizing influence of the internet today ( think web2.0 ) , and looking toward a post-modern future with shades of Ray Kurzweils messianic/apocolyptic concept of Singularity <p> Maybe the pendulum is ready to swing in Joe the Messiahs direction . Second Coming of Christ , anyone ? <h> Joe the Messiah 7 Comments <p> Hey Neal , thanks for the blog shout-out . Its an honor for this new blogger to be quoted by a seasoned blogger such as yourself . <p> As to the divinity of Christ , I do n't  have any problem acknowledging both aspects of his nature . His humanity is how I know he relates to me , Joe the Consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I have faith that He has overcome the trials I face and through Him , I am able to do the same . <p> On a completely unrelated note , I went out to the Southern Hills pumpkin patch last week and bought a couple to take home . We took pictures of Cale out there and he absolutely loved it . Also got to spend time with Jessie , which is always awesome . <p> Im fascinated that you brought politics into this the way you did . I 'm also QUITE surprised that you favor McCain , particularly with your emphasis on the needs of the marginalized and " the average Joe " . I do n't  find that McCain , as he has conducted himself in this campaign , relates well to the average person , other than to play to the countrys fears . He hammers away at Obamas supposed " elitism " and is himself a graduate of an elite military academy in a family line of similar graduates . His wifes wealth has supported his political career . While there 's nothing inherently wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of " the average Joe " . Obama , on the other hand , did not come from a privileged background . After graduating from law school , he went to work at the grassroots level with " the average Joe and Jane " . Yes , he has a lot of political and monetary support now , but he reached that place in a much different way than McCain . Neither is superior to the other ; they are simply different . However , for one who understands " the average Joe " better , I choose Obama . <p> What does this have to do with our theology ? On that point , I think you make some interesting connections . Jesus has been so over-divinized in the doctrine and language of the Church that we have slid , by neglect , into the heresy of downplaying his humanity . We place so much more emphasis on the Person of Jesusas in Second Person of the Trinitythat we ignore his teachings . We expect our personal relationships with him to have more claim on us than how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I do n't  see anywhere in scripture where Jesus commanded us to worship him , but I see a lot of places where he commanded us to serve others as he has served us . Jesus the Exemplar , the " Son of Man " , should have as central a place in the Churchs teaching and mission as Jesus the Savior , the " Son of God " . <p> You mention your favorite author . Allow me to mention one of mine : Tolkien . In all this discussion about the nature of Jesus , I 'm reminded of the scene in LotR where Galadriel is tempted by the power of the ring . She is transfigured before Frodo and Sam into a being of terrific power and proclaims , " In place of a Dark Lord , you would have a Queen . All shall love me and despair . " Had Jesus made a big deal about his divinity , I think his Transfiguration before Peter , James , and John would have gone just as badly . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he would have been focused on his power , not on his mission . In the words of the childrens song , " he came down that we might have love " , not that we would " love him and despair " . As Paul quotes God , " My power is made perfect in weakness . " <p> Oh , God help me , I 'm procrastinating from what I should be doing right now ! Pastors do n't  have time to talk theology ; were supposed to be running churches ! = Get thee behind me , Neal ! <p> Mark my relationship with John McCain is complicated , and goes back eight years to when he ran against Bush . I do n't  really think either candidate is a true " man of the people " but I 'm still intrigued at the ways in which each claim it . <p> Tolkien is among my favorites , too great analogy ( and I always thought Frodo was the messianic oneor was it Aragorn ? ) <p> I have a great respect for McCain . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . That said , I do n't  care for the way he has conducted his campaign . Obama is no messiah , nor is he anywhere near perfect . However , he has a cooler head , tends to draw advice from a wider sampling of perspectives , and does n't  play on peoples fears the way McCain does . The lesser of two evils ? Survey says " Obama " , imho . <p> Politics aside , now . I 'm back on theology . As far as Im concerned , Frodo is a Christ figure in LotR , definitely . Okay , for everyone who will scream at that , Frodo is a Christ-like figure . He is selfless enough to appeal to the Christ in those around him : Sam , Merry , Pippin , Aragorn , and even , arguably , Boromir and Smeagol . As Frodo persists in his quest for the sake of others , they persist in their efforts for his sake . The epitome of communion in Christ , would n't you say ? <p> Oh NO ! You 're a heretic ! Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( imagine that said in my best Grady Walker voice ) . <p> The usual defense that tries to dismiss your type of questions is something like , " This is nothing new . The Fathers ( i.e. the Councils ) made the assertions they did for a reason : they researched the scriptures and debated this long ago , and their votes decided that this was heresyand that settles it . " Or does it ? Think of all the **27;204;TOOLONG the Fathers brought to the table . <p> As Phyllis Tickle mentioned in her Great Emergence , this all comes back to the issue of authority . Sola scriptura ? Tradition ? A combination thereof ? Neither ? I think the pendulum is , as you mentioned , swinging back against itself . I think mainly because we have a new set of criteria for testing sources of authority now . <p> For good or bad , the enlightenment ( and all those things leading up to it ) permanently altered our collective perspective . And now , with our position set solidly in the information age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our most fundamental assumptions . Some still never will , but I ( and apparently you too ) must . That 's not a bad thing . it is in our spiritual and physical DNA . <p> So , all that rambling was to say that I at least agree with your willingness to question the " unquestionable . " And in other words , welcome to the Matrix . <p> I know this is late to the game .. I starred this in Reader and just got back around to looking thru my stars .. <p> Just wanted to suggest you re-read the first chapter of Johns gospel . I have a hard time with the proposition that Jesus did not want to emphasize his Deity . Surely he did so by his actions all throughout his ministry , and it was confirmed by the Father at his baptism . <p> " For this is why the Word became man , and the Son of God became the Son of man : so that man , by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In brief , Jesus humanity means nothing if we deny or suppress his divinity . His divinity is precisely what gives meaning and purpose to the Incarnation . <p> The balance you speak of is of course real , but it is also necessary . For in the same way , if our Lord were not also fully human , the Incarnation and Atonement could not have the effect of making us able to become true sons of God and freed from our sin . Both are necessary . Neither should be shunned . <p> I am puzzled why you feel the need/desire to overemphasize Christs humanity . The real Good News is that we can become sons of Godthat we become more like him .

This one is perhaps less controversial ( maybe less original , too ) but still worth thinking about . It starts with a familiar metaphor from the bible itself : The church as the " body " of Christ . A body that is made up of individual members . And we want to be a healthy body , right ? <p> So , imagine the following conversation : RICK : Dude , have you heard about Joel ? He s been growing like crazy lately . <p> BILL : Yeah , I saw him just the other day . He s HUGE ! He must be 400 pounds , at least . <p> RICK : I wonder what his secret is .

That would be awesome ! <p> RICK : Hey , then you could host your own " growth " seminar . Maybe you could even write a book 218026 @qwx838026 <h> Comments <h> Fat Church 4 Comments <p> Actually , your masturbation metaphor is actually something that is thought of on the exchange of information between student and teacher . Basically , the relationship between student and teacher is akin to a romantic relationship . The exchange of information between them is like having sex . This is such a powerful relationship that it can be confused for real romantic feelings , and you see student/teacher romantic relationships form . Yes , it sounds creepy , but its the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts to the subject that is being taught . <p> So yeah , there are implications that can come out of this that are not really wanted , like your masturbation post .

@@89755461 @5255461/ 218026 @qwx838026 <p> Admittedly , calling people assholes is not the best way to start a conversation , but for better or worse , I did have a lot of conversations last week : With PhD students , with fellow MDiv students , with former students , faculty members , staff members , bloggers , anonymous emailers and letter writers , and also with the Dean of Students . <p> Many brought up the fact that , while there was some truth to what I said , it was the manner in which it was said that generated most of the controversy . This sentiment is not lost or wasted on me . Blogging is a balancing act . It is confessional : striving to capture the authentic emotions of the moment ( even frustrated angry ones ) . It is marketing : striving to say something interesting enough for people to actually read it . But unlike a diary or a newspaper , it is also conversational : striving to draw people into the conversation in a way that shows respect for all . Obviously , I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge that the post in question was a rather truncated viewpoint on what is certainly a complicated issuecommunities and relationships are always about more than gimmicky labels , limited experiences , and painting with broad strokes . Certainly , moving beyond those things is a step in the right direction . So I wanted to offer this additional insight in light of my experiences resulting from last weeks blog post . <p> I wrote a blog post about PhD Students at Princeton Theological Seminary . I said some pretty disparaging things about PhD Students at Princeton Theological Seminary . I got a lot of different responses , but here are the ones that stand out most in my mind : <p> A PhD student who sat next to me on the shuttle this week , and listened patiently . <p> Another PhD student who calmly offered affirmation and thoughtful insight from the other side . <p> Another PhD student , who made it a point to let me know he had been praying for me . <p> Another PhD student , who picked me up and took me on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles &amp; outcomes in my meeting with the dean . <p> And finally a PhD student who sent an email to the dean saying " If he goes down , I want to go down with him . " <p> If those are the kind of things PhD students at Princeton Theological Seminary will do to go out of their way for a first-year MDiv student , then the only word that comes to my mind is " Grace . " <p> For what its worth , that word applies to my meeting with the dean as well . I spent all Friday morning reading the student handbook , noting ( to my dismay ) all the ways in which I might legitimately be chastised , penalized , or censored . My undergraduate years , and my all-too-frequent conversations with another dean of students accustomed me to one-way conversations that ended in penance for me . Instead , the dean explained the tense emotions of the community in light of another recent incident ( that I had known about , but not considered when writing my post ) , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student blogs , but asked me very nicely if I might consider toning things down as they work toward reconciliation among the community. - I am entirely willing to get on board and work toward that goal . <p> Are there still assholes at Princeton Theological Seminary ? To be sure , and some days I 'm one of them . But perhaps where assholes abound , grace abounds even more . This asshole , for one , is grateful for that . <p> here 's one asshole doctoral student who thinks people who do n't  like what you 're writing should use their doctrine of free will to click away . Feel free to censor that if you think my loquacious feelings will cause more offense . <p> I honestly can not believe how pretentious and uptight people are at PTS . I mean , I know it is a seminary and all , but gee whiz . Its a freakin blog post . Of course , it is very complicated as to why ANY PhD students are assholes , but as someone who has been a PhD student since 2005 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I myself have been an asshole in the past . Mostly , we get really caught up in our studies and spend way too much time alone studying what we want , esp . in the dissertation phase , and then we can become too selfish . I 've really had to take a step back on many occasions and remind myself that my topic is n't as brilliant to everyone else as it is to me . Not everyone is as interested in renaissance music aesthetics and reception history as I am . ( Weirdos . ) <p> But the earlier comment about free will , and to that I will add free speech , is absolutely right on ! ! Since when is academia the harbinger of censorship ? ! Are n't  we IN academia because we have our own interesting , original thoughts that need to be shared ? ! Since when are we supposed to just fall in line ? ! But then , that 's from a PhD student with eight piercings , seven of which are on her face , and reddish/purpleish hair , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  get an academic job because of my free spirited behaviour , then good riddance . At least , that 's what my outside diss . reader says , too , and she 's doing well <p> Most people are never stuck by lightning . Some people are . Then there are those hardy souls who are struck by lightning on more than one occasion and live . <p> Ive been the kind of person who finds himself in the middle of situations that feel a lot like drawing lightning . Sometimes I 've caused them myself most unintentionally and some where my actions where intentional but the results were not . Other times I 've simply been in the right place at the right time to be in the middle of whatever is going on . Its not fun . Its painful , and sometimes temporarily damaging . <p> What Ive found as I look back is that there was usually one similarity among all of the situations something was wrong , and my involvement brought the problem to the light of day . Its a little like opening a festering wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air out rather than covering it up to keep the unsightly out of sight . Now do n't  get me wrong there are certainly times when Ive done something stupid and no good has come of it . But more often than not a problem has been solved that would have remained hidden because I ( someone not afraid to speak out ) was involved . <p> Also , most of the time I learned something . <p> Keep it up you bring light to the world by doing the right thing , even if it is something akin to removing the dust from something by first covering it up and causing more darkness temporarily . <p> Besides , PTS is a Presbyterian institution , right ? Are n't  we destined to fight ? = <p> I graduated from PTS in 1993 , and I 've only been back to visit once , but I have to say that I certainly experienced a culture of abuse in the PTS community . In a public debate organized by PhD students I heard a senior professor tell a junior colleague that his recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student reduced to tears in the library foyer by his faculty advisor . The PhD student who taught my intro to Preaching class almost gave me an emotional breakdown by the cruelty of her comments on a particularly poor attempt at a sermon that I had delivered in class . ( That PhD student is now an administrator at PTS ) . <p> A friend of mine recently completed a DMin at PTS and reported similar cruelties from the faculty , as have the two members from my church who have attended PTS . <p> I look back with great fondness at my seminary years . I learned a lot and I made wonderful friends . There 's no question , however , that many people in the PTS community have a really hard time demonstrating basic kindness . <p> I hope this changes , and I hope your post will be a @qwx838030 218024 @qwx838024 218028 @qwx838028

The church campus is located just three miles northwest of the capital and surrounded by half a million residents . The congregation has a healthy mix of 1800+ older and younger members , many of whom are leaders in business , medicine , community organizations and politics . The church staff includes three ordained pastors and a program staff of 12 . Westminster began a contemporary worship service in January 2006 using a praise band , computer graphics and video presentations . We 've found it challenging to remain faithful to our denominational tradition yet culturally relevant to the unchurched and those believers who are n't comfortable in our three traditional worship services . This format is constantly changing and we are n't finished yet . During the past three years , our members have engaged in critical analysis of their faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the Alpha course , Experiencing God , the Bethel series , The Bible in 90 days , and currently a year-long study of the Gospel of Matthew . This congregation has extended its faith roots deeper and is on the brink of transformation of themselves and their community . We are definitely committed to provide compassionate care to our neighbors . <p> Westminster 's Gifts , Skills and Resources for Mission Westminster has a gifted membership with proven commitment . It is financially secure , with program staff that is mature , experienced and collegial . We have excellent children 's and adult education programs . The facility is in good shape . The congregation has a strong will to change in whatever way needed to thrive in the future . Our Senior Pastor/Head of Staff , Bryan Eckelmann , arrived at Westminster only a year and a half ago with a vision for building on our strengths of worship , lay leadership and Christian education . His particular passions are spiritual transformation , missional outreach and relational ministry . Under his direction , the congregational care , adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church have been significantly strengthened , and renovations to the sanctuary and church exterior have been completed ( debt free ) . Now , the focus is turning toward outreach and reforming our methods of worship to reach a changing culture . In the neighborhoods immediately surrounding Westminster there is a diverse population with many who have yet to experience the transformative power of Jesus Christ and the love of his people . We want to change that . <p> Key Theological Issues That Are Reflected in the Ministry of Our Congregation Westminster is unique in our denomination . It is growing and attracting an increasingly younger membership and is thriving in an urban/suburban setting . It has strong Bible-centered Christian Education programs , and a mission- and justice-centered heart . It suffered through a 5-year period of financial and pastoral scandals , but has remained healthy and enthusiastic about its future . As one of the largest and wealthiest congregations in the Presbytery , WPC could succumb to complacency . God forbid ! Complacency will not meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving post-Christian culture . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of un-churched individuals with the timeless truths of the Gospel . While using methods that honor the people to whom we minister , we are called to affirm the unchanging truths of Scripture and our Confessions . The imperative of evangelism , the call to purity and the need for relevance must be maintained in prayerful tension as we seek faithful forms of worship and ministry . We trust that with the Spirit 's guidance , we will rise to this challenge . Many Westminster members are involved in civic volunteer work .

I hope I have better things to spend my money on . <p> Actually , you might hit closer to home and have a stronger point if you talked about tattoos something I do want to spend money on . <p> But I 'm not really talking about spending money to make ones self look good , here .

My Christmas non-gift list : <p> What I want more than anything else this Christmas , is to help make the world a better place for a few people in countries less wealthy than ours . <p> There is an organization called Kiva that is doing exactly that : Check out what they do on their website .

But if you 've already done one of the options above , do n't  feel obligated to wrap something unless it will somehow make your life incomplete not to . <p> That 's it .

I do n't  have a good Greek font installed to reproduce it here , but its the same word in the New Testament that we usually translate as " cleave " ( as in , a man shall leave his family and cleave to his wife ) . It also has connotations of " glue " and " stick " but at least one Greek dictionary also used a stronger , more interesting word : Weld . The image of " God as Welder " instantly conjured up ( for me , at least ) a blue-collar , working class sort of God , and borrowing a popular political meme lately , I blurted out to my Greek class , " Hey , its Joe the God ! " Not surprisingly , I got a lot of raised eyebrows on that one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , its true that John McCain has kind of been beating the whole " Joe the Plumber " thing to death lately , and all of its related offshoots ( Bob the bricklayer , Craig the Construction Worker , Sue the Waitress , ad nauseum ) but there 's an undeniable appeal to the " common person " here . <p> Its one that resonates with me . My favorite author , John Steinbeck , spent a literary career celebrating the lives of working class people in books like The Grapes of Wrath , East of Eden , and Once there Was a War . Actually , it permeates everything he wrote . My musical icon , Woody Guthrie , and folk music as a whole , celebrate the " songs of the simple folk . " In my own life , I have often championed the cause of the massesit explains my infatuation with blogging , Web2.0 technology , Wikipedia , and open-source software . <p> Back to " Joe the God . " Ive been really stressing lately in my church history class over the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early councils and creeds . While I cant completely deny that Jesus is God , I 've had a hard time affirming it outright . I 'm beginning to realize that perhaps this is because for a long time now , I 've been far more enthralled with Jesus favorite title for himself ( Son of Man ) than with our favorite title for him ( Son of God ) . Im captivated by his humanity more than by his " divinity . " Its the idea of " Joe the God " or perhaps more accurately " Joe the Messiah " that really moves me , and I sense I 'm not alone in this either . <p> here 's a thought : The early church " fathers " struggled to find a balance between Christs divinity and his humanity . Is it possible that in our own time the pendulum has swung to far to the " divinity " side , to the point where people like me feel a strong need to advocate and emphasize Chriss humanity ? Yes , I know I sometimes take this to the extreme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in order to bring balance to the force . Oops , wrong universehows that for syncretism ? ! <p> Back to politics and a nod to the other point of view : A few months ago , long before the rise of " Joe the Plumber " my friend Trait Thompson made a case against looking for a " Joe Six Pack " to lead the nation , arguing that instead we need an FDR or a Thomas Jefferson . Its a great post , and you should read it . Ironically , we both like John McCain , but ( obviously ) come at it from different angles , as we always have ( Its great to have friends across the aisle , btw ) . <p> So I wonder if those who yearn for strong or exemplary leadership in our government are more drawn to the image of Jesus as " Son of God .

Conversely , perhaps those with a pre ( or post ) Augustinian view of things , who see mankind as " made in the image of God " and therefore intrinsically good , look internally to humanity for our salvationcasting Jesus as the " peoples Messiah " or " Son of Man . " <p> If this is the case , following the threads begun in the age of Enlightenment , through the democratizing influence of the internet today ( think web2.0 ) , and looking toward a post-modern future with shades of Ray Kurzweils messianic/apocolyptic concept of Singularity <p> Maybe the pendulum is ready to swing in Joe the Messiahs direction . Second Coming of Christ , anyone ? <h> Joe the Messiah 7 Comments <p> Hey Neal , thanks for the blog shout-out . Its an honor for this new blogger to be quoted by a seasoned blogger such as yourself . <p> As to the divinity of Christ , I do n't  have any problem acknowledging both aspects of his nature . His humanity is how I know he relates to me , Joe the Consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I have faith that He has overcome the trials I face and through Him , I am able to do the same . <p> On a completely unrelated note , I went out to the Southern Hills pumpkin patch last week and bought a couple to take home . We took pictures of Cale out there and he absolutely loved it . Also got to spend time with Jessie , which is always awesome . <p> Im fascinated that you brought politics into this the way you did . I 'm also QUITE surprised that you favor McCain , particularly with your emphasis on the needs of the marginalized and " the average Joe " . I do n't  find that McCain , as he has conducted himself in this campaign , relates well to the average person , other than to play to the countrys fears . He hammers away at Obamas supposed " elitism " and is himself a graduate of an elite military academy in a family line of similar graduates . His wifes wealth has supported his political career . While there 's nothing inherently wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of " the average Joe " . Obama , on the other hand , did not come from a privileged background . After graduating from law school , he went to work at the grassroots level with " the average Joe and Jane " . Yes , he has a lot of political and monetary support now , but he reached that place in a much different way than McCain . Neither is superior to the other ; they are simply different . However , for one who understands " the average Joe " better , I choose Obama . <p> What does this have to do with our theology ? On that point , I think you make some interesting connections . Jesus has been so over-divinized in the doctrine and language of the Church that we have slid , by neglect , into the heresy of downplaying his humanity . We place so much more emphasis on the Person of Jesusas in Second Person of the Trinitythat we ignore his teachings . We expect our personal relationships with him to have more claim on us than how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I do n't  see anywhere in scripture where Jesus commanded us to worship him , but I see a lot of places where he commanded us to serve others as he has served us . Jesus the Exemplar , the " Son of Man " , should have as central a place in the Churchs teaching and mission as Jesus the Savior , the " Son of God " . <p> You mention your favorite author . Allow me to mention one of mine : Tolkien . In all this discussion about the nature of Jesus , I 'm reminded of the scene in LotR where Galadriel is tempted by the power of the ring . She is transfigured before Frodo and Sam into a being of terrific power and proclaims , " In place of a Dark Lord , you would have a Queen . All shall love me and despair . " Had Jesus made a big deal about his divinity , I think his Transfiguration before Peter , James , and John would have gone just as badly . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he would have been focused on his power , not on his mission . In the words of the childrens song , " he came down that we might have love " , not that we would " love him and despair " . As Paul quotes God , " My power is made perfect in weakness . " <p> Oh , God help me , I 'm procrastinating from what I should be doing right now ! Pastors do n't  have time to talk theology ; were supposed to be running churches ! = Get thee behind me , Neal ! <p> Mark my relationship with John McCain is complicated , and goes back eight years to when he ran against Bush . I do n't  really think either candidate is a true " man of the people " but I 'm still intrigued at the ways in which each claim it . <p> Tolkien is among my favorites , too great analogy ( and I always thought Frodo was the messianic oneor was it Aragorn ? ) <p> I have a great respect for McCain . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . That said , I do n't  care for the way he has conducted his campaign . Obama is no messiah , nor is he anywhere near perfect . However , he has a cooler head , tends to draw advice from a wider sampling of perspectives , and does n't  play on peoples fears the way McCain does . The lesser of two evils ? Survey says " Obama " , imho . <p> Politics aside , now . I 'm back on theology . As far as Im concerned , Frodo is a Christ figure in LotR , definitely . Okay , for everyone who will scream at that , Frodo is a Christ-like figure . He is selfless enough to appeal to the Christ in those around him : Sam , Merry , Pippin , Aragorn , and even , arguably , Boromir and Smeagol . As Frodo persists in his quest for the sake of others , they persist in their efforts for his sake . The epitome of communion in Christ , would n't you say ? <p> Oh NO ! You 're a heretic ! Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( imagine that said in my best Grady Walker voice ) . <p> The usual defense that tries to dismiss your type of questions is something like , " This is nothing new . The Fathers ( i.e. the Councils ) made the assertions they did for a reason : they researched the scriptures and debated this long ago , and their votes decided that this was heresyand that settles it . " Or does it ? Think of all the **27;260;TOOLONG the Fathers brought to the table . <p> As Phyllis Tickle mentioned in her Great Emergence , this all comes back to the issue of authority . Sola scriptura ? Tradition ? A combination thereof ? Neither ? I think the pendulum is , as you mentioned , swinging back against itself . I think mainly because we have a new set of criteria for testing sources of authority now . <p> For good or bad , the enlightenment ( and all those things leading up to it ) permanently altered our collective perspective . And now , with our position set solidly in the information age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our most fundamental assumptions . Some still never will , but I ( and apparently you too ) must . That 's not a bad thing . it is in our spiritual and physical DNA . <p> So , all that rambling was to say that I at least agree with your willingness to question the " unquestionable . " And in other words , welcome to the Matrix . <p> I know this is late to the game .. I starred this in Reader and just got back around to looking thru my stars .. <p> Just wanted to suggest you re-read the first chapter of Johns gospel . I have a hard time with the proposition that Jesus did not want to emphasize his Deity . Surely he did so by his actions all throughout his ministry , and it was confirmed by the Father at his baptism . <p> " For this is why the Word became man , and the Son of God became the Son of man : so that man , by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In brief , Jesus humanity means nothing if we deny or suppress his divinity . His divinity is precisely what gives meaning and purpose to the Incarnation . <p> The balance you speak of is of course real , but it is also necessary . For in the same way , if our Lord were not also fully human , the Incarnation and Atonement could not have the effect of making us able to become true sons of God and freed from our sin . Both are necessary . Neither should be shunned . <p> I am puzzled why you feel the need/desire to overemphasize Christs humanity . The real Good News is that we can become sons of Godthat we become more like him . Why would you want to make him more like us ? 218031 @qwx838031 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 218029 @qwx838029 218030 @qwx838030 218024 @qwx838024 218028 @qwx838028

This one is perhaps less controversial ( maybe less original , too ) but still worth thinking about . It starts with a familiar metaphor from the bible itself : The church as the " body " of Christ . A body that is made up of individual members . And we want to be a healthy body , right ? <p> So , imagine the following conversation : RICK : Dude , have you heard about Joel ? He s been growing like crazy lately . <p> BILL : Yeah , I saw him just the other day . He s HUGE ! He must be 400 pounds , at least . <p> RICK : I wonder what his secret is .

Like , one thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across , even if it belongs to someone else . <p> RICK : Wow . That 's deep . Hey , do you think there 's such a thing as " too big ?

That would be awesome ! <p> RICK : Hey , then you could host your own " growth " seminar . Maybe you could even write a book 218026 @qwx838026 <h> Comments <h> Fat Church 4 Comments <p> Actually , your masturbation metaphor is actually something that is thought of on the exchange of information between student and teacher . Basically , the relationship between student and teacher is akin to a romantic relationship . The exchange of information between them is like having sex . This is such a powerful relationship that it can be confused for real romantic feelings , and you see student/teacher romantic relationships form . Yes , it sounds creepy , but its the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts to the subject that is being taught . <p> So yeah , there are implications that can come out of this that are not really wanted , like your masturbation post . That 's all the more reason to explore it further instead of going the P.C. route . Just tell your church , so they do n't  receive the surprise in a way that can get you fired .

And then I busily start compiling a wish-list of things I want people to buy for me . <p> Every year I tell people that Christmas ( for Christians , at least ) is about celebrating the arrival of Christ into a desperate and hurting world . The world is still desperate and hurting , but youd never know it to look around my upscale , suburban neighborhood : I live in the land of the year-round Santa Claus . <p> Meanwhile , as I 'm sipping egg-nog in a warm house and tearing through a mountain of wrapped boxes this Christmas : <p> 16,000 children will die on Christmas day from malnutrition and hunger-related causes , most of them in poverty-stricken parts of the world .

So here 's my simple proposal to my family and close friends ( or any generous soul who was planning on giving me a gift this year ) . My Christmas non-gift list : <p> What I want more than anything else this Christmas , is to help make the world a better place for a few people in countries less wealthy than ours . <p> There is an organization called Kiva that is doing exactly that : Check out what they do on their website . They also do gift certificates , in increments as little as $25 dollars a great gift for anyone , but definitely the top of my list this year . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind if two or more family/friends combine on this one . <p> If you 're the type who absolutely *has* to put something wrapped under the tree with my name on it , then I 'd ask that at the very least , you help me make this Christmas a less commercial , less retail-driven one : Pick a book from your personal collection that you enjoyed and are ready to part with , or make me a mix-CD of *your* favorite songs ( not mine , I already have those ) . But if you 've already done one of the options above , do n't  feel obligated to wrap something unless it will somehow make your life incomplete not to . <p> That 's it . That 's really all I want for Christmas this year . <p> In a few months , I begin seminary and the journey to becoming an ordained minister .

@@89755485 @5255485/ 218026 @qwx838026 <p> At this summers PC(USA) General Assembly , I was frequently asked the question " What church do you belong to ? " This question always gave me some pause , and I 'm not sure I ever figured out the best way to answer , other than saying " Which one ? " At the moment , I belong to four different church communities with varying degrees of " membership . " <h> The Four Churches I Love <p> Faithbridge Presbyterian Church. - On paper , my connection here is strongest , but in actuality and function , the connection here is the most tenuous. - Faithbridge is the church I was a member of when I entered the ordination process , and therefore the church I remain " under care " of until after seminary. - That said , we now live 1,500 miles away from this church , have no family and few connections there , and I have n't heard from my " session liaison " in well over a year. - Faithbridge played a large part in my decision to enter ministry ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to consider myself a " member " there , even though of all four churches , this is where my membership officially resides . <p> Middlesex Presbyterian Church . This is where my family attends every Sunday morning in New Jersey , and we are " affiliate members " here. - - I consider the pastor here , Dr. Neal Presa , as " my " pastor , and the congregation is an extended family that looks out for and cares for me and my family , and we participate actively in the life of the church. - However , even though this church is a lot closer than Faithbridge , we still live 45 minutes away , making it hard to engage with the community throughout the week. - We spend long chunks of time away from this church in the summer and over the Christmas holidayssome of the most important times in the life of a church. - I also realize that this is a temporary family for us , as my time at seminary will come to an end , and we have no deep roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Second Life . This is the online community I helped organize a little over a year ago that meets in the virtual world of Second Life. - It is probably the most cutting-edge and innovative of all my church communities , and there is a great excitement among those who participate. - My wife and I can participate in this church wherever we travel , and even worship together when we are in separate cities. - There is a very real , very embodied community in this church , that has deepened my faith and my relationship with others. - However , because our denominational polity still lags behind the technology , this church can not yet be recognized as an " official " church , and there is no way ( yet ) for my children to actively participate with us. - Many members of this community are also members at other , geographically-based churches . <p> First Presbyterian Church of El Paso. - This is the church where I 'm currently serving as a summer pastoral intern. - On one hand , this church is entirely new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcoming ) , but on the other hand , El Paso is my hometown , where my wife and I- grew up , met , and married . We have more family here than anywhere else , and will almost certainly return here after seminary. - I am not a member of First Presbyterian , bu t shortly after my arrival , I was given two things : An email address ( neal@firstpres-ep.org ) and a- very professionally made and nice-looking hard-plastic , magnetic name tag. - These things may sound trivial , and yet one ( the name tag ) is traditionally recognized in church culture as an unofficial sign of membership , and the other ( the email address ) is a clear and certain hallmark of membership in the digital culture of my generation. - For this and many other reasons ( like the fact that the pastor is a former college English professor , and that the father of my high-school best friend is an elder here ) I feel very much " at home " here . <h> Serial Monogamy vs . Polygamy <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many sociologists have noted the recent trend toward " serial monogamy " in other words , people are likely to have multiple amorous relationships over the course of a lifetime , but in sequence , not all at once. - Church membership has seen a similar trend : - For most , - the era where a person might be baptized , married , and buried all in the same church community is long gone. - Still , in the 20th century , church members were generally committed to only one church at at time in a given location serial monogamy . <p> So does that make me a polygamist when it comes to my own church membership ? - Am I " cheating " on the church where my membership resides by seeking to fulfill spiritual needs elsewhere , or by contributing my time &amp; talents elsewhere ? - Perhaps this is where the metaphor breaks down , but I do feel a certain guilt in the fact that I " need " not just one alternate church community , but no less than four ! <p> Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something necessary and good for my faith journey. - I like to think that I have something to contribute to each of them as well. - And yet all also have shortcomings yes , all churches have " shortcomings " but here I do not mean the sort that results from human failing or lack of effort the shortcomings in this case are all hurdles of geography , technology , or institutional structure. - They are shortcomings for which no solution currently exists , other than " polygamous " or at least " promiscuous " notions of church membership . <h> Toward Post-Modern Membership <p> So , in case you had n't  noticed yet , fixed boundaries are rather difficult for those of us who grew up in a post-modern world , and classic notions of membership seem to be built on expectations of exclusive fealty. - Contrast this with membership in the very post-modern world of the internet : - I have " officially joined " facebook , twitter , Second Life , Google , Wikipedia , FourSquare , Presbymergent , BrightKite , Amazon.com , Ebay , ReverbNation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " social networks . " - In fact , I was required to join each of them before I could " fully " participate in the life of their respective communities . This is a fixed boundary of sorts. - And yet it is fluid : - None of them seemed to object to my membership in of any of the others in fact , the really smart ( and successful ) ones have found ways to actually help me integrate my participation accross platforms so that the unique strengths of each community can benefit the others. - This is the paradigm of " membership " that I think most people in my generation embrace , whether consciously or not . <p> So what would it look like if church membership took a page from the Web2.0 playbook ? - I think the greatest fear that might be voiced is one against fragmentation and confusion. - Promiscuous membership might indeed play into our existing consumerist tendencies. - And yet , is " church collecting " really worse than " church hopping ? " - - Another fear might be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many places to be of any use to one. - - - This is certainly a valid fear. - But I think that here again , skillful integration might be the key. - Most aspects of our lives are balancing acts to begin with , and church communities that find ways to complement and contribute to one another are more likely to survive than those who prefer their members live in isolated fidelity to one community. - I participate in the Amazon.com community far less frequently than I do in the twitter community , but when I need an objective and detailed book review , 140 characters does n't  quite cut it. - But once I find the review , chances are Ill post a short-link to it on twitter for others to follow and thus value is added to both communities . <h> Epilogue <p> I would love to say that from here I will now ride happily into the sunset with my four beautiful church communities in tow and live happily ever after but I acknowledge were not quite there yet. - I suspect that my membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than others. - But I also see hopeful potential- in an expanding understanding of " membership " for me , for my family , and especially for a denomination in dire need of new approaches and new forms of collaboration. - After all , the one thing my four church communities have in common is that they all share a common name , " Presbyterian .

Better than a friend in Loudoun Country , VA who " goes to " one church for the preaching , one for Sunday School , one for coffee hour , and one for Bible study .

I agree that membership does n't  hold significant meaning for the average Joe , but when push comes to shove , membership in PC(USA) means a vote . At that point , I would like some form of commitment . what is the standard ? Residence in the community , number of Sundays in worship , a pledge honored ? <p> Rev. Rebba Voting is one of my favorite things about being Presbyterian ! <p> Unfortunately , the only church where I technically " can " vote right now is the church I 'm never around when the voting happens . All the churches where my vote might actually be well-informed and productive , I cant vote in . <p> SoI agree that some form of commitment is a good idea . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one organization at a time . What 's the standard ? How about public profession of commitment , and actually showing up to vote when the voting happens ? This may sound like a lax standard ( and it is , quite intentionally ) but in my experience people tend to sort themselves out this way anyhow : Those who care about an issue ( or the community ) will be there to vote ; those who do n't  care , wo n't show . If anything , lax standards of membership allows more people who *do* care to actually participate . The problem , of course , is that the people who care passionately , but disagree with you on any given issue , will also show up = <p> In the open source community , membership in any given project is largely " self selecting . " I think this is a good place to begin . You say you want to be a member ? Ok , you 're a member . If we never see you again after you joinhmmmmwe already have that problem even with fixed membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if I 'm in a community in Vermont , and suddenly a bunch of people from Texas decide to take over my community by merely showing up and voting ? Well , let 's not flatter ourselves into thinking that were really *that* important . There will always be the oddball griefer , but for the most part , over time , only those who care about the community will repeatedly make the effort to vote . <p> Hmmmhaving read over what I just wrote , Im now thinking of exceptions and all sorts of worst-case scenarios . For example , in the case of the current PCUSA debates over marriage and ordination , I actually could see an organized group of people leading a push to go " vote " in any body considering one of these controversial questions , not having ever been part of the community . <p> So maybe here 's my " revised " answer : Criteria for a " loose " ( but not quite as loose as my last post ) membership might be something like " sustained participation in the community " for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any number of ways , but the main thing here is that its not exclusive membership it recognizes that a person can be a committed and thoughtful participant ( and voter ) in more than one worshiping community , and that that 's ok. 218031 @qwx838031 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 218029 @qwx838029 218030 @qwx838030 218024 @qwx838024 218028 @qwx838028

" - Since it marks some major changes ( or clarification ) in my thinking , and tracks some things I 've been involved with recently , I thought it might be good to post here : <p> Three months ago , I embarked on a project to gather together Presbyterians in the virtual reality world of Second Life , and with them form a community of people who pray together , fellowship together , support and encourage one another , and reach out to others in the name of Christ. - What initially drew me into this project was my ongoing commitment to explore the intersection between new technologies and the church , my commitment to exploring what it means to be a Presbyterian in a post-modern culture , and my desire to follow Gods universal call to evangelism in all places. - Honestly , I was also a bit surprised to find that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the only major denominations not already organized and taking advantage of the opportunities to do all of the above in a global community with over 1.3 million participants , many or most of whom are what would be considered " unchurched " in either virtual or actual reality . <p> Despite the somewhat bizzare and otherworldly , high-tech nature of Second Life , as I began to encounter people there ( Presbyterian and otherwise ) , have conversations with them about God , faith , and the church , and as our community began to meet regularly for conversation and prayer , I noticed that the skills I was drawing upon most were not my " high tech " ones , nor even my sense of " cultural relevancy. " - Rather , it was my experiences in a real-world New Church Development for several years , and snippets of advice I had gleaned from various New Church Development and Evangelism conferences ( that I had often scorned or considered outmoded at the time ) that I now found myself straining to remember , and , when implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that the shared wisdom and experiences of those who have gone before me and worked hard to plant worshipping communities however different they may initially appear from my own context are of great value , and that solid principles of organization and leadership often transcend age , location , and context . <p> There are two reasons I would like to attend this NCD Discernment event. - The first is short term : - It is the hope that by spending a few days with those who have done what I am attempting to do , I can listen attentively and glean some useful guidance about church planting , about myself , and about following Gods call into difficult places. - In this , I hope that I can bring some benefit to the virtual-reality community where I feel God is currently calling me to lead. - The second reason is a more long-term one : - While I have always felt called to evangelism , mission , and community building , I have generally expected to do this work independently , " outside " of denominational structures. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer my denomination , my denomination would likely not have much to offer me. - My experiences in the past few months have led me to question this position , and to be more open to the idea that I , and any community I might someday lead no matter how " different " or " outside the box " would stand to benefit greatly from the collective wisdom and experience of those who have done NCD work in the PCUSA. - Now , with ears that are more " ready to hear , " I hope that this event can help me better discern the nature of my calling in relation to my denomination , and whether NCD work in the PCUSA is where God is leading me upon my graduation from seminary . 218026 @qwx838026 <h> Comments <h> SecondLife , New Church Development in the PCUSA , and Discerning my Calling 3 Comments <p> Good luck on the application .

Thank you , if you have time ! <p> Thanks , Sabio I think that people in my circles think in terms of post-modernism whether they want to or not , whether they realize it or not , and as much as some of them try to oppose it . We are , after all , a post-modern people , despite our protestations to the contrary . <p> But that might not be what you were getting at certainly there are many in the church who think post-modernism is evil , and some who just think its the latest trend they can outlast . <p> If you can look past those voices ( and most of them do seem to be the ones in " charge " of the institutional church at the moment ) I think you 'll find a whole range of post-modern Christian communities beginning to flourish .

And I seen your light , " he explained . <p> " Well , I got a right to have a light . You go on get outa my room . I ai n't wanted in the bunkhouse , and you ai n't wanted in my room . " <p> " Why ai n't you wanted ? " Lennie asked . <p> " ' Cause I 'm black . They play cards in there , but I ca n't play because I 'm black . They say I stink .

" <p> Crooks stared at Lennie , and he reached behind him and took down the spectacles and adjusted them over his pink ears and stared again . " I do n't know what you 're doin ' in the barn anyway , " he complained . " You ai n't no skinner . They 's no call for a bucker to come into the barn at all . You ai n't no skinner . You ai n't got nothing to do with the horses . " <p> " The pup , " Lennie repeated . " I come to see my pup . " <p> " Well , go see your pup , then . Do n't come in a place where you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He advanced a step into the room , then remembered and backed to the door again . " I looked at ' em a little .

" <p> " Oh , she do n't care . She let 's me . " Lennie had moved into the room again . <p> Crooks scowled , but Lennie 's disarming smile defeated him . " Come on in and set a while , " Crooks said . " ' Long as you wo n't get out and leave me alone , you might as well set down . " His tone was a little more friendly . " All the boys gone into town , huh ? " <p> " All but old Candy . He just sets in the bunkhouse sharpening his pencil and sharpening and figuring . " <p> Crooks continued . " Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell he 's talkin ' about . Ai n't that so ? " He leaned forward , boring Lennie with his deep eyes . " Ai n't that so ? " <p> " Yeah ... sometimes . " <p> " Jus ' talks on , an ' you do n't know what the hell it 's all about ? " <p> " Yeah ... sometimes . But ... not always . " <p> Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk . " I ai n't a southern Negro , " he said . " I was born right here in California . My old man had a chicken ranch , ' bout ten acres . The white kids come to play at our place , an ' sometimes I went to play with them , and some of them was pretty nice . My ol ' man did n't like that . I never knew till long later why he did n't like that . But I know now . " He hesitated , and when he spoke again his voice was softer . " There was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't a colored man on this ranch an ' there 's jus ' one family in Soledad . " He laughed . " If I say something , why it 's just a nigger sayin ' it . " <p> Lennie asked , " How long you think it 'll be before them pups will be old enough to pet ? " Crooks laughed again . " A guy can talk to you an ' be sure you wo n't go blabbin ' . Couple of weeks an ' them pups 'll be all right . George knows what he 's about . Jus ' talks , an ' you do n't understand nothing . " He leaned forward excitedly . " This is just a nigger talkin ' , an ' a busted-back nigger . So it do n't mean nothing , see ? You could n't remember it anyways . I seen it over an ' over- a guy talkin ' to another guy and it do n't make no difference if he do n't hear or understand . The thing is , they 're talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It do n't make no difference , no difference . " His excitement had increased until he pounded his knee with this hand . George can tell you screwy things , and it do n't matter . It 's just the " talking . It 's just bein ' with another guy . That 's all . He paused . " <p> His voice grew soft and persuasive . " S'pose George do n't come back no more . S'pose he took a powder and just ai n't coming back . What 'll you do then ? " <p> Lennie 's attention came gradually to what had been said . " What ? " he demanded . <p> " I said s'pose George went into town tonight and you never heard of him no more . " Crooks pressed forward some kind of private victory . " Just s'pose that , " he repeated . <p> " He wo n't do it , " Lennie cried . " George would n't do nothing like that . I been with George a long a time . He 'll come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't you think he will ? " <p> Crooks ' face lighted with pleasure in his torture . " Nobody ca n't tell what a guy 'll do , " he observed calmly . " Le 's say he wants to come back and ca n't . S'pose he gets killed or hurt so he ca n't come back . " <p> Lennie struggled to understand . " George wo n't do nothing like that , " he repeated . " George is careful . He wo n't get hurt . He ai n't never been hurt , ' cause he 's careful . " <p> Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers . Jus ' set down , he said . " George ai n't hurt . " <p> Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg . " Ai n't nobody goin ' to talk no hurt to George , " he grumbled . <p> Crooks said gently , " Maybe you can see now . You got George . You know he 's goin ' to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't go into the bunkhouse and play rummy ' cause you was black . How 'd you like that ? S'pose you had to sit out here an ' read books . Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark , but then you got to read books . Books ai n't no good . A guy needs somebody- to be near him . " He whined , " A guy goes nuts if he ai n't got nobody . Do n't make no difference who the guy is , long 's he 's with you . I tell ya , " he cried , " I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an ' he gets sick . " <p> Crooks said , " I did n't mean to scare you . He 'll come back . I was talkin ' about myself . A guy sets alone out here at night , maybe readin ' books or thinkin ' or stuff like that . Sometimes he gets thinkin ' , an ' he got nothing to tell him what 's so an ' what ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do n't know whether it 's right or not . He ca n't turn to some other guy and ast him if he sees it too . He ca n't tell . He got nothing to measure by . I seen things out here . I was n't drunk . I do n't know if I was asleep . If some guy was with me , he could tell me I was asleep , an ' then it would be all right . But I jus ' do n't know . " Crooks was looking across the room now , looking toward the window . <p> Lennie said miserably , " George wu n't go away and leave me . I know George wu n't do that . " <p> The stable buck went on dreamily , " I remember when I was a little kid on my old man 's chicken ranch . Had two brothers . They was always near me , always there . Used to sleep right in the same room , right in the same bed- all three . Had a strawberry patch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the alfalfa on a sunny morning . My brothers 'd set on a fence rail an ' watch ' em- white chickens they was . " <p> Gradually Lennie 's interest came around to what was being said . George says we 're gon na have alfalfa for the rabbits . <p> " What rabbits ? " <p> " We 're gon na have rabbits an ' a berry patch . " <p> " You 're nuts . " <p> " We are too . You ast George . " <p> " You 're nuts . " Crooks was scornful . " I seen hunderds of men come by on the road an ' on the ranches , with their bindles on their back an ' that same damn thing in their heads . Hunderds of them . They come , an ' they quit an ' go on ; an ' every damn one of ' em 's got a little piece of land in his head . An ' never a God damn one of ' em ever gets it . Just like heaven . Ever'body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of books out here . Nobody never gets to heaven , and nobody gets no land . It 's just in their head . They 're all the time talkin ' about it , but it 's jus ' in their head . " He paused and looked toward the open door , for the horses were moving restlessly and the halter chains clinked . A horse whinnied . " I guess somebody 's out there , " Crooks said . " Maybe Slim . Slim comes in sometimes two , three times a night . Slim 's a real skinner . He looks out for his team . " He pulled himself painfully upright and moved toward the door . " That you , Slim ? " he called . <p> Candy 's voice answered . " Slim went in town . Say , you seen Lennie ? " <p> " Ya mean the big guy ? " <p> " Yeah . Seen him around any place ? " <p> " He 's in here , " Crooks said shortly . He went back to his bunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bald wrist and looking blindly into the lighted room . He made no attempt to enter . " Tell ya what , Lennie . I been figuring out about them rabbits . " <p> Crooks said irritably , " You can come in if you want . " <p> Candy seemed embarrassed . " I do ' know . ' Course , if ya want me to . " <p> " Come on in . If ever'body 's comin ' in , you might just as well . " It was difficult for Crooks to conceal his pleasure with anger . <p> Candy came in , but he was still embarrassed , " You got a nice cozy little place in here , " he said to Crooks . " Must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way . " <p> " Sure , " said Crooks . " And a manure pile under the window . Sure , it 's swell . " <p> Lennie broke in , " You said about them rabbits . " <p> Candy leaned against the wall beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been here a long time , " he said . " An ' Crooks been here a long time . This 's the first time I ever been in his room . " <p> Crooks said darkly , " Guys do n't come into a colored man 's room very much . Nobody been here but Slim . Slim an ' the boss . " <p> Candy quickly changed the subject . " Slim 's as good a skinner as I ever seen . " <p> Lennie leaned toward the old swamper . " About them rabbits , " he insisted . <p> Candy smiled . " I got it figured out . We can make some money on them rabbits if we go about it right . " <p> " But I get to tend ' em , " Lennie broke in . " George says I get to tend ' em . He promised . " <p> Crooks interrupted brutally . " You guys is just kiddin ' yourself . You 'll talk about it a hell of a lot , but you wo n't get no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you out in a box . Hell , I seen too many guys . Lennie here 'll quit an ' be on the road in two , three weeks . Seems like ever ' guy got land in his head . " <p> Candy rubbed his cheek angrily . " You God damn right we 're gon na do it . George says we are . We got the money right now . " " Yeah ? " said Crooks . " An ' where 's George now ? In town in a whore house . That 's where your money 's goin ' . Jesus , I seen it happen too many times . I seen too many guys with land in their head . They never get none under their hand . " <p> Candy cried , " Sure they all want it . Everybody wants a little bit of land , not much . Jus ' som'thin ' that was his . Som'thin ' he could live on and there could n't nobody throw him off of it . I never had none . I planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they was n't my crops , and when I harvested ' em , it was n't none of my harvest . But we gon na do it now , and do n't you make no mistake about that . George ai n't got the money in town . That money 's in the bank . Me an ' Lennie an ' George . We gon na have a room to ourself . We 're gon na have a dog an ' rabbits an ' chickens . We 're gon na have green corn an ' maybe a cow or a goat . " He stopped , overwhelmed with his picture . <p> Crooks asked , " You say you got the money ? " <p> " Damn right . We got most of it . Just a little bit more to get . Have it all in one month . George got the land all picked out , too . " <p> Crooks reached around and explored his spine with his hand . " I never seen a guy really do it , " he said . " I seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' time a whore house or a blackjack game took what it takes . " He hesitated . " ... If you ... guys would want a hand to work for nothing- just his keep , why I 'd come an ' lend a hand . I ai n't so crippled I ca n't work like a son-of-a-bitch if I want to . " <p> " Any you boys seen Curley ? " <p> They swung their heads toward the door . Looking in was Curley 's wife . Her face was heavily made up . Her lips were slightly parted . She breathed strongly , as though she had been running . <p> " Curley ai n't been here , " Candy said sourly . <p> She stood still in the doorway , smiling a little at them , rubbing the nails of one hand with the thumb and forefinger of the other . And her eyes traveled from one face to another . " They left all the weak ones here , " she said finally . " Think I do n't know where they all went ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Lennie watched her , fascinated ; but Candy and Crooks were scowling down away from her eyes . Candy said , " Then if you know , why you want to ast us where Curley is at ? " <p> She regarded them amusedly . " Funny thing , " she said . " If I catch any one man , and he 's alone , I get along fine with him . But just let two of the guys get together an ' you wo n't talk . Jus ' nothing but mad . " She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips . " You 're all scared of each other , that 's what . Ever ' one of you 's scared the rest is goin ' to get something on you . " <p> After a pause Crooks said , " Maybe you better go along to your own house now . We do n't want no trouble . " <p> " Well , I ai n't giving you no trouble . Think I do n't like to talk to somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stick in that house alla time ? " <p> Candy laid the stump of his wrist on his knee and rubbed it gently with his hand . He said accusingly , " You got ta husban ' . You got no call foolin ' aroun ' with other guys , causin ' trouble . " <p> The girl flared up . " Sure I got ta husban ' . You all seen him . Swell guy , ai n't he ? Spends all his time sayin ' what he 's gon na do to guys he do n't like , and he do n't like nobody . Think I 'm gon na stay in that two-by-four house and listen how Curley 's gon na lead with his left twicet , and then bring in the ol ' right cross ? ' One-two , ' he says . ' Jus ' the ol ' one-two an ' he 'll go down . ' " She paused and her face lost its sullenness and grew interested . " Say- what happened to Curley 's han ' ? " <p> There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he coughed . " Why ... Curley ... he got his han ' caught in a machine , ma'am . Bust his han ' . " <p> She watched for a moment , and then she laughed . " Baloney !

Who bust him ? " <p> Candy repeated sullenly , " Got it caught in a machine . " <p> " Awright , " she said contemptuously . " Awright , cover ' i 'm up if ya wanta . Whatta I care ? You bindle bums think you 're so damn good . Whatta ya think I am , a kid ? I tell ya I could of went with shows . Not jus ' one , neither . An ' a guy tol ' me he could put me in pitchers ....

Standin ' here talkin ' to a bunch of bindle stiffs- a nigger an ' a dum-dum and a lousy ol ' sheep- an ' likin ' it because they ai n't nobody else . " <p> Lennie watched her , his mouth half open . Crooks had retired into the terrible protective dignity of the Negro . But a change came over old Candy . He stood up suddenly and knocked his nail keg over backward . " I had enough , " he said angrily . " You ai n't wanted here . We told you you ai n't . An ' I tell ya , you got floozy idears about what us guys amounts to . You ai n't got sense enough in that chicken head to even see that we ai n't stiffs . S'pose you get us canned . S'pose you do . You think we 'll hit the highway an ' look for another lousy two-bit job like this . You do n't know that we got our own ranch to go to , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . We got ta house and chickens an ' fruit trees an ' a place a hunderd time prettier than this . An ' we got fren 's , that 's what we got . Maybe there was a time when we was scared of gettin ' canned , but we ai n't no more . We got our own lan ' , and it 's ours , an ' we c'n go to it . " <p> Curley 's wife laughed at him . " Baloney , " she said . " I seen too many you guys . If you had two bits in the worl ' , why you 'd be in gettin ' two shots of corn with it and suckin ' the bottom of the glass . I know you guys . " <p> Candy 's face had grown redder and redder , but before she was done speaking , he had control of himself . He was the master of the situation . " I might of knew , " he said gently . " Maybe you just better go along an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to you at all . We know what we got , and we do n't care whether you know it or not . So maybe you better jus ' scatter along now , ' cause Curley maybe ai n't gon na like his wife out in the barn with us ' bindle stiffs . ' " <p> She looked from one face to another , and they were all closed against her . And she looked longest at Lennie , until he dropped his eyes in embarrassment . Suddenly she said , " Where 'd you get them bruises on your face ? " <p> Lennie looked up guiltily . " Who- me ? " <p> " Yeah , you . " <p> Lennie looked to Candy for help , and then he looked at his lap again . " He got his han ' caught in a machine , " he said . <p> Curley 's wife laughed . " O.K. , Machine . I 'll talk to you later . I like machines . " <p> Candy broke in . " You let this guy alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm gon na tell George what you says . George wo n't have you messin ' with Lennie . " <p> Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her . " I had enough , " he said coldly . " You got no rights comin ' in a colored man 's room . You got no rights messing around in here at all . Now you jus ' get out , an ' get out quick . If you do n't , I 'm gon na ast the boss not to ever let you come in the barn no more . " She turned on him in scorn . " Listen , Nigger , " she said . " You know what I can do to you if you open your trap ? " <p> Crooks stared hopelessly at her , and then he sat down on his bunk and drew into himself . <p> She closed on him . " You know what I could do ? " <p> Crooks seemed to grow smaller , and he pressed himself against the wall . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your place then , Nigger . I could get you strung up on a tree so easy it ai n't even funny . " <p> Crooks had reduced himself to nothing . There was no personality , no ego- nothing to arouse either like or dislike . He said , " Yes , ma'am , " and his voice was toneless . <p> For a moment she stood over him as though waiting for him to move so that she could whip at him again ; but Crooks sat perfectly still , his eyes averted , everything that might be hurt drawn in . She turned at last to the other two . <p> Old Candy was watching her , fascinated . " If you was to do that , we 'd tell , " he said quietly . " We 'd tell about you framin ' Crooks . " <p> Candy stepped over to him . " Do n't you worry none , " he said . " I jus ' heard the guys comin ' in . George 'll be in the bunkhouse right now , I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You better go home now , " he said quietly . " If you go right now , we wo n't tell Curley you was here . " <p> She appraised him coolly . " I ai n't sure you heard nothing . " <p> " Better not take no chances , " he said . " If you ai n't sure , you better take the safe way . " <p> She turned to Lennie . " I 'm glad you bust up Curley a little bit . He got it comin ' to him . Sometimes I 'd like to bust him myself . " She slipped out the door and disappeared into the dark barn . And while she went through the barn , the halter chains rattled , and some horses snorted and some stamped their feet . <p> Crooks seemed to come slowly out of the layers of protection he had put on . " Was that the truth what you said about the guys come back ? " he asked . <p> " Sure . I heard ' em . " <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gate banged , " Candy said , and he went on , " Jesus Christ , Curley 's wife can move quiet . I guess she had a lot of practice , though . " <p> Crooks avoided the whole subject now . " Maybe you guys better go , " he said . " I ai n't sure I want you in here no more . A colored man got to have some rights even if he do n't like ' em . " <p> The three men went out of the door . As they went through the barn the horses snorted and the halter chains rattled . <p> Crooks sat on his bunk and looked at the door for a moment , and then he reached for the liniment bottle . He pulled out his shirt in back , poured a little liniment in his pink palm and , reaching around , he fell slowly to rubbing his back .

I said I did n't  know , but that we did n't  have anything scheduled in the building for that night . We have several groups and three different churches that share our facilities , so I 'm not even entirely sure which prayer meeting he was talking about . He was disappointed , but seemed to understand . <p> Just as I started to get into my car , he paused and said , " Unlessyoud like to pray with me ?

I told him that ordinarily I would have been happy to ( would I , though ? ) but that I was on my way to a meeting where people were expecting me .

I hope his need for prayer wasnt borne out of desperation . I mumbled a quick prayer for him in the car on the way to my writers group meeting ( where no one was really " expecting " me ) , but that still did n't  assuage my guilt .

fame ? happiness ? family ? ) and I suspect that those who advocate a prosperity gospel would define it more charitably than those who critique it. - But a desire for a better " quality of life " seems to be a motivating factor however one defines it , and this seems largely an outgrowth of the fact that there is now more lifetime to occupy ones self with. - - That said , there are still things that plague our modern civilizationcancer , natural disasters , and those accidents we have not learned to prevent or cure. - Often , our prayers are still turned to these things , asking God to intervene miraculously where our technology can not , and placing our hope in an afterlife when those close to us die . <p> Bottom Line : - In the modern church , faith and prayer are still focused on the widespread concerns of suffering , death , and the afterlife , but we are now in a time of transition as life becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith more on quality of life than on quantity ( or at least more and more people are starting to do this ) . <p> Church Future <p> Predicting the future is nothing if not controversial. - The future I am about to paint is no exception to this , and so I should say at the outset that I take my cues unapologetically from Ray Kurzweil , and I believe his record of accuracy speaks for itself. - - You can disagree with me , but please do n't  label my views of the future as unrealistic or impossible until you 've thoroughly read what the man has to say ! - Let us proceed : <p> Continuing the trend of the past segment , life spans will continue to increase ( dramatically ) and medical science will continue to advance ( dramatically ) . - There will , of course , be new challenges , new threats , new dangers , and new manifestations of evil but sickness , disease , and ultimately even death will not be among them. - Few bodily accidents will be fatal or beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an eternal afterlife , the early/medieval focus of Christianity will finally be brought to a close. - At this point , I believe that the Prosperity Gospel , in whatever form it will have evolved to , will be dominant , and will be the orthodox representation of Christianity ( although there will still be small pockets of dissenting theology , as there always have been ) . - Christians may still disagree about what kind of prosperity we ought to pray for , and what kind of prosperity God grants but " quality of life " will be the last remaining frontier beyond our control , and the place where Gods miraculous intervention is still most needed and sought after . <p> However , it is in this era that a challenge to the Prosperity Gospel will finally arise : - It will finally be made irrelevant by the same technological and cultural forces that made its predecessor irrelevant. - Prosperity ( however it is defined ) will begin to become widespread. - Converging developments across a wide array of fields will contribute to the ultimate breakdown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an era of abundant food , energy , material resources , and information ( in our own era , the economics of abundance are already breaking down traditional paradigms in information management ) . - The prayers and faith of Christians will begin once again to shift toward whatever aspects of their lives seem beyond their control , whatever ways in which they feel a need for miraculous , divine intervention . <p> Bottom Line : - In the future church , faith and prayer are no longer focused on sickness , suffering , and death , because these are no longer significant factors in peoples lives. - Quality of life ( prosperity ) is the dominant concern of Christianity , but we are again in a time of transition as prosperity itself becomes widespread , and no longer beyond the reach of most Christians . <p> All this raises a good question : - If " technology " supplies all of humanitys needs , will there still be a need for God ?

@@89755497 @5255497/ 218025 @qwx838025 218026 @qwx838026 <p> When ABCs Lost first reared its head a couple of seasons ago , I did n't  notice . Or if I did , I thought , " HmmSurvivor without the reality part I like so much . " But eventually the combination of deserted island ( which I 'm a sucker for ) , religion , philosophy , and cliffhanger was too much and I caved . Amy and I rented the first two seasons on DVD , and spent way too much time watching them late into the night until we were caught up . <p> How cool is it that my favorite character ( Locke ) shares my last name ? And when another character named Rousseau surfaces , and then a Scotsman named Desmond Hume , that 's when I start to get really excited and say things like , " Wheres Voltaire ? The Enlightenment party would n't be complete without him ! " <p> I was looking in the wrong direction . Last night , they introduced ( albeit in an abstract sort of way ) someone far more elevated in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick summary : Sawyer ( who shares a name with someone else in my family ) is reading Of Mice and Men while in prison ( flashback ) and throws around the usual references to George , the farm , etc . Later ( in real time ) he tosses out the references again to ( possible ) antagonist , Ben , who pretends not to get it , but at the very end quotes the whole " lonely " speech made by Crooks to Lennie in chapter four of OMAM , and then the episode ends . <p> So . From what I can tell so far , the writers of Lost are pretty deliberate in their inclusion of literary , historical , and cultural references . I doubt they 're just trying to paint Sawyer and Ben as " smarter than we think they are . " Why Steinbeck ? Why Of Mice and Men ? <p> Steinbecks whole premise with OMAM , and a big part of his developing philosophy of " non-teleological thinking " is the notion that ( forgive the vulgar expression ) " shit happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , but he probably would have at least appreciated the effort . And when it happens , is it providence ? Coincidence ? The unyielding hand of fate ? Consider these lines from the Robert Burns poem where Steinbeck got the title : <p> We ( Lost fans ) spend countless water-cooler hours trying to answer questions like : What 's real and what 's not real ? What 's the truth ? What 's going to happen next ? Why are they here ? Why is all this happening ? And we read so much into every little action , every little word of every character . There just HAVE to be answers and " enlightenment " waiting at the end of this tunnel . Right ? <p> Perhaps not . Perhaps this whole Steinbeck insert is the writers way of telling us , " there is no point , there is no purpose , there is no truth . Things just happen . You cant stop them , you cant predict them , you cant change them . " <p> At the end of OMAM , Lennie dies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better life . George walks away with no answers . No meaning . Steinbeck almost titled the novel " Something That Happened . " And perhaps at the end of the day , all the crazy , convoluted plot twists that make Lost will be justsome things that happened . <p> Or maybe I 'm just reading way too much into a few minor words from a few minor characters <h> Lost &amp; Steinbeck 6 Comments <p> And this post , after last nights episode of " Lost " so good ! I love the analysis of OMAM and Steinbeck . Even better since I 'm reading EoE for the first time ( can you belive it ? Seriously ) . I love your estimation that quite possibly all this could be just " stuff that happened " . Wont we all feel like idiots then ? <p> I 'm only 1/6 of the way into the novel so far , so I better keep in mind that Steinbeck writes with this " shit happens " idea of realityI hope I 'm not too disappointed in the book when its all over ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Locke " and how they relate to , shall we say , Grady Lockes family . But now that is totally going to crack me up . <p> I 'm taking Cultures of India this semester and we cant believe how much the plot also parallels with Hinduism . We first began looking at the connections when we were learning about Dharma . But the final progression of faith involves letting all the measurements of good and power you recognized in your life fall away , until you die to your family altogether and they hold a funeral for you . You do n't  even hold religion anymore . <p> Then , in another class , we had a great speaker from Pitt about psychadelic drugs . You can bet we enjoyed the sweatlodge episode after that ! <p> Wowthat never occurred to me , but DUH ! ? ? ! Dharma InitiativeHow did I miss that one ? And what you 're saying about the " final progression of faith " would make sense too , as all the main characters were at crucial " separation " points with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not holding religion anymore , that definitely puts Lockes " faith " struggles into an interesting light . <p> What a great show . I 'm continually impressed all the more , because I just did n't  think that network television was capable of generating decent quality writing . Oh well , not the first time Ive been wrong <p> So whatd you think of last nights episode ? I think they had to kill off Echo because it was too hard to write for a deep character . The writing in general last night sucked . Prooving your point about network . Time to go download some more Weeds at ITunes . <p> But now I guess I know they 're going to kill off Echo . The priest . Definitely in keeping with your idea that religion must be abandoned to achieve Dharma . <p> Actually , on second thought , I 'm kind of glad they knocked off Echo ( though I do n't  know how yet , so do n't  tell me until tomorrow ) . I really , really disliked it when he just blindly took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of BF Skinners behaviorism at work than " faith . " Locke was right to questionquestioning is a vital and necessary part of faith . Perhaps in his blind , unquestioning obedience , Echo came to personify " institutionalized religion " ( which values obedience and heirarchy ) more than the blend of rationalism and mysticism ( like Lockes sweatlodge experience ) which I believe is a more spiritually healthy expression of faith . <p> I 'll let you know if I still feel this way @qwx838030 218024 @qwx838024 218028 @qwx838028

After all , what the use of all that pondering if one ca n't spout off what one ponders in a blog , even if it is pondering about silence : ) <p> Neal , knowing you , this is a noble endeavor , indeed . However , to your friends , your opinions ( while not always mutually agreed with ) are welcome and provide ample fodder for a good conversation . Ill be interested to read the resutls of your experiment in this blog . <p> I guess it would be inappropriate to this post if I give my unsolicited opinion ? ? Hee . But Its ok to use big words . Language should be used and you do n't  want to fall into the trap of censorship = And no one knows if you 're talking to yourself as long as no ones around . Good luck Neal .

Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up the slopes of the Gabilan Mountains , and the hilltops were rosy in the sun . But by the pool among the mottled sycamores , a pleasant shade had fallen . <p> A water snake glided smoothly up the pool , twisting its periscope head from side to side ; and it swam the length of the pool and came to the legs of a motionless heron that stood in the shallows . A silent head and beak lanced down and plucked it out by the head , and the beak swallowed the little snake while its tail waved frantically . <p> A far rush of wind sounded and a gust drove through the tops of the trees like a wave . The sycamore leaves turned up their silver sides , the brown , dry leaves on the ground scudded a few feet . And row on row of tiny wind waves flowed up the pool 's green surface . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the clearing was quiet again . The heron stood in the shallows , motionless and waiting . Another little water snake swam up the pool , turning its periscope head from side to side . <p> Suddenly Lennie appeared out of the brush , and he came as silently as a creeping bear moves . The heron pounded the air with its wings , jacked itself clear of the water and flew off down river . The little snake slid in among the reeds at the pool 's side . <p> Lennie came quietly to the pool 's edge . He knelt down and drank , barely touching his lips to the water . When a little bird skittered over the dry leaves behind him , his head jerked up and he strained toward the sound with eyes and ears until he saw the bird , and then he dropped his head and drank again . <p> When he was finished , he sat down on the bank , with his side to the pool , so that he could watch the trail 's entrance . He embraced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The light climbed on out of the valley , and as it went , the tops of the mountains seemed to blaze with increasing brightness . <p> Lennie said softly , " I di' n't forget , you bet , God damn .

If George do n't want me ... I 'll go away . I 'll go away . " <p> And then from out of Lennie 's head there came a little fat old woman . She wore thick bull's-eye glasses and she wore a huge gingham apron with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in front of Lennie and put her hands on her hips , and she frowned disapprovingly at him . <p> And when she spoke , it was in Lennie 's voice .

" You 're always sayin ' that , an ' you know sonofabitching well you ai n't never gon na do it . You 'll jus ' stick around an ' stew the b'Jesus outa George all the time . " <p> Aunt Clara was gone , and from out of Lennie 's head there came a gigantic rabbit . It sat on its haunches in front of him , and it waggled its ears and crinkled its nose at him . And it spoke in Lennie 's voice too . <p> " Tend rabbits , " it said scornfully . " You crazy bastard . You ai n't fit to lick the boots of no rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go hungry . That 's what you 'd do . An ' then what would George think ? " <p> " I would not forget , " Lennie said loudly . <p> " The hell you wouldn ' , " said the rabbit .

If you think George gon na let you tend rabbits , you 're even crazier'n usual . He ai n't . He 's gon na beat hell outa you with a stick , that 's what he 's gon na do .

" <p> " It do n't make no difference , " George said , and he fell silent again . <p> Only the topmost ridges were in the sun now . The shadow in the valley was blue and soft . From the distance came the sound of men shouting to one another . George turned his head and listened to the shouts . <p> Lennie said , " George . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Ai n't you gon na give me hell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , like you always done before . Like , ' If I di' n't have you I 'd take my fifty bucks- ' " <p> " Well , I can go away , " said Lennie . " I 'll go right off in the hills an ' find a cave if you don ' want me .

" But not us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because I got you an ' - " <p> " An ' I got you . We got each other , that 's what , that gives a hoot in hell about us , " Lennie cried in triumph . <p> The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and the leaves rustled and the wind waves flowed up the green pool . And the shouts of men sounded again , this time much closer than before . <p> George took off his hat . He said shakily , " Take off your hat , Lennie . The air feels fine . " <p> Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the ground in front of him . The shadow in the valley was bluer , and the evening came fast . On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush came to them . <p> Lennie said , " Tell how it 's gon na be . " <p> George had been listening to the distant sounds . For a moment he was businesslike . " Look acrost the river , Lennie , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Lennie turned his head and looked off across the pool and up the darkening slopes of the Gabilans . " We gon na get a little place , " George began . He reached in his side pocket and brought out Carlson 's Luger ; he snapped off the safety , and the hand and gun lay on the ground behind Lennie 's back . He looked at the back of Lennie 's head , at the place where the spine and skull were joined . <p> A man 's voice called from up the river , and another man answered . <p> " Go on , " said Lennie . <p> George raised the gun and his hand shook , and he dropped his hand to the ground again . <p> " No , " said George . " No , Lennie . I ai n't mad . I never been mad , an ' I ai n't now . That 's a thing I want ya to know . " <p> The voices came close now . George raised the gun and listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . Le 's get that place now . " <p> " Sure , right now . I got ta . We got ta . " <p> And George raised the gun and steadied it , and he brought the muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie 's head . The hand shook violently , but his face set and his hand steadied . He pulled the trigger . The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down again . Lennie jarred , and then settled slowly forward to the sand , and he lay without quivering . <p> George shivered and looked at the gun , and then he threw it from him , back up on the bank , near the pile of old ashes . <p> The brush seemed filled with cries and with the sound of running feet . Slim 's voice shouted . " George . Where you at , George ? " <p> But George sat stiffly on the bank and looked at his right hand that had thrown the gun away . The group burst into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on the sand . " Got him , by God . " He went over and looked down at Lennie , and then he looked back at George .

" <p> But Carlson was standing over George . " How 'd you do it ? " he asked . <p> " I just done it , " George said tiredly . <p> " Did he have my gun ? " <p> " Yeah . He had your gun .

But I 'm still here , and several blog-able ideas have been percolating in my mind , with no other constructive outlet . Rather than jump in right away , however , here are a few shorter " updates . " <p> Weather : - As I write this , its snowing outside , and has been for most of the day. - We were lucky to spend a nice , warm Christmas season in sunny El Paso , Tx and a few days in Phoenix , AZ. - But that 's over now , and its back to freezing , freezing , cold. - Grady is having the time of his life , though , and has already built a miniature snowman , and covered the sidewalk with snow angels. - The other day when I was walking to class , bundled in multiple layers , gloves , hat , even thermal underwear and still feeling like I might die of hypothermia at any minute a girl jogged casually past me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a weather-wimp. - Oh well , three more months to go . Then four more years <p> Classes : - I 'm about halfway through the January term , which , although occuring in the spring of calendar year 2009 is academically considered part of the fall 2008 semester ( hey , I do n't  make the rules , thank God ) . - I 'm taking one class , which meets three days a week in the mornings : The Theological Legacy of the Dionysian Forgery , with Professor Paul Rorem ( who was also my church history professor last semester ) . - The reading is pretty dense the kind where you have to read every sentence three or four times before it begins to make sense , and then when you think you 've grasped it , you suddenly realize you havent. - Still , the subject matter is interesting , and both influences/touches on everything from medieval scholasticism and angelology to neo-platonism , - gothic architecture , intellectual property , and even post-modern deconstructionism. - More on Pseudo-Dionysius later . <p> Abby : - Shes not only walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a vocabulary over the Christmas holidays. - She yells " Da-Da ! " when I walk through the door at the end of the day , and then raises her arms in the air , saying " Wee-wee ! " which means she wants me to pick her up and fly her through the air like an airplane ( her favorite ) . - She also *finally* has been letting me read to her , and will even bring me a book to read , her favorites being Go Dogs , Go ! ; Goodnight Gorilla ; and Sandra Boyntons Moo , Baa , La , La , La. - She dances when you play music , and loves to play peekaboo ( which she says " pickabee " ) . In case there was ever any doubt , she 's definitlely aspiring to be a girly-girl , and will walk around the house with a purse on her arm , trying to steal her moms makeup. - She has a particular fondness for jewelery , watches , and cell-phones. - She also says hello , bye-bye , baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nose , clock , tick-tock , Grandad , and meow ( which she pronounces miamee ) . <p> Facebook : - A few weeks ago , I found one of my old friends from elementary school in Belgium on facebook that led to another and another , until we 've almost got enough for a 5th grade class reunion. - I 've reconnected with some great childhood friends , and had to brush up on my long dormant French in the process. - Thank God for Google translator and Babel Fish to pick up the slack . <p> Brewing : - While my brothers were in town last week , we brewed our first batch of " Locke Bros Beer " all together theyve been brewing for almost a year , and- started earlier this fall. - This was my fourth batch total , and it looks to be a Strong Belgian-style Golden Ale. - We have n't named it yet , though. - - I 'm almost out of the Christmas Beer I brewed in December , called IncarnationAle. - It got plenty of good reviews , though , except for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bottle along with the beer ! - Thanks to Philip Lotspeich , Drew Ludwig , and Loren Crow , who each ( independently ) suggested the same name . <p> Search for a Church : - As an inquirer on the " ordination track " I 'm under care of my home church and presbytery , which means that well remain members of Faithbridge Presbyterian Church in Frisco , Tx during my entire time at seminary. - Still , we 've been looking for a place to worship on Sunday mornings , and it has n't  been easy. - Most of the Presbyterian churches we 've visited in this part of the country are very " high church " traditional , and almost identical in architecture , aesthetics , liturgy and demographics. - Plus , they all seemed to have everything all worked out. - Coming from a new church development , we werent used to that. - Some did n't  seem too welcoming , and some did n't  have much in the way of nursery/Sunday school for Abby and Grady. - But I think we finally found a place we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NJ. - Its about a 45 minute drive north of us , and the one service starts at 9:30am , but the church is very warm , friendly , multicultural , and there are a LOT of four year-old boys for Grady to play with. - The pastors name also happens to be Neal Neal Presa , and I 've had a chance to get to know him a little via facebook , lunch , and a few other conversations that 's important to me. - More importantly , we felt like MPC is a place we can help and contribute , and a place that isnt afraid to be creative and even a little " wheels off " as my pastor/mentor/friend , Philip Lotspeich , likes to say . <p> New Years Resolution : - In short , I do n't  have one yet. - Last years was the first I ever kept throughout the whole year , and it was an enjoyable experience I think I 'll keep observing last years resolution ( to only buy clothes at second-hand stores like Goodwill or Salvation Army ) , just not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with something new. - Something that , while making a difference in my life , also helps to make a small difference in the larger world. - I 'm giving myself until the end of January to come up with something , so any realistic ( taking me into account ) suggestions are welcome . 218026 @qwx838026 <h> Comments <h> Just a Quick Warm-Up Post 1 Comment <p> Dude , loved your Incarnation Ale .

Through the open door came the thuds and occasional clangs of a horseshoe game , and now and then the sound of voices raised in approval or derision . <p> Slim and George came into the darkening bunkhouse together . Slim reached up over the card table and turned on the tin-shaded electric light . Instantly the table was brilliant with light , and the cone of the shade threw its brightness straight downward , leaving the corners of the bunkhouse still in dusk . Slim sat down on a box and George took his place opposite . " It was n't nothing , " said Slim . " I would of had to drowned most of ' em anyways . No need to thank me about that .

" He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to the wall and drew up his knees . <p> George put down his cards very deliberately . " Lennie , " he said sharply . <p> Lennie twisted his neck and looked over his shoulder . " Huh ? What you want , George ? " <p> " I tol ' you you could n't bring that pup in here . " <p> " What pup , George ? I ai n't got no pup . " <p> George went quickly to him , grabbed him by the shoulder and rolled him over . He reached down and picked the tiny puppy from where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach . <p> Lennie sat up quickly . " Give ' um to me , George . " <p> George said , " You get right up an ' take this pup back to the nest . He 's got ta sleep with his mother . You want to kill him ? Just born last night an ' you take him out of the nest . You take him back or I 'll tell Slim not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands pleadingly . " Give ' um to me , George . I 'll take ' um back . I did n't mean no harm , George . Honest I did n't . I jus ' wanted to pet ' um a little . " <p> George handed the pup to him . " Awright . You get him back there quick , and do n't you take him out no more . You 'll kill him , the first thing you know . " Lennie fairly scuttled out of the room . <p> Slim had not moved . His calm eyes followed Lennie out the door . Jesus , he said . " He 's jus ' like a kid , ai n't he ? " <p> " Sure he 's jes ' like a kid . There ai n't no more harm in him than a kid neither , except he 's so strong . I bet he wo n't come in here to sleep tonight . He 'd sleep right alongside that box in the barn . Well- let ' im . He ai n't doin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dark outside now . Old Candy , the swamper , came in and went to his bunk , and behind him struggled his old dog . " Hello , Slim . Hello , George . Did n't neither of you play horseshoes ? " <p> " I do n't like to play ever ' night , " said Slim . <p> Candy went on , " Either you guys got a slug of whisky ? I got ta gut ache . " <p> " I ai n't , " said Slim . " I 'd drink it myself if I had , an ' I ai n't got a gut ache neither . " <p> " Got ta bad gut ache , " said Candy . " Them God damn turnips give it to me . I knowed they was going to before I ever eat ' em . " <p> The thick-bodied Carlson came in out of the darkening yard . He walked to the other end of the bunk house and turned on the second shaded light . " Darker'n hell in here , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " He 's plenty good , " said Slim . <p> " Damn right he is , " said Carlson . " He do n't give nobody else a chance to win- " He stopped and sniffed the air , and still sniffing , looked down at the old dog . " God awmighty , that dog stinks . Get him outa here , Candy ! I do n't know nothing that stinks as bad as an old dog . You got ta get him out . " <p> Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk . He reached over and patted the ancient dog , and he apologized , " I been around him so much I never notice how he stinks . " <p> " Well , I ca n't stand him in here , " said Carlson . " That stink hangs around even after he 's gone . " He walked over with his heavy-legged stride and looked down at the dog . " Got no teeth , " he said . " He 's all stiff with rheumatism . He ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ai n't no good to himself . Why' n't you shoot him , Candy ? " <p> The old man squirmed uncomfortably . " Well- hell ! I had him so long . Had him since he was a pup . I herded sheep with him . " He said proudly , " You would n't think it to look at him now , but he was the best damn sheep dog I ever seen . " <p> George said , " I seen a guy in Weed that had an Airedale could herd sheep . Learned it from the other dogs . " <p> Carlson was not to be put off . " Look , Candy . This ol ' dog jus ' suffers hisself all the time . If you was to take him out and shoot him right in the back of the head- " he leaned over and pointed , " -right there , why he 'd never know what hit him . " <p> Candy looked about unhappily . " No , " he said softly . " No , I could n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He do n't have no fun , " Carlson insisted . " And he stinks to beat hell . Tell you what . I 'll shoot him for you . Then it wo n't be you that does it . " <p> Candy threw his legs off his bunk . He scratched the white stubble whiskers on his cheek nervously . " I 'm so used to him , " he said softly . I had him from a pup . <p> " Well , you ai n't bein ' kind to him keepin ' him alive , " said Carlson . " Look , Slim 's bitch got a litter right now . I bet Slim would give you one of them pups to raise up , would n't you , Slim ? " <p> The skinner had been studying the old dog with his calm eyes . Yeah , he said . " You can have a pup if you want to . " He seemed to shake himself free for speech . " Carl 's right , Candy . That dog ai n't no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get old an ' a cripple . " <p> Carlson said , " The way I 'd shoot him , he would n't feel nothing . I 'd put the gun right there . " He pointed with his toe . " Right back of the head . He would n't even quiver . " <p> Candy looked for help from face to face . It was quite dark outside by now . A young laboring man came in . His sloping shoulders were bent forward and he walked heavily on his heels , as though he carried the invisible grain bag . He went to his bunk and put his hat on his shelf . Then he picked a pulp magazine from his shelf and brought it to the light over the table . " Did I show you this , Slim ? " he asked . <p> " Show me what ? " <p> The young man turned to the back of the magazine , put it down on the table and pointed with his finger . " Right there , read that . " Slim bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man . " Read it out loud . " <p> " ' Dear Editor , ' " Slim read slowly . " ' I read your mag for six years and I think it is the best on the market . I like stories by Peter Rand . I think he is a whing-ding . Give us more like the Dark Rider . I do n't write many letters . Just thought I would tell you I think your mag is the best dime 's worth I ever spent . ' " <p> Slim looked up questioningly . " What you want me to read that for ? " <p> Whit said , " Go on . Read the name at the bottom . " <p> Slim read , " ' Yours for success , William Tenner . ' " He glanced up at Whit again . " What you want me to read that for ? " <p> " You think he 's the guy wrote this letter ? " " I know it . Bill and me was in here one day . Bill had one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it and he says , ' I wrote a letter . Wonder if they put it in the book ! ' But it was n't there . Bill says , ' Maybe they 're savin ' it for later . ' An ' that 's just what they done . There it is . " <p> " Guess you 're right , " said Slim . " Got it right in the book . " <p> George held out his hand for the magazine . " Let 's look at it ? " <p> Whit found the place again , but he did not surrender his hold on it . He pointed out the letter with his forefinger . And then he went to his box shelf and laid the magazine carefully in . " I wonder if Bill seen it , " he said . " Bill and me worked in that patch of field peas . Run cultivators , both of us . Bill was a hell of a nice fella . " <p> During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in . He continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him uneasily . At last Carlson said , " If you want me to , I 'll put the old devil out of his misery right now and get it over with . Ai n't nothing left for him . Ca n't eat , ca n't see , ca n't even walk without hurtin ' . " <p> Candy said hopefully , " You ai n't got no gun . " <p> " The hell I ai n't . Got a Luger . It wo n't hurt him none at all . " <p> Candy said , " Maybe tomorra . Le 's wait till tomorra . " <p> " I do n't see no reason for it , " said Carlson . He went to his bunk , pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol . " Le 's get it over with , " he said . " We ca n't sleep with him stinkin ' around in here . " He put the pistol in his hip pocket . <p> Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candy said softly and hopelessly , Awright- take ' im . He did not look down at the dog at all . He lay back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling . <p> From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong . He stooped over and tied it around the old dog 's neck . All the men except Candy watched him . " Come boy . Come on , boy , " he said gently . And he said apologetically to Candy , " He wo n't even feel it . " Candy did not move nor answer him . He twitched the thong . " Come on , boy . " The old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently pulling leash . <p> Slim said , " Carlson . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " You know what to do . " <p> " What ya mean , Slim ? " " Take a shovel , " said Slim shortly . <p> " Oh , sure ! I get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> George followed to the door and shut the door and set the latch gently in its place . Candy lay rigidly on his bed staring at the ceiling . <p> Slim said loudly , " One of my lead mules got a bad hoof . Got to get some tar on it . " His voice trailed off . It was silent outside . Carlson 's footsteps died away . The silence came into the room . And the silence lasted . <p> George chuckled , " I bet Lennie 's right out there in the barn with his pup . He wo n't want to come in here no more now he 's got a pup . " <p> Slim said , " Candy , you can have any one of them pups you want . " <p> Candy did not answer . The silence fell on the room again . It came out of the night and invaded the room . George said , " Anybody like to play a little euchre ? " <p> " I 'll play out a few with you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table under the light , but George did not shuffle the cards . He rippled the edge of the deck nervously , and the little snapping noise drew the eyes of all the men in the room , so that he stopped doing it . The silence fell on the room again . A minute passed , and another minute . Candy lay still , staring at the ceiling . Slim gazed at him for a moment and then looked down at his hands ; he subdued one hand with the other , and held it down . There came a little gnawing sound from under the floor and all the men looked down toward it gratefully . Only Candy continued to stare at the ceiling . <p> " Sounds like there was a rat under there , " said George . " We ought to get a trap down there . " <p> Whit broke out , " What the hell 's takin ' him so long ? Lay out some cards , why do n't you ? We ai n't going to get no euchre played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly and studied the backs of them . The silence was in the room again . <p> A shot sounded in the distance . The men looked quickly at the old man . Every head turned toward him . <p> For a moment he continued to stare at the ceiling . Then he rolled slowly over and faced the wall and lay silent . <p> George shuffled the cards noisily and dealt them . Whit drew a scoring board to him and set the pegs to start . Whit said , " I guess you guys really come here to work . " <p> " How do ya mean ? " George asked . <p> Whit laughed . " Well , ya come on a Friday . You got two days to work till Sunday . " <p> " I do n't see how you figure , " said George . <p> Whit laughed again . " You do if you been around these big ranches much . Guy that wants to look over a ranch comes in Sat'day afternoon . He gets Sat'day night supper an ' three meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after breakfast without turning his hand . But you come to work Friday noon . You got to put in a day an ' a half no matter how you figure . " <p> George looked at him levelly . " We 're gon na stick aroun ' a while , " he said . " Me an ' Lennie 's gon na roll up a stake . " <p> The door opened quietly and the stable buck put in his head ; a lean negro head , lined with pain , the eyes patient . " Mr. Slim . " <p> Slim took his eyes from old Candy . " Huh ? Oh ! Hello , Crooks . What's'a matter ? " <p> George dealt and Whit picked up his cards and examined them . " Seen the new kid yet ? " he asked . <p> " What kid ? " George asked . <p> " Why , Curley 's new wife . " <p> " Yeah , I seen her . " <p> " Well , ai n't she a looloo ? " <p> " I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Whit laid down his cards impressively . " Well , stick around an ' keep your eyes open . You 'll see plenty . She ai n't concealin ' nothing . I never seen nobody like her . She got the eye goin ' all the time on everybody . I bet she even gives the stable buck the eye . I do n't know what the hell she wants . " <p> George asked casually , " Been any trouble since she got here ? " <p> It was obvious that Whit was not interested in his cards . He laid his hand down and George scooped it in . George laid out his deliberate solitaire hand- seven cards , and six on top , and five on top of those . <p> Whit said , " I see what you mean . No , they ai n't been nothing yet . Curley 's got yella-jackets in his drawers , but that 's all so far . Ever ' time the guys is around she shows up . She 's lookin ' for Curley , or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's lookin ' for it . Seems like she ca n't keep away from guys . An ' Curley 's pants is just crawlin ' with ants , but they ai n't nothing come of it yet . " <p> George said , " She 's gon na make a mess . They 's gon na be a bad mess about her . She 's a jail bait all set on the trigger . That Curley got his work cut out for him . Ranch with a bunch of guys on it ai n't no place for a girl , specially like her . " <p> Whit said , " If you got idears , you oughtta come in town with us guys tomorra night . " <p> " Why ? What 's doin ' ? " <p> " Jus ' the usual thing . We go in to old Susy 's place . Hell of a nice place . Old Susy 's a laugh- always crackin ' jokes . Like she says when we come up on the front porch las ' Sat'day night . Susy opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get yor coats on , girls , here comes the sheriff . ' She never talks dirty , neither . Got five girls there . " <p> " What 's it set you back ? " George asked . <p> " Two an ' a half . You can get a shot for two bits . Susy got nice chairs to set in , too . If a guy do n't want a flop , why he can just set in the chairs and have a couple or three shots and pass the time of day and Susy do n't give a damn . She ai n't rushin ' guys through and kickin ' ' em out if they do n't want a flop . " <p> " Might go in and look the joint over , " said George . <p> " Sure . Come along . It 's a hell of a lot of fun- her crackin ' jokes <p> all the time . Like she says one time , she says , ' I 've knew people that if they got a rag rug on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 're running a parlor house . ' That 's Clara 's house she 's talkin ' about . An ' Susy says , ' I know what you boys want , ' she says . ' My girls is clean , ' she says , ' an ' there ai n't no water in my whisky , ' she says . ' If any you guys wanta look at a kewpie doll lamp an ' take your own chance gettin ' burned , why you know where to go . ' An ' she says , ' There 's guys around here walkin ' bow-legged ' cause they like to look at a kewpie doll lamp . ' " <p> George asked , " Clara runs the other house , huh ? " <p> " Yeah , " said Whit . " We do n't never go there . Clara gets three bucks a crack and thirty-five cents a shot , and she do n't crack no jokes . But Susy 's place is clean and she got nice chairs . Do n't let no goo-goos in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollin ' up a stake , " said George . " I might go in an ' set and have a shot , but I ai n't puttin ' out no two and a half . " <p> " Well , a guy got to have some fun sometime , " said Whit . <p> The door opened and Lennie and Carlson came in together . Lennie crept to his bunk and sat down , trying not to attract attention . Carlson reached under his bunk and brought out his bag . He did n't look at old Candy , who still faced the wall . Carlson found a little cleaning rod in the bag and a can of oil . He laid them on his bed and then brought out the pistol , took out the magazine and snapped the loaded shell from the chamber . Then he fell to cleaning the barrel with the little rod . When the ejector snapped , Candy turned over and looked for a moment at the gun before he turned back to the wall again . <p> Carlson said casually , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Whit . " What 's eatin ' on Curley ? " <p> Carlson squinted down the barrel of his gun . " Lookin ' for his old lady . I seen him going round and round outside . " <p> Whit said sarcastically , " He spends half his time lookin ' for her , and the rest of the time she 's lookin ' for him . " <p> Curley burst into the room excitedly . " Any you guys seen my wife ? " he demanded . <p> " She ai n't been here , " said Whit . <p> Curley looked threateningly about the room . " Where the hell 's Slim ? " <p> " Went out in the barn , " said George . " He was gon na put some tar on a split hoof . " <p> Curley 's shoulders dropped and squared . " How long ago 'd he go ? " <p> " Five- ten minutes . " <p> Curley jumped out the door and banged it after him . <p> Whit stood up . " I guess maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Curley 's just spoilin ' or he would n't start for Slim . An ' Curley 's handy , God damn handy . Got in the finals for the Golden Gloves . He got newspaper clippings about it . He considered . " " But jus ' the same , he " better leave Slim alone . Nobody do n't know what Slim can do . " <p> " Thinks Slim 's with his wife , do n't he ? " said George . <p> " Looks like it , " Whit said . " ' Course Slim ai n't . Least I do n't think Slim is . But I like to see the fuss if it comes off . Come on , le 's go . " <p> George said , " I 'm stayin ' right here . I do n't want to get mixed up in nothing . Lennie and me got to make a stake . " <p> Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and pushed the bag under his bunk . " I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Old Candy lay still , and Lennie , from his bunk , watched George cautiously . <p> When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after them , George turned to Lennie . " What you got on your mind ? " <p> " I ai n't done nothing , George . Slim says I better not pet them pups so much for a while . Slim says it ai n't good for them ; so I come right in . I been good , George . " <p> George asked , " Did you see Slim out in the barn ? " " Sure I did . He tol ' me I better not pet that pup no more . " <p> " Did you see that girl ? " <p> " You mean Curley 's girl ? " <p> " Yeah . Did she come in the barn ? " <p> " No . Anyways I never seen her . " <p> " You never seen Slim talkin ' to her ? " <p> " Uh-uh . She ai n't been in the barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess them guys ai n't gon na see no fight . If there 's any fightin ' , Lennie , you keep out of it . " <p> " I do n't want no fights , " said Lennie . He got up from his bunk and sat down at the table , across from George . Almost automatically George shuffled the cards and laid out his solitaire hand . He used a deliberate , thoughtful slowness . <p> Lennie reached for a face card and studied it , then turned it upside down and studied it . " Both ends the same , " he said . " George , why is it both ends the same ? " <p> " I do n't know , " said George . " That 's jus ' the way they make ' em . <p> What was Slim doin ' in the barn when you seen him ? " <p> " Slim ? " <p> " Sure . You seen him in the barn , an ' he tol ' you not to pet the pups so much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can a ' tar an ' a paint brush . I do n't know what for . " <p> " You sure that girl did n't come in like she come in here today ? " <p> " No . She never come . " <p> George sighed . " You give me a good whore house every time , " he said . " A guy can go in an ' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his system all at once , an ' no messes . And he knows how much it 's gon na set him back . These here jail baits is just set on the trigger of the hoosegow . " <p> Lennie followed his words admiringly , and moved his lips a little to keep up . George continued , " You remember Andy Cushman , Lennie ? Went to grammar school ? " <p> " The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids ? " Lennie asked . <p> " Yeah . That 's the one . You can remember anything if there 's anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitaire hand . He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two , three and four of diamonds on it . " Andy 's in San Quentin right now on account of a tart , " said George . <p> Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers . " George ? " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " George , how long 's it gon na be till we get that little place an ' live on the fatta the lan ' - an ' rabbits ? " <p> " I do n't know " , said George . " We got ta get a big stake together . I know a little place we can get cheap , but they ai n't givin ' it away . " <p> " Well , it 's ten acres , " said George . " Got a little win'mill . Got a little shack on it , an ' a chicken run . Got a kitchen , orchard , cherries , apples , peaches , ' cots , nuts , got a few berries . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They 's a pig pen- " <p> " An ' rabbits , George . " <p> " No place for rabbits now , but I could easy build a few hutches and you could feed alfalfa to the rabbits . " <p> " Damn right , I could , " said Lennie . " You God damn right I could . " <p> George 's hands stopped working with the cards . His voice was growing warmer . " An ' we could have a few pigs . I could build a smoke house like the one gran'pa had , an ' when we kill a pig we can smoke the bacon and the hams , and make sausage an ' all like that . An ' when the salmon run up river we could catch a hundred of ' em an ' salt ' em down or smoke ' em . We could have them for breakfast . They ai n't nothing so nice as smoked salmon . When the fruit come in we could can it- and tomatoes , they 're easy to can . Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe we 'd have a cow or a goat , and the cream is so God damn thick you got to cut it with a knife and take it out with a spoon . " <p> Lennie watched him with wide eyes , and old Candy watched him too . Lennie said softly , " We could live offa the fatta the lan ' . " <p> " Sure , " said George . " All kin 's a vegetables in the garden , and if we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something , or some milk . We 'd jus ' live there . We 'd belong there . There would n't be no more runnin ' round the country and gettin ' fed by a Jap cook . No , sir , we 'd have our own place where we belonged and not sleep in no bunkhouse . " <p> " Tell about the house , George , " Lennie begged . <p> " Sure , we 'd have a little house an ' a room to ourself . Little fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a fire goin ' in it . It ai n't enough land so we 'd have to work too hard . Maybe six , seven hours a day . We would n't have to buck no barley eleven hours a day . An ' when we put in a crop , why , we 'd be there to take the crop up . We 'd know what come of our planting . " <p> " Sure , you 'd go out in the alfalfa patch an ' you 'd have a sack . You 'd fill up the sack and bring it in an ' put it in the rabbit cages . " <p> " They 'd nibble an ' they 'd nibble , " said Lennie , " the way they do . I seen ' em . " <p> " Ever ' six weeks or so , " George continued , " them does would throw a litter so we 'd have plenty rabbits to eat an ' to sell . An ' we 'd keep a few pigeons to go flyin ' around the win'mill like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked raptly at the wall over Lennie 's head . " An ' it 'd be our own , an ' nobody could can us . If we do n't like a guy we can say , ' Get the hell out , ' and by God he 's got to do it . An ' if a fren ' come along , why we 'd have an extra bunk , an ' we 'd say , ' Why do n't you spen ' the night ? ' an ' by God he would . We 'd have a setter dog and a couple stripe cats , but you got ta watch out them cats do n't get the little rabbits . " <p> When Candy spoke they both jumped as though they had been caught doing something reprehensible . Candy said , " You know where 's a place like that ? " <p> George was on guard immediately . " S'pose I do , " he said . " What 's that to you ? " <p> " You do n't need to tell me where it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , " said George . " That 's right . You could n't find it in a hundred years . " <p> Candy went on excitedly , " How much they want for a place like that ? " <p> George watched him suspiciously . " Well- I could get it for six hundred bucks . The ol ' people that owns it is flat bust an ' the ol ' lady needs an operation . Say- what 's it to you ? You got nothing to do with us . " <p> Candy said , " I ai n't much good with on'y one hand . I lost my hand right here on this ranch . That 's why they give me a job swampin ' . An ' they give me two hunderd an ' fifty dollars ' cause I los ' my hand . An ' I got fifty more saved up right in the bank , right now . Tha 's three hunderd , and I got fifty more comin ' the end a the month . Tell you what- " He leaned forward eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tha 's three hunderd an ' fifty bucks I 'd put in . I ai n't much good , but I could cook and tend the chickens and hoe the garden some . How 'd that be ? " <p> George half-closed his eyes . " I got ta think about that . We was always gon na do it by ourselves . " <p> Candy interrupted him , " I 'd make a will an ' leave my share to you guys in case I kick off , ' cause I ai n't got no relatives nor nothing . You guys got any money ? Maybe we could do her right now ? " <p> George spat on the floor disgustedly . " We got ten bucks between us . " Then he said thoughtfully , " Look , if me an ' Lennie work a month an ' do n't spen ' nothing , we 'll have a hunderd bucks . That 'd be four fifty . I bet we could swing her for that . Then you an ' Lennie could go get her started an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ res ' , an ' you could sell eggs an ' stuff like that . " <p> They fell into a silence . They looked at one another , amazed . This thing they had never really believed in was coming true . George said reverently , " Jesus Christ ! I bet we could swing her . " His eyes were full of wonder . " I bet we could swing her , " he repeated softly . <p> Candy sat on the edge of his bunk . He scratched the stump of his wrist nervously . " I got hurt four year ago , " he said . " They 'll can me purty soon . Jus ' as soon as I ca n't swamp out no bunkhouses they 'll put me on the county . Maybe if I give you guys my money , you 'll let me hoe in the garden even after I ai n't no good at it . An ' I 'll wash dishes an ' little chicken stuff like that . But I 'll be on our own place , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He said miserably , " You seen what they done to my dog tonight ? They says he was n't no good to himself nor nobody else . When they can me here I wisht somebody 'd shoot me . But they wo n't do nothing like that . I wo n't have no place to go , an ' I ca n't get no more jobs . I 'll have thirty dollars more comin ' , time you guys is ready to quit . " <p> George stood up . " We 'll do her , " he said . " We 'll fix up that little old place an ' we 'll go live there . " He sat down again . They all sat still , all bemused by the beauty of the thing , each mind was popped into the future when this lovely thing should come about . <p> George said wonderingly , " S'pose they was a carnival or a circus come to town , or a ball game , or any damn thing .

It was n't easy , and the quality is n't as perfect as I 'd like , but they still came out quite nicely . I wrote and recorded both of these songs on a Roland Synthesizer the summer between my senior year of high school and my freshman year of college . The first is a short , upbeat song I call " One Hundred " that I mostly just wrote to test the capabilities of the synthesizer . The second is a longer instrumental arrangement of a song I had previously written for Amy , called " Forever . " I think I had the genre of " movie soundtracks " in mind for both of them . Basically , I remember locking myself in my room for several days when I got hold of the synthesizer ( which I had borrowed from church ) , going nuts with capabilities that ( at the time ) blew my little Yamaha keyboard out of the water .

@@89755528 @5255528/ <p> A few miles south of Soledad , the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green . The water is warm too , for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool . On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan Mountains , but on the valley side the water is lined with trees- willows fresh and green with every spring , carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris of the winter 's flooding ; and sycamores with mottled , white , recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool . On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them . Rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening , and the damp flats are covered with the night tracks of ' coons , and with the spread pads of dogs from the ranches , and with the split-wedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is a path through the willows and among the sycamores , a path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the deep pool , and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the highway in the evening to jungle-up near water . In front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by many fires ; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it . <p> Evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the leaves . The shade climbed up the hills toward the top . On the sand banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones . And then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves . The rabbits hurried noiselessly for cover . A stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down river . For a moment the place was lifeless , and then two men emerged from the path and came into the opening by the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , and even in the open one stayed behind the other . Both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons . Both wore black , shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders . The first man was small and quick , dark of face , with restless eyes and sharp , strong features . Every part of him was defined : small , strong hands , slender arms , a thin and bony nose . Behind him walked his opposite , a huge man , shapeless of face , with large , pale eyes , and wide , sloping shoulders ; and he walked heavily , dragging his feet a little , the way a bear drags his paws . His arms did not swing at his sides , but hung loosely . <p> The first man stopped short in the clearing , and the follower nearly ran over him . He took off his hat and wiped the sweat-band with his forefinger and snapped the moisture off . His huge companion dropped his blankets and flung himself down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank with long gulps , snorting into the water like a horse . The small man stepped nervously beside him .

You gon na be sick like you was last night . " Lennie dipped his whole head under , hat and all , and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his back . " That 's good , " he said . " You drink some , George . You take a good big drink . " He smiled happily . George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank . " I ai n't sure it 's good water , " he said . " Looks kinda scummy .

Look what I done . " <p> George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick scoops . " Tastes all right , " he admitted . " Do n't really seem to be running , though . You never ought a drink water when it ai n't running , Lennie , " he said hopelessly . " You 'd drink out of a gutter if you was thirsty . " He threw a scoop of water into his face and rubbed it about with his hand , under his chin and around the back of his neck . Then he replaced his hat , pushed himself back from the river , drew up his knees and embraced them . Lennie , who had been watching , imitated George exactly . He pushed himself back , drew up his knees , embraced them , looked over to George to see whether he had it just right .

George took the mouse and threw it across the pool to the other side , among the brush . " What you want of a dead mouse , anyways ? " <p> " I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along , " said Lennie . <p> " Well , you ai n't petting no mice while you walk with me . You remember where we 're goin ' now ? " <p> Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face against his knees . " I forgot again . " <p> " Jesus Christ , " George said resignedly .

" <p> George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his head , and Lennie imitated him , raising his head to see whether he was doing it right . " God , you 're a lot of trouble , " said George . " I could get along so easy and so nice if I did n't have you on my tail . I could live so easy and maybe have a girl . " <p> For a moment Lennie lay quiet , and then he said hopefully , " We gon na work on a ranch , George . " <p> The day was going fast now .

" George rolled on his side . " No reason at all for you . I like it here . Tomorra we 're gon na go to work . I seen thrashin ' machines on the way down .

George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself . There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken . George stopped whistling and listened . " Poor bastard , " he said softly , and then went on whistling again . <p> In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush . He carried one small willow stick in his hand . George sat up . Awright , he said brusquely . " Gi'me that mouse ! " <p> But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence . " What mouse , George ? I ai n't got no mouse . " <p> George held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You ai n't puttin ' nothing over .

George said coldly , You gon na give me that mouse or do I have to sock you ? <p> " Give you what , George ? " <p> " You know God damn well what . I want that mouse . " <p> Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket . His voice broke a little . " I do n't know why I ca n't keep it . It ai n't nobody 's mouse . I did n't steal it . I found it lyin ' right beside the road . " <p> George 's hand remained outstretched imperiously . Slowly , like a terrier who does n't want to bring a ball to its master , Lennie approached , drew back , approached again . George snapped his fingers sharply , and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand . <p> " I was n't doin ' nothing bad with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush , and then he stepped to the pool and washed his hands .

Jesus Christ ! A big guy like you . " Lennie 's lip quivered and tears started in his eyes . " Aw , Lennie ! " George put his hand on Lennie 's shoulder . " I ai n't takin ' it away jus ' for meanness . That mouse ai n't fresh , Lennie ; and besides , you 've broke it pettin ' it .

I remember a lady used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . But that lady ai n't here . " <p> Lennie looked sadly up at him . " They was so little , " he said , apologetically .

They ai n't so little . " <p> " The hell with the rabbits . An ' you ai n't to be trusted with no live mice . Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you would n't have nothing to do with it . " <p> " It was n't no good to pet , " said Lennie . <p> The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountaintops and dusk came into the valley , and a half darkness came in among the willows and the sycamores .

A dove 's wings whistled over the water . George walked to the fire pile and lighted the dry leaves . The flame cracked up among the twigs and fell to work . George undid his bindle and brought out three cans of beans . He stood them about the fire , close in against the blaze , but not quite touching the flame . <p> " There 's enough beans for four men , " George said . <p> Lennie watched him from over the fire .

Get a gallon of whisky , or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool . " Lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry George . And Lennie 's face was drawn with terror .

Lennie crawled slowly and cautiously around the fire until he was close to George . He sat back on his heels . George turned the bean cans so that another side faced the fire . He pretended to be unaware of Lennie so close beside him . <p> " George , " very softly . No answer . " George ! " <p> " Whatta you want ? " <p> " I was only foolin ' , George .

@@89755533 @5255533/ 218026 @qwx838026 <p> I 'm starting a Theology on Tap group that will meet on my front porch every Thursday this summer at 7:00 . Please come join me for beer , theology , and protest of stupid copyright laws . <p> What ? <p> Yeah , I 'm not really starting a Theology on Tap because I 'm that attached to the concept ( although its a good one ) . I 'm starting a theology on tap because my friend Adam Walker Cleaveland just wrote a blog post tossing out the mere idea of starting a theology on tap group for his church , and within six hours , he received an email notification from the group that apparently holds the trademark for the term " theology on tap . " They basically told him he could n't use the name without paying them money . Oh , and this is a ministry , too . <p> So , even though I actually think the name " Theology on Tap " is a little hokey and overused , Im now going to start one , and yes , that 's EXACTLY what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday night at 7pm , my front porch . Bring your favorite beer , and I 'll share some of mine with you . Well print t-shirts , flyers , and publicize the heck out of it . Oh , and if you 're not in New Jersey but still want to participate , I 'd encourage you to start your own THEOLOGY ON TAP wherever you live . If thousands of us all do it together , I doubt the copyright Nazis who " own " the words ( ridiculous , is n't it ? ) Theology on Tap will really be able to sustain that many lawsuits . And even if they try , theyll end up looking as stupid and foolish and selfish as when ASCAP sued the Girl Scouts of America for singing copyrighted songs around their campfires. 218026 @qwx838026 <h> Comments <h> Now Starting : Theology On Tap 17 Comments <p> As someone who has been very active in a non-sanctioned ToT for many years and as someone who use to work for the Catholic Church ( who owns the copyright ) I see both sides of this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty big Catholic program . One that that will have hundreds of participants each night it occurs in many Dioceses around the country . It is target to " young people " in the Catholic Church . It is very Catholic in its programming . <p> Catholics have put with a long history of " protestants " aggressively trying to convert them to " real " Christianity and they are a bit sensitive to that . So if a non-Catholic church promotes a ToT it could be confusing for pew Catholics so I can see why they would enforce the copyright . They just do n't  know what the intention of all these groups are , so they probably choose to enforce it everytime they notice it . <p> This issue is a lot more complicated than one might think at first glance . <p> Simple solution , fg : Call it " Catholic Theology on Tap " and then there 's no confusion . I personally am a fan of the Roman Catholic Church , and think there 's much we as protestants still need to learn from our Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> But that 's no excuse for propping up idiotic laws that allow people to own arrangements of words and prevent others from using them . I seriously , seriously doubt that the Catholic group in question were the first to use the term . More likely , they were just the first opportunistic squatters to trademark it . And then rabidly defend it from others , including ( again , I 'm speculating ) those who had already been using it . <p> You 're a fan of the Roman Catholic Church ? ? ? ? ? They are pretty much the anti-Mr . Locke . Hierarchical leadership ? Check . Fixed doctrine and dogma ? Check . Very fixed boundaries for church membership and who can take the eucharist ? Check . <p> Sounds like you like the idea of liking Catholicism because it makes you more ecumenically minded than you actually like much about Catholicism itself . <p> Second , you prove the point that you really do n't  know me too well , and that you can only know one side of a person from reading his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since I attended one for several years as a child in the very Catholic country of Belgium . I 've had a love for Catholic monasticism for many years , too , especially the Benedictine , Cistercian , and Trappist traditions . I have profound respect for the long and complex history of the Catholic church through the millenia , and even when I was a teenager , I viewed Pope John Paul II as one of my favorite role models . <p> But you are correct in noting that there is much about the Catholic church that seems to run counter to several of my stated values on this blog . You might note the same things about my relationship with the Presbyterian church , for that matter , or even with my mother , sister , and grandfather ( all military officers ) , the fact that I married and am very much in love with an orthodox , conservative , Southern Baptist wife , that I did my undergraduate studies at Oral Roberts University , or the fact that even now Im enrolled in a degree program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't grasped that I 'm comfortable with paradox yet , you are n't  too bright . If you cant understand that Ive always been attracted to things and ideas on the other side of my vantage point , you just do n't  know me . And judging from your anonymity , you really do n't  seem that interested in getting to know me as a complex human being , so why even bother pointing out what *you* perceive to be my inconsistencies ? My friends do a much better job at that , and I respect their words when they do . But not yours . <p> Have ye considered some other equally satisfyin title ? I 've had some events at me local brew-on-premises pub , an typically do somethin relatin t th Weddin at Cana . Water into grog be , after all , a pretty impressive miracle . <p> Wow Neal way to put fg in his place . Maybe you should clarify that last statement " but not yours " , so that is n't mistaken for being loathsomeThat you would respect his opinion if he made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not the case ( and I believe it is ) , it should be . <p> Oh , and I like the blog post . Although there are a lot of other battles to fight , I am going to start a TOT group just because I admire your spirit and passion on the issue . Thats righttry to stop us now ! ! = <p> @Jeff my last comment rant wasnt directed at fg ( that 's Fritz Gutwein ) because his comment was n't anonymous . And he was actually being pretty nice ( I was the one kind of being a jerk in that conversation ) . The comment you 're referring to was directed at " BWAHAHAHA " whomever that is . And yes , I accept your clarification that the statement " but not yours " only applies if my assumption is correct that he or she does n't  want to try to build a relationship , just to make mocking comments hidden behind the cloak of anonymity . ( FWIW I have no problem with mocking comments exchanged publicly among friends or colleaguesits the anonymity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately in this case , its not at all about the name , clever or not . Its about trying to use a little bit of civil disobedience to break down a corrupt copyright system . That 's not entirely the fault of the organization who trademarked " Theology on Tap " but they certainly did take advantage of the system . BTW , I have confirmed ( via a link someone posted on Adams site ) that the term " Theology on Tap " dates at least back to the early 1900s and its original use was not from a Catholic organization . <p> @fg , I would be reluctant to say " the Church " owns it . It appears to be an independent group affiliated with a diocese . <p> Just reading their about page , I get annoyed with seeing RENEW every third word .. Reminds me of when I wanted a particular domain name . Turns out a Catholic had bought it and was squatting on it . I wanted it for non-profit , religious apostolate reasons , but he was asking for $$$ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , note its not hard to TM things , or at least try to . You just try to be the first to claim the TM and list it in your publications as such . Its not even about being the first to use it .. just the first to TM ( as I understand it ) . <p> Anyhoo , I salute you , Neal , for doing this , whatever its called . Maybe I can come a few times . = <p> Margaret Youre absolutely right that Jesus did n't  call down fire on Samaritans . But I do n't  think the entity in question here is playing the part of the Samaritan . Instead they remind me of the overly legalistic pharisees that Jesus actually did expend some pretty choice words to . <p> Copyright and trademark abuse is no " petty " matter , especially for the church . In my personal experience , it often cuts to the heart of ministry , and that 's why I take it so personally . Let me give you some examples : <p> 1 . The coffee shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play music was shut down because of copyright trolling . <p> 2 . The girl scouts of America were sued by ASCAP for merely singing copyrighted songs around campfires at their meetings . <p> 3 . Several churches across the nation were forced by legal threats from the NFL to shut down super-bowl parties , many of which were organized as fundraisers for local soup kitchens . <p> 4 . A musician friend of mine was sent threatening legal notices from a major CHRISTIAN publishing company because she recorded the public domain song " Amazing Grace " the company said the legal burden of proof rested with her to *prove* that her version was n't the same as one from one of their artists . She could n't afford the legal fees , so she simply yanked her recording off the internet . <p> Margaret , things like this are absolutely INSANE , and standing up for a more just and equitable **26;320;TOOLONG system in our country certainly is n't petty . To me its a matter of social justice , and freedom to pursue ministry . <p> Let me ask you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam ( or any number of churches who use it ) in some way causing detriment or harm to the ministry of the group that owns the trademark ? It is n't likely . <p> In most cases like this , the ones who hold the trademark or copyright represent the legal " power " and those who are threatened with legal action are the marginalized , powerless , and victims of the situation . Sure , it may not quite rise to the level of AIDS or global hunger , but I suspect I know who Jesus would side with in cases like this one . 218031 @qwx838031 <p> Comment <p> Name * <p> Email * <p> Website 218029 @qwx838029 218030 @qwx838030 218024 @qwx838024 218028
