@@14234039 @2834039/ <h> The Color of Meat <p> When displayed at the grocery store , why is some meat bright red and other meat very dark in color ? <p> Optimum surface color of fresh meat ( i.e. , cherry-red for beef ; dark cherry-red for lamb ; grayish-pink for pork ; and pale pink for veal ) is highly unstable and short-lived . When meat is fresh and protected from contact with air ( such as in vacuum packages ) , it has the purple-red color that comes from myoglobin , one of the two key pigments responsible for the color of meat . When exposed to air , myoglobin forms the pigment , oxymyoglobin , which gives meat a pleasingly cherry-red color . The use of a plastic wrap that allows oxygen to pass through it helps ensure that the cut meats will retain this bright red color . However , exposure to store lighting as well as the continued contact of myoglobin and oxymyoglobin with oxygen leads to the formation of metmyoglobin , a pigment that turns meat brownish-red . This color change alone does not mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Why is pre-packaged ground beef red on the outside and sometimes grayish-brown on the inside ? <p> These color differences do not indicate that the meat is spoiled or old . As discussed earlier , fresh cut meat is purplish in color . Oxygen from the air reacts with meat pigments to form a bright red color which is usually seen on the surface of ground beef purchased in the supermarket . The interior of the meat may be grayish-brown due to the lack of oxygen penetrating below the surface . <p> A beef roast has darkened in the refrigerator , is it safe ? <p> Yes , it is safe . The darkening is due to oxidation , the chemical changes in myoglobin due to the oxygen content . This is a normal change during refrigerator storage . <p> Can cooked ground beef still be pink inside ? <p> Yes , ground beef can be pink inside after it is safely cooked . The pink color can be due to a reaction between the oven heat and myoglobin , which causes a red or pink color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the meat . Because doneness and safety can not be judged by color , it is very important to use a meat thermometer when cooking ground beef . To be sure all harmful bacteria are destroyed , cook all ground beef products to an internal temperature of 160 - F throughout . <p> What causes iridescent colors on meats ? <p> Meat contains iron , fat , and other compounds . When light hits a slice of meat , it splits into colors like a rainbow . There are various pigments in meat compounds that can give it an iridescent or greenish cast when exposed to heat and processing . Wrapping the meat in airtight packages and storing it away from light will help prevent this situation . Iridescence does not represent decreased quality or safety of the meat . <p> What causes grayish or green color on cured meats ? <p> Exposure to light and oxygen causes oxidation to take place , which causes the breaking down of color pigments formed during the curing process . Chemicals in the cure and oxygen , as well as energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical breakdown and microbial spoilage of the product . Cure , such as nitrite , chemically changes the color of muscle . Curing solutions are colored in order to distinguish them from other ingredients ( such as sugar or salt ) used in fresh and cured meat products . For example , cured raw pork is gray , but cured cooked pork ( e.g. , ham ) is light pink . <p> Although the swine flu vaccine is widely available , the state health department says the highest number of confirmed cases are among young adults .

Their owners were in no hurry to join the pioneer trek to television , influenced no doubt by thoughts of large and risky capital . In early 1945 , just months before the war ended , the FCC allocated four VHF TV channels to Richmond . Local observers mistakenly guessed that the franchises would be quickly picked up by WRVA and WRNL , regarded in the industry as Virginia 's leading broadcasters . The third and fourth channels were wild cards . Another local radio station , WMBG ( now WTVR-AM ) , was not thought of as a likely contender , but its owner , the founder of the future WTVR , took the initiative and picked up a channel before an unexpected construction permit freeze was imposed . WTVR ( and WBTV , Charlotte ) were among the 108 pre-freeze stations . Foot dragging was costly for others . In the end , WRNL lost its television bid and WRVA got only a half loaf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saga of a $500 investment that brought millions when the property was sold . Wilbur M. Havens and a man named Martin owned a hole-in-the-wall automobile battery and ignition shop on West Broad near Laurel street . In 1927 , the partners , drawn by the romance of radio , obtained a license ( WMBG ) to operate a ten watt station on the second floor of the shop . Power was stepped up several times . By 1939 , growing WMBG sported a new 5000 watt transmitter on Staples Mill Road and a studio and office building at 3301 West Broad . Martin sold his share of the business to Havens in 1942 . <p> Having no board of directors or partners to answer to , Havens could move as he desired . In 1947 , he brought the first FM service to Richmond . His WCOD(FM) operates now as WTVR-FM . It is unknown if Havens at the time saw a golden future for television . Possibly he was drawn to the romance of TV just as he had been to radio 20 years earlier . Whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until papers were filed with the FCC . With no other Richmond applications to consider , the commission quickly granted his request for authority to build a station on Channel six . <p> A sync generator and the control room switcher were said to have been built in the chief engineer 's home workshop . FM and TV antennas shared space on a fairly short tower adjacent to the AM towers on Staples Mill Road . An addition to the transmitter building housed a medium power FM and five hundred watt TV transmitter . And a small studio and control room went into the West Broad Street radio building . Havens ' WTVR won the everlasting distinction on April 22 , 1948 , of being the first television station south of Washington , DC to begin broadcasting . <p> The owners of WRVA and WRNL were jolted into action and both companies quickly applied for permits . They were too late . A growing backlog of applications had swamped the commission and the Richmond cases were still pending when the FCC processing line was abruptly stopped . <p> Richmond was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WTVR was an NBC affiliate , contracts to single station markets were non-exclusive , allowing Havens to book CBS and ABC offerings if he cared to do so . For eight years , viewers in Central Virginia either watched WTVR , or by placing antennas on tall poles , could tune in snowy images coming in from Washington or Norfolk . Most set owners elected to keep dials locked on channel 6 and their antennas oriented toward West Broad Street . <p> Owners of Larus and Brothers Tobacco Company and its powerful WRVA subsidiary had a lofty objective . Their future Television station was to be a giant in Central Virginia , rivaling 50,000 watt WRVA in size and importance . <p> During the years of stalled FCC hearings a New Jersey consulting firm was employed to study potential tower sites . The best location to cover Central Virginia , the consultant said , was near U.S. Route 250 at Oilville , 25 miles west of the City center . The concept of placing a TV tower miles from the city was faulty , however . Although regional coverage would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inadequate strength . <p> A location on Parham Road on the land now occupied by Regency Square fitted engineering standards , but Henrico County zoning authorities were unwilling to allow construction of a tall tower close to prime residential areas . The land eventually chosen was near the intersection of Midlothian Turnpike and German School Road , then a rural district outside the city . Richmond did not extend its boundaries to include the site until the early 1960 's . <p> In anticipation of eventually moving into television , Richmond Newspapers , Inc . ( WRNL ) opened a " Broadcasting House " in a new building on North Fourth Street across from its newspaper plant . An auditorium studio took up much of the ground floor . On other floors were offices , radio control rooms , studios and space reserved for future TV facilities . A large tower anchored to the roof was sturdy enough to support FM and TV antennas . <p> Larus ( WRVA ) took a different approach . The land on Midlothian Pike was sufficient for any foreseeable expansion . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the front lawn would someday be crowded with antennas aimed toward outer space . <p> A self-supporting 500 foot tower , massive enough to support stacked FM and TV antennas was erected . WRVB(FM) , now WRVQ/Q94 , began broadcasting from the site in 1947 . It was expected at the time that TV operations might begin before 1950 . It was not to be : WRVA and WRNL were about to become trapped in a second ice age . <p> The agonizing period of waiting did not end when the channel distribution thaw came . Accumulated old business and an overwhelming deluge of new applications swamped the FCC Broadcast Bureau when processing was resumed in 1952 . In almost every instance requests for permits exceeded channel availability per city , forcing long-drawn-out hearings to identify the best qualified applicants . <p> The new city by city channel distribution formula reduced Richmond 's VHF share from four to two . One former Richmond channel was shifted to the air , leaving only one additional opening . Although five new UHF channels were allocated to the city , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of WRNL and WRVA , along with Neighborhood Theaters , WLEE and Southern Broadcasters , a Winston Salem company , competed for authority to operate a station on VHF Channel 12 . The Commission set a date for a comparative hearing to determine the relative merits of applicants . <p> New FCC rules that were part of the reallocation plan allowed stations to build taller towers and operate with more power . Havens quickly applied for a permit to boost the power of WTVR and the height of its antenna to the maximum allowed . While other applicants were struggling with hearings , Havens was building his new plant behind the Broad Street studio . In 1953 WTVR switched to its tall tower . <p> Meanwhile , WRVA management , wise to workings of the Commission 's examiners , demonstrated serious commitment in the years before the Richmond case was heard . A two-camera training studio was built in a corner of the Larus tobacco factory . The cost of cameras , lights and other equipment was less than $40,000 , compared with many times that amount gambled by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive training program put future TV personnel through months of news and entertainment dry runs and other matters pertaining to television operations . WRVA was a CBS-Radio affiliate at the time . Employees marked for management positions were sent to CBS-Television for seminars and workshops . The chief engineer-elect attended half a dozen television technical seminars sponsored by RCA . Other technicians spent varying lengths of time at television factories for hands-on equipment exposure . <p> Some stations employed outside engineering consultants to plan and supervise construction of facilities . WRVA traditionally used in-house personnel . The future chief engineer visited stations from Greensboro to New Haven and as west as Cleveland and Detroit to study TV plants already in operation . Having developed basic design notions , he escorted architects to Washington and Philadelphia for their examination of TV stations . Preliminary building plans were developed and presented to top management . The building proposed was a handsome structure that could have been an asset to the community . Estimated construction cost was $1.8 million , a sizable sum in the 1950 's . The proposal was summarily rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the senior owner who pointed out that he had a fine dairy barn on his farm that was made of concrete blocks . In his opinion , such a structure was completely adequate for almost any purpose . The future WWBT ended up with a building that reflected the wishes of a man who deeply admired his cow barn . <p> In a strategic move to enhance chances of winning , the owners of WRVA approached Neighborhood Theaters with an offer to merge its application with that of the theater corporation 's newly created Richmond Television Corporation ( RTVC ) . Oddly , the theater group allowed Larus to assume 60 percent ( controlling ) interest . Owners of WLEE , evidently viewing RTVC and WRNL as unbeatable , soon withdrew from the Richmond arena . The company filed for Channel 8 in Petersburg and easily won in a comparative test against the owner of a small radio station in that city . Its WXEX , affiliated with NBC , began broadcasting from Petersburg in mid-1955 . Southern Broadcasters withdrew its application . <p> The Midlothian Turnpike property was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the theater group . Neighborhood Theaters had close ties with Morton G. Thalhimer , Inc. , principally a commercial real estate management and sales corporation . Thalhimer represented owners of large tracts of undeveloped land in western Henrico County . Tension developed between the two . Mr. Thalhimer advanced a proposal to locate the station on several acres of undeveloped West Broad Street land . His reasoning was sound from the perspective of a real estate man : land values in that part of the city and county were appreciating rapidly , the location offered high public visibility , access was good . His stated opinion was that real estate investment futures along Midlothian Pike in Chesterfield County were not bright . <p> Experienced broadcasters who spoke for WRVA argued that real estate considerations were secondary : station location was a matter dictated by FCC and FAA requirements , local ordinances and engineering considerations . Henrico County officials had already expressed their distaste for very tall towers , while rural Chesterfield had shown no such bias . Besides , the corporation 's land on Midlothian Turnpike was already cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land would have cost half a million dollars , while the Pike property had been purchased for less than $10,000 . Thalhimer lost the round . <p> Trivia : The site proposed by Thalhimer was immediately west of Reynolds Metals ' corporate headquarters in the space where Interstate 64 now passes under West Broad Street . At that time little commercial development existed west of Reynolds . Midlothian Turnpike was equally pristine . <p> The decision awarding Richmond Television Corporation a construction permit was announced December 2 , 1955 , more than ten years after wartime restrictions were lifted . Richmond Newspapers , the big loser , eventually abandoned its million dollar broadcasting center on Fourth Street . <h> The Joy and Pain of Starting a TV Station from Scratch <p> The chief engineer for television was promoted and transferred from WRVA Radio to RTVC the day the FCC announced its decision to deny Richmond Newspapers ' ( WRNL ) application .

WXEX signed-on in Petersburg four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was distinctly a non-event on a cold afternoon . Tobacco company officials and radio station executives remained at desks in their snug downtown offices . The station 's photographer shot a single picture of a lonely trio---a young woman pressing a spade into soft earth as the new chief and a contractor 's superintendent looked on . That was it---no hoopla , no speeches . The only public notice of the event was a one paragraph squib in the WRVA news . Local newspapers declined to use the picture . It appeared later in the radio station 's monthly newsletter and program guide . Others on the management team transferred from radio on January 2 , 1956 . They occupied a temporary office on Main Street until April . The staff grew on a timetable that would bring in employees as needed . Technicians were the first to be called . The future technical operations group , directed by two manufacture 's engineers , began installing equipment in early March , working more than ten hours a day , six days a week to meet a start-up date set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate west of the Atlantic Coast Line ( now CSX ) railroad tracks in northern Chesterfield County . The station was located in a neighborhood of small farms , modest homes , one pump filling station and two man auto repair shops . The only nearby restaurant was a dingy hamburger and beer joint across Midlothian Turnpike . <p> Factory engineers who assisted during construction had the choice of sleeping on lumpy mattresses at nearby six cabin tourist operation or checking in at a downtown hotel . Midlothian Turnpike had been rebuilt to four lane capacity a year earlier but was still a lightly traveled rural highway . <p> In mid-April a test pattern was seen on Channel 12 for the first time . Regular program service began at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday , April 29 with a brief dedication ceremony conducted by churchmen of the Protestant , Jewish and Catholic faiths . The first fifteen minute news presentation was sent at 7:00 p.m. the next evening . <p> The studio roof had not been completely waterproofed . For two or three days the primitive news set---actually nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward off possible dribbles of water . Behind the newsman was a hastily installed gray curtain . The economy roof structure had no sound insulation , an extension of the cow barn philosophy . Sounds of thunder and the drumming of heavy rain hitting the roof would forever mar studio production . <p> Few offices were ready for occupancy . Desks were clustered in areas that had been roofed over . Recognizing that the lack of air conditioning during construction presented a comfort problem , casual dress was permitted . Some young women took full advantage of relaxed rules during warm days of late spring by showing up for work wearing scanty outfits that would have stopped a varsity ball game . One , known for her liberal attitudes , sashayed in one morning wearing a clear plastic top and no bra . Little objection was heard from some quarters . Construction workers , however , freely admitted that it slowed work . She was sent home to change . <p> Younger employees were not immune to their relaxed surroundings that glorious spring . An informal patrol was kept busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were included in the first equipment order , two for studio and two for field service . None could be described as " portable " ; each chain , comprising camera head , tripod , control unit , monitor , connecting cables and power supply , weighed about 1000 pounds . Truly portable microwave equipment was not available in 1956 . In most cities the telephone company provided TV connections between field locations and station control rooms . <p> The first remote pickup was scheduled in October when Willow Lawn Shopping Center , the first mall in Richmond , opened for business . A thirty minute ceremony was broadcast live in late afternoon . Lacking a truck and microwave equipment , the Technical Department rented a large van in which <p> was placed a crude table made of thick boards laid on saw horses . Equipment transported to Willow Lawn weighed more than a ton--all for a two camera job . <p> The telephone company lacked coaxial cables and microwave facilities needed to send TV signals across town . Terminal and microwave units were rented from C&amp;P-Washington for the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microwave shot to the telephone company building or directly to Channel 12 was not feasible at the time . C&amp;P technicians laid temporary cable on the ground from Willow Lawn to Staples Mill Road , two blocks away . From there the program was sent by microwave to C&amp;P headquarters at 8th and Grace Streets , thence over a CBS backup microwave circuit to WRVA-TV . <p> Willow Lawn executives were thrilled , station management pleased and technicians pooped . It was a long day . <p> A medium size van , purchased in a few months , was used to transport field equipment . Costly C&amp;P local service was dropped after portable microwave transmitters and receivers were introduced in 1958 . <p> Crews went to football , baseball and basketball games , golf and tennis matches , political events , auto races , the State Fair , nighttime Tobacco Festival Parades , the Richmond Symphony at the Mosque , governors inaugurations at the State Capitol and into department stores and auto dealerships . Programs were live events--RCA and Ampex were still in a race to perfect and market something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word yet to be coined . <p> WRVA-TV was quickly recognized as the city 's leading remote broadcaster . WTVR did not schedule out-of-studio programs for years . A WXEX truck was seen only when something big was to be covered . WRVA-TV and successor WWBT have maintained the lead for 33 years . <p> Early television broadcasting was highly labor intensive . Few machines existed that could assist salespersons , creative artists , news people , anybody . Human hands and brains were needed all along the way to produce and deliver the product to viewers . Organizing a staff starting from ground zero at new television stations was a difficult and trying experience . Managers and department heads , often making vertical transfers from parent radio companies , may have known radio , but television presented new challenges . People having extensive TV experience were spread thinly among the several hundred stations that were on the air by the mid-1950 's . Personnel needed to fill job openings at new stations came from parent radio broadcasting companies , other TV stations and a variety of TV oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among WRVA transferees , those from other TV stations and TV schools , and those who lacked any previous broadcast experience . <p> Anguish sometimes chilled the excitement of moving out of radio to TV . The first news anchor relinquished his job as senior newsman at WRVA where he had a loyal following that outnumbered the combined news tune-in of all other Richmond radio stations . He was expected to be a real powerhouse . The man was great on radio--on TV he failed to come across . Ratings remained flat for a year as he tried desperately to find a fix . The poor man had worked for WRVA more than 10 years , built a home , had children in school and a wife who teaching in the school system . A painful decision was forced on his longtime colleagues--he had to go if the station had hoped to build a news audience . There was no turning back . The vacancy at WRVA had been filled by another popular newscaster . He was the first person at WRVA-TV to feel the cold steel blade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WRVA and the new TV station . He was known to be a man who expected everyone to carry his fair share of the work load . He had little patience with loafers and was quick to make his displeasure known . The old gentleman made a practice of opening seldom used doors and peering into dark corners . In the photo lab was a tiny closet where one went to load film holders for still-cameras . ( Yes , early TV made wide use of stills for news and commercials . ) On an unexpected early morning visit to the station Mister CT , as close associates called him , found an employee in the closet reading a morning paper , all the while ignoring persistent intercom page . The hapless idler lasted long enough to pick up his final check . <p> Although he was not penalized for dereliction , a news cameraman caused the station to miss breaking the flash locally when President Kennedy was shot . He was alone in the news office , feet on desk , reading a newspaper , all the while ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior employee rushed in to see what the frantic ringing was about . He literally screamed at the cameraman that the President had been shot . The laggard , suspecting a ruse , never lifted his eyes from his paper . The network cut in with the most dramatic news flash in the history of television before an announcer could be summoned . Three valuable minutes and a local first had been lost . <p> Another employee , a projectionist , was discharged after repeatedly being called on the carpet for careless job performance . patience of his co-workers and management ended one night when a director was surprised to see a reel holding the late-night movie rolling across the floor . The operator had failed to snap a reel-lock on the projector . When confronted the next day , his response was , " Frankly , I do n't give a damn . " Termination was quickly arranged . <p> Some termination 's were even faster . Another incident ... another projectionist and a cop . A man in blue strode through the station , arrested the film jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll . The ex-jock served nine years . Burglary rap . <p> For about a year network video was delivered to the station via microwave , but audio came in on a special line that was incorporated in the regular telephone cable , which in those days was suspended on poles beside the Pike . A temporary overhead wire completed the connection between the streetside cable and master control . Arrangements were made to land an Army helicopter on the front lawn in connection with a military recruiting drive . A morning soap was in progress when audio was interrupted . A hasty call to the telephone company brought assurances that sound was leaving the downtown office okay . The thin overhead wire , unnoticed by the chopper pilot , had been neatly severed . A resourceful film cameraman quickly grasped broken strands and held ends together until an emergency splice could be made . <p> Fidel Castro 's Cuba confiscated a WRVA-TV movie camera shortly before the Bay of Pigs affair . An adventurer convinced the news director that he could smuggle some terrific footage out of Cuba . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a camera . The story , according to him , would be a dynamite exclusive . A movie camera and supply of film was turned over to the swashbuckler who headed for Florida and a blockade runner 's boat . Weeks passed without contact . In fact , he was never again heard from directly . It was eventually learned through clandestine sources that the freelance news hawk had been captured and sentenced to a term in Havana 's forbidding jail . The camera was never recovered . <p> Bottom dollar backyard swimming pools were hot items in the early 1060s . For $950 a supplier dug a hole in a residential backyard , lined it with cinder blocks and dropped in a heavy-duty vinyl liner . Voila , in three days a water-filled hole in the back yard became a yuppie family 's newest plaything . A distributor opened a shop on Forest Hill Avenue . He was soon pounced on by a Channel 12 salesman eager to sell something--sell anything . The undercapitalized vendor , having misjudged the market , and struggling to keep his head above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration pool on station property in exchange for air time . Agreed . The pool won immediate favor among the office staff and created a big headache for managers . Counting time to get out of bathing attire , dress , fix hair , put on lipstick or whatever , office routine was interrupted until two o'clock . At 1 p.m. curfew had to be introduced . <p> The evening studio crew may have had the most fun . The pool worked fine for a few weeks . One morning it was found half empty . It looked as if a cookie cutter had been used to cut several holes in the vinyl . The dealer was puzzled , but went ahead and made free repairs anyway . The truth leaked out in a few days ; the evening crew was using the pool area after news sign-off for beer busts . A trainee studio cameraman named " Woozy " pole vaulted across the pool several times , using the long steel tube that was part of the pool cleaning kit . It was a neat cookie cutter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also chewed out . The vendor was out of business before another summer arrived . TV employees have enjoyed his pool for thirty years , although with more restraint . RTVC spent several thousand dollars to reinforce walls with steel rods and smooth-coat the rough cement blocks in order to prolong the life of a $950 hole in the ground . <p> The swimming pool still earns its keep . In the early years teenagers came to the station by invitation once a week for a poolside dance party sponsored by Miller and Rhoads . Young people modeled swim wear and all the trappings of beach life . Women , now fiftyish , still ask about the emcee who was billed The Teen Age Rage . <p> Marine dealers launched boats in the pool , demonstrated outboard motors , fishing gear and water sports goods . For years starting swimmers were taught the basics in supervised classes by YWCA instructors . <p> Probably the most novel commercial that featured the pool was sponsored by Streitmann Biscuits . A watertight package was being promoted at the time . Two police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big James River carp that had been released in the water . The gimmick was that one frogman would snare a box of Streitmann biscuits instead of a carp , then both swimmers would sit on pool edge , open the package and taste a few crackers to demonstrate their freshness . The act was n't convincing . It aired only a few times . <p> For years professional football rules did not allow TV carriage in the city of origination . Redskins fans drove to Richmond on Washington blackout days , rented motel rooms , hauled in cases of beer and settled down to watch the screen . One Sunday network chieftains , for a reason now forgotten , decided to switch games at the last minute . The station 's night door rattled under great pounding less than 30 minutes into the substitute tournament . Standing outside was a beer sloshed crowd of Washingtonians who announced that the engineer 's face was about to be rearranged and the building dismantled brick by brick . Ordinary door glass was replaced by wire reinforced lexan and the lock quickly beefed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events are broadcast to conclusion . Right ? Well , it was n't always so . For a long time the ninth inning or the fourth quarter was clipped if the game infringed on prime time and to heck with the final play . Heidi--nice little Heidi and her beloved grandfather--changed long standing network practice . With less than 4 minutes of play remaining , it was the Oakland Raiders over the NY Jets by a wide margin . Football that afternoon in late 1968 was lackluster ; even the great Joe Namath seemed unable to get going . NBC decision makers in New York decided to pull the plug on schedule and run Heidi as advertised . A flurry of phone calls from angry fans quickly swamped the WWBT weekend answering service . Frustrated viewers switched over to radio to catch the conclusion of the game . As Boom Boom would say : Boom , boom , boom , the Jets rallied and in quick succession made three touchdowns , once again bringing glory to the Big Apple . NBC--and WWBT in the minds of local viewers--blew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avalanche . In minutes the telephone company 's 233 exchange overloaded , paralyzing the system for all users and effectively isolating the station from the outside world . Viewer reaction in New York and at affiliated stations across the country was similar . And that , gentle reader , is why sports events are aired to conclusion , thus delaying programs for the rest of the evening . An unlisted special connection from Master Control to the 644 exchange across town was ordered the next day . It would serve as a bypass should callers ever again paralyze the listed 233 number . The number was phased out in 1989 when part of the station 's PBX was connected to the 230 exchange . <p> A neo-Nazi raised the blood pressure of conservative Virginians when he ran for president , backed by a soon forgotten minor party . Trapped in a Fairness Doctrine thicket , station officials had no choice but to honor a request for air time . Several protesters and supporters gathered in front of the building before he arrived . Actually , the man had a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues not heard before . But the broadcast had barely started when the switchboard was flooded with calls from angry viewers . Meanwhile , the outdoor crowd was growing and becoming unruly . A squad of policemen cleared the area . <p> A daily program for preschoolers was imaginative . Miss Nancy lined up creative projects , planned entertaining games , provided animals to pet , pictures to paint , sand castles to be built . When a small-animal circus came to Southside Plaza , arrangements were made to bring a baby elephant into the studio . Five-year-old youngsters had a great time feeling its trunk , giving the elephant peanuts and taking turns sitting on its back . Miss Nancy had a grand idea : " let 's have a parade , with the elephant leading the procession . " On the second lap around the studio , the pachyderm did and did what pachyderms do and do . Green fumes made some kids i 'll . Hit black , roll film , get out the Air Wick , open the door , do something . <p> It was autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nights crisp ; a time to have a Fall Fling under a full moon . Departing from the custom of serving catered food , the Fling Committee decided to have a poolside party featuring an old fashioned down-on-the- farm hog roast . Now , a country barbecue party is not your ordinary backyard cookout . The carcass of a whole hog is roasted above ground , fueled by green saplings in the charcoal source . Hot embers by the shovelful are transferred frequently from bonfire to cooking pit . It 's no jiffy process ; count on at least eighteen hours to thoroughly cook a large porker . The carcass , secured fore and aft on a homemade iron grill , must be turned frequently to maintain uniform temperature . There 's much basting , using highly seasoned " secret " sauces--an all night and next day ritual of turning , basting , replenishing charcoal . <p> Dawn on festival day was misty and cool . Overnight volunteers retired to get a little sleep while newcomers continued the ritual . Mist had turned to light rain by ten o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid being soaked . One of the party , feeling that his cohorts deserved a special treat to compensate for discomfort , went home and prepared a picnic jug brimful of hot buttered rum , the main ingredient being 151 proof Meyers . <p> Alfresco feasting and merrymaking was scheduled to begin late in the day , but falling temperature and intermittent showers forced activities indoors . Hungry staffers , unaware that the pit crew had quaffed a hefty ration of hot grog , enjoyed generously seasoned roasted pork washed down with cold beer , all the while wondering why cooks rather than the barbecue appeared to be more saturated with " sauce . " An after dinner sing-along helped return the party into a rousing success . <p> Occasionally , a company-sponsored social event did not turn out well . The program committee had meager funds to finance a party dinner the first Christmas in 1956 . The best place to be had , considering the fiscal matter , was a cheap roadhouse far out in Chesterfield County in the Hull Street boonies . Employees were still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hoped that this first social gathering would help create a more friendly spirit at work . A cash bar was available . Most people ordered a token drink , but one man , a West Virginian mountain man , got skunk drunk on moonshine he brought in his personal bottle . The meal was ruined when he picked a fight with one of his colleagues , bloodied his nose and ripped the shirt from his back . It put a damper on station socials for a time . <p> In a better year the Christmas party featured " The Continentals , " a local carryover from the big band era . Music was sweet and the program included dance tunes from current pop to ballroom standards , something to appeal to the varied tastes of the young to the middle-aged who were present that evening . All seemed to have a good time , but , as every entertainment committee knows , you ca n't please ' em all . There were loud complaints in the hall the next day about " that crummy , creepy music . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . <h> Network Merry-Go-Round <p> When WRVA-TV signed-on in 1956 owners and management had every reason to expect it to take off like a rocket boosted by momentum of its radio predecessor . Employees who transferred from highly successful WRVA worked alongside newly hired personnel who came from other TV stations and , in one case , from CBS-NY . Department heads had gone to network sponsored seminars structured to address management and program aspects of the emerging TV broadcasting Business . The station was a CBS affiliate . Program plans , quickly implemented , called for active community involvement . Technical equipment was the best available . A loyal WRVA radio audience was expected to quickly embrace and nurture the infant television station . <p> It was known there would be obstacles . The station would be competing with one that had been in operation for eight years ; outdoor receiving antennas , often a necessity at the time , were aimed toward the older station ; viewers were unaccustomed to dial switching ; the new Channel 8 outlet in Petersburg was expected to siphon off viewers south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Frequent telephone surveys made during after-dinner hours by a national ratings firm showed that relatively few viewers were switching to WRVA-TV . The 1956 autumn sweep was disappointing , although not alarmingly below projections for the first months of operation . Local programs and station promotion went through a period of readjustment during the winter . <p> The station remained in third place in the spring rating books . Twelve months before the first term of the affiliation contract was due to expire , CBS gave protective notice of cancellation , with a proviso that the agreement would continue if ratings showed marked improvement . <p> Local programs were substantially improved , principally by purchasing better feature movies and syndicated shows . Promotion was stepped up through increased use of billboards and frequent full page ads in Richmond and out of town newspapers . Service shops and stores that sold TV sets were given incentives to promotes sales of rotatable home antennas . Tours through the station were conducted on Sunday afternoons to give the public an opportunity to see how a television station works . Although of lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages were conducted for several years . <p> Moderate improvement in audience numbers after a year failed to save the network connection . WTVR , left with ABC after losing CBS and NBC to WRVA-TV and WXEX respectively , was still the most looked-at station . CBS moved its affiliation to Channel 6 , leaving WRVA-TV with no place to go but ABC , then a struggling third network which in the late 1950 's was regarded on Madison Avenue as unlikely to survive . Channel 12 switched to ABC on May 30 , 1960 . <p> Well intentioned company policy may have been the major contributor to slow audience growth . The station was burdened with the impractical objective of covering all of central Virginia with a strong signal . The antenna was designed to keep a certain percentage of radiated energy above ground for the first twenty or thirty miles from the tower , wasting signal over sparsely populated areas at the cost of reduced strength in the city and adjoining counties . A side effect of design was uneven local coverage . At some locations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported occasional freak reception of the station in distant places , especially eastern Pennsylvania , New York City and on both sides of Long Island Sound , may have been an indication that part of the signal was overshooting the desired target area . Mechanical and electrical changes in the antenna , made in 1960 , somewhat improved reception in the city . <p> Thalhimer , becoming increasingly critical of performance after CBS was lost , applied pressure to get the station into high gear . In exasperation , Larus offered to purchase stock certificates from dissidents . All outstanding theater and most minority shares were tendered and purchased . Larus and Brother Tobacco Company became 97-percent owner of Richmond Television Corporation . <p> The ABC connection brought new problems . Network service began in midmorning and ended at 11 p.m. , leaving affiliates with hours of time to be filled locally . For several months sign-on was delayed until nine o'clock , and sign-off came at conclusion of the late news . <p> The development of in-house talent and imaginative promotion turned business around in the early 1960 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1960 respectively , giving WRVA-TV the distinction of being the first station in the state and among the first nationwide to be so equipped . Networks bought the first 25 machines . The Richmond machine was about the tenth delivered to non-network customers . The VTR 's were responsible for a dramatic improvement in local sales , particularly in automobiles and durable goods . It was an era of driving cars into the studio for taping sessions , and the scene dock was always jammed with furniture and white goods waiting for studio time . Off premises commercial production was less successful . Although TV crews went to auto sales lots and department stores , heavy cameras and bulky cable connections to the remote truck made the venture impracticable . <p> Ratings were so improved by 1964 , mostly at the expense of WXEX , that management decided to seek NBC affiliation . It was a difficult decision to make , however , for ABC by then was attracting attention nationally and looking better all the while . The game of musical chairs played its last tune in 1965 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of less than ten years it had been connected to every network . <h> Stay Tuned For The Weather <p> Weather reporters locally and on the networks in the 1950 's and 60 's ranged from awful to passable . Means to collect data was almost nonexistent . Presentation techniques were primitive ; some broadcasters preferred permanent maps produced in the art department and others got by with daily hand drawn charts interpreted with much finger pointing and arm waving . Others depended on metallic map boards on which magnetic symbols were pressed ; wands or chalk were de riguer in some studios ; some weather people were serious , others comics . WRVA-TV tried them all . <p> Network figures may have had some degree of professional expertise , but at the local level sunny/rainy day gurus usually had other primary job functions--weather was a sideline . Lacking the availability of satellites and radar , data presented on the air was the same precooked information distributed by the government weather service . <p> Herbert " Herb " Clarke spoke from both sides of his head for a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the posts were separated when Atlantic Refining Company picked up weather sponsorship . After that , bowing to wishes of the client , Herb delivered his daily summary attired in a regulation filling station employee 's uniform complete with visored cap and black leather bow tie , and surrounded by tires , quarts of oil and other Atlantic products . " Your Atlantic Weather Reporter " was believable and popular . Viewers came to depend on his daily predictions for rain , snow , hot and cold . But a bigger city called . Herb picked up the weather job at WCAU in Philadelphia . Newspapers in that city call him " Philadelphia 's Mr. Weather Man " in the position he has occupied at WCAU for more than twenty-five years . <p> One of the station 's most popular personalities occasionally reported weather as a secondary assignment . His primary job was host for daily cartoon and science programs aimed toward seven to twelve year-olds . Sailor Bob was a skilled cartoonist who embellished his cloud charts with assorted characters that displayed smiling or sad faces depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff around the time of transition to WWBT management . <p> The task was handled temporarily by the news director who , on camera , was a buffoon , a Cousin Willard without a Gumblian side kick . His approach to reporting weather was light , and in the opinion of his critics , terrible . Hand drawn situation maps were cluttered with elementary cartoons and stick men . His creative noun twists must have made professional meteorologists cringe . Mixed snow and rain became " s'rain " , sleet and rain was " sl'ain , " snow mixed with sleet came out as " sn'eet . " Honest--that was Channel 12 's weather format for a mercifully short time . <p> Spencer Christian , a native of Charles City County , was just out of Army service when he was hired by WWBT . Although a professional journalist , being the newest kid on the roster made him vulnerable for the weather draft . He demurred , but the manager , having run out of ideas to top sn'eet and sn'ail , insisted . The rest is history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then to ABC , New York , where he became the net 's popular morning weather oracle . <p> The weather beat was a springboard for a young meteorologist . Jeff Lawson deserted Richmond for a larger market when he moved to the weather berth at WTTG , Washington . Other station people were drawn by West Coast glitter . Chuck Shull , one of the first WRVA-TV news anchors , eventually pulled up stakes and headed west with wife Jennifer . Chuck was the face and voice that sold Tetley Tea for years . Jennifer became a Hollywood script writer . Anna Inge , tired of office routine at WRVA-TV , moved to Hollywood writing departments . Anna caught the eye of Gordon Jump--they were married in the lean years before Gordon became the bumbling General Manager of " WKRP in Cincinnati . " <h> An Era Ends , Ninety-Two-Year-Old Parent Company Sells Out <p> William T. Reed , Jr. , Chairman of the Board of Larus and Brother Company , Inc. and its Richmond Television Corporation subsidiary , died suddenly in 1966 , leaving no likely successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1876 , passed from generation to generation as a family legacy . Reed 's death came at a time when the cigarette and smoking tobacco industry was declining , radio income down , and the company 's future in television uncertain . More than one hundred heirs among the Larus and Reed family dynasties have business connections other than manufacturing and broadcasting . Stockholders ( the families ) made a quiet decision to dispose of tobacco , radio and TV holdings . <p> The agreement was a carefully guarded secret until the owners were ready to disclose their intentions . Announcement of the coming breakup of one of the city 's oldest companies shocked business and public sectors alike . Products of the factory , especially its Edgeworth pipe tobacco , were marketed nationwide . Larus founded widely known WRVA in 1925 . Power of the clear-channel station was increased in 1939 to 50,000 watts--ten times greater than any other broadcaster in the state . Its clear channel cut a swath through the airwaves from Bermuda to Chicago and beyond . Latecomer WRVA-TV by then had earned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into third place and was crowding WTVR for top ratings . <p> In a move toward spinning off tobacco and broadcasting divisions separately the parent corporation was converted to a holding company . Tobacco , WRVA-Radio , Inc . And WRVB-FM , Inc. became separate entities . No change was made in the structure of Richmond Television Corporation since it was already a separate corporation . <p> A broker who specialized in selling radio and TV stations was engaged . Disposal of assets was not a distress sale ; the owners , known for a long history of civic involvement in many fields , reserved the right to be selective , with the aim of selling its stations only to broadcasters known to have exemplary records of community service elsewhere . Negotiations with Jefferson Standard Broadcasting Company ( now Jefferson-Pilot Communications ) began after another prominent southeastern multi-station operator failed to pass scrutiny . <p> Charles H. Crutchfield , president of the North Carolina company , was met at the airport by his Richmond counterpart . The desire to keep negotiations secret was so strong that Mr. Crutchfield was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his guest that knowledge of his presence might start a wave of premature speculation . <p> Mr. Crutchfield returned home without seeing more than the balance sheet , the grounds , a tower and a swimming pool . But he had made up his mind ; purchase was recommended contingent on further investigation by his company . How could he be wrong ? The asking price was right , with no inherited debt . Jefferson Standard would probably have been interested in WRVA Radio , too , had FCC rules permitted common ownership of two overlapping 50 kilowatt stations . Jefferson 's WBT-Charlotte radiates its most powerful signal on a north-south axis , while WRVA beams maximum power east to west . The pair could have blanketed a sizable portion of the eastern and midwestern states , which would have been undesirable for economic and policy reasons in the eyes of several government agencies . <p> A Charlotte delegation that visited the station on May 16 , 1968 , was the first to be invited indoors . The inspection team must have been appalled by what they saw--an austere lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , and floors that were an unbroken expanse of plain white vinyl , all of which combined to create an institutional atmosphere . Two strictly utilitarian studios had unpainted walls and bare concrete floors . Except for new General Electric color cameras , a GE color film chain and two Ampex tape machines modified for color , technical equipment had reached its terminal life if judged by industry practice . The development of broadcasting hardware never stood still ; the 12 year-old transmitter and control room equipment represented a technology nearing obsolescence . <p> The inspection team recommended purchase . Staying with the WRVA-TV call letters might have had promotional value , but FCC rules do not allow shared calls if radio and TV stations are not under common ownership . A request to change the station I 'd to " WWBT " was included in the license transfer application . Commission approval was granted in mid-November , 1968 . All remaining details of the sale were completed by November 27 . <p> Although viewers may not necessarily have been aware that the station had a new owner , visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WRVA-TV closed down at 1:00 a.m. on November 28 , 1968 . An hour earlier a construction crane pulled in front of the building and parked . Workmen spent the hours of darkness changing big stainless steel letters on the front wall . Motorists on Midlothian Turnpike were surprised at dawn when they saw the proud new WWBT logo . It was Thanksgiving morning . The sign-on crew loaded a new I 'd slide . WWBT was officially in business . <p> Thanksgiving Day , 1968 : WWBT Wakes Up Richmond With Its New I 'd and Fresh Television Ideas The Jefferson Standard influence raced through every department . An engineering consulting firm took to the field to measure signal strength in every direction out to 55 miles from the tower , the chief engineer was asked to name specific items of equipment that he considered needed immediate replacement , the sales department was quickly overhauled . News department personnel , long squeezed into cramped quarters , saw a partition knocked out and working space doubled . More reporters and photographers were on the street in a few weeks . Carpets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and corridors , and the lobby was brightened with new furniture . <p> A new studio video switcher and improved audio equipment came on line . The engineering consultant , after studying data gathered during his signal strength survey , recommended changes in the antenna that would improve reception in the city and neighboring counties . A color film chain from RCA and studio cameras from Norleco replaced the GE equipment . An order was placed with RCA for the newest state of the art transmitter--and construction was started on an addition to the building that would house the new apparatus . <p> The transmitter and an improved master control switcher were activated in 1970 . A modest step toward automation made it possible for one person to watch the transmitter and execute master switching . Another technician working in the old operations room attended to loading film projectors and videotape machines . <p> Billboards reminded motorists on every major traffic artery that The Scene Tonight would appear on home screens at 6 and 11 . Names of anchors , sports and weather personalities became household words . Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as blood give-ins , all-night fund raising campaigns for national health programs and a massive " Letters to Hanoi " drive intended to remind Vietnam that America wanted her sons back . Thousands of letters collected by WBTV and WWBT were personally delivered to a neutral intermediary in Stockholm , Sweden , by representatives of the two Jefferson Standard stations . <p> In the early 1970 's the news department moved to larger quarters . The former transmitter room was stripped to bare walls and reconfigured to house videotape machines , film projectors and a new studio control room . The first computer terminal--located in Sales--tied in with Jefferson Data Services mainframe in Charlotte . Later the same year a computer was used for the first time to facilitate the analysis of state election returns . <p> To supplement film for news gathering a smaller , lighter weight video camera was purchased in 1975 . A portable transmitter , paired with new receiving equipment at the station , made possible more economical coverage of special events . For the first time , late breaking news could be picked up live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on location or relayed via microwave to a news department VTR could be edited almost to air time , saving hours formerly lost while motion picture film passed through developing tanks . <p> Further miniaturization of video equipment extended the ability of reporters to cover news happenings more effectively than hitherto possible . The two-piece camera and video recorder fell into disuse after now ubiquitous camcorders were introduced . <p> Cramped workspace was a recurring problem . News moved again in 1978 to larger quarters in a new addition to the building , and the sales department settled into its newly constructed suite . <p> WWBT looked toward the sky in 1981 when the first satellite receiving antenna was installed on the front lawn . It opened the way to program opportunities never available before . <p> Weather came of age at WWBT in the 1980 's . Chalk boards and comic weather reporters by then had passed into folk history . Professional staff meteorologists , backed up with such tools as Doppler radar , satellite views of clouds in motion , resources of NOAA , the National Weather Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to expect from lows , highs and fronts . <p> Graphic arts specialists cleaned their inky-messy tools for the last time and turned to electronic ways to create superior artwork . Motion picture film became a relic of television 's past . The processor was dismantled for electronic graphics . Film projectors followed processing equipment to the surplus dealer . <p> Personal computers for word processing and other forms of business automation replaced typewriters . <p> Television transmitters have a practical life of only fifteen to twenty years due to never ending product improvement . By 1985 the unit installed by Jefferson-Pilot in 1970 was becoming an antique . To avoid disrupting operations during replacement , a second story was added above the old equipment room to house a new transmitter , much of it consisting of electronic devices not even dreamed of by scientists when television broadcasting began its rapid expansion into almost every corner of the nation in the 1950 's . <p> First generation technical equipment , with the exception of the tower and main antenna , was completely phased out during the 1970 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , was replaced by a newly available helical , circularly polarized model in 1986 . The top-of-the-line RCA product delivers a better signal to viewers , whether intercepted by elaborate outdoor home aerials , table top vee rabbit ear antennas or simple telescoping rods built into receivers . More power is directed into the city without reducing the energy needed to send a strong signal to outlying communities . The improved quality of reception is often dramatic in locations where WWBT was formerly a poor performer . <p> The time worn news set was replaced by a professionally designed and produced product that brought dazzling freshness to the studio and to viewers . <p> First generation satellite antennas , commonly referred to as dishes , were more than 30 feet in diameter . Later designs brought the size down to manageable dimensions . In 1987 WWBT took to the road with a truck-mounted uplink dish that an operator vehicle arrives on site . LiveStar 12 specials in 1989 included programs from Chesapeake Bay fishing villages , North Carolina beaches , mountain ski resorts and distant college basketball courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The station 's internal telephone system ( PBX ) was replaced in late 1988 with a fully automatic facility that included a mysterious " PhoneMail " electronic file cabinet where inter-office or incoming voice messages are digitally stored for later retrieval when the addressee is away from his or her work place . Also , viewer 's choice--yes or no , for or against--on a selected sub , , , j , , , , ect may be polled and stored automatically in PhoneMail where accumulated votes are held until extracted by an attendant . <p> Although it is not part of the Phone Mail system , frequently updated information covering a wide variety of subjects of popular interest may be accessed by persons who dial special four-digit codes associated with a similar type storage device at another location . Known as the Talking Yellow Pages , it is a service of the Donnelly Directory , which features a tie-in with WWBT . Donnelly 's 1989-90 directory lists the special codes , starting on the flip side of the front cover . <p> An ombudsman service known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or help for viewers who have difficulty coping with the maze of red tape that seems to entangle every human transaction these days . <p> In the 1980 's most commercial production moved to the field or outside production houses , eliminating the need for cumbersome studio props on the premises at WWBT . Surplus storage space was allocated to technical operations where , in early 1990 , an operations center incorporating advanced technology broadcasting hardware is scheduled to come on line . <p> Numerous additions to the building over a span of thirty years doubled usable floor space , but expansion was always in areas that left the main entrance unaltered . A porte-cochere was added in 1989 , improving an otherwise bland streetside view . The modernization project includes an enlarged and redecorated lobby . <p> Viewers get a steeplejack 's glimpse of the city from a camera permanently mounted high on the main tower . On clear days the downtown skyline is displayed with clarity expected of a fine photograph . At dawn the camera , peering across ground hugging early morning fog , portrays central Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist . Some days the camera is aimed toward a red sunrise , a rosy sunset , wind torn storm clouds , autos bunched at traffic signals on Midlothian Turnpike , vehicles rushing along Chippenham Parkway--SkyCam sees all . <p> A satellite service called LiveStar 12 is used regularly to send news and special event pickups back to WWBT . A helicopter identified as Sky 12 is readily available to transport crews to newsworthy locations . If aerial pictures are desired , a camera and hand held transmitter may be used to send pictures and voice from the ' copter to the station or , when necessary , relayed via the satellite uplink truck and LiverStar 12 . <p> The Jefferson-Pilot Communications presence in Richmond evolved from a production house concept in the early nineteen-seventies to a full scale public information and community awareness medium in the information and community awareness medium in the nineteen-eighties . A minuscule portion of the population came in direct contact with their WWBT friends in the first two months of operation two decades ago .

Today , full service local news/sports/weather programs are presented five times daily , starting at six-thirty in the morning , and supplemented by headlines first broadcast at 7:25 a.m . Revenue programs may be preempted for the carriage of local or national news or specials of wide interest . Additionally , bulletins warning of the approach of dangerous storms in the viewing area are displayed on crawls across the bottom of viewer 's screens any time alerts are issued by the National Watcher Service . Reporters cover over the State Capitol , City Hall , area courts and government centers in central Virginia counties . WWBT news people go on assignment to any corner of the state when circumstances justify . Staffed and equipped branch bureaus are maintained in Charlottesville and Petersburg , a shared bureau operates outside of Washington and stringers are on tap in cities across Virginia .

Owning to unprecedented interest in the Virginia race , WWBT fed the full six hour special report to WNVT in Northern Virginia and to all the United States via C-Span . <p> Retired President Charles Crutchfield must smile when he hears reports of happenings at the Richmond station twenty years after he recommended its purchase .

That 's why it 's best to explore options available for the final care of your pet 's body before his death . If your pet dies before you can make arrangements , most veterinary hospitals can keep your pet 's body for a few days while you consider your options . Unpleasant as this subject may seem , peace of mind comes in knowing exactly what will become of your pet 's remains and making the choice that feels right . <p> Can I bury my pet in a cemetery ? <p> You can bury your pet in a cemetery created specifically for beloved pets .

To locate one , look in the Yellow Pages under " Pet Cemeteries &amp; Crematories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemeteries and crematories . <p> Before choosing a pet cemetery , check to make sure the cemetery sits on " dedicated land . " To do this , verify with the cemetery manager that the cemetery 's property deed states that the land will always remain a pet cemetery regardless of ownership . Standards set by the International Association of Pet Cemeteries ( 800-952-5541 ) can guide your selection . <p> How do cemeteries bury pets ? <p> Pets can be buried either in a private plot or in a communal plot . In a private burial , a pet 's remains are separately prepared and placed in an individual grave site , crypt , or mausoleum . In a common or communal burial , a pet is buried in the same plot with other deceased pets .

Many animal crematories do mass cremations and then divide the ashes .

Some pet caregivers , viewing their pet 's spirit as distinct from the body , choose to have their pet 's body rendered so the remains can be put to further use .

's former president lived a lifestyle most people in the Tri-State could only dream of , according to documents uncovered by FOX19 . <p> Dr. Greg Williams only lives 20 minutes away from CVG Airport but Bank of America credit card statements , which U.C. paid , show he often used Executive Transportation Services to drive him there and back . In his last month in office , for instance , he spent $443 of the university 's money on chauffeured cars . Long term parking at CVG runs as low as $8 per day and parking near the terminal is $14 a day . <p> FOX19 obtained Williams ' credit card statements for each month he was president of the University of Cincinnati , which showed a pattern of using car services throughout his tenure . <p> When he went to Manhattan in April 2010 he used a company called A-1 Hospitality Limousine at least three times and spent $338 . That company is now out of business . So when FOX19 tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vehicle Williams was driven around in , we got a message saying the company 's phone number no longer works . <p> FOX19 showed Fran Barrett , the Cincinnati attorney who is currently the chairman of the U.C. Board of Trustees , the credit card records yesterday at his downtown office . He said it was the first time he had seen them , though auditors comb through records like these , he said . <p> " I would certainly hope that anybody would never abuse anything like that , " Barrett said . " And again , I was not aware of any . " <p> After Dr. Williams resigned , many union workers at U.C. were outraged that at a time when university leaders say they have to cut back on their healthcare benefits , the board signed two separate agreements with Williams worth about $1.3 million . <p> " The wage they 're offering is not a livable wage , " said Carolyn Schwier , president of the U.C. chapter of the Service Employees International Union . <p> She says the university has presented her union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on a wage and benefit agreement . <p> " One of the most worrisome things is what they 're proposing on health benefits , " Schwier said . " So that in the year 2014 , their offer basically is that we will get whatever they say we get . It almost ends collective bargaining for health benefits . " <p> In response , board chairman Barrett said he knows the unions are being asked to sacrifice . But he does n't apologize for the lifestyle U.C. affords its top leaders . <p> " I know times are tough , " Barrett said . " I know how the union employees feel . And we 're going to do everything we can to be as fair to them as possible . But on the other hand , there 's no extravagance on our part in treating our top executives . " <p> Copies of Dr. Williams ' two severance agreements , obtained by FOX19 , show that Williams will be paid $555,000 over the next two years for classes he 'll never teach . Also included is a consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board and talk about the status of past fundraising and image-building projects he was involved with at U.C. For those consultations , which will last " up to " 40 hours a month , the university will pay Williams $25,000 a month until next September . Then his salary drops to nearly $17,000 a month . The consulting agreement ends in September of 2014 . <p> Barrett says Williams ' original contract called for even longer payments for " teaching . " You might think of it as a prenuptial agreement inside a contract --- except the university was n't protecting its assets . It was allowing Dr. Williams to choose what he wanted should there be a professional " divorce , " a moment that arrived on a Tuesday afternoon in August . <p> With so many talented people out of work because of the Great Recession when Williams came on-board in November 2009 , FOX19 asked Barrett if trustees could n't have found a good leader for the university who was cheaper . <p> " I do n't think so , " said Barrett . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's well within mid-range . And again , to attract somebody in the future to replace the president , you must treat that person not only fairly but consistent with market conditions . " <p> Which brings us to the new president , Dr. Santa Ono , who used to be U.C. 's provost . <p> Barrett revealed to FOX19 that back in May , Dr. Williams was so worried about another university luring Dr. Ono away that he convinced the board to pay-off Ono 's mortgage on a home in Atlanta . It cost U.C. about $172,000 . <p> Ono would n't sit down with FOX19 to talk about it . But through a university spokesman he released this statement : <p> " My compensation is established by the UC Board of Trustees , " Ono 's statement said . " I am truly honored by the confidence they have placed in me and commit to doing the best job possible for the students , faculty , and staff of the University of Cincinnati .

This long-neglected iconic structure will create new commercial energy in our downtown , and in turn , nurture continued job growth and generate new tax revenues . <p> We 're no longer hemorrhaging people or money . Those days are past . <p> Today , we 're growing again . Young people are moving into Richmond , not out . Our finances are growing stronger , not weaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating . <p> Stronger finances make everything more achievable , whether it is improving city schools or revitalizing a neighborhood . <p> Our strength no longer depends on the surrounding counties . We 're growing strong on our own because all great regions need strong core cities . <p> Richmond has never had momentum like this before . <p> But what I know is .... unless we seize the momentum and make bold new moves , we 'll be stuck where we are and we wo n't get to where we need to be . <p> There is a cost to not acting ... <p> The reality is , as the city grows , so do our expenses . Our public schools , roads , and numerous other services need more money . <p> The best option for us is to expand our tax base to generate more property tax and sales tax revenue . <p> REVITALIZE RVA <p> And that is what Revitalize RVA is all about . <p> I want to be clear . The Redskins project was about more than football , and the Shockoe plan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating good , living wage jobs that people can get to . It 's about taking non-revenue-producing parcels of land , and ensuring that they are strategic revenue-generating properties for the city . This plan is about investments that will generate new money that we can use for schools and neighborhoods . The plan is simply good business . <p> We all know our schools need a lot of help , and it 's going to take more money . Neighborhoods along Jeff Davis Highway need sidewalks . Streets in the Fan need new streetlights . We need more officers on the street . <p> All of that takes money . <p> So where 's it going to come from ? <p> We could generate it by raising the real estate tax rate . But we already pay the highest rate in central Virginia . That hits everybody hard , rich and poor alike . So that 's not a good option . <p> Or we could get more people to shop in Richmond , to generate more sales tax revenue . <p> But that 's not going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the City of Richmond , north of the James River . We did have that a generation ago , when Thalhimers and Miller &amp; Rhoads anchored downtown . But those days are past , and we have n't had that since then . <p> Today , when our citizens go shopping , they pay a sales tax that sends money to Henrico and Chesterfield . The 1% that localities get to keep is left in the counties . That 1% translates into millions that help the counties enjoy lower real estate tax rates and that helps the counties pay their bills . <p> No other capital city would settle for that , and neither should we . <p> Let 's look at this squarely ; the city has the highest tax rate in the area at $1.20 per 1,000 , and we 've also got the highest poverty rate at 26% - equating to over 50,000 people in poverty . <p> Anything short of bold and intelligent action to address this reality is unacceptable . <p> We also ca n't take a half-baked approach to addressing these needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... we need bold action if we are to realize the full benefit of this pivotal point in our city . <p> Revitalize RVA is a bold plan . <p> It 's a jobs and economic development plan designed to generate as much new tax revenue as possible by unlocking the potential of two of Richmond 's major undeveloped sites . <p> It takes an under-producing asset in the floodplain and makes it produce . <p> It opens us up to get the best use out of valuable real estate on the Boulevard in a city where we have very limited strategically located land . <p> This plan turns that strategic underutilized land into a high producing asset . <p> I want to keep professional baseball in central Virginia , and we need to do it in a way that benefits Richmond the most . That clearly means locating the ballpark in Shockoe , so we can mitigate the flooding problem affordably , while opening the Boulevard to full development . <p> The alternative is a course that leaves Shockoe behind and fails to create the right conditions for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gentlemen , that 's the cost of not acting . That 's the cost of delay . <p> When we look at the next 20 years , let 's do so with a vision of leaving no one behind . A real vision for our city has to include a plan to face the 26% poverty rate we 've been battling . A real vision our vision considers the state of our schools and the needs of our children . <p> What we have right now is an opportunity to address our problems in either a small way or in a big way . <p> For me the choice is clearwe MUST get the best return on our investment and continue to follow our core principles - principles that have been getting results . <p> It 's time to meet these challenges in a big way . <p> This city can be the greatest capital city in the nation ; all we need to against enforcement of ever-tightening rules

@@14234117 @2834117/ <h> SPECIAL REPORT : Dangerous virus killing dogs <p> A new virus is striking dogs in the middle of the country , and if not treated , it has the potential to kill an infected animal in just days . There 's no vaccine . In other animals , it 's been highly infectious , and scientists still ca n't say with certainty how it 's transmitted . What is certain is this disease could be deadly , especially in kennel settings . Even though cases have been limited to just three states so far - California , Michigan , and Ohio some Richmond Vets fear it 's just a matter of time until it makes its way here . <p> Dr. Olivia Pan is keeping up with all of the latest information for when it does , because early study results are frightening . <p> " They 're suspecting the dogs can bleed into their cavities , their chest into their abdomen , and those are some of the more serious ones that would bleed to their deaths , " said Dr. Pan . <p> It 's called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but mainly in pig populations - it can decimate a hog farm in just a week . Certain pet birds also seem susceptible , especially parrots , parakeets and cockatoos . What 's new is , the virus has never made the jump to dogs - until now . <p> At The Pet Spot , a kennel in a suburb of Cincinnati , three dogs died and a fourth became i 'll in just three days , all suffering from symptoms " consistent " with circovirus . Tests weeks later at the University of California on blood and tissue samples of these dogs and others suspected with the virus from Michigan were n't conclusive that circovirus was responsible for the deaths , since the infected dogs also had other health issues . One vet told me , " it ( circovirus ) was likely a contributing factor . <p> For the owner at the Pet Spot in Ohio , the deaths of 3 dogs in one week has been hard both personally and professionally . <p> " We consider this the loss of three of our family members , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do things the right way , and make sure we 've taken every step to ensure a clean , safe environment . " <p> One of the main problems with circovirus is there 's no easy way to diagnosis it . Since it can kill so quickly , sending blood samples off to a lab for testing just is n't practical . <p> " There 's no way of us knowing it 's the circovirus or not until you do all of these tests , and by then - you do n't get the results back for weeks , " said Dr. Pan . <p> Doctors do know that dogs who are frequently boarded or spend time in " play situations " with large groups of other dogs would be at greatest risk . The bad news is , there 's no vaccine to prevent it - no known cure - and to make matters worse , it 's still not clear how the virus is spread . <p> That fact is especially frightening for kennel or doggie daycare operators responsible for a large number of dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these dogs are going to get sick at the same time , " said Dr. Pan . <p> Since the disease was only first detected in dogs in 2012 , the symptoms are n't set in stone . <p> Here 's what we know : many of the infected dogs had severe inflammation in their intestinal tract , and exhibited varying degrees of lethargy , vomiting , and diarrhea . If your dog exhibits those symptoms , visit the vet immediately , but it 's believed that some dogs can be carriers and not symptomatic . <p> July 06 , 2017 Genesis Tree Service Stafford , a tree removal company in Stafford , VA , has announced that they have received a 5 star review on Google Maps .

I feel like my brain is always thinking about breakfast , lunch and dinner . As a mom that tries to be out and about as much as possible , I have found that planning ahead for breakfast and lunch is necessary to keep my sanity . I think there is nothing wrong with off the cuff meals on a routine day , but if you are planning a zoo trip , or another activity that will be an all-day affair , then trust me , thinking about how everyone is going to be fed ahead of time will save you a lot of headaches . <p> I will fill you in on how I normally plan our meals for a day out . <p> Breakfast : Normally my plan is to do our everyday breakfast at home ; this is what is easiest for me and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later than expected or I will be running behind . When this happens I alter how I do breakfast instead of being late to my destination . A quick breakfast for us is normally milk and dry cereal in a bag . That way it is portable and they can snack on it in the car . <p> My 3-year-old can sometimes be a little cranky about changing her breakfast routine so I usually have a " special " cereal on hand that makes the change exciting rather than annoying . Also , if you do milk in the morning like we do , I recommend having the Horizon boxed milks on hand . They do n't  have to be refrigerated and have a nice long shelf life ! <p> Lunch : This is the meal that is the most important to think ahead about because its the meal that you will most likely run into while you areout . Even if you plan to be home for lunch , think about what you will do if that does n't  work out . For example : if you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Chick Fil A down the street . Just having that mental note and plan will save you from the initial panic of , " Oh no , we are going to miss lunch ! " <p> We normally pack our lunch when we go out . This makes it easy for me to accommodate my girls if they get super hungry before we are ready to go , or as I have mentioned before I will use lunch as a way to keep my kids up in the car . My go to for a packed lunch is almost always an Uncrustable . My 3-year-old is picky and a PB&amp;J is always acceptable to her . The prepackaged Uncrustables are great because you do n't  have to worry about keeping them cold and they are super easy to pack ! <p> Feeding baby on the go When you have a baby that is not fully dependent on solids yet it can make feeding a little tricky sometimes . This is especially true if you are a first time mom , or a second time mom that 's learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as I mentioned above with the older kids , I would recommend having a plan for where you will feed baby if you get stuck out longer than expected . <p> If your baby is formula fed I would suggest packing enough powder and water or even those great ready to use bottles to get you through the day . That way , whether or not you will have enough milk is never a concern . <p> If your baby is breastfed and you are comfortable nursing in public than planning ahead is n't as much of a concern because you will be able to accommodate your baby whenever necessary . If you are not comfortable nursing in public than I would think ahead about where you will nurse before you leave . A lot of places offer nursing mother rooms or private areas that you are welcome to use . <p> By planning ahead you will be able to avoid a stressful run through the zoo or park back to the car to nurse your baby . Now , what if you exclusively pump ? I know this resonates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options above , but this is what I did for both of my girls and I do n't  want to leave these mamas out ! Planning ahead for pumpers is a little trickier than the other feeding options , but is very do able . <p> I would recommend packing your pump ; I always had a bag by the door with a set of pump parts , cleaning cloths , and a battery pack ready to go . That way I could just throw my pump in the bag and I was all set just in case I needed it . <p> If you have a battery pack or car adapter , then pumping in the car is a great option . Also most family restrooms , nursing mother rooms , and handicapped fitting rooms have outlets available for you to use . It took me until baby number 2 and one too many uncomfortable car rides home to figure out that pumping while you are out really is n't that hard , and will make for a much less stressful day for you and your baby .

@@14234215 @2834215/ <h> Governor McAuliffe gives State of the Commonwealth Address <p> Battle lines were drawn on the first day of the General Assembly session . After Tuesday 's special election , Republicans maintain control in the Senate and House , while Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe is fired up for his last year in office . <p> McAuliffe presented his State of the Commonwealth address in the House Chamber Wednesday night . <p> NBC12 interviewed both the Governor and Republican House Majority Leader about what they 're focused on this session - the $1 billion budget deficit , transportation , education funding and job creation . <p> " I 'm fired up , but as you know , I 'm always fired up , " said McAuliffe . <p> He is fired up for his last year in office and his goals for this session . He wants to make sure students are being trained to fill high tech jobs . <p> " Our problem is we have high paying jobs , but we 're not filling them . That is the worst of the worst , because these jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After meeting with companies in California , who he says asked about the controversial bathroom bill , he emphasized he 'll veto it . <p> " Do not think for one second that these discriminatory bills on LGBT members ... they are job killers . Companies have opportunities to go all over the globe . And go to 50 states , they are not going to a state that is putting walls up around them , " said McAuliffe . <p> " I think it 's getting too much attention . It 's ironic the governor talks about being open for business , then talks about social issues , " said House Majority Leader Kirk Cox . <p> Cox says a top priority this session will be balancing the budget after a $1.26 billion deficit resulted in canceling pay raises for state workers . While Congress considers repealing the Affordable Care Act , Medicaid expansion will again be a contentious topic for Virginia . <p> " If we do n't repeal the Affordable Care Act , we have to immediately take Medicaid expansion , " said Cox . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't agree with that . " <p> This year , the House of Delegates will provide archive video of session debates . So in addition to watching the live stream , you can watch archived video on the General Assembly website . <p> Here is the full transcript of the Governor 's State of the Commonwealth address : <p> Speaker Howell , Leader Norment , Ladies and Gentlemen of the Virginia General Assembly , thank you for inviting me to speak to you this evening . And to the people of Virginia who are with us tonight or watching from home , thank you for the honor of serving you as this Commonwealths 72nd Governor . <p> We are joined here this evening by Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring . <p> These two Virginia leaders who have been great partners as we work to build a stronger , more open , and more prosperous Virginia . <p> And of course , our First Lady is with us this evening . <p> Dorothy your work expanding access to healthy nutrition , promoting national service and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state a better place to live . Thank you for your leadership and for your partnership over these past 28 years . <p> We are free to meet here tonight because of the brave men and women at the federal , state and local levels who risk their lives to keep us safe . <p> The head of the Virginia National Guard , General Timothy Williams is with us here tonight thank you and your troops for your service to Virginia and to our nation . <p> We are also joined this evening by one family that embodies the service and commitment our men and women in uniform and their loved ones make to protect our country and our Commonwealth . <p> Shawn Talmadge is a key member of our Commonwealths emergency management and disaster response team . He is also a Lieutenant Colonel in the Virginia National Guard . While we were celebrating the holidays with our families this past year , Shawn was separated from his on a deployment to Kuwait with the 29th Infantry Division . <p> Shawns wife Melana and their two children are with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and every Virginian who serves and sacrifices in uniform to keep us safe . <p> Before we begin , let us pause for a moment of silence in memory of our friend and colleague Chuck Colgan . <p> Senator Colgan was the longest-serving member of the Virginia Senate and a true example of a Virginia gentleman . He will be dearly missed . <p> On this day , three years ago , we met on the steps of this historic building , and I was honored to take the oath to serve the people of Virginia as their governor . <p> That was a day of celebration . But significant work lay ahead . <p> Virginians hired each of us to work for them here in Richmond to solve problems and make their lives better . In a state as large and diverse as ours , that can be a daunting task at any time . But we began our partnership at a unique moment in our Commonwealths history . <p> For years , Virginias economy had floated atop a massive wave of federal spending that created millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hampton Roads . That relationship created economic opportunity , but it also made us overly reliant on federal spending . <p> We all know what happened next as other states began their climb out of the Great Recession , congressional dysfunction led to defense cuts and sequestration that severely hampered Virginias ability to regain its footing . <p> And so as we began our work three years ago today , we had a choice . We could sit back and watch external forces limit our growth or we could work together to open a new chapter of opportunity . <p> We needed to build a new Virginia economy that would grow and create opportunity no matter what happens in Washington , Beijing , or anywhere else in the world . <p> We needed to redouble our focus on economic development and make Virginia more attractive to job creators in sectors like cyber security , bioscience , data analytics , advanced manufacturing , and autonomous vehicles . <p> We needed to align every public system , from transportation to public education to workforce development , with the needs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more open and welcoming climate to attract families and job creators from every walk of life . <p> And so we got to work . <p> Recognizing that 95 percent of the worlds customers live outside the U.S. , we took the Virginia story to 19 countries in every corner of the globe . We took every meeting we could get and convinced job creators to bring new operations to our Commonwealth , or to buy the world-class goods , agricultural products , and services our businesses create . <p> And those efforts are paying off . <p> As of tonight , we 've helped close 853 new economic development deals worth $14.23 billion in capital investment . That is nearly $5 billion more than any administration in Virginia history . <p> And let 's start the year out with a bang . Tonight , I am proud to announce that Navy Federal Credit Union has agreed to locate 1,400 new jobs and invest $102 million in Frederick County . <p> I hope you will join me in welcoming Navy Federal CEO Cutler Dawson and Vice Chair of the Frederick County Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate this major victory for our Commonwealth . <p> And , I am particularly pleased that we beat out the state of Florida for this important project . <p> Bringing new projects like this one to Virginia is critically important . In fact , I just took the red-eye back after two days of business outreach in California , and we are closing in on bringing thousands of new jobs and billions in investment to Virginia , which we will announce this year . <p> But we also need to build lasting infrastructure that will generate even more jobs and economic activity for generations to come . <p> And , working together , we are doing just that . <p> Last year we passed a budget that invested more than $1 billion in public education , the highest level of investment in Virginia history . <p> We are transforming our K-12 system to prepare students for the jobs of the 21st Century , with a particular emphasis on modernizing the SOLs and how we deliver high school education . I want to recognize Delegate Tag Greason , and the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education system . <p> Thanks to the leadership of our First Lady , we are connecting more students with the nutrition they need to thrive in the classroom and grow healthy minds and bodies . Virginia students are hungry to learn , but they can not learn if they are just plain hungry . That is why I am so proud that , last year alone , Virginia schools served 5 million more school breakfasts than the year before . <p> That success would not be possible without leaders who recognize that strong , accessible nutrition programs are essential to a quality education . Dr. Scott Brabrand is one of those leaders . As Superintendent of Lynchburg City Schools , Dr. Brabrand helped oversee a 20 percent increase in school breakfast participation in just one year , adding 550 students to the program . He has also thrown his support behind after-school and summer meal programs to help ensure that the more than 6,000 students who rely on school meals do not go hungry when classes end . <p> Let 's welcome Scott here this evening and thank him for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions we have reformed Virginias workforce development system and incentivized institutions and students to complete degrees and credentials in high-demand industries . <p> And this work comes at a critical time . Virginia is unique our problem is not that we do n't  have high-paying jobs available its that we do n't  have the trained workers to fill those jobs . Last year , Virginia saw 149,000 jobs open in the technology sector alone . And we have 36,000 jobs open today in cyber security . <p> Parents listen to me . The average starting pay for these jobs is $88,000 . Our mission is to prepare students with the skill sets to fill these jobs so they can lead our economy into the future . <p> We helped veterans get into the private workforce faster by offering workforce credit for military training . <p> We expanded the Virginia Values Veterans program to help more than 20,000 veterans find work . <p> We funded the opening of two new veterans care centers so that Virginia men and women who have served in uniform no longer have to wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care they need . <p> We took great strides forward on transportation , undertaking significant projects in high-traffic corridors across Virginia like I-95 , I-64 and I-66 . <p> We passed the Smartscale prioritization process so that decisions are based on data about the benefits to taxpayers and our economy , not backroom deal-making . <p> After several disastrous public-private partnership deals that cost Virginians hundreds of millions , we transformed the process and brought a taxpayer-first approach to negotiating these deals . The results of our efforts are clear . <p> If we had followed the old process , the I-66 outsidethe-beltway project could have cost taxpayers $1 billion . By reforming our system and strengthening how we negotiate , the final deal will not require Virginians to invest one single tax dollar . And , the winning consortium has agreed to include an additional $800 million in private funding for transit , $350 million in corridor improvements , and a $500 million payment to the Commonwealth at closing . Our reforms and leadership resulted in a $2.5 billion turnaround on this one project alone . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Atlantic Gateway Project , which will unlock travel and commerce on road and rail all across the Commonwealth . <p> We returned the Port of Virginia to financial solvency and made record investments to position our Commonwealth as a leader in global trade for generations to come . <p> As a result , the port , which had suffered seven straight years of operating losses and was once unwisely put up for sale , is now profitable and leading the nation in import volume growth . <p> We ensured a bright future for private spaceflight in Virginia by strengthening the MARS Spaceport . <p> We leapt from the back of the pack on cyber security , bioscience , autonomous vehicles , and renewable energy to become a national leader in these cutting edge industries . <p> I am particularly proud of the work we have done on cyber security . This is a critical issue for Virginia . Last year , we experienced more than 70 million cyber-attacks , or one every 4 seconds . We have a responsibility to protect our data from cyber criminals and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Governors Association I have made cyber security the centerpiece of my agenda and I am proud to say that Virginia is leading the way . <p> We took action to protect Virginia from the threat of climate change and sea-level rise , winning a $120 million federal resiliency grant for Norfolk and other communities in Hampton Roads . That is the largest grant given to any state in America . <p> We have made great strides protecting Virginias historic and natural assets as well . After 30 years , we finally reached an agreement with Dupont on the largest natural resource settlement in Virginia history bringing $50 million back to Virginia to improve our environment in Waynesboro and the surrounding area . <p> We undertook an initiative to preserve 1,000 Virginia natural and historic treasures for the enjoyment of generations to come and we accomplished it one full year ahead of schedule . <p> And tonight , I am proud to announce that we have finalized negotiations with the United States Army to expand Virginias historic Fort Monroe so that Virginians and visitors can fully explore its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years have been defined by significant substantive accomplishments on one key policy issue after another . Those achievements are not victories for one party or another . They are victories for Virginia . We achieved them by working together and doing what it takes to build a new Virginia economy from the bottom up . <p> And if you look at the numbers , its clear we are making substantial progress . <p> When I took office , Virginias unemployment rate was 5.4% . Over the course of this administration it fell to as low as 3.7% , which represented the steepest decline in any Governors term in 32 years . <p> Today , as more and more Virginians respond to our strengthening economy by returning to the labor force , our 4.2% rate is 1.2% lower than when we began our work together and the second lowest rate of any major state . <p> In total , Virginia has created 167,100 net new jobs over the past three years . <p> These are important indicators that our efforts are working and that our trajectory is indisputably upward . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , with real stories . I would like to take a moment to tell you about a few people who have benefited from actions we have taken over the past few years . <p> One of the proudest moments of my life came on April 22nd of last year when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and brought Virginia into line with 40 other states that restore the civil rights of people who made mistakes and served their time . <p> That action was greeted by cheers from some corners of this room and lawsuits from others . But the principles of redemption and second chances are essential to a healthy society and I was proud to fight for them . <p> Since that day , my team has worked hard to restore the rights of individuals who have served their time and reentered society to build productive lives . <p> And tonight I am proud to announce that , thanks to those efforts , we have given more than 127,000 Virginians a second chance at citizenship since I took office . <p> I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1968 and grew up in Northern Virginia .

She served her time . She became a productive member of her community . But our policy of disenfranchisement made her a second-class citizen . <p> Until last year . <p> After Terrys rights were restored in August , she walked into a voting booth for the first time in her life this past November , regaining her place in our society and showing all of us how powerful a second chance can be . <p> Terry is with us tonight on behalf of so many Virginians who are proud to have a voice in their Commonwealths future again .

Every single proposal is tied directly to building a new Virginia economy that creates opportunity for families from every walk of life and every corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges facing our Commonwealth today is how we care for our fellow Virginians who suffer from behavioral health disorders . As too many recent tragic events have taught us , our current system is too fragmented and underfunded . <p> The budget I submitted to you last month includes new funding to allow our community services boards to offer same-day service to Virginians experiencing a behavioral health crisis . This will allow our CSBs to serve Virginians rather than turning them away , at risk to their health and the health of others . <p> One result of our challenged mental health system is that too many individuals who suffer from behavioral health disorders wind up in jail , where there are not enough resources to properly care for them . To solve that problem , I have proposed legislation and funding to expand mental health screenings in local and regional jails . <p> As we work to prevent future tragedies , I have proposed legislation giving the Virginia Board of Corrections the authority to investigate deaths in Virginia jails so that its role is clear if one does occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Creigh Deeds for his vision and leadership on this important issue . <p> We can not fully reform our mental health system without tackling the massive epidemic Virginia and states across the nation are confronting with respect to heroin and prescription drugs . In 2015 , we saw more than 800 of our fellow Virginians , of all ages and walks of life , die due to opioid addiction and overdose and when final data is available , we expect total deaths in 2016 to have exceeded 1,000 . Tackling this problem is a matter of life and death for people in every corner of Virginia . <p> My budget proposal includes $5.3 million for increased substance abuse disorder services and new tools to prevent overdose deaths . I have also introduced a package of legislative reforms that include limiting opioid prescriptions written in emergency departments to three days , requiring e-prescriptions for all prescription narcotics and allowing community organizations to distribute Naloxone during opioid response trainings . <p> The men and women affected by this crisis are sons and daughters , mothers and fathers , husbands and wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this epidemic and keep these Virginians , their families and their communities healthy . I look forward to working with Members including Delegates John OBannon , John Bell , and Todd Pillion to confront this urgent problem . <p> Additionally , as we wait for congress to determine the future of the Affordable Care Act , we should remember that Medicaid expansion offers us an additional $300 million per year to strengthen our behavioral health system . <p> As you know , the budget I submitted gives the Governor the authority to expand Medicaid if an enhanced federal match is available after October 1 , 2017 . <p> And even if that is not the case , we should all agree that we have a responsibility to help as many people as we can access health care . Virginians elected us to solve problems . 400,000 people living without health care is a problem . We should never stop seeking ways to solve it . <p> Another matter that deserves our attention is ensuring that our criminal justice system is keeping our communities safe in an effective and cost-efficient manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made transforming Virginias juvenile justice system from an adult-style incarceration system to a data-driven enterprise aimed at putting our young people on a better path . <p> One way to accomplish that goal is to increase the Commonwealths threshold for felony larceny from $200 to $500 . Right now Virginia is tied with New Jersey for fiftieth out of fifty for the most punitive felony threshold in the nation . <p> Let us work to bring Virginia up from the bottom of the rankings on this important issue . <p> Another step we can take to protect Virginians economic productivity is to limit the number of people whose drivers licenses are suspended due to unpaid court costs and non-driving related offenses . <p> Suspending peoples drivers licenses limits their ability to work , which only makes it more difficult to earn the money to pay off their debt and build better lives . <p> Additionally , I am proposing to make it easier for people who have been wrongly convicted of crimes to clear their names . This bill will allow individuals to petition for a writ of actual innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they pleaded guilty . <p> Last month I submitted my amendments to the Commonwealths biennial spending plan for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 . The plan I presented to you addresses the Commonwealths revenue shortfall , while protecting core services like education and public safety . It has n't  always been easy , but our work together on the budget has always been marked by bipartisan cooperation . I particularly want to thank Chairmen Jones , Ware , Norment and Hanger for your continued partnership on Virginias spending plan . <p> Our state workforce is the best in America , and they deserve more compensation than they currently receive . I am proud that we have worked over the past three years together to pass two such salary increases , after employees went 8 years without one . <p> While language in our budget restricted the second raise due to our revenue shortfall , the budget offers Virginias teachers , state employees and state-supported local employees a 1.5% bonus as a stopgap until our revenue conditions allow for a permanent increase in base pay . <p> If our revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to prioritize a more significant pay increase . <p> Even as we have dealt with a challenging revenue picture , the budget I submitted to you does not make any program cuts to K-12 education . <p> It also requires fewer reductions from our higher education system than originally anticipated . <p> I am proud of the work we have done together to strengthen Virginias education system from Pre-K through higher-ed and mid-career workforce training . This session we can build on those accomplishments together . <p> We all agree that technology provides us with the opportunity to offer high-quality education to students who are unable to attend school in a traditional setting . This year I am proposing to offer full-time , high-quality virtual learning to every Virginia student . <p> I am also proposing several pieces of legislation aimed at helping Virginians access student financial aid and pay those loans off as quickly and easily as possible . <p> To meet that challenge , I am proposing a Borrowers Bill of Rights to provide student loan borrowers with basic consumer protections and more information and assistance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give Virginias institutions of higher education the authority to restructure financial aid to incentivize students to complete degrees within four years . This proposal will help schools minimize the amount of debt students are incurring on the way to a degree . Delegate Kirk Cox and Senator Dick Saslaw have been leaders on this issue and I look forward to working with them in the coming weeks . <p> As we prepare our students to work and succeed in the new Virginia economy , we have a responsibility to use taxpayer dollars wisely to ensure that there are jobs waiting for them when they graduate . <p> I know we all agree that we should strengthen how our Commonwealth serves taxpayers with respect to economic development . <p> I am proud of the record-breaking success we have achieved bringing new jobs and economic activity to Virginia . However , if we are going to build a new Virginia economy , we must use every single dollar to its greatest impact creating jobs and opportunity . <p> Since it was created nearly 22 years ago , the Virginia Economic Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many hard-working men and women at VEDP , but , as a recent JLARC report identified , the organization is in need of stronger management and accountability . <p> Reforming VEDP should not be a partisan issue . Its problems have persisted over the terms of 5 previous Governors and 21 General Assembly sessions . I am ready to work with you to ensure that Virginias economic development infrastructure is delivering the return on investment that taxpayers have a right to expect . <p> Making Virginia the best home to veterans and military families is another area of significant bipartisan achievement over the past three years . <p> The budget I proposed to you will expand the success we have achieved connecting veterans with jobs through the V3 program . I am proposing a two-year pilot to assist veteran entrepreneurs who want to start companies in high-growth sectors . <p> We can also direct our social service agencies to better coordinate with military authorities in the cases of family abuse and neglect of military children . <p> These initiatives will strengthen our Commonwealths position as the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <p> Last year we worked together on a historic bipartisan package to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who can not pass background checks . The legislation we passed included the first meaningful restrictions on dangerous gun ownership in a generation , and showed the rest of the world that common sense compromise on this issue is possible . <p> This year , we have an opportunity to strengthen the domestic violence protection law , which is already the toughest in the nation , by expanding it to include non-family abuse orders as well as permanent protective orders . This change , which is being sponsored by Senator Janet Howell and Delegate Kathleen Murphy , would keep more Virginians safe from gun crime . <p> Additionally , let 's make 2017 the year we make universal background checks for firearm sales the policy of our Commonwealth . <p> Over the years we have also worked together productively to reform our Commonwealths ethics system . The reforms we passed , including a cap on gifts that can be accepted from lobbyists , have contributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginias worldwide reputation for clean and well-run government . <p> This year , I propose that we ban the personal use of campaign funds . There is room for honest disagreement on many ethical issues , but we should all be able to agree that political contributions should be spent informing voters , not lining politicians pockets . <p> Any effort to build a stronger economy and society must begin with giving as many Virginians as possible a full voice in that society . Unfortunately , here in Virginia and across the nation , too many laws have been passed that are designed to restrict access to democracy rather than expand it . <p> When it was passed , our photo I 'd law made it significantly harder for many Virginians to vote , without any evidence that voter fraud is a problem in Virginia . And so this year I hope we will repeal it . <p> I will also submit legislation this session to allow no-excuse in-person absentee voting , and to add a new excuse for absentee by-mail for child caregivers . <p> These reforms are based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working together to make it easier to vote , not harder . <p> For the past three years , our work together has seen far more bipartisan victories than divisive battles . While political fights rage in Washington , we have proven again and again that Virginia is a place where leaders still work together to get things done . <p> In fact , over the past two sessions , we have worked together to pass 72 percent of the initiatives I have presented to you and I thank you for that . <p> We can build on that record this year but only if we remain focused on the issues that are most important to Virginians . <p> As we begin our work together this session , our neighbor North Carolina remains mired in a divisive and counterproductive battle over laws its legislature passed that target the rights of LGBT citizens . As we have seen in that state and others , attacks on equality and womens health care rights do n't  just embarrass the states that engage in them they kill jobs . <p> Since North Carolinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the state has lost out on millions in economic activity and thousands of jobs , as organizations like Deutsche Bank , Paypal , the NBA and the NCAA have withdrawn investments in the state . <p> At the same time , Virginia has taken a different approach . Over the past three years , we have worked to send a message to families and job creators all over the globe that our Commonwealth will not tolerate discrimination against anyone , including our friends and neighbors in the LGBT community . <p> And those efforts are paying off . This year , Virginia competed directly with North Carolina for the CoStar Groups new research headquarters . And we started at a disadvantage when North Carolina put an incentive package on the table that was three times the size of our own . <p> But in the end , Virginias open and welcoming business climate trumped North Carolinas attacks on equality , and Costar is bringing 732 new high-paying jobs right here to the city of Richmond . <p> And so tonight I am simply asking for your assistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them away . <p> First , I want to make it very clear that I will veto any legislation that discriminates against LGBT Virginians or undermines the constitutional health care rights of Virginia women . <p> I am 71-0 on veto override votes and I 'm ready to keep the streak alive . But I hope you will deny me the opportunity by simply refraining from sending them to me so that we can spend our time on more productive pursuits . <p> Second , we must protect and enhance our business climate by erasing division and discrimination from our code and our constitution . <p> After a landmark ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court , in which our Attorney General Mark Herring played a central role , marriage equality is now the law of our land . We should not wait another session to comply with that ruling and take our outdated ban off our books . <p> In years past , Virginia also created laws that are overt efforts to undermine a womans access to reproductive health care . Before I took office , I pledged to do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health clinics that offer abortion services . <p> After working with Lieutenant Governor Northam to overhaul the Virginia Board of Health and following a lengthy regulatory process , I am proud to say we have kept our promise and prevented that law from closing a single clinic . <p> That law , along with Virginias law forcing a medically unnecessary ultrasound on a woman , does not keep people safer or healthier . <p> They do nothing more than inject government into decisions that should be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor -- so let 's repeal them both this year . <p> If we can work together to roll back unwise attacks on equality and constitutional rights , and stand against future proposals , we can send a clear message that Virginia is a Commonwealth of equal opportunity for people and job-creators from every walk of life . <p> The next 45 days offer us the opportunity to cement the progress we have made together on so many issues , and to address problems that still need to be solved . <p> If we seize this opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that works better for people from every corner of the Commonwealth and every walk of life . <p> We can bring hope to communities that are ravaged by the opioid epidemic and to families with a loved one battling a mental illness . <p> We can strengthen our economic development efforts so that every taxpayer dollar goes directly into creating new opportunity and economic activity . <p> We can expand virtual learning for public school students and offer low-income Virginians a shot at the dream of a college education . <p> We can make Virginia an even better place to live for military families and for veterans who are eager to start a successful business here in our Commonwealth . <p> We can make our government even more transparent and accessible to the people who own it . <p> And we can continue to show the nation and the world that Virginia is a place where leaders come together to get things done , no matter their political points of view . <p> Three years ago we met on the steps of this building and began what some might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and difficult campaign , we had every reason to retreat to our partisan corners . <p> But we took a different course . We identified the issues where compromise could be reached and we got to work making life better for the people whom we serve . <p> And so this evening , as we begin our final session of work together , I want to thank you . For your leadership , your partnership and your dedication to overcoming political obstacles on the way to doing the right thing . <p> We have real incentive to work together . As the father of five , I share the dream of every Virginia parent that my children will find opportunities to live , work and raise a family here in our home state . But that will not be possible without the vision and leadership of the people in this room . <p> And so , as I conclude , I hope you will join with me for one more session to strengthen the foundation we have laid for a new Virginia economy and build upon it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals I have set forth this evening , and I look forward to considering the legislation you will send me over the coming days . <p> If we take this opportunity to work together , I know we will emerge at the end of this session with a stronger , more resilient economy that works for all Virginians . <p> May God Bless each of you and may God continue to bless the greatest state , in the greatest nation on Earth .

" The results support the need for improved monitoring and intervention strategies to reduce the risk of respiratory compromise and improve outcomes .

One of my favorite things to do is to take day trips , my girls and I try to go as often as we can . I always feel lucky that we are in an area that has so many great options for day trips .

My tip to make your trip a little more special , stop at Jamestown Pie Company and pick up a delicious pot pie to have for dinner after you get home , trust me its worth it ! <p> When I first started this blog I wrote down a list of topics that I wanted to focus on first , screen time was at the top of my list .

I will start off by saying that the purpose of this post is not to tell you how much TV , iPad , or computer time your kids should have , that is a decision for each family to make on their own . I am going to say that I have found that a lot of times when moms talk about their little ones watching a movie , or playing on an iPad they feel the need to defend the choice . I can usually sense a little bit of shame in the decision , I know I am personally guilty of this . <p> Do n't  feel shameful . <p> Whether you are a parent that allows no screen time , a little screen time , or a lot of screen time , what ever decision you have made do n't  feel guilty about it .

Some days more then others , but we know all the shows on Disney Junior , and we have watched all the princess movies on repeat . What can I say ? We are a girl house . This is where I stand with screen time for my kids , everything in moderation . <p> What about personal screen time ?

I kept a log of everything I wanted to do with my phone during this time . I was surprised at what I discovered . I thought I was only using my phone during down time , but the reality is I was using it frequently throughout the day and turning all phone usage into addressing immediate needs . Here are a few examples from my log : I need to order dog food , I need to check on the guest pass policy for our pool , I need to check the weather for next week , I need to RSVP to a party , I need to text my girlfriends a funny picture of my child , the list goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the things on the list could wait until later . I found during the time I was unplugged I was more patient with my girls , they were less needy , and we overall have had better days . <p> Since my experiment I try to be more aware of how often I am on my phone and try to limit myself when I can . Our phones are great tools for moms and dads at home , they enable you to stay connected to the outside world and feel less isolated . However , If you find yourself taking a little too much time away from reality , then maybe it is time for a little screen time audit . Even if its only for a day , you might be surprised what you discover .

( Source : NBC12 ) @qwx183768 <p> A controversial new audit claims veterans are still facing long wait times for care at McGuire Veterans Medical Center in Richmond , Virginia . The leader of the VA and the hospital dispute the findings . <p> The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General conducted the audit in response to ongoing concerns about wait times between April 2016 and January 2017 . The report says McGuire and 11 other hospitals in North Carolina under-reported just how long veterans are waiting to see doctors for appointments . Auditors also say these hospitals put incorrect scheduling data into the system . <p> The audit estimated that 36 percent of appointments for new patients had waits of more than 30 days . The average wait for these patients was 59 days . <p> The audit also looked at Veterans Choice , the program created to cut down on these long waits . Patients are referred to doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 30 days or if they lived more than 40 miles from a VA Medical Center . <p> The audit says the average wait time for patients who received care through Veteran 's Choice was 84 days . <p> This is something the On Your Side Investigators documented last November through paraplegic veteran Brian Kearns . He waited more than six months for a shoulder surgery and for someone to look at a sore on his chest . He was referred to Veteran 's Choice , but the people running that program never called him back about the dermatology appointment until we reported on the problems . <p> " They think they 've created a program that will help . They did n't . They created a program that 's worse , " said Kearns in November . <p> VA Secretary David Shulkin took issue with the findings in the audit - specifically with the way the inspector general calculated wait times . He questioned the methodology , saying the findings did not account for patients who pushed back their own appointments : <p> Because OIG uses a methodology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration ( VHA ) policy , I can not concur with some of the conclusions in this report nor use them for management decisions . I am primarily concerned that OIG used a criterion for determining whether schedulers had appropriately recorded a Veterans preferred date for their appointment that is not required by our policies . This means the OIG finds our schedulers deficient at doing something that we do not require them to do . It also means the OIG ignored the dates patients told us they wanted to be seen , and selected an earlier date to use for calculating wait times . As a result , the wait times OIG calculates are longer than what VHA reports , simply because the OIG has discounted Veterans preferred dates for appointment . <p> McGuire Medical Center agrees with Shulkins assessment . In a statement , Spokesperson Darlene Edwards wrote : " We are privileged to serve more than 60,000 Veterans in central Virginia and we are committed to ensuring they have access to the care they need , when they need it .

Though the report does not find intentional misreporting , it does find that actual wait times are drastically longer than what is being reported . The VAs own standard on appointment wait times is not being met , either due to a lack of understanding or a lack of training . The bottom line is our veterans are not getting the timely care they deserve . <p> I have worked on this issue since 2014 and have again asked for an explanation from the VA IGs office and a briefing from the VA on what actions are being taken to respond to this report .

She asked how was she going to be able to pay half of her car insurance only working part time making minimum wage . Enter the opportunity to discuss budget . I would go to her at the end of the month and ask for her half . Which forced HER to budget . Getting paid bi-weekly she had to set money aside . A couple months went by and it finally clicked .

It went number one in the UK . Ferry enlisted the help of some of his famous musician friends like Pink Floyd 's David Gilmour and Dire Straits ' Mark Knopfler for the album .

To experience someone so influential , it 's hard to quantify his importance . <p> If Ferry and Roxy Music need any more validation , here 's part of U2 drummer Adam Mullen Jr .

The Modern Olympic Games are a captivating display of strength , endurance , speed , tenacity and perseverance . <p> With each Olympiad we marvel at the incredible feats of physical strength on display . In those two weeks we see the results of what was years , even a lifetime in the making . <p> Athletes train a lifetime , for what may be a few seconds of action . All their work , all their sacrifices are bundled up in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony of defeat . <p> So much time , work and sacrifice is poured into the race .

And even the slightest distraction from the course laid out before them , can result in a world-class athletes crushing defeat . <p> ( PAUSE ) <p> For the last six years I have had the honor of a lifetime serving you and this Great State as Governor . Six years ago I solemnly took the Oath of Office to uphold our States Constitution . <p> And six years ago I personally made a commitment to the people of this State , to submit myself a humble servant to the men , women and children who proudly call Alabama home , to help create well-paying jobs so they can support their families , to make sure every child has the opportunity to receive the best education , to support our most vulnerable the disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I committed myself to the careful consideration that all men , all Alabamians , are created equal regardless of race , political party , gender or economic status . I vowed never to accept a salary until every Alabamian who wants a job can get a job . <p> The course laid out before us six years ago was filled with uphill obstacles of soaring unemployment , bleak state budgets , an unprecedented environmental disaster and a natural disaster that would go down in history . <p> Facing those obstacles head on , this race is still being run today with every bit of tenacity and endurance as when we left the starting gate . <p> More people in Alabama are working than at any time in our Administration . <p> Alabamas labor force is the largest its been in five years . <p> And tonight we can proudly announce we have now reached the milestone of 2 million Alabamians in the workforce . <p> Running full sprint toward our goal of Full Employment , we are intentional with our mission to Put Alabamians Back To Work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham were laid off , when maritime workers were needed in Mobile , the Alabama Department of Labor held a series of successful job fairs to connect jobs with our people . <p> 500 employers ready to hire have participated and lines of job seekers often stretched out the door and down the street . <p> As a result of those efforts , today approximately 1,000 more Alabamians have a job . <p> Alabamas manufacturing industry is growing with more Alabamians working in the sector than before the 2008 Recession . <p> Since taking office in 2011 my Administration has sought , recruited , announced , broken-ground and celebrated over 92,000 well-paying jobs for the people of this state . <p> There is little that is more gratifying to me at this point in our Administration than to see the seeds of economic development planted in a community , take root and come into the full bloom of well-paying jobs that feed and support families . <p> The world took notice of Alabama in 2012 when we welcomed Airbus and the aerospace industry to Mobile .

The First-of-its-kind infrastructure program is a hallmark of this Administration and the tremendous cooperation we enjoy between state and local governments . <p> Since the first project began five years ago , you 've seen across our Great State hundreds of roads improved and dangerous bridges replaced . Those orange barrels on county roads , asphalt pavers on highways and Alabama workers manning equipment to replace crumbling bridges are the results of ATRIP , Alabamas Infrastructure Success Story . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on schedule for your local communities . These are projects specifically requested from local governments . Already over 700 projects have been completed . <p> And the effects of ATRIP reach beyond the pavement - 94 percent of all ATRIP projects have been won by Alabama contractors . <p> Now in its fifth year , ATRIP is the number one reason some of those contractors were able to stay in business . <p> When bureaucracy grinds government to a halt , ATRIP has been an answered prayer for communities . Just ask Marshall County about the Redmill Bridge . <p> The dangerous bridge was the site of fatal car crashes . It was an impediment to the local economy heavily dependent on local poultry farms . Chicken trucks could n't even turn on the road , blocking access to farms and serving as an obstacle to greater overall economic development . <p> Like many of you have seen in your local districts , it was one of those projects everyone wanted and the community desperately needed yet no one in Marshall County thought they would ever see in their lifetime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locals and together last month we celebrated the completion of the largest Marshall County project ever . <p> When there is an obstacle along the course of this race we run , we will " find a way or we will make one " . <p> When this race began , we launched an ambitious effort to save Alabama taxpayers money . <p> It was an uphill climb , Alabama was essentially broke , savings accounts had been wiped out and federal stimulus dollars were gone . <p> But we knew there were opportunities to find efficiencies , to consolidate , to cut and to trim the size of state government and ultimately save taxpayers millions of dollars . That is exactly what we did then , and exactly what we continue to do even to this day . <p> We launched an ambitious plan in 2012 with a goal to save one billion dollars by the end of our Administration . Not only did we reach that goal , but we accomplished it much earlier than expected . <p> Alabama led the nation in our road to a billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tonight , that Alabama taxpayers have now saved a stunning $1.2 billion annually . <p> This Administration worked so fast and so efficiently that of the 26 new governors elected nationwide in 2010 , we reduced the size of our states bureaucracy at the third fastest pace . <p> President Trump has already taken decisive and necessary action to enforce our nations immigration laws . And let me repeat , what we made clear last week : <p> Alabama will not support Sanctuary Cities or institutions that harbor or shelter illegal immigrants , and are in clear violation of the laws of the nation . We will enforce the law . <p> Tonight , to members of our Law Enforcement community , and to our men and women who proudly defend our nation in the greatest military in the world We say Thank You ! <p> ( APPLAUSE ) <p> The dawn of the new Presidential Administration has ushered in a truly remarkable time in our States history . <p> States and their Governors are enthusiastic about the Trump Administration because finally WE are being heard , concerns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long decried the overreach of the Federal government , the unfunded mandates , the suffocating and stifling regulations handed down . <p> From the campaign trail and from this podium you 've heard me time and again declare my long held beliefs in our great Constitution , the Power and Authority it grants to The States . <p> Our country is made up of fifty sovereign states , and Governors like myself , have stood firm while costly mandates were shoved down our throats , and said collectively " no more . " <p> Now states are finally being afforded the opportunity to have a strong voice in the repair or replacement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . I am a physician who cared for all my patients regardless of their ability to pay . Many times I would just get paid in turnip greens and syrup . <p> When I was still practicing medicine , I saw anyone who needed care . I would travel to some of the most impoverished counties in West Alabama and spend a day seeing and caring for patients . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not charge them . Many times , I would buy medications for those who could not afford to buy their prescriptions . <p> As a practicing physician , I would never want anything to come between me and my patient especially the federal government . I am licensed by the state of Alabama , not the federal government , and we will always keep it that way . <p> Today as your Governor , I have to be concerned for our state , and the tremendous cost of accessible and affordable healthcare , not just for patients , but on our entire health care system . <p> Last month my Governor colleagues and I candidly presented our plan for replacing the healthcare that has n't  proved to be affordable , and has yet to prove itself to be a protection for patients . <p> Do we have a problem with accessible health care in this country ? Certainly we do . <p> But one size healthcare does not fit all . No one knows better than the states , what it is that states need . <p> Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that will lead the way with Congress , with better solutions and affordable outcomes . <p> ( PAUSE ) <p> The strength of States is what fuels the momentous overhaul in Education Reform that allows us to take back ownership of our Educational rights . <p> Alabama has taken the lead on the reauthorized federal education legislation known as the Every Student Succeeds Act . <p> Its the greatest devolution of federal power in 50 years , and an incredible opportunity to bring together teachers , superintendents , early childhood educators , business and industry . <p> The new law gives states the ability to keep the decision-making process in education at the local level . <p> ESSA creates a role for every governor to move his or her education system from federal mandate to state-centric approach . <p> Alabama wasted no time taking back control , when I became the first Governor to issue an Executive Order ensuring that it is the Educators , District Leaders and parents who help determine a new direction for schools . <p> In partnership with the Alabama Department of Education , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , Alabama serves as a model for education stakeholder engagement across the country . <p> We 've asked , and education policy leaders enthusiastically shared their input , and have a clear , strong voice in the development of the plan . <p> States have all seen that through failed bureaucratic policies , costly mandates on taxpayers and federal regulations that cripple job growth it is not the Federal government that knows best . <p> ( PAUSE ) <p> The Great State of Alabama has stood for decades at the forefront of some of the most pivotal , incredible and inspiring events in Americas history .

But probably none were as excited as a little girl named Malika . <p> As we were leaving the school , someone told me Malika had something she wanted to say to me . And I soon realized why this little girl was waiting to talk . Malika was non-verbal , and had been all her life . Her teachers told me she was unable to speak , until the gift of technology changed all that . <p> This non-verbal child could now virtually " speak " through the use of her very own iPad . Technology has opened up her world , and the door of opportunity for a better education . <p> Opportunity is not out of reach for our children , we just have to make sure we as leaders provide them . <p> We have the greatest ability to do that through what is an absolute Jewel in our state . <p> Alabamas First Class High Quality Pre K is a proven success . <p> Each year since I 've been Governor we have steadily increased funding for Pre-K , weve expanded classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabamas children . <p> There is no denying the positive results of children who attend a First Class PreK . Four-year-olds are building on a firm foundation , demonstrating higher achievement at higher grade levels . Weve seen the results . In study after study , a four year old enrolled in one of our high quality First Class Pre-K Programs misses fewer school days , they are much less likely to be retained , or held-back , in higher grades and most importantly they are ready for Kindergarten . <p> We studied four year olds when they first enrolled in Pre-K and again when they completed their year . We found that students at the beginning of the year scored below " widely held expectations " for school readiness . By the time they completed Pre-K , over 90% were meeting or exceeding the expectations across the board . <p> These children were more than ready to start school . That is why by the third grade , we 've found PreK children , especially those from low-income families are scoring well in critical areas of math and reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Class PreK supports a strong foundation for school success and school readiness and most importantly for our state , our families and our future success of our children it is closing the achievement gap for our most vulnerable children . <p> And that 's why for the last 10 years Alabamas First Class PreK has been awarded the highest quality rating by the National Institute for Early Education Research . <p> Why then would we just stop with 4 year olds ? Why do n't  we look beyond the undeniable success of what we can do with our four-year-olds and expand on that success where its most needed ? <p> Why then when Alabama 3rd graders fall woefully far behind in reading scores , when as our Superintendent said , we have a " Math crisis " in Alabama , would we not want to extend the gains we are making with the four year olds up to elementary school ? <p> Jeana Ross Secretary of the Department of Early Childhood Education and State Superintendent Michael Sentance are joining forces and working side by side to align and integrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model with how we educate those in Kindergarten up to the Third Grade . We know based on the success of Pre-K the result will be higher achievement , but most importantly children who can read , who can compete and who have a strong foundation . <p> Once again this year we are expanding the reach of Pre-K so that even more 4 years olds have an opportunity for a new strong foundation , with a $20 Million dollar increase to fund 160 more PreK classrooms . Over 28-hundred more children will have access to a First Class High Quality Pre- K classroom . <p> PreK is truly an Alabama success story , our 4 year olds are thriving , and we are ranked Number One in America . Not only is it transforming how students learn , its transforming how Educators teach . I hear from Pre-K teachers across the state who tell me they are amazed with the results they see among their students , they are excelling , they are thriving . And they tell me it makes them better teachers . The success of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pre-K teachers , dedicated to our children . <p> Tonight it is my honor to introduce you to three of our First Class Pre-K teachers here with us . Chelsi Jones , Angie Dillard and Alicia Koonce are from Coffee County and they are just three of our great Pre-K teachers all across Alabama . We have the Number One PreK in America because of our Pre-K teachers . They are Alabamas true National Championship Team . <p> ( APPLAUSE ) <p> Alabama leads the nation in our efforts to ensure every person has a voice and every citizen is heard . <p> In the last decade , the number of minorities in our state has grown . Women now make up more than half of our population . The Hispanic population has doubled and the Black community is the second largest group in the state . <p> Ive spent time with and listened to many of you , leaders and representatives of our minority communities . You shared with me your needs , your frustrations and your concerns . Out of those discussions came a solution to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in state government . <p> As part of Great State 2019 , last June Alabama became only the second state in the nation to establish a Cabinet-level Office specifically focused on the needs of minority communities . The Governors Office of Minority Affairs offers a perspective on addressing minority and womens issues , and this year we will introduce a slate of initiatives aimed at strengthening these groups . <p> ( PAUSE ) <p> In 65 of Alabamas 67 counties we have a shortage of doctors , Alabama ranks 40th in the number of physicians per capita and we rank last in the number of dentists . <p> Great State 2019 meets this challenge head on . Last year we took action to stop rising rates of preventable and manageable disease , especially among , rural , low-income counties . <p> By expanding and increasing funding for loan-repayment programs for healthcare providers we have taken action to increase the number of doctors serving in the states poorest counties . <p> Having practiced medicine for 35 years , and having seen the needs of patients in some of the most impoverished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good doctor in a small , rural community , changes a community and it saves lives . <p> We will increase funding for Alabamas low-income children and youth so they may have access to home-based services and treatment of Psychiatric , emotional and behavioral disorders . <p> In addition , through Great State 2019 , we will increase funding for treatment for Alabamas low-income children with Autism Spectrum Disorder . <p> ( PAUSE ) <p> We are taking bold steps to protect the people of our state from one of the greatest and deadliest attacks in our nations history . It does n't  come from a foreign enemy , the deaths are not the result of an unknown killer , the weapons are not advanced missiles , assault rifles or even bombs . <p> Opioid painkillers have fueled one of the deadliest drug epidemics in our nations history , killing 78 people every day . <p> Over-prescribing painkillers has led to a steady increase in drug-related deaths over the last 15 years . <p> Alabama is the highest painkiller prescribing state in the nation and nonmedical use of pain relievers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That is why in 2016 I joined 45 other Governors in signing the Compact to Fight Opioid Addiction , through the National Governors Association . This marks the first time in more than 10 years that governors have developed a compact through NGA to spur coordinated action on an urgent national issue . In 2012 and 2013 the Legislature passed , and I signed into law several bills needed to fight drug abuse and in particular , opioid abuse . <p> Last December we created the Alabama Council on Opioid Misuse and Addiction to continue to build on existing efforts to combat opioid abuse in our state and present to me innovative ideas to put an end to this deadly epidemic . <p> The Council consists not only of healthcare professionals but real people who have had real experiences with the devastating effect opioid addiction has on the lives of our people . <p> Opioid addiction is an epidemic in Alabama and across the country . Our states potential is too great , our people too precious to ignore . All of our people ; The poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Behind the razor wire fences , iron bars and concrete walls of Alabamas 17 major Correctional Facilities are thousands of men and women who also call our state home . <p> They are there because of terrible choices made , tragic mistakes , or even intended harm . <p> Whatever the reason the men and women are serving their sentence of punishment , they are all taking up long term and possibly permanent residence in a cellblock cut off from society , from family , from their children . <p> But each Sunday a group of people from the largest church in the state , faithfully travel to 14 of these facilities and Worship with the inmates . Side by side " saint and sinner " tune in to the same church service some of us out here in the " free world " may be attending . <p> During that church hour some of Alabamas most hardened and hated convicted criminals are raising their tattooed hands in worship , they are hearing the Word of God preached and they are bowing their heads in solemn prayer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free world " go home to Sunday dinner , these inmates who shared the same Sunday service go back to some of the worst conditions , in the worst facilities of any prison in the country . <p> Decades old buildings , never intended to house triple the inmates that are packed inside , are literally crumbling . <p> Draper Correctional Facility in Elmore County was built in 1939 before World War II . Still open today , Draper houses double the inmates it can sustain . <p> The entire kitchen floor has collapsed , repairs to a Depression era facility are cost prohibitive to say the least . <p> And its no wonder 78-year-old pipes meant to accommodate 600 people are operating at 200-percent capacity . <p> Its not just Draper - nearly all DOC facilities are double , sometimes triple capacity , infrastructure is collapsing and the tensions created among inmates and officers by the deteriorating facilities and overcrowded conditions have even become deadly . <p> Alabama is about to embark on a complete transformation of the states prison system . <p> The Alabama Prison Transformation Initiative will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21st Century . <p> The initiative will consolidate 14 of 16 maximum custody level prisons into four large scale , state of the art regional correctional facilities three mens facilities and one womens facility to permanently replace Tutwiler Prison for Women . <p> Combined with recent prison reform legislation that has reduced the prison population , the increased capacity of these 4 larger facilities will reduce the prison population to 125 percent over the next five years . <p> Four large facilities will help us save tens of millions on maintenance costs for these Depression era buildings , we will save millions on overtime and personnel costs of Officers and staff , protecting not just inmates but our law enforcement officers as well . <p> And the facilities will be much better able to provide proven and badly needed rehabilitation and re-entry programs for substance abuse treatment , counseling , job training and work release training so that inmates are able to successfully transition back into our communities . <p> Better facilities will provide better and broader rehabilitation programs and that means inmates are less likely to find themselves back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Corrections . The men and women inside these prison walls are there for Just punishment . But they are not there to slip further into a cycle of dependency , crime , violence and hopelessness . <p> Ask those who hold the church services there every Sunday what theyve seen . When an inmate has hope for a better life on the inside , there is a greater opportunity for restoration of families , communities and lives on the outside . <p> Deborah Daniels can tell you that 's true . She served her time in prison . When she was finally released , Deborah , free from iron bars , chose to surrender her life for Gods glory . She thought she was finished with a life behind bars , but God had a different plan . <p> Nearly a decade later , Deborah is in vocational ministry , serving in Prison Fellowship . She works closely with DOC helping inmates with their own re-entry into society . She is active with Mentoring Children of Prisoners and now trains volunteers to serve in prison ministry . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a prison after serving her time , listen to what she says . " What motivates me " , she said , " Is that my life is a testimony to others , proof of his amazing grace and the vital role of the Body of Christ in the Transformation and Restoration of sinners . " <p> And ask Frank Gossett . At age eleven Frank started using drugs , and by the time he was a teenager he was caught in the web of addiction to alcohol as well . His $200 a day cocaine habit led him to a life of crime , depression and attempted suicide . Soon Frank was behind DOC bars serving time for theft . <p> Once he was released it was n't long before he was back in prison . But this time a fellow inmate helped Frank give his life to Christ , and although he was still behind bars , Frank will tell you he was set free of the bondage of drugs , alcohol , suicide , depression , victimizing others and guilt . <p> He went through faith-based counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became an Assistant Chaplain at Alabamas death row facility , Holman Prison , where he ministers to the men who are incarcerated there . Frank received a full pardon four years ago , and in 2015 Frank became an ordained minister . <p> Deborah Frank would you please stand so we can honor you for your service to our state . <p> ( APPLAUSE ) <p> The Transformation of Alabamas Prisons will protect our law enforcement officers , overworked and overwhelmed with mounting tensions that have been boiling and building within prison walls . <p> Overcrowded conditions , understaffed Personnel has proven to be a deadly combination . <p> Corrections Officers outmanned by inmates are stretched to their limits , and for one of our Corrections Officers it cost him his life . <p> Officer Kenneth Bettis was an Iraqi War Veteran and a dedicated law enforcement officer . Last summer Officer Bettis was attacked by an inmate , stabbed and killed . Officer Bettis leaves a widow and children . Today his name is etched into Alabamas Law Enforcement Memorial as one of states Fallen Officers . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieving widow . I pray I never have to attend another memorial for another Alabama Corrections Officer . <p> We can not afford to wait any longer to solve this lingering , difficult and deadly problem . It is time to get over this hurdle on this race we are running . It is past time to fundamentally transform the prison system . <p> The risks are too great . The human toll is too high to wait any longer . <p> If you think we cant afford the cost of the transformation , then ask one of our Corrections Officers , ask one of our prison ministry volunteers , ask a former inmate how much their life is worth . <p> Last fall I had the honor of attending one of these church services inside the prison walls . I was at Kilby Correctional Facility . The church service began , the music played and we listened to the sermon . <p> At the end of the service , I was truly moved by what I saw . To hear those men , with their deep , gravelly voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them inside the prison and to see how they want to change their lives , made me realize the Department of Corrections , is Correcting . <p> Still , we have to do more . If we want to truly transform the person , we must first transform the system . <p> We must run around , over and through any obstacle on this course , and finish this race . <p> This last year our state has certainly faced obstacles , tragedies and what looks like impossible challenges . But its in the quiet crucible of suffering , that Gods greatest gifts are given to us . Through every challenge , there 's always hope . <p> There 's a young man in Northport who saving a family from a house fire , there 's a State Trooper in Elkmont stopping to deliver a baby on the side of the road , there 's a First Responder in Birmingham risking his own life , rushing to the scene when a pipeline explodes . <p> There 's a loving community in Rosalie and Rehobeth wrapping their arms around one another when a tornado takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving just one dollar , all she can afford , to help storm victims recover . <p> I see our state , I hear our people , and I know what we are capable of . In the midst of Alabamas greatest challenges , I always have great hope for our Great State . <p> In the year 2019 Alabama will celebrate its 200th Birthday . That year also marks the 50th Anniversary of the day Alabamians put Man on the Moon . And I will have finished my service in Office . I will have finished this race . If Alabamians can put man on the moon , we can build new prisons . <p> If we can lead the world in medical breakthroughs , we can stop the scourge of opioid addiction . <p> If we can win football championships , we can make sure there is a Number One ranked PreK classroom for every four year old . <p> If we can birth a worldwide movement for equality and civil rights , we can make sure every Alabamian who wants a job can get a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling in the same direction . <p> At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics , Derek Redmond was in his final qualifying round to compete for the Gold Medal . Having trained his entire life , Redmond held the World Record in the 400-meter . A world champion , all he had to was finish one more qualifying round before competing for the Gold in his strongest event . <p> The 400 meter race began , and Redmond was off to a strong start . But within site of the finish line , something went wrong . Redmond felt a terrible sharp pain in his right leg . He collapsed to the pavement , and medical staff ran onto the track . <p> Redmond , though , stood back up , hobbling in pain . He waved off the medical staff , limping and hopping toward the goal .

The bill will now move to the Senate for consideration . <p> The proposal , introduced by Del . Rob Bell , R-Charlottesville , would eliminate a statewide ban prohibiting home-schooled students from participating in high school athletics and other interscholastic activities . <p> Bell has introduced similar legislation , which is based on laws from other states , perennially since 2005 . In 2015 and 2016 , Bells legislation passed both the House and Senate but was ultimately vetoed by Gov . Terry McAuliffe . <p> Opponents say home-schoolers do n't  have to meet the same academic standards as public school students , so it would n't be right to let them play alongside regular students in high school sports . <p> McAuliffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Opening participation in those competitions to individuals who are not required to satisfy the same criteria upends Virginias extracurricular framework and codifies academic inequality in interscholastic competition , " the governor wrote in his veto message . <p> Bell counters that this is not the case with his latest iteration of the bill . <p> Under the legislation , students who want to participate in their local high schools athletic programs would have to pass standardized tests and demonstrate " evidence of progress " in their academic curriculum for at least two years . Bell said the home-schoolers also would have to meet the same immunization standards as their public school counterparts . <p> Del . Delores McQuinn , D-Richmond , shared her concerns about the bill on the House floor Tuesday . <p> " As a former school board member and parent of a child who spent a significant number of years in private school , I 'm always hesitant to see us move in this direction , " McQuinn said . <p> " Take my nephew , for instance . As a star basketball player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary determination into reaching his current playing level . Yet if a home-schooling ( student ) is granted the same exposure and resources , it goes without saying that they reap the same benefit after investing a highly disproportionate amount of time . " <p> Bell argued that his bill simply allows home-schooled students who might not fit the typical public school mold the same freedoms as all other students . <p> " If you are a parent and your kid does n't  fit into the public school curriculum right now , you can go private or you can go home-schooling except many places , including a county I represent , have very limited private school options , " Bell said . " Yet were forcing parents to say , You can have football , or you can have the education that you want. " <p> McQuinn said the bill was not a matter of equality , but rather the opposite . <p> " What message does this send to public school parents and students ? " she asked . " One of fairness or favorability ? While public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , I believe the passing of this bill would add another dimension of complication to the public school system . " <p> Bell said that was not the case . Under the legislation , the decision to allow home-schoolers to participate in high school sports would come down to the local school district . Each individual school board would be able to decide for itself . <p> McQuinn countered that allowing the localities to decide brings its own set of problems . <p> " There are implications with making this a local school board issue as well , " she said . " If a school division allows home-schooled students and another does not , there would be cases where teams would have to make a decision to forfeit a game . This kind of policy breeds division , brings fairness into question and creates inconsistencies across individual schools .

I went to the traditional play dates , but my son was n't into them . He sat in the middle of the floor staring into the deep void of his mind completely unengaged with people .

Show them in the same light as you see Jacob every day . It sounded thrilling . It sounded exhilarating . Huge . Gargantuan . <p> I had two choices . One- to politely ignore the idea and quietly get Jacob services , and Two- to completely embrace his Autism Spectrum Disorder and find a way to make it a better world for him and all children with special needs .

That 's only a little bit more than the year before that , but a significant amount more than 2014 . In 2015 , 7,229 charges were dismissed or rejected .

" But , actually , we 've accomplished what we wanted to - making the victim whole . " <p> As for charges like felon in possession of a firearm or resisting a police officer , the district attorney said those usually are connected with a major charge . So the lesser charges are dismissed to allow resources to be focused on the more serious ones . <p> " We get those cases out of the system . Therefore , we can spend time on the rapes , the murders , the molestation cases , the armed robberies . The ones that we really need to push and put in jail . " <p> Many of the charges that were dropped were minor .

A case Stewart said three out of four district attorneys rejected . <p> " When we got there , trying to prepare for trial , we found some major problems in the case . So we talked to the family , so we rejected it . " <p> Waco Collins , a man described as a very violent drug dealer , had his second-degree murder charge dropped in 2016 .

Allen claims a wardrobe malfunction outside a campus bathroom led to police finding a gun he forgot he had on him . <p> Allen admits to running from police once he was handcuffed . <p> " My mind goes to dark places , I thought if I did n't run , my life could have ended .

Allen also initially was charged with illegal carrying of weapons , a charge the district attorney 's office rejected . <p> Allen would spend a week in jail then accept a plea deal in July . <p> Even though he claims he did n't do it , he pleaded guilty to sexual battery in exchange for having his other charges dropped . <p> " I was like I can either extend the amount of time I 'm fighting this in court , or end up coming out worse or I can take the plea bargain . " <p> On July 28 , 2016 , Allen was sentenced to pay court costs and serve six months in the parish jail . The court suspended the jail sentence and instead placed Allen on supervised probation for one year . <p> " My lawyer tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to get , that 's it . I 'm just going to take the plea bargain , " Allen said . <p> Looking back on what happened , he is grateful for the system 's flexibility that allowed his charges to be dropped . <p> " I think because you can still find your way out and establish a life , due to these dismissal of charges , and plea bargains , it shows the justice system is fair , I think . " <p> Not all run-ins with courts work out smoothly . <p> Shreveport pastor Linus Mayes ' , who had his own bank fraud and felony theft charges dismissed in January 2015 , had a different experience with the man who allegedly shot his son in October 2016 . <p> Mayes explained to KSLA News 12 that his son allegedly was shot by Quinton Hill , a man who had accepted a plea deal only a month earlier . <p> " First of all , we panicked as any parent would do , " Mayes said in December . <p> His son was shot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mayes wonders how someone with a lengthy criminal history was walking free .

Governor McAuliffe and many of his appointed board members are now easing those restrictions . <p> Monday 's action is being considered a win by pro-choice advocates and a " sham " by those against abortion . When the board of health passed the final amendment , pro-choice people in the audience stood up and cheered . <p> That final amendment is the most impactful - it eases former Governor McDonnell 's regulations on the buildings abortions are performed in . In 2013 , McDonnell passed regulations that any facility or clinic performing abortions meet the same building codes as hospitals . <p> The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled against a similar regulation in the state of Texas . <p> The Virginia State Board of Health has amended that regulation , essentially saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office that performs out-patient surgery or a doctor 's office that performs a colonoscopy . <p> " I am very concerned by the fact that these restrictions are closing our healthcare centers in Virginia , which is limiting access to women who otherwise may not have any other means to receive the care that they need , " said Dr. Serina Floyd , Medical Director of Planned Parenthood of Metro Washington . <p> " There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of violations , so if we water down the regulations , the surprise inspections , the one that 's going to hurt the most is of course , the woman .
