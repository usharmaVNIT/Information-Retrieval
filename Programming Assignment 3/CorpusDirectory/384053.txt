The report , by Wainhouse Research anticipates that UC services revenues , which are far smaller than product revenues today , will eclipse those of traditional conferencing services by 2013 or 2014 . <p> Videoconferencing , an Affordable and Innovative Alternative to Traveling <p> " Videoconferencing is proving to be a viable solution for companies eager to cut their travel expenditures , while they improve the quality of inter-office and customer communications , " says Salanco . <p> In addition , companies are looking at videoconferencing as a way to improve the work-life balance of their key executives and sales people . These frequent travelers face numerous issues , such as suffering repeated jet lag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch-up on their job duties every time they fly . <p> Demand for videoconferencing is coming from two different kinds of buyers : companies that simply want a standalone solution and those that want videoconferencing to be part of a converged UC system . <h> Many SMBs understand and can afford videoconferencing <p> SMBs get the benefits of the technologyreduced travel costs , and better collaboration between employees , customers and consultants . Bottom line : SMBs can afford to buy relatively low-cost solutions from such vendors as Avaya and LifeSize . <p> Implementing a videoconferencing solution can be a great opportunity to do a network readiness assessment Implementing a videoconferencing solution is typically as simple as downloading some software , placing units in different rooms and plugging them into the network . However , the implementation task can be a great time for a VAR to suggest doing a network readiness assessment .

SIP is a signaling protocol that controls multimedia communication sessions over IP . For SMBs wanting to maximize their installed IP-PBXs , a SIP trunk is the smart way to go as it enables them to communicate over IP within the company and to connect to the outside world via PSTN ( Public Switched Telephone Network ) . <p> Managed videoconferencing services can be lucrative For many VARs , managed services are often the main way they make their best margins .

Last year , when Tech Data 's Senior Vice President of U.S. Sales Pete Peterson took the reins , he steered the community toward a new , more aggressively profitable horizon and a well-rounded experience for all involved . <p> " TechSelect members are some of our most strategic customers respected for their business acumen , " says Peterson . " I wanted to bolster the impact of this community by encouraging more engagement and creating greater opportunities for practical learning . " <p> Tech Data 's Director of Sales Planning Jackie Baron sums it up as , " It 's imperative that our members and vendors feel this is an extremely valuable program ; we hit the refresh button and it 's made a significant difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the numbers . TechSelect members grew their businesses seven percent year over year in FY ' 11 . And Peterson and Baron are n't stopping there . <p> Like the Three Musketeers TechSelect is successful thanks to the collective trio of Tech Data , vendors and resellers working together . Each group brings to the table a wealth of knowledge and skills that can benefit one another for the greatest business growth . <p> " We have two sets of constituents in this community : our 400-plus reseller members and our 30-plus vendors who invest in the program , " says Peterson . " We 're finding new ways to provide both with greater ROI across the board . " <p> According to Rory Sanchez , president of South Florida solutions provider SLPowers and TechSelect 's Advisory Council president , establishing the ROI for vendors was intangible in the past . " We 've put together the Vendor Relations Committee ( VRC ) and created a multi-year plan to measure our business success , " he said . <p> To ensure vendors get the ROI they expect , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing opportunities for them to offer exclusive promotions and presentations for Community members . <p> " At the last two Partner Conferences , we were able to introduce the vendors in a whole new way to the Community through Vendor Panels , " explains Peterson . " We 've moved away from the speeds and feeds presentations to addressing the opportunities in the market whether it 's a specific vertical or technology segment and helping the resellers better capitalize and build success . " <p> In advance of the events , vendors receive critical feedback on their presentations to help them better align with their audience . <p> " Improving the presentations improves the overall experience , " says Allan Walters , senior vice president of Saratoga Technologies and vice president of the TechSelect Community . " We ask them , ' What is your goal and what do you want to get out of TechSelect ? ' From there , we help vendors fine tune their presentations to meet their goals , therefore increasing their ROI because they 're speaking to the right people about what they really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors be more engaged in the Community , sometimes through indirect channels . <p> " The best-practice advice resellers receive at these events may have nothing to do with a particular vendor 's products , " says Walters . " However , if I increase my business by 20 percent with the skills I learned at these conferences , then I 've also increased the businesses of those vendors I partner with . " <p> Peer Interactions Make a Difference What really makes the Community work are the peer interactions . Each member is invited to participate in conferences , Town Hall Calls , TechSelect University and a variety of other networking opportunities . <p> " When you sit in the room with a bunch of other folks that are in the same business that you 're in , you know that we all have similar challenges , " shares Sanchez . " You can meet people who have success at dealing with these challenges and get a first-hand look at what really works .

" We 've partnered with other TechSelect members to win deals ourselves or help them win deals . Working with other folks in non-competing geographies provides both parties with mutual benefits . " <p> Spencer Ferguson , president of Wasatch Software , agrees . " What 's invaluable is the real-world expertise members share with one another . Engaging with peer experts within the community enables those in attendance to get the real scoop on technologies , markets and trends , " he says . <p> A Distribution Point of View Tech Data 's executive involvement gives resellers access to people who have a different point of view on the industry , and an insider look at distribution and the trends . " Finding out what they 're seeing from their perspective enables resellers to get a more diverse view of the channel , " says Sanchez . <p> Peterson and his team agree that sharing their perspective with the Community is mutually beneficial . <p> " Tech Data has a lot of new opportunities to share with TDMobility , Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new market segments entering the channel , our strategy is to provide the Community with the awareness , education and enablement they need to strengthen their businesses , " Peterson explains . " This includes making them aware that these opportunities are out there , educating them on what Tech Data can do to help them be successful and enabling them by helping them apply this knowledge to their business . " <p> Baron shared how this new strategy worked at the last conference in San Antonio . " We launched Xerox 's e-concierge . Along with introducing this new service product , we also had Rich Chiarello , president of Above The Line Management Solutions , there to demonstrate and teach members how they could increase their market share by utilizing this tool . " <p> Ferguson agrees that the awareness , education and enablement approach makes a huge difference in his company 's success . " Learning from industry experts and getting the actionable items to take home helps us more effectively improve our services and be more profitable , " he says . <p> It Just Keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlando will be even better , " says Baron .

@@58876132 @7876132/ <p> While marketing authors and gurus sometimes have differing opinions , they typically agreeon one thing : marketing is critical to maintaining sales momentum and building brand equity , particularly in challenging times . In fact , those companies that continue to market through economic downturns are the ones who gain the most when recovery arrives . And , despite continuing high unemployment , most experts expect 2011 to be a year of economic growth with the consensus being a 3 to 4 percent increase over 2010 . So what does that mean for the channel ? <p> While marketing may have been on the back burner during the past few years , recent conversations with resellers and vendors indicate that many will ramp up their marketing activities and spend in 2011 . Now is the time to put your strategy and tactics in place for the year , so you can capitalize on the opportunities presented by a recovering economy . If not , you risk losing business and ultimately market share to your competitors that are actively marketing . <p> Experience has shown that the most effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different tactics " perhaps advertising , public relations , Web , e-marketing , direct marketing and social media " into a comprehensive campaign to raise awareness , generate demand and change perceptions " or whatever your goals may be . The key to success is developing clear , consistent messaging across all mediums . Your campaign will really begin to gain traction when prospects are continually exposed to a unified message across multiple tactics . Importantly , this integrated approach lowers your risk of failure because not everything rests upon the success of one tactic . <p> Time and again , resellers tell us the area they struggle with the most is marketing . They know they need to do it , but in many cases , they do n't have the time , resources or know-how . As a solution , many resellers will hire an outside agency ; however , this is not always a guarantee of success . Many agencies specialize in one specific tactic . For example , if you go to an advertising agency and explain your business objectives or challenges , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as a public relations firm will most likely tell you a PR campaign is what you need . In contrast , an integrated marketing agency " one that can provide a complete portfolio of solutions " is better positioned to advise you on what tactics will work best for your specific needs . It may be advertising and/or PR , or it may be something completely different . <p> Of course finding an integrated marketing firm is not easy . And even if you do , many have limited ( or no ) experience creating business-tobusiness campaigns or promoting sometimes very complex high-tech products . Fewer still have any experience with channel marketing and the unique challenges that it entails . <p> This is what led to the creation of Tech Data 's own TDAgency more than 10 years ago .

We live and breathe IT , and understand the business inside and out .

@@58876232 @7876232/ <h> Welcome to Authority <p> The channel and IT community is awash in cloud hype , and its not unjustified . Cloud computing is exploding from a data center experiment that produced incremental revenue to full lines of business generating billions of dollars in sales for vendors and solution providers alike . <p> How big will cloud computing be ? According to Gartner , total sales generated by cloud computing will top $160 billion annually by 2015 . And that has every vendor and solution provider chasing the new pot of gold in technology . <p> But is " the cloud " the only opportunity in technology ? According to Edison Peres , senior vice president of worldwide channels at Cisco , the answer is no . <p> At the recent Cisco Partner Summit in New Orleans , Peres uttered a prophetic statement to partners in attendance : " If all you see on the horizon is cloud , your focus is much too narrow . The cloud is part of a broad set of opportunities before us . " <p> Peres job at Cisco is to look beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cisco is betting heavily on cloud computing , but its also looking to retain leadership in core routing and switching and continue development of its video , unified communications , collaboration and telephony product lines . So anyone would be justified in being skeptical of his sincerity . <p> But he s right . The cloud is just one of many IT options , and the cloud will not obliterate the need for many of the technology products currently sold and supported by the channel . Despite the astronomical projections for cloud growth , the relative amount of cloud sales will be low compared to on-premise infrastructure . <p> Consider this : IBM CEO Sam Palmisano recently said that Big Blues cloud revenue will top $7 billion in the next five years . Its an impressive number , but it 's less than 10 percent of IBMs total revenue . And Symantec CEO Enrique Salem has repeatedly said cloud computing will account for no more than 10 to 15 percent of the security and storage software vendors revenue . <p> " Many people believe relevancy as a partner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity is going down . I do n't  believe that . Cisco does not believe that . Yes , we need to evolve and were at an inflection point where we need to think differently . At the end of the day , there are certain values that you solution providers bring to the market , " he told Cisco partners during his keynote . <p> Those competencies include technology selection and integration services , multivendor management experience , vertical solution development , managed services and professional services . Do these skills and services evaporate in the cloud ? No , because the cloud is dependent on the migration of data from on-premise applications and equipment that channels the cloud . <p> Forrester Research analyst Tim Harmond recently predicted that as much as 15 percent of the channel would fail due to their inability to adapt to the cloud computing era . He is n't wrong , either , but there 's an equal chance that solution providers will fail because they gave up profitable lines of business to needlessly chase clouds . <p> Consider the channel revenue trends , as tracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barometer report . Product sales soared nearly 325 percent in the middle of the year as solution providers capitalized on pent-up demand for new networking and endpoint equipment . Professional services inclusive of consultative and architecture services---jumped more than 100 percent as businesses sought guidance on upgrading their IT capabilities . <p> Did the cloud drive that growth ? Probably some of it , but there remains a healthy need for on-premise and endpoint technologies that are n't  serviceable through the cloud . <p> There 's a rising din in the industry that cloud computing is not just overused , but bastardized . " The Cloud , " no matter how its defined , is simply a delivery mechanism and technology/business model that 's applicable to myriad products . <p> As Peres said , solution providers need to choose their role in cloud computing . Again , he s right , but he could 've gone further : Solution providers need to define their current business model as well as their desired future state ( in other words , goals ) . From there , they can determine what products and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyll need to make to reach those goals . <p> The cloud may definitely be in the future of many solution providers , but so is the development and construction of data centers , unified communications systems , mobility networks , business intelligence applications , embedded and dedicated devices for verticals , telephony and endpoints . The warning for solution providers : you 'll miss other opportunities if all you chase are clouds .

@@58876279 @7876279/ <h> Welcome to Authority <h> SMBs Rely on VARs for Security Solutions . <p> For many SMBs , data and network security have become major priorities . How major ? Well , major enough for SMBs to spend an average of $51,000 a year on it , and two-thirds of their IT staff time , according to a survey released last year by Symantec . <p> Symantecs 2010 Global SMB Information Protection Survey , published last June , found that SMBs ( with 10 to 499 employees ) made information protection their main IT priority , as opposed to 2009 , when one-third of them lacked the most basic protection of allantivirus software . <p> SMBs new-found preoccupation with security is not too surprising . Companies are facing increased threats from cyber attacks , lost devices , and the loss of confidential or proprietary data such as bank account numbers , credit card information , and customer and employee records . Whether its due to a malware attack , a server crash or a stolen mobile device , lost information can be highly detrimental , if not fatal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of significance , 74 percent of SMBs in the 2010 survey chose data loss as number one or two , while 58 percent chose cyber attacks . And , for good reason -- 42 percent said they had lost confidential or proprietary information in the past year , which resulted in lost revenues , damaged reputations and direct financial costs . Seventy-three percent said they were hit by cyber attacks . <p> In spite of the rising security threats , a lot of SMBs are still more reactive than proactive when it comes to doing anything about protecting their data , devices or networks , says Alan Novack , an IBM senior systems engineer at Tech Data . <p> " Usually , SMBs do n't  deal with security until they have to , " he notes . " In many cases , they think about security after the horse has bolted from the stableafter valuable and/or confidential data has been lost , or a network has been crashed or deeply penetrated . " <p> Tech Datas Recommendations Security can be a hard sell for VARs but it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer at Tech Data . <p> " VARs can help SMBs with various security issues in many different ways , " says Johnson . " They can perform all kinds of security assessments , chiefly data risk assessments and network vulnerability assessments , as well as regulatory compliance consulting and security audits . " <p> SMBs Need VARs for Advice and Expertise The need for companies to protect their networks , and the data inside them , is becoming more important every day , so understanding the solutions and opportunities around network and data security is crucial for VARs , says , Vice President of Software Product Marketing at Tech Data , Stacy Nethercoat . <p> " Small and medium businesses are most vulnerable to intrusions , and rely on resellers and our vendor partners to educate them about how to protect their data , " notes Nethercoat . <p> The SMB market presents VARs with many lucrative sales opportunities not just to sell products but to wrap services and add-on sales around the initial sale , she adds . <p> Some SMBs are slow to adopt security solutions due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of internal resources and expertise , says Chris Wargo , co-founder and senior security consultant at InfoLock Technologies , a VAR in Arlington , Virginia . <p> " Security solutions are complicated systems that require integration with existing networks and applications , and significant experience to properly install , configure and manage , " says Wargo . " Such complexity can overwhelm the average SMBs IT staff , but this presents an opportunity for the VAR , not just to gain service revenue but to develop a trusted advisor role with clients . " <p> Security Appliances Remain Hot with SMBs and VARs <p> For many SMBs , all-in-one security appliances are the best solution to their security needs as they are very affordable , offer excellent protection and require little or no technical expertise to install or maintain . For those same reasons , VARs find appliances to be a relatively easy sell. <p> Among the easiest sells are functional , manageable and upgradeable devices , notably Unified Threat Management ( UTM ) appliances , which are available from many vendors , including Fortinet , SonicWALL and WatchGuard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has tightly integrated security features that work together on a single appliance . UTMs typically include intrusion detection and prevention , gateway antivirus , e-mail spam filtering and Web content filtering , as well as a firewall . <p> This class of appliance makes it easy for organizations to manage their security because they only have to deal with one box and one source of support . Such an appliance solution is highly cost-effective as it offers a centralized console that enables monitoring of network security at remote locations . <p> In addition to UTMs , the market includes standalone appliances ( which deliver a single security application ) , blade appliances ( a hybrid between UTMs and standalone devices ) and software or CD appliances .
