( WBKO ) -- Kevin Taylor is no stranger to the world of martial arts . In fact , there 's only two degrees of separation between Taylor and legendary fighter Ip Man , and only one degree between he and Bruce Lee . <p> " In 1985 , I moved to England to go to high school for two years and when I was there , I started studying Wing Chun Kung Fu with my teacher , Nino Bernardo , who was a student of Wong ShunLeung . Wong ShunLeung was Ip Man 's top fighter , " Taylor explained . <p> Less than two years ago , Taylor found himself back in his hometown of Bowling Green , Kentucky , opening his own business : Kentucky Grapplers . <p> " Most of the stuff that I do is geared toward law enforcement , military and civilian self defense , " said Taylor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky Grapplers is able to run without deadlines and on-and-off seasons , but also without rules . <p> " Two young guys that want to beat one another up in the corner are welcome to , they just ca n't impose it on anybody else . So , with that kind of philosophy of training , it allows people to come in at whatever level they 're at . " <p> That kind of freedom sounds intimidating , but Brenda Givens says , even as a woman who considers herself a beginner at the art of self defense , the environment has an odd kind of comfort to it . <p> " These guys are easy to get along with , " Givens said . " Our trainer 's really easy to get along with and very down to Earth , and so that really helps .

" <p> For women who feel they are n't strong enough or fast enough to protect themselves against an attacker , Taylor says " think again . " <p> " With technical skills , there 's a lot of times that someone with a smaller stature does n't need to be strong to , say , poke somebody in the eye . Or anytime you use bony parts of your body to hit soft parts of somebody else 's , you can do damage , " he explained . <p> Givens says she took the leap of faith and decided to train for a day she hopes never comes . <p> " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , " she said . " I mean , chances are nothing will , but there 's that slim chance that you might actually need to use something , and if not , at least you get a good workout . " <p> One unique thing about self defense training is that it can be different every time you look at it . <p> Hand-to-hand combat and boxing not your style ? Not a problem in Taylor 's eyes . <p> " We do a lot of weapons training . A knife is the great equalizer . One of my teachers has a quote where he says ' I respect you and your art , but my blade does n't . ' " <p> Kentucky Grapplers say for people who are too afraid to take the jump for themselves , thinking about what the training would allow them to do for their friends and family usually is the only push they need . <p> " Our idea is that a fighter is training to beat somebody else , so if you 're a competitor , you 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to train warriors , and a warrior is training to protect the people behind them , not to beat somebody in front of them . " <p> " Stop being scared , " says Givens . " Just go for it . I mean , what do you have to lose ? " <p> Could it be that there 's nothing to lose , and everything to gain ? An easy " yes " for Taylor . <p> " This is something that everybody can do . You do n't have to go compete , you do n't have to go get in the cage , you do n't have to get punched in the face every night .

Asked if Sessions should recuse himself , he said " I do n't think so . " <p> The Russian cloud hovering over the Trump White House engulfed Attorney General Jeff Sessions Thursday following revelations he failed to disclose pre-election meetings with the Kremlin 's ambassador to Washington . <p> Several Republicans , many of them increasingly uneasy about the implications of the evolving Russian drama , called on Sessions to recuse himself from any involvement in an FBI probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I do think he should recuse himself , " said Rep.

They underscored the difficulty the administration has had in shaking off a controversy that has already claimed the scalp of one key Trump campaign aide appointed to a senior White House post -- former national security adviser Michael Flynn . <p> They also deepened questions about the extent to which the President 's key surrogates , of whom Sessions is one , had contacts with Moscow at a time when it was accused of disrupting the US election to help the GOP nominee . <p> The attacks on Sessions also threatened to complicate the administration 's efforts to stave off calls for an independent inquiry or a special prosecutor to investigate the links between the Trump campaign and Russia . <p> " ( That ) the top cop in our country lied under oath to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday .

Again , these are some depersonalized assumptions of the media that are constantly trying to blow this situation out of proportion . " <p> Minnesota Sen.

But when it gets a few years and miles on it , there are new smells that you might start showing up . <p> Many times those smells are an indication of a repair that needs to be done , so today I 'm going to use some smelly props to give you a better idea of what you can tell from your smell . <p> An antifreeze leak can give you a hot syrup smell . Any loss of coolant should be investigated , or you risk overheating and ruining your engine . If you have this type of smell and the inside of your windows are constantly fogging over , you probably have a leaking heater core in your dash that needs to be replaced . <p> A burning plastic smell can be an indication of an electrical problem . From a short circuit to an electrical component that 's just plain worn out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a more serious issue . <p> If you have a gas smell , it needs to be looked into immediately , especially if you actually see gas on the ground or the engine . In these cases , do not drive the vehicle to the shop ; you need to have it towed . <p> A nasty burnt popcorn smell is usually an indication of either a clutch or a brake problem that 's making the friction material overheat . A common reason for this type of smell is not getting the parking brake completely released before driving . <p> A rotten egg smell usually indicates an engine that is running poorly or a catalytic convertor that needs to be replaced . Whether it 's the engine or the catalytic convertor that 's acting up , a sulfur smell that 's not going away needs to be inspected and corrected to avoid serious damage . <p> A burning oil smell is exactly that . Oil leaking onto the hot parts of the engine and exhaust will definitely give your vehicle a nasty burning smell , and maybe even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nasty smell that might indicate a problem with your serpentine belt or any of the accessories that it drives such as an alternator or air conditioning compressor . Check it out because it can definitely lead to a breakdown if any of those parts end up failing . <p> A stinky tennis shoe smell in the summertime is usually caused by mildew forming in your vehicles air conditioning ductwork . There are products that can be used to alleviate these types of issues , but you can also switch off your ac during the last couple blocks of your drive and keep the blower on high to greatly reduce the chances of mildew forming in the ductwork . <p> So do n't ignore any abnormal smells coming from your vehicle .

Fewer people have pitched their family camps on the farm . <p> The findings were released Tuesday by UNO 's Center for Public Affairs Research . It 's a project that 's shining some new light on census analysis and it highlights some big differences between Nebraska 's urban and rural population centers . <p> According to the report , Nebraska 's non-metropolitan areas are shrinking , becoming less diverse , aging and becoming less educated compared to their higher-population metro area counterparts . <p> Research coordinator David Drozd says there have been several dramatic trends in Nebraska 's demographics pertaining to who lives here and where in Nebraska you 'll find them . <p> Here is the summary of the researchers ' findings : <p> PopulationOf Nebraska 's 1.8 million residents , nearly two-thirds live in metro counties . These counties include those surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Island , which officially became a metro area in 2013 . <p> Additionally , the number of residents in metropolitan counties like Douglas County and Sarpy County has been dramatically increasing since the 1930s while the number in non-metro counties has dropped significantly during the same timeframe . <p> According to Census data , there were around 500,000 residents in Nebraska 's current 13 metro counties in 1930 while that number more than doubled to over 1.1 million in 2010 . Meanwhile , the number of residents in the remaining 80 non-metro counties was at its peak of nearly 900,000 in the 1930s and has declined to just over 670,000 today . For comparison , the same 80 counties had 10,000 more in 1890 than they do today . <p> Projections show that overall , the state of Nebraska is likely to add about 415,000 new residents by 2050 , for a total of 2.24 million Nebraskans . <p> AgeThe ages of those living in metro and non-metro counties are also heading in dramatically opposite directions . <p> Based upon births , of those who were between the ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-metro counties while only 190,000 were in metropolitan counties . In 2013 , there are approximately 225,000 children between the ages of five to 17 in metro counties but only 110,000 in non-metro counties , a decrease of about 120,000 , or slightly less than half of the number that existed 50 years ago . <p> As counties get more rural , the percentage of those under the age of 45 in those counties decreases . The numbers show while Douglas , Lancaster and Sarpy counties have nearly two-thirds of their residents under the age of 45 , the number is closer to half for counties without a town of 2,500 residents . <p> Additionally , even though Nebraska 's median age of 36.2 is only one year younger than the national median age , the figure drops to 33.6 in metro areas and jumps to 40.5 in non-metro areas , or a gap of nearly 7 years , which is twice the national average . <p> By 2050 , Nebraska 's population , like much of the country , is expected to have a higher percentage of those 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 250,000 residents aged 65 or older in Nebraska currently , that number will likely jump to over 470,000 by 2050 . <p> According to the projections , the older the age range the more significant the growth .

The least populated counties have Hispanics accounting for 3.2 percent of their population , which , while small , is still significantly higher than the 0.4 percent of African Americans in the same area . <p> Overall , Nebraska actually had a 9.6 percent decrease in its White non-Hispanic under 18 population , with nearly all of that loss coming from non-metro counties , whereas there was an across-the-board 54 percent increase in the minority under 18 population for the state . <p> Comparatively , while Nebraska 's losses in the White non-Hispanic population were fairly consistent with the national rate of 9.8 percent , the increase for its minority population was more than double the national rate of 21.9 percent . <p> According to the projections , by 2030 there will not just be a decline in the proportion , but an actual population decrease of White non-Hispanics in Nebraska .
