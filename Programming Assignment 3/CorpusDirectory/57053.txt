The juicy rib-eye steaks you picked up a few weeks ago have been sitting in your freezer , just waiting to be grilled . Tonight , you plan to fire up the barbeque and do just that . <p> But first , you 've got to defrost the steaks . And you need to take special care : Some approaches to thawing food , like leaving it on the counter all day , are unsafe and can cause illness . <p> Youve got 3 choices for safely thawing any type of food . Heres what you need to know about each : <p> 1 . Refrigerator Thawing <p> This is certainly the easiest method for defrosting frozen food just stick it in the fridge and waituntil its thawed . <p> But you may be waiting longer than you thought . It usually takes an entire day to thaw even a small amount of frozen food , such as a pound of ground meat or boneless chicken breasts . For large items , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defrosting time for every 5 pounds of food . <p> All that waiting does have a payoff , though . A major advantage of refrigerator thawing is that you do n't  have to cook the defrosted food right away especially helpful if you 're faced with a last-minute change in plans . <p> Poultry , fish and ground meat that 's been defrosted in the fridge can be kept for an additional 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator before cooking . Beef , pork , lamb or veal ( roasts , steaks or chops ) will keep refrigerated for another 3 to 5 days after thawing . <p> Another plus : If you decide not to cook the thawed food , you can safely refreeze it within these same time limits . <p> 2 . Cold Water Thawing <p> The upside to this approach is that its much faster than refrigerator thawing .

Never use hot water , as that can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperature where harmful bacteria begins to multiply .

If you have a change in plans , you can safely refreeze the food once you 've cooked it thoroughly . <p> 3 . Microwave Thawing <p> The microwave , as you might expect , offers the speediest method of defrosting food . <p> Set your microwave to the " defrost " or " 50 percent power " setting while thawing to ensure that the outer edges of the food do n't become cooked while the remainder is still frozen .

Do n't do it .

That 's because with either method , the steaks could have at least temporarily warmed up to a temperature higher than 40F . At that point , harmful bacteria can begin to multiply and only further cooking will destroy it ; simply refreezing the steaks wont do the trick . <p> Finally , if you thawed the steaks on the counter or in hot water , you should n't eat them at all .
