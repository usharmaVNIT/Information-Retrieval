The crew of the Starship Enterprise returned three years later to go even more boldly where no man had been before in Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan .

The examiner report for Wrath of Khan notes that the film , with " various explosions , deaths " , was a likely A category .

@@34540475 @3540475/ <p> Lord of the Flies , by Nobel Prize-winning English author William Golding , was first published 60 years ago , in September 1954 . But the first film adaptation of the book did not arrive at the BBFC until 1964 . <p> Lord of the Flies ( 1963 ) , directed by Peter Brook , was classified X ( suitable only for those aged 16 and over ) for language and nudity as well as the final scenes in the film , which were considered too strong and alarming for children . Cuts for an A certificate were offered to the company , but these were refused on the grounds that they would spoil the film and it was therefore passed X. <p> The restrictive X certificate sparked a number of letters from teachers dismayed that their pupils under the age of 16 and studying the text could not see the film . Local councils in Caernarvon , North Wales and Southend-On-Sea , ultimately decided to over-rule the BBFC X classification in order to hold special screenings of the film for local schoolchildren , while BBFC Secretary John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBFC , that the film could be shown to under-16s studying the text , if the screenings were supervised . <p> In 1970 the BBFC introduced the new AA rating , meaning anyone aged 14 or over could see the film . Rights holders of some films classified X , were invited to apply for an AA rating , but the company behind Lord of the Flies declined . Following a letter to the BBFC from an MP , John Trevelyan once again asked whether the company might accept an AA for Lord of the Flies , and this time his request was met and the film was " re-graded " AA . <p> Lord of the Flies was submitted by a new distributor on video in 1990 . The Examiner notes describe the violence as " very muted " and the language at the " bloody level " , both of which could be contained at PG . The Examiner doubts that most 6-9-year-olds would have any interest in the film , but that it should be within the capability of 10 12-year-olds . This is in stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 , which likely reflects changes in public acceptability , but also the widespread familiarity of the story as a now-famed text . <p> However , it was around a similar time that a re-make of the film was also submitted for classification . In 1989 Lord of the Flies , directed by Harry Hook and starring Balthazar Getty , was submitted to the BBFC . The distributor of the film requested a PG certificate , but immediately four uses of strong language in the film made this lower category impossible and pushed the film to a 15 classification . Examiners however did consider whether the film could be contained at the new 12 certificate , introduced for film in 1989 . <p> The Examiner report here details the debate for and against a 12 classification , including whether the known quantity aspect of the text amongst school children of 14 to 16 , made the film more acceptable at the 12 rating . Ultimately , Lord of the Flies ( 1989 ) was passed 15 for its four uses of strong language and the horror filmic treatment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by this Examiner report was never fulfilled , chiefly because the UK distributor made it clear they were not willing to consider reducing the film 's strong language . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

However , their excitement turns to fear as they realise that the meteor is actually a magnetic travelling machine from Mars and its occupants are far from friendly . <p> When the distributors first submitted the film feature to the BBFC in March 1953 , the BBFC considered some of the films scenes to be " very alarming and a number could certainly be described as horrific ' " . A letter to the films distributor , Paramount , states that <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to suggest cuts for an A certificate We have no alternative , therefore , but to place the film - without any cuts , of course in the X category " . <p> However , even at the time , the BBFC came under some pressure to reduce the certificate . Letters from some local councils , including Great Yarmouth in Norfolk and Blackburn in Lancashire , asked whether the film could be theatrically released as an A in their local area . In his letter to Charles Robinson , Blackburn Town Clerk , the BBFC Secretary , Arthur Watkins , stated " The Board considers that a number of scenes would be very likely to frighten younger children who , under an A certificate , would be able to see the film with their parents " . <p> Mr Robinson later replies that he has refused the application of the cinema who requested the lower certificate , but " permission has been granted to show it in this Borough in accordance with the X certificate granted by the Board " . <p> Paramount sought to have the films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but received a letter from the BBFCs new Secretary , John Trevelyan , stating that this was " carefully considered " , but " there are too many scenes in it which would be unacceptable for any category that would admit children " . <p> The film finally received its sought-after A in 1981 . One of the Examiners viewing the film said <p> " When this film was first issued , I was not old enough to see it with its X certificate . However it , like me , has aged and todays television-reared generation shouldnt find it too alarming either in theme or treatment " . <p> The films dominant issues are still violence and horror , though age had , by the 1980s , reduced the impact , and audience expectations at lower categories had shifted , so we classified the video release at PG in 1986 . The strongest scene , noted throughout the history of its submission to the BBFC , shows two men on fire , collapsing to the ground and screaming . However , there is no close-up detail and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBFC describes as ' sustained ' in terms of visual detail . They comprise zaps of red and green light , flames and explosions , with very little focus on victims . Where there are victims they simply disappear on the spot , as if teleported elsewhere , or are shown as human-shaped piles of ashes . <p> In 1953 , with the nation recovering from a recent and very real threat from the Communist east , the film presented enough disturbing realism to require an adult only rating . It is a very different thing today an entertaining example of 1950s science fiction at its most imaginative . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

As a result , 28 of them raised the classification to the X certificate ( no admission to persons under 18 ) and 11 of them banned it altogether .

@@34540503 @3540503/ <h> How does classification work ? <p> Here you can find more information about the BBFCs classification process . Customers looking for information on submitting works should visit the Industry Services Section of the website . <p> In order to protect children from unsuitable and even harmful content in films and videos and to give consumers information they might need about a particular film or video before deciding whether or not to view it , the BBFC examines and age rates films and videos before they are released . This independent scrutiny prior to release ensures the highest possible level of protection and empowerment . <p> We watch films and videos all the way through and award an age rating and BBFCinsight to each one . We reach an age rating by applying the standards and criteria contained in our Classification Guidelines which can be downloaded below . <p> Typically , two Examiners view a film for theatrical release . In most cases a Senior Examiner will confirm the examiners recommendation . But if the Examiners are in any doubt or fail to agree , or if important policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members of the Board up to , and including , the Chief Executive and Presidential team . Occasionally we need to take specialist advice about the legal acceptability of film content or its potential for harm . <p> The same process exists for DVDs and Blu-rays though generally these are seen by one Examiner . However , opinions from other Examiners may be required for more difficult works . <p> We look at issues such as discrimination , drugs , horror , dangerous and easily imitable behaviour , language , nudity , sex , and violence when making decisions . The theme of the work is also an important consideration . We also consider context , the tone and likely impact of a work on the potential audience . <p> The release format of a work has an impact on classification . Our decisions on the age rating of DVDs and Blu-rays can occasionally be stricter than at the cinema because there is a higher risk of underage viewing in the home and a greater potential for watching scenes out of context . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

In some circumstances a work may be rejected , ie refused an age rating at any category ( see General Principles section of the BBFC 's Guidelines ) . Details of interventions are published on this website . <h> Cuts for category <p> If the submitted work is suitable for age rating , but only at a rating higher than that requested by the submitting company , the BBFC will consider whether a lower rating could be achieved through relatively minor or simple changes .

@@34540506 @3540506/ <h> The Killing Of Sister George 201963 @qwx401963 <p> In contrast to its subsequent reputation , The Killing Of Sister George has very reputable antecedents . A successful stage play by British author and Daily Telegraph theatre critic Frank Marcus , it had been performed both in Londons West End and on Broadway . The play won the Evening Standard Award for Best Play in 1965 , while Beryl Reids performance ( she played the central role on both sides of the Atlantic ) won the Tony Award for Best Dramatic Actress in 1967 . <p> The play and film charts the unravelling of the professional and personal life of a middle aged actress . June Buckridge ( Beryl Reid ) plays district nurse Sister George in ' Applehurst ' , a popular BBC TV soap opera set in an idyllic English country village ( reportedly based on the long-running ' The Archers ' radio show ) . In contrast to her kindly aphorism-quoting character , June is a volatile , temperamental , gin-swilling woman prone to emotional outbursts , drunken jealousy and an inappropriate sense of mischief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Childie , with whom she has an occasionally abusive relationship . An incident in which June drunkenly accosts two novice nuns in the back of a black cab brings her behaviour to the attention of BBC television executives , in particular Mrs Mercy Crofts . From this point , things start going wrong for June and it becomes apparent Mrs Crofts has a hidden agenda . <p> The hefty BBFC file on the film 's classification ( running to three files ) is testament to the contentiousness of its theme and to prevailing sensibilities about some aspects of its portrayal of homosexual characters . Although the film is now regarded as a pioneering lesbian classic , when the film was first submitted at the beginning of 1969 the initial opinion of the Board was less enthusiastic . <p> For the most part , The Killing Of Sister George was felt to be suitable only for the X category , the most restrictive certificate at the time ( it limited cinema audiences to those aged 16 years and over ) . <p> The reports indicate that the ' theme ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle even though it may be distasteful for many audiences . There was some discussion about Junes aggressive utterance of piss off . The scene in which June forces Childie to eat a half-smoked cigar was unpleasant , but by the way it was presented within the film , it was also acceptable . It was the films penultimate scene in which Mrs Crofts seduces Childie which caused the Board considerable pause for thought . <p> In this sequence , Mrs Crofts is helping Childie gather her things to stay at her house after a final argument with June . The two women embrace . Childie removes her top and lies on the bed . Mrs Crofts approaches the bed and masturbates Childie to orgasm below screen before the couple are suddenly aware of Junes presence in the bedroom doorway . The sex scene was described by John Trevelyan , the then BBFC Secretary as by far the most explicit scene of Lesbian physical love that has ever been submitted for classification . <p> While lesbianism had never been illegal in the UK ( male homosexuality had only been decriminalised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taboo . BBFC principal officers judged that the sex scene would not be harmful , in that it was unlikely to corrupt adult cinema goers , but were concerned that the public was not ready to accept such a detailed lesbian scene . The view was expressed in reports that the public would be shocked by the scene to such a degree that it may prove detrimental to the liberalism of film censorship . John Trevelyan acknowledged that the BBFC had not been ungenerous when allowing passionate scenes of this kind to be passed in other films but only when the relationship was heterosexual . He further clarified this particular viewpoint in a letter to Cinerama , the films UK distributor . In explaining the decision for cuts Trevelyan said " ... it is a totally different matter when the context is one of Lesbian physical love " . <p> There was also the feeling at the BBFC that this scene was superfluous not dramatically necessary - to the wider film , and so removing the scene would not damage the narrative continuity or impinge on the films artistic qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for sensationalist publicity purposes to promote the film . John Trevelyan pointed to reports from the States that cinema-goers in New York , where The Killing Of Sister George had been released with the sex scene intact , were contacting cinemas showing the film to find the exact time when this particular scene would appear . Taking all these factors into consideration , the BBFC asked the distributor to remove the sequence before it would issue a classification certificate to the film . <p> Cinerama resisted the cut . A modified version of the scene was submitted for consideration , and then another version with further modifications . The distributor fought hard to retain the kiss between Mrs Crofts and Childie , citing a similar kiss in The Fox passed by the BBFC in 1967 . But the BBFC was adamant that the scene be removed in its entirety . Trevelyan stated that the BBFC was not prepared as yet to accept Lesbian sex to this point . <p> The Killing Of Sister George was eventually classified X in February 1969 with the encounter between Mrs Crofts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of local authorities across the UK even in this version . The Greater London Council , however , was shown the uncut version of the film , and required only minor edits to the scene that the BBFC had deleted , thus allowing a more complete version of the film to be screened in its cinemas . The increase in the age bar for X films from 16 to 18 in 1970 saw some local authorities relent on their previous decision , and allow the film to be shown under this higher age restriction . <p> Later BBFC views on The Killing Of Sister George , when the film was submitted for video classification in 1986 , were more sympathetic and demonstrated more relaxed attitudes towards on-screen depictions of homosexuality . One examiner described the scene between Mrs Croft and Childie as tenderly portrayed , while another recognised that the film would have been treated less nervously if it had depicted heterosexual sex . The sexual orientation was considered less relevant to the classification of the film for VHS in 1986 than in 1969 .

The overall reaction from the examining team was that a film made from that script would almost certainly have to receive an X. One examiner comments , " the first page describes this as a light-heartedly dramatic excursion into what might or might be the supernatural ; this definitely does not accurately describe what is found in the script itself .

" <p> Over one year later , in September 1956 , a new version of the script still entitled The Bewitched was sent in by Sabre Films for further advice .

Set during World War II , it tells of Bruno , the young son of a camp Commandant . Unaware of the camps real aims , and bored after moving from his city home , Bruno forges a secret ( and forbidden ) friendship with a young Jewish boy , Shmuel , a little boy of his own age that he sees on the other side of the camp fence . As the war progresses his mother becomes increasingly concerned that the camp is no place for children . <p> It is a British film ( from the producer of the Harry Potter series ) and arrived at the BBFC with no category request . This means the films distributors did n't  ask for any particular certificate . <p> The film views the Holocaust through the eyes of an eight-year-old boy , ignorant of many of the stronger prejudices of his family and his fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence which takes place near his house . For example , he believes the camp to be a farm , and the uniforms to be pyjamas . The enormity and genuine horror of what happens on the ' farm ' is only occasionally and discreetly hinted at throughout the film until the final sequence . He also develops an equal and honest friendship with the camp prisoner Shmuel . <p> Despite the Holocaust theme , most of the early part of the film could be comfortably contained at PG . There are some strong anti-Semitic remarks , but these are made by unsympathetic German characters clearly signposted as wrong , and viewed with increasing suspicion and horror by Bruno and his mother . <p> At PG the BBFC Guidelines state that where more serious issues are featured nothing in their treatment should condone unacceptable behaviour . They also have a note on discrimination which requires that Discriminatory language or behaviour is unlikely to be acceptable unless clearly disapproved of or in an educational or historical context . Discrimination by a character with which children can readily identify is unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moral arc which demonstrates that the violently racist and anti-Semitic views displayed by the Nazi characters are wrong . Indeed , Brunos lie about being friends with the Jewish boy , which gets his friend beaten , is shown to cause him considerable distress and immediate remorse . <p> There are some situations of threat but these are mild , and counterbalanced by the reassuring presence of a parent figure ( Bruno 's mother always close at hand ) . The violence is implied ( it is mostly heard or suggested off screen ) and lacks any gory detail . <p> The Holocaust has been explored at PG before , for example , in Roberto Benigni 's Oscar winning Life Is Beautiful . Examiners noted that The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas would probably appeal to older children and their parents given the books popularity .

Suddenly however , at the films climax , this alters and the work shows the film 's central ( child ) protagonist , and his friend gassed to death in a chamber .

@@34540516 @3540516/ <h> The 1950s <p> The Fifties saw the end of rationing and a gradual increase in prosperity for those who , as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan stated , ' have never had it so good ' . One development that stemmed from this apparent affluence was the emergence of ' youth ' as a group with a defined identity and as a target for consumer goods , as young people with disposable income became an attractive proposition for those selling records , clothes and all the trappings of the teenager . <p> Controversial subjects on film were accommodated in the UK under the new X category , introduced in 1951 and incorporating the former advisory H category given to horror films . As the growth of television ownership eroded the adult/family cinema audience , films like Rock Around The Clock ( 1956 ) drew teenage audiences . Cut for U , this film caused rioting in cinemas and fuelled increasing concern about teenage criminality , although there was in fact no evidence of a teenage crime wave as suggested by the popular press . <p> Concerns about what were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedek 's 1954 film The Wild One for thirteen years because the BBFC described the contents as ' a spectacle of unbridled hooliganism ' . Marlon Brando stars as the leader of a biker gang who rides into a small American town and creates mayhem , fighting with a rival gang leader and defying adult authority . Repeated attempts were made to secure a rating , and eventually some local authorities overturned the BBFC 's rejection , allowing local releases . The riots in English seaside towns involving Mods and Rockers , ( Margate and Clacton in 1964 ) , were cited as providing justification for the BBFC 's continuing objections to the film . The BBFC maintained its stance until 1967 , when the dangers associated with the film 's release were judged to be over . <p> Nicholas Ray 's 1955 Rebel Without A Cause also ran into trouble because of its depiction of what the BBFC considered to be anti-social behaviour and teen violence , but substantial cuts were agreed for the film 's release at X. In the same year , Richard Brook 's The Blackboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dedicated teacher assigned to a tough class of adolescents in a New York urban school . The first reaction of the BBFC ' s Secretary Arthur Watkins was to reject it , on the grounds that ' filled as it is with scenes of unbridled revolting hooliganism ( it ) would , if shown in this country , provoke the strongest criticism from parents ... and would have the most damaging and harmful effect on ... young people ' . The film was withdrawn from the Venice Film Festival after pressure from the US ambassador to Italy , who felt that it presented an unflattering impression of American schools . The rejection decision was challenged by the distributor MGM and the film was viewed again by the BBFC President which resulted in another rejection , although the artistic merits of the film were acknowledged and cuts were considered . A series of negotiations then began , resulting in substantial cuts for an X certificate . <p> 1955 also saw the rejection of a very different film , The Garden Of Eden , about a mother and daughter who decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buttocks , but the film was regarded as unacceptable , the BBFC having had a long-standing policy against screen nudity , partly on the grounds that if they encouraged more nudity on screen , they would be inviting sexual exploitation . However , a large number of local authorities saw fit to overturn the BBFC decision , to the extent that in 1958 , the BBFC was obliged to rate the film A. <p> The topic of drugs exercised the BBFC to a considerable degree during this decade . Devil 's Weed was rejected in 1951 , because the BBFC felt that the moral lessons about the evils of drugs use were not made sufficiently clear . In 1954 , however , the BBFC awarded an X with cuts to L'Esclave , another film dealing with the subject of drugs . <p> 1955 saw the submission of Otto Preminger 's The Man With The Golden Arm , a story about a recovering drug addict who is lured back into his habit . The Home Office had made it known that they had no objection to films dealing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to be attractive and that the profits from dealing were not emphasised . The BBFC therefore felt able to offer an X in 1956 with cuts to details of drug preparation and some incidental violence . It is interesting to note that while the film had a fairly smooth passage past the BBFC in the UK , it met with problems with the Production Code in the US , where the theme of drugs in films was proscribed by the MPAA . The Code was amended in 1956 to allow for the treatment of narcotics as a theme . The DVD was later rated 15 . <p> In the same year , Lee Thompson 's Yield To The Night was rated X uncut . The BBFC read the novel on which the film is based as well as the script before the coincidental execution in 1956 of Ruth Ellis , the last woman to be hanged in the UK for murder , but the theme of capital punishment for women was much on the public agenda . The film tells the story of a woman who murders out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death sentence is carried out . Examiners expressed concerns at an early stage about how such a theme might be handled , and even before the film was scripted Arthur Watson was warning the distributor that an X certificate was the most likely outcome , and only if the treatment was discreet . The distributor argued strongly for an A category at the script stage and Examiners considered whether there was any possibility of an A , but felt that parents of girls aged between 12 and 16 would not endorse such a decision . The film was rated X and it remains a 15 on DVD . <p> The year 1956 also saw the resignation of Arthur Watkins , who was replaced for the next two years as Secretary by John Nichols . In 1958 John Trevelyan became BBFC Secretary . The upheaval in social and class barriers that followed the war is reflected in films like Jack Clayton 's Room At The Top ( 1958 ) , a film that generated much amicable negotiation between Trevelyan and Romulus Films on the language used in the film . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch ' from the dialogue , and also required a softening of the words used to describe the death of a female character in a car accident . It was clear that Trevelyan wished to establish the X category for serious adult British films - the category that had previously been used mostly for horror and Continental films . However , the American League of Decency attacked the film , describing it as involving ' gross suggestiveness and costuming , dialogue and situations . It moreover tends to arouse undue sympathy for an adulteress ' . The DVD version was re-rated from 15 down to 12 in 2008 . <p> At the end of the decade came Beat Girl , a sort of British equivalent of Rebel Without A Cause , starring Adam Faith . The BBFC was not impressed with the film script about a teenage girl who seeks to rebel against her father by hanging around with a bad crowd in Soho and considers becoming a stripper . The script was judged to be ' the product of squalid and illiterate minds ' and several amendments were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 on DVD , having lost its appeal to shock . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540519 @3540519/ <h> The Last Temptation Of Christ 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Submitted for classification in 1988 , this dramatisation of the adult life of Christ attracted notoriety some time before it reached the BBFC . Press reports suggested that the film would contain a ' blasphemous ' scene in which Christ fantasises on the cross about making love to Mary Magdelene . The BBFC received nearly two thousand letters and petitions from the public and pressure groups , a majority anxious about what they regarded as potentially blasphemous content , and the minority supporting the film 's uncut release in the UK . <p> In fact , the film was not based on the Gospels themselves but on a famous 1952 novel by the Greek author , Nikos Kazantzakis ( author of ' Zorba the Greek ' ) . It had been widely available in the UK in an English translation since 1961 without protest being raised or blasphemy charges brought . <p> The BBFC took the unusual step of inviting twenty-eight representatives of the major Christian churches to view the film at the BBFC , and also took legal advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the film at the BBFC agreed that the film was not blasphemous in the legal sense , although it might have the capacity to offend some Christian viewers . <p> In order for a work to be considered blaphemous at law , it must contain material that is ' contemptuous , reviling , scurrilous or ludicrous ' in relation to God or Jesus Christ . However , the film seemed to all who saw it to be sincere in intent , reverent in atmosphere and in no way contemptuous of its subject . Indeed , the sequence that had aroused controversy was in fact an exploration by Kazantzakis of what it means to be both a man and God by envisaging what Christ 's life may have been had he not given his life . Ultimately the film affirms the supreme importance of his sacrifice . <p> The film was passed 18 in 1988 without cuts and subsequently viewed by the Director of Public Prosecutions who supported the BBFC 's decision that the film was not likely to be found guilty of blasphemy by a Jury . A handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the grounds of possible offence ( in response to petitions against it ) rather than blasphemy . Nonetheless , controversy surrounding the film receded after its release and in 2000 the BBFC agreed to reclassify the film , for DVD release , down to 15 . <p> In 2008 , section 79 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel . This means that the BBFC is no longer entitled to consider whether the publication of the film might comprise a blasphemous libel . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

The BBFC was initially shown a screenplay based on Anthony Burgess 's novel in 1967 and advised the distributors that a film showing ' an unrelieved diet of vicious violence and hooliganism ' would be unlikely to be acceptable . <p> However , when the finished film was submitted to the BBFC in 1971 ( by which time the age bar for seeing an X film had been raised from 16 to 18 ) , it was passed at X with no cuts . At the time , the BBFC 's Secretary , Stephen Murphy , defended the film by stating that : <p> " Disturbed though we were by the first half of the film , which is basically a statement of some of the problems of violence , we were , nonetheless , satisfied by the end of the film that it could not be accused of exploitation : quite the contrary , it is a valuable contribution to the whole debate about violence " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion that the criminal and anti-social actions of the film 's main character , Alex , would be copied by young people , inspired by his charismatic example to break the law .

This was in spite of the fact that the film had been judged by the BBFC to be acceptable for public viewing for adults over the age of 18 .

The film tells the story of a young girl who is possessed by a demon . <p> The film had already courted controversy in the US where it had supposedly provoked fainting , vomiting and heart attacks in cinemas . <p> Nonetheless , in spite of its more sensationalist moments , the BBFC considered that The Exorcist was suitable for an X certificate to be issued without cuts . As the BBFC 's Secretary , Stephen Murphy , said at the time , " It is a powerful horror movie . Some people may dislike it , but that is not a sufficient reason for refusing certification ' ' . <p> Given the recent controversy over films such as A Clockwork Orange , Trash , Straw Dogs and Last Tango in Paris , it was perhaps unsurprising that the film 's UK release provoked a certain degree of outrage , particularly amongst pressure groups such as the Festival of Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the box office and the public as a whole did not seem overly concerned . Despite this , a handful of local authorities bowed to the demands of pressure groups and banned the film in their areas , which only added to the reputation of the film . <p> In 1979 the BBFC asked to look at the film again to see whether some of the scenes involving the young actress , Linda Blair , might be vulnerable under the new Protection of Children Act 1978 , which made the distribution of ' indecent ' images of children illegal . After careful consideration it was decided that the scenes in question were constructed specifically to avoid any such images , and the film was allowed to continue its ongoing - and still popular - late-night screenings . <p> In 1981 , the film was released on video by Warner Home Video , as one of their first UK releases . At the time , there was no requirement that videos should be classified by the BBFC so the video was simply released on the strength of its existing X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never included on the Director of Public Prosecution 's list of ' video nasties'and was never prosecuted for obscenity - testament perhaps to the popularity of the film and the high regard in which it was held . <p> After the Video Recordings Act ( VRA ) was introduced in 1984 it became necessary for The Exorcist to obtain a certificate for video release from the BBFC . Because of the huge number of titles already on the shelves , the BBFC was given four years in which to work through those titles that had already been released , determining whether they should be allowed to remain on the shelves ( and , if so , with what classification ) or whether they must be withdrawn from sale . <p> As the 1988 deadline for making a decision on The Exorcist approached , the BBFC continued to debate whether the film was suitable , within the meaning of the VRA , for ' viewing in the home ' . Of particular concern was the fact that the protaganist of the film was aged 12 and the film might therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been relatively easy to ensure that young children would be excluded but video was a different matter . Adding to the BBFC 's difficulties were the reports of incidents of hysteria involving young women , which had led to concerns that the film might cause severe emotional problems , particularly among those who believed in the reality of demonic possession . <p> It was with this concern in mind that the BBFC in the 1980s and early 1990s concluded that a video classification - even with an 18 rating ( which could not entirely exclude the possibility of the work being seen by younger and susceptible viewers ) - was inappropriate . <p> Therefore , at the beginning of 1988 , the video was removed from the shelves ( after nearly seven years of free availability ) and was to remain unavailable for 11 years . Despite the prohibition on the video version , the film continued to play occasionally in cinemas , its existing X certificate being replaced by a new 18 certificate - for cinema release only - in 1991 . <p> In 1998 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaunching the film in UK cinemas . The BBFC watched this re-release with interest , as it was widely expected that a fresh attempt to obtain a certificate for video ( and now DVD ) release would inevitably follow . The cinema re-release was notable in that it was not accompanied by any of the hysteria or audience disturbance which supposedly occurred in the mid-1970s . <p> When the film was formally resubmitted for video/DVD release at the end of 1998 , the BBFC concluded that The Exorcist , while still a powerful and compelling work , no longer had the same impact as it did 25 years ago . Film technique and special effects had moved on a long way since then , and audiences - including ( or especially ) teenagers brought up on a range of modern multi- media output - were less likely to be affected . Correspondingly , the potential of The Exorcist to disturb a small , impressionable minority seemed to have been significantly diminished . <p> The BBFC also considered the likely effects of the film 's reputation . Whilst unable to discount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons may seek ways to view it , both the name and the nature of the film were familiar to most people . It was considered that its reputation should prompt many parents and guardians to be more alert to that possibility than would normally be the case . <p> Therefore the BBFC agreed that The Exorcist could finally be classified 18 uncut for video/DVD release , at a level which minimised the likelihood of the work being viewed by young and impressionable persons . <p> A DVD version was submitted to the BBFC in 2010 with very minor changes to the end credits These did not affect the content , and so the same classification of 18 was again given , with BBFCinsightadded of ' Contains very strong language , strong threat and supernatural horror ' . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

It contains a fantasy scene in which the figure of St Teresa of Avila caresses the body of the crucified Christ and apparently has sex with him . <p> The BBFC , having taken legal advice , judged the film to be potentially liable to prosecution under the common law offence of blasphemous libel . Because cuts would have removed about half the work ( which is only 19 minutes long ) the only viable option was to refuse a classification . There was much debate in the press about whether or not the film was a serious experimental work and about whether the offence of blasphemy had any place in a modern society . <p> Nigel Wingrove , the film 's director and distributor , appealed against the BBFC 's rejection to the independent Video Appeals Committee . This Committee was established by the Video Recordings Actin 1984 to hear appeals from distributors who felt that the BBFC 's decisions on their works were too restrictive . <p> After hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film by film maker Derek Jarman , the Committee upheld the BBFC 's original decision , being satisfied that a reasonable jury was likely to convict . Indeed , only 10 years previously , Gay News had been successfully prosecuted for blasphemy after publishing a poem by James Kirkup describing a Roman soldier 's sexual fantasies about Christ . <p> The distributor then took his case to the European Court of Human Rights , who delivered their verdict in 1996 . Although the Court did not consider whether or not the video itself was blasphemous ( since that was a matter that could only be decided under UK law ) it was asked to consider whether the existence of a law of blasphemy was consistent with the right of Freedom of Expression , guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights . In their conclusion they stated that : " Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society . As paragraph 2 of Article 10 expressly recognises , however , the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is , in regard to objects of veneration , gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory " . <p> In 2012 , the film was resubmitted for classification and the BBFC considered the film in terms of its current Guidelines . With the abolition of the blasphemy law , the film was no longer likely to be considered illegal under any current piece of UK legislation . Nor was the film likely to be harmful to viewers under the terms of the Video Recordings Act . Although the Board recognised that the film retained the potential to offend some viewers , there were no longer any sustainable grounds to refuse a classification and Visions of Ecstasy was therefore classified 18 without cuts . To ensure that prospective viewers are fully aware of the content of the film , the BBFCinsight reads ' Contains nudity and sex involving religious images ' . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

Films aimed at children have their fair share of scary moments , and always have . So how does the BBFC treat horror aimed at children ? <p> In the BBFC Guidelines to the junior categories it notes that at PG there might be some scary moments , and it is worth remembering the rollercoaster effect of some famous PG level films like Jurassic Park or Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring . <p> Childrens film Coraline arrived at the BBFC with a PG category request . It was based on the popular , award-winning , childrens book by Neil Gaiman and is a stop-motion animated film in a similar style to The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Corpse Bride . <p> It tells of Coraline , a feisty young girl whose busy parents often leave her on her own . One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that takes her to another world , an alternative universe where she lives with her Other Mother and Other Father . These Other parents seem perfect they cook delicious food and lavish attention on their daughter , and yet they are also slightly sinister with their buttons for eyes and desire to keep Coraline with them . <p> Examiners noted a general air of creepiness or spookiness running through the film . The eeriness starts in the opening credits which show close-up images of a raggedy doll being taken apart with medical precision and continues with the first sight of the Other Mother and her button eyes . They also noted that as the film progresses the slight creepiness becomes increasingly menacing . Coraline is asked to consider replacing her own eyes with buttons so she can stay with the Other Mother forever and when she refuses the Other Mother reveals her true self , the Beldam , a huge spider-like creature . As Coraline tries to escape , everything becomes scary and dark the garden full of snapping plants , her friendly Circus Master revealed to be a bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBFC Guidelines allow some element of horror provided it meets the criteria that frightening sequences are not prolonged or intense . Recently updated BBFC Guidelines go into even more detail about scary moments in childrens films in the Main Issues section : <p> " Many children enjoy the excitement of scary sequences , but , where films are targeted at a younger audience , classification decisions will take into account such factors as the frequency , length and detail of scary scenes as well as horror effects , including music and sound , and whether there is a swift and reassuring outcome . " <p> Despite the scariness , the film features a number of mitigating factors elements which lessen the intensity of the more frightening scenes . These included moments of comedy and fun like silly songs , performances by dancing mice and the strange behaviour of the amusing and colourful neighbours . Additionally , a lot of emphasis is placed on the reassuring happy ending . <p> The characterisation of Coraline also offered a strong argument for placing the work at PG . Coraline is shown to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally be scared , always manages to find a way out of a tricky situation and eventually succeeds in not only defeating the Other Mother but also saves her own parents and returns home safely . The biggest consideration , perhaps , was the fact that in Coraline some of the scares come from people or places that should feel safe to children , for example their homes and parents . This was one of the reasons the examiners did not feel a U category would be suitable . <p> At PG the BBFC Guidelines also state that fantasy settings may be a mitigating factor and Coraline certainly fits into the category of a fantasy film . The examiners recognised that the films central idea of a parallel world would be a familiar idea for a child audience well used to similar plot devices in fairy tales . The films fantastical elements : the talking cats , performing mice , and mothers with buttons for eyes , plus the fact that Coraline features animated models rather than human actors , all make it very clear that Coralines world is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As well as the scary moments , examiners also noticed that there was one use of mild language as Coralines mother describes some rat droppings as rat crap and a scene in which the overweight actress Miss Spinks appears as a character from a painting wearing just a mermaids tail and some glittery stickers on her breasts . <p> A film with a PG classification is described by the BBFC as offering General viewing , but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children . Unaccompanied children of any age may watch . A PG film should not disturb a child aged around eight or older . However , parents are advised to consider whether the content may upset younger or more sensitive children. <p> Bearing this in mind the BBFCinsight ( the source of information about the films content which is displayed either on posters or the BBFC website ) offered enough detail to warn parents about elements that might scare more sensitive young viewers . <p> The BBFCinsight stated the film Contains mild threat and scary scenes and one use of mild language while the extended version went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the film listing . <p> Not all parents agreed with the PG classification for Coraline , however , and some wrote to the BBFC to complain that their children had been scared by the film - some of them to the point of having to leave the cinema . Everyone who wrote in received a reply explaining all the reasons for the PG classification as the BBFC has a responsibility to take into account public opinions on the classification of films . ( See the Education news article on Complaints Letters . ) <p> Coraline was also released in a 3D version , and Examiners watched and classified this too , as sometimes the format of a film may change the viewing experience . In the case of Coraline , both versions were given a PG classification . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

Lawrences novel Lady Chatterleys Lover , suggested a strong shift in public opinion , when a jury acquitted this work . John Trevelyan , as BBFC Secretary , responded to the new spirit of liberalism by stating : ' The British Board of Film Censors can not assume responsibility for the guardianship of public morality . It can not refuse for exhibition to adults films that show behaviour that contravenes the accepted moral code , and it does not demand that the wicked should also be punished . It can not legitimately refuse to pass films which criticise the Establishment and films which express minority opinions ' . <p> However , the decade began with a challenge in the form of Michael Powell 's Peeping Tom , which had been seen by the BBFC at the script stage and provoked a remark from Trevelyan about its ' morbid concentration on fear ' . Various cuts had been suggested at script stage , and the film was rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a torrent of abuse and it failed to please the public , damaging Powell 's reputation . The DVD remained at 18 until 2007 when it was re-rated 15 . <p> New realism took hold in British films , with the submission of a number of ' kitchen sink ' dramas from the British New Wave directors - Karel Reisz 's Saturday Night And Sunday Morning in 1960 and Tony Richardson 's The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner in 1962 , both passed X , the latter with cuts . Saturday Night And Sunday Morning had been submitted to the BBFC at script stage . Concerns were expressed about the language , violence and the theme of abortion , and the script was modified to meet these concerns . This might have been the ' swinging Sixties ' , but in spite of the film 's BBFC uncut release at X , Warwickshire Council deemed it too strong and demanded that cuts be made for a local certificate . The film was rated PG on video in 1990 . <p> By 1966 , Lewis Gilbert 's Alfie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' basically moral theme ' in spite of some misgivings at the BBFC about the abortion theme . Attitiudes to sexuality were on the change in the wake of the 1957 Wolfenden Report , which recommended a relaxation of the laws concerning homosexuality , although no new legislation was to appear for another ten years . Trevelyan claimed that the BBFC had never banned the subject of homosexuality from the screen but ' the subject was one that would probably not be acceptable to the British audience ' . Basil Dearden 's Victim contributed to the debate in 1961 , containing the line ' they call the law against homosexuality the blackmailer 's charter ' . The film was rated X with a brief cut . It was then rated 15 on video in 1986 and re-rated 12 on DVD in 2003 .

The decade also saw the establishment of the Carry On series , characterised by its use of seaside postcard humour , some of which was trimmed for the A category - for instance in Carry On Cleo ( 1964 ) and Carry On Camping ( 1969 ) . <p> Violence in Walter Grauman 's Lady In A Cage proved too strong for the BBFC in 1964 and the film was rejected on the grounds that it could ' invite and stimulate juvenile violence and anti-social behaviour by young people ' .

This Roger Corman work about the delights and drawbacks of taking LSD was not rated until 35 years had lapsed and it was no longer considered a danger . It was for years the BBFC 's stance that the film presented LSD use as normal and legitimate , rather than as a dangerous and criminal , practice .

Soon after arrival , they inadvertently unleash the forces of darkness and , one by one , are turned into rampaging zombies . Luckily for the special effects department , the zombies can only be stopped by the act of bodily dismemberment . <p> The Evil Dead was first seen by the BBFC in August 1982 . Reaction within the BBFC was divided between those who felt the film was so ridiculously ' over the top ' that it could not be taken seriously , and those who found it ' nauseating ' . Realising that there was likely to be an equal division of opinion amongst cinema audiences , the BBFC 's Director at the time felt that the best course of action would be to tone down the most excessive moments of violence and gore . It was hoped that cuts could retain the film 's humour whilst neutering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footage was removed , taken from several scenes , before an X certificate was awarded . This included reducing the number of blows with an axe , reducing the length of an eye gouging , and reducing the number of times that a pencil was twisted into a person 's leg . <p> It was unfortunate for the distributors of The Evil Dead that their film was released at the height of the ' video nasties'scare . At the time , there was no formal requirement that films must be classified for video release and this loophole had encouraged some of the smaller and more enterprising distributors to release a number of uncensored films on video that would not have been acceptable for cinema release . <p> Although The Evil Dead was quite different in tone to many of the so-called ' video nasties ' , in that its tongue was firmly in its cheek , it was not entirely surprising when the video version ( which had already been cut in line with the BBFC 's cinema cuts ) was added to the list of ' video nasties ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBFC , there were concerns that the lack of an effective age rating system on video - and the easy availability of videos once they entered the home - would inevitably lead to underage viewing . The video version was therefore seized from a large number of shops around the UK and , in many cases , the shop owners simply pleaded guilty to supplying an obscene article rather than incur the added expenses of trying to defend the film . Ultimately , the distributors themselves were taken to Snaresbrook Crown Court , where they successfully argued that the film was not obscene . The Evil Dead was therefore removed from the ' video nasties ' list by the Director of Public Prosecution ( DPP ) in September 1985 . <p> With the introduction of theVideo Recordings Act in 1984 , under which all videos were now required to be classified by the BBFC , The Evil Dead needed to be formally submitted for a video classification . Despite the acquittal of the film at Snaresbrook and its subsequent removal from the DPP 's list of video nasties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version in its current form . Of greatest concern was that , regardless of the verdict at Snaresbrook , the film had nonetheless been found obscene by other courts around the country . Under the terms of its designation under the Video Recordings Act , the BBFC was obliged to avoid classifying any material that might be found obscene . <p> Furthermore , given the stricter tests imposed on the BBFC by the Video Recordings Act - which required that the BBFC should consider the suitability of a video for ' viewing in the home ' - there was concern about whether the film as it stood would be acceptable under the new Act . Because the expressed purpose of the Video Recordings Act was to remove ' video nasties ' from the shelves , it might seem indefensible at this stage to approve for video release what Mary Whitehouse had called the ' number one nasty ' . <p> Accordingly a decision on The Evil Dead was put off until 1989 , by which time the initial furore about the film had died away . Nonetheless , given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the BBFC 's cut and approved version that had been subject to prosecutions - it was decided that further cuts would be required before issuing a certificate for video release . The BBFC 's lawyers advised that one or two minor cuts would be insufficient , since the BBFC needed to arrive at a noticeably different version of the film to avoid classifying something that had been found obscene . In many cases , scenes that had already been subject to cuts for cinema release were simply subjected to slightly deeper cuts . <p> However , some scenes that had previously been approved intact for cinema release were now also reduced . Most famously this included the sequence in which one of the female characters is assaulted by a tree . In total a further one minute six seconds were removed from the video version , meaning that The Evil Dead had now been cut by a total of one minute 55 seconds . This reduced version was agreed by the BBFC 's lawyers to comprise a ' significantly different ' version to the one that had been prosecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2000 , the uncut version of the film was finally resubmitted to the BBFC . The BBFC recognised that standards had changed since 1990 ( and certainly since 1982 ) and that modern audiences were more accustomed to the excesses of horror films . Compared to films like Scream , The Evil Dead now looked rather tame . The BBFC therefore agreed , in line with the views of the public that the BBFC should only intervene when material was illegal or harmful , that The Evil Dead could now be classified 18 without cuts . The uncut DVD was released in 2001. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

The examiners viewing the film noted the main issues as : <p> several uses of strong language two uses of very strong language violence / horror <p> The repeated use of strong language immediately leads to a 15 classification . There are some 15 uses of variants of f**k ' . More unusual at 15 are two uses of very strong language , c**t , which normally indicates an 18 rated film . The BBFC accepts that this word can be highly offensive to members of the public , so careful consideration was given to the context in which this language appeared . Where the word is used aggressively and repeatedly in dialogue , an 18 will always result . In this film , the first use occurs in a scene at the police station where we see a swear box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that warrant a fine to be placed in the box . The word is seen briefly as part of this list . Given that the word is not actually spoken at this point , and that the context makes it clear that the word is offensive , examiners felt that the 15 would suffice . The second use occurs where police officer Nick listens to his sergeant describing a man 's selling drugs to students . Nick 's response of , What a c**t ! is an expression of his disapproval of trading in drugs , rather than aggressive swearing directed straight at the offending drug dealer . Because of the context , and the fact that the film is comic throughout , examiners felt that there was no need to raise the classification to 18 on account of the language . <p> The film exploits the presentation of bad language in one scene , where hero cop Nick Angel snarls , You mothers ... ! at a group of ( literal ) mums who come down the lane with their children , making a joke about a familiar swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this swear word as the doctor is shot in the foot , much as action heroes are accustomed to do in the films which Hot Fuzz sends up - again , the context is comic . <p> The fact that the film is a spoof of various familiar genre films - the cop movie , the action movie , the horror movie , the mystery thriller - means that the violence and horror merited a different treatment from violence and horror occurring as part of a serious film . Comedy will usually , but not always , lessen the impact of bloody violence in film . Examiners felt that this was the case in Hot Fuzz . The most striking example in the film occurs as reporter Tim waits beneath the church tower , and the murderous axe-man above dislodges the spire , which falls , demolishes Tim 's head and lodges itself neatly in Tim 's neck cavity , with very bloody effect . WhileBBFC Guidelinesfor violence at 15 state that ' Violence may be strong but may not dwell on the infliction of pain and injury ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images are unlikely to be acceptable ' , the image of Tim with the spire where his head should be is so exaggerated and absurd that examiners could not treat it in the same fashion as violence / horror images from , for instance , Hostel , rated 18 . <p> Further exaggerated violence and horror feature in the finale where the bad guy Skinner is thrown onto the spire of a model church - the tip of the spire pierces his chin and emerges through his mouth . He seems little inconvenienced by this problem , though , and continues to talk amiably .

@@34540550 @3540550/ <h> Cannibal Holocaust 201963 @qwx401963 <p> This 1979 Italian cannibal horror film was not submitted to the BBFC at the time of its original production , presumably because no distributor felt that it was likely to be acceptable for classification at that time . Instead , a version of the film that had already been slightly pre-cut by its distributors was released on video in 1982 without a BBFC certificate . At the time there was no formal requirement that videos should be classified by the BBFC , with the result that a number of small and enterprising companies exploited the loophole by releasing strong horror films onto the video market without submitting them to the BBFC . Not only did the lack of video classification mean that material that had been cut or rejected by the BBFC ( or which would not have been classified by the BBFC ) was freely available , it also meant that such material was available to persons of all ages , including children . <p> It did not take long before the Press launched a campaign to ban unclassified horror cassettes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In response , the Director of Public Prosecutions drew up a list of videos that he believed were obscene under the terms of the Obscene Publications Act . Some of the ' video nasties ' in fact turned out to be comparatively mild and a handful had even received BBFC cinema certificates . In a number of cases the sensationalist marketing of the films and their lurid packaging artwork was actually worse than the content of the films themselves . As a result , titles were periodically removed from the list as and when they were found ' Not Guilty ' by the courts . However , there was a hard core of nasties that would certainly have posed major difficulties for the BBFC had they been submitted for classification . Cannibal Holocaust was one of the strongest titles on the list . <p> Cannibal Holocaust recounts the story of a film crew searching the South American jungles for a missing team of young documentary film-makers . Although they never find the missing crew members , they do uncover some camera equipment and unopened film cans . When the footage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a TV broadcaster to help assemble the found footage . He swiftly discovers that the film crew were in fact frauds , illicitly fabricating footage by perpetrating atrocities on the local people and wildlife . As the film proceeds , we are shown the final footage shot by the missing crew as the local people take their terrible revenge . <p> Cannibal Holocaust was not formally submitted to the BBFC until 2001 , largely because its reputation as a ' video nasty ' and its long history of prosecutions for obscenity seemed to preclude the issuing of a BBFC certificate . <p> When it was submitted for video and DVD release the BBFC examined the film very carefully in terms of its own published Guidelines . <p> The film 's presentation of strong sexual violence infringed the Board 's strict policy on rape and sexual violence which states that ' Where the portrayal eroticises or endorses sexual assault , the Board is likely to require cuts at any classification level ' . Furthermore , in common with a number of Italian films of the same period , the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the filmmakers . UK law prohibits the public exhibition of cinema films if animals were cruelly mistreated during their making and the BBFC applies this test also to videos and DVDs . <p> Nonetheless , the BBFC recognised that the film , although strong , could be made acceptable , subject to the removal of the above scenes . The distributor therefore agreed to make five minutes 44 seconds of cuts to remove unacceptable elements , after which the film was passed at 18 for video and DVD release . Cuts were required in eight individual scenes : four scenes of sexual violence and four scenes of animal killing . <p> In 2011 , ten years after its previous examination , the BBFC was asked to take a second look at the film for DVD and BluRay release . Whilst recognising that the film still retains its power to shock and offend , the Board concluded that the scenes of sexual violence that had been subject to reductions in 2001 no longer warranted cuts at the adult level . Careful examination of the scenes in question showed there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scenes were often chaotically filmed , with hand held cameras , and/or featured frequent cutaways to the reactions of horrified onlookers . Their likely effect was to horrify and disgust the audience , rather than to eroticise or endorse such activity in the real world . <p> In terms of the scenes of animal killing , the BBFC concluded that one of the four scenes cut in 2001 still required intervention because it clearly showed an animal being made to suffer in a cruel fashion . The killing in question , in which a small mammal has its neck cut with a knife , is quite protracted and the animal is seen to struggle and scream as it bleeds out . However , careful inspection of the other previously cut scenes revealed that the animals in question were killed quickly and cleanly . For example , the notorious scene in which a turtle is killed shows the turtle 's neck being cut with a single rapid blow , instantly severing the spinal cord and killing the animal immediately . These scenes were not , therefore , in breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals but not the killing of animals , providing that the killing is swift . In each case , the animal 's body is seen to twitch after death but this was considered to be a post mortem reaction , akin to a headless chicken running around a farmyard . The BBFC recognises that some viewers may find the scenes of animal killing offensive or upsetting , not least because of the nervous reactions on display in the animals ' bodies or body-parts after death . However , the scenes do not breach the terms of BBFC policy , itself based on the Cinematograph Films ( Animals ) Act 1937 . It was acknowledged that the decision to cut these scenes in 2001 was primarily the result of the disgusting nature of the sequences , as well as the history of the film as a DPP-listed ' video nasty ' , rather than the result of a strict application of policy . Removing these sequences would be inconsistent with the BBFC 's decisions to permit quick clean kills in several other films , such as Apocalypse Now . <p> Accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen seconds of cuts to one scene of animal cruelty . The BBFCinsight states that the film ' Contains strong sex , sexual violence , bloody violence , and animal slaughter ' . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969 
@@34540551 @3540551/ <h> Dawn Of The Dead 201963 @qwx401963 <p> American film director George A. Romero built his reputation on being the creator of the modern horror zombie movie . His debut feature Night Of The Living Dead ( 1968 ) redefined the genre , introducing new levels of graphic violence that were to influence cinematic trends throughout the 1970s and 1980s . <p> However , it took Romero another ten years to construct a follow-up to the film , in which time he produced a string of critically acclaimed box office failures ( Martin , The Crazies ) and increasingly found it difficult to find funding for his projects . It was also during this period that special effects began to take on new levels of realism and the publics expectations of what the modern horror genre offered increased . <p> Dawn Of The Dead saw Romero back on safe ground - graphic depictions of human evisceration , exploding heads , and gruesome flesh eating ! Its premise was familiar to fans of the first one for unexplained reasons , a plague of zombies were scouring earth on a hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its predecessor . In Dawn of the Dead several survivors of the outbreak barricade themselves inside a suburban shopping mall and do their best to stave off the zombies . <p> Many critics read the narrative as a satirical commentary on consumer culture , whilst others were appalled by the strength of the visceral special effects . Influential U.S critic Roger Ebert claimed it was " one of the best horror movies of all timenobody ever said art had to be in good taste " . <p> Dawn Of The Dead was submitted to the BBFC for classification in June 1979 seven months after the film was released unrated in the US . It is probably true to say that the film arrived at the Board with a certain amount of notoriety ; two trailers had previously been submitted and both had suffered cuts . The film was seen by six examiners and the then Director of the BBFC , James Ferman . <p> The examiners unanimously disliked the film , whilst at the same time acknowledged that Romero had displayed some technical flair in creating pace and atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the film were the zombies sentient beings or unfeeling objects ; was the violence mitigated by the fact that the zombies are no longer human beings ; was the audience being invited to indulge in the killings because the zombies ostensibly felt nothing ? One examiner felt so strongly that the film glorified violence that he excluded himself from any further screenings or discussions surrounding the work . <p> One thing that all the examiners and James Ferman agreed on was that the 125 minute submitted version would have be cut before being released to the general public . Ferman stated that the film featured violence perpetrated against people which was " to a degree never before passed by the Board " and subsequently issued a cuts list that amounted to approximately 55 separate cuts ( two minutes 17 seconds ) . These included images of zombie dismemberment , the machine gunning of a child zombie , a sword cutting open a zombies head and most infamously , a slow motion shot of a zombies head exploding . <p> The following month a cut version of the film was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed the film . All of the examiners still disliked the film and some were convinced that cutting was not the solution to alleviating the possible desensitising effect that the film might have on vulnerable audiences . Despite this view , the suggestion of further extensive cuts was made and the film was once again seen by James Ferman , who subsequently issued a further one minute 29 seconds of cuts to more scenes of gory detail . At this point the distributor ( Target International Pictures ) was worried that the film would not be ready in time to be screened at the London Film Festival , so James Ferman suggested that the BBFCs in-house editor create a version that would be acceptable within the guidelines of the X certificate . <p> In September 1979 Ferman wrote to the distributor exclaiming that " a tour de force of virtuoso editing has transformed this potential reject from a disgusting and desensitising wallow in the ghoulish details of violence and horror to a strong , but more conventional action pieceThe cutting is not only skilful , but creative , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making the audience notice the emotions of the characters and the horror of the situation instead of being deadened by blood and gore " . <p> When the work was first submitted for classification for video in 1989 it arrived in its post-BBFC censored version , now clocking in at 120 minutes 20 seconds . However , under theVideo Recordings Act 1984 ( VRA ) , the film was to be subjected to another 12 seconds of cuts to scenes of zombie dismemberment and cannibalism . In 1997 Dawn Of The Dead was picked up by a new distributor ( BMG ) who took the decision to submit the film in its original uncensored state , with a running time of 139 minutes . <p> This time the BBFC only insisted on six seconds of cuts . However , it was in 2003 that the film was finally passed at 18 uncut by the BBFC , with the examiners feeling that under the 2000 BBFC Guidelinesit was impossible to justify cutting the work the film contained no material that was unprecedented and that it had in many ways been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28 Days Later and House Of 1,000 Corpses . <p> 2004 saw the release of Zack Snyders remake of Romeros Dawn Of The Dead , which proved to be an altogether more gruesome and graphic affair .

Why is the approach taken by the mobile operators with respect to commercial content different to general Internet content ? <p> Mobile operators have different responsibilities for commercial content where they have contractual agreements with content providers than they do for general content on the Internet . <p> The mobile operators commercial content is classified in accordance with the framework provided by the independent body and any content with an 18 rating is placed behind access controls . <p> With respect to Internet content , the mobile operators are not rating content or services but offer a filter to customers . The Classification Framework will be used to calibrate the filters used by the Operators to restrict access to Internet Content ( ie content delivered by URLs ) via mobile networks by those under 18 . <h> Q : What about wi-fi and Bluetooth ? <p> A : The Framework applies to content accessed via mobile networks only , not other wireless technologies such as wi-fi and Bluetooth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Apps stores , it is the responsibility of the Apps store provider to enforce their own terms and conditions . <h> Q : What about advertisements ? <h> Q : What about age restricted goods ? <p> A : The Classification Framework does not cover sites which supply age restricted goods or services such as knives , fireworks , tobacco , legal highs , alcohol , gambling or adult entertainment unless any adult filters in place block on the basis of the types of content listed in Part B of the Classification Framework .

Such content may include strong language , sexualised content , violence and so on , and may typically be rated 12 or 15 by the BBFC at the cinema or on video . The context in which such issues are presented is also central to the question of whether or not they need to go behind access controls . That context may either aggravate an issue ( for example language is used aggressively ) or mitigate ( for example comedy may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the content their children access is suitable for their age . <h> Q : What about ' glamour ' works ? <p> A : Works whose primary purpose is sexual arousal or stimulation are considered sex works and will be restricted to adults only . While pornographic content is restricted to adults , BBFC policy on glamour works makes some allowance for content whose primary purpose may fall short of sexual arousal or stimulation , but which has clear suggestive intentions . Such ' glamour ' video content may contain brief moments of sexualised posing where there is no focus on such content . Obvious sexual posing which is intended to arouse or stimulate rather than being merely suggestive is unlikely to be allowable in still images that are not placed behind access controls . <h> Q : Is the BBFC censoring the internet ? <p> A : No .

@@34540556 @3540556/ <h> The Wild One 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Laslo Benedeks 1953 film was one of the most controversial of its era , as it was released in the time of a moral panic . Post war American and British teenagers alarmed their elders in a way that was probably unprecedented and from which we still see some of the ripples in popular culture today . <p> The 1950s was a time of profound social change and the experience of what it meant to be young was transformed , as many of the old certainties and habits disappeared in the new consumer age . Indeed , the notion of the teenager , with his or her own clothes , music and interests , was largely a post war creation . Before 1939 , broadly speaking , each generation dressed in a largely similar fashion , listened to the same kind of music , went to the same pubs , music halls and so on . <p> After the end of the Second World War , however , cultural change picked up pace and the newly affluent teens , with increasing time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their parents had , and rejected many of the old habits and styles . This new air of liberation sometimes expressed itself as an antisocial rebelliousness that turned into outright hooliganism and violence at dance halls playing the newly popular Rock and Roll music . <p> In England the Teddy Boys were the most visible and alarming expression of the new youth culture , with their distinctive dress style and apparent willingness to fight and brandish knives . In America disaffected soldiers who found life tough after returning from the European conflict formed their own subcultural groups , such as Greasers and the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club . It was the latter that inspired and informed The Wild One and made its star , Marlon Brando , a popular icon of his time , along with James Dean and Marilyn Monroe . <p> Brando , as Johnny Strabler , leads the Black Rebels Motorcycle Club into a peaceful American town , and terrorises the inhabitants with their machismo antics and disaffected attitudes . The film was inspired by a real news story from 1947 when possibly three thousand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reportedly ran amok for three days ( see Hunter S. Thompsons book Hells Angels for a fuller description of events ) . <p> One of the films most famous scenes features Brando looking on insouciantly as gang members dance to a juke box in a diner they have taken over . What are you rebelling against Johnny ? a girl asks him . Waddaya got ? drawls the handsome young star . It was such apparently antisocial and nihilistic attitudes that thrilled young audiences and appalled their elders . <p> The film was banned by the BBFC upon its release here and remained so ( except for screenings in film societies where local councils overturned the BBFCs decision ) until 1967 when it was released with an X certificate ( suitable for 16 year olds and above ) . <p> The initial ban was prompted mostly by a fear that the very real problem of burgeoning juvenile delinquency , and a seemingly increasing lack of respect for authority , could only be aggravated by young people seeing this film . <p> The formal letter of rejection states that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " spectacle of unbridled hooliganism with no more than a mild censure from a police officer , would be likely to exert a harmful influence in that very quarter about which anxiety is felt and would expose the Board to justifiable criticism for certificating a film so potentially dangerous on social grounds " . The proliferation of youth styles and subcultures in the 1960s and pitched battles between Mods and Rockers did little to ease the fears of British society , and the BBFC remained cautious in its approach to The Wild One for over a decade , until its fashions and attitudes were seen as too dated to appeal to the new generation of would-be juvenile delinquents . <p> In the meantime , Columbia Pictures and the director of the film worked hard at getting the ban rescinded , looking in turn at cuts , amendments ( including a new ending with Johnny and his gang being sentenced in court ) and justifications for the films content . Benedek stated in print that he regretted the BBFC banning the film here , and that " somewhere my collaborators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British way of life of the sincerity of our purpose " . <p> It was passed PG on video in 1988 , where it sits today on DVD . By todays standards the film appears quite tame , and it is fairly obvious that its inherent message is that people such as Johnny and his ilk turn to gangs as a surrogate family and that society needs to embrace them , rather than push them further into the margins . It is a debate that troubles us still . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

The key classification issues in the work are infrequent strong language , moderate sex references and brief sight of a gory scene from an old horror movie The Wizard Of Gore ( rated 18 ) . When making their recommendations examiners also discussed the films tone , likely appeal and audience , and the treatment of the theme of teenage pregnancy . <p> The two uses of strong language ( ' f**K ' ) are not aggressive nor directed at anyone . They occur firstly when Mark ( the prospective adoptive father for Junos baby ) is trying to appear ' cool ' in a conversation about horror movies , and secondly when Juno realises she is going into labour . Though strong language is not permitted at PG , the BBFC Guidelines do allow for infrequent uses of strong language at 12A . Two uses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references are fairly frequent in Juno but they are moderate in tone and strength . Most sex references are comic . They include references to boners , condoms that make his balls smell like pie a vag , getting snatch ' . Some take place in a sexual health clinic where Juno goes when she is considering a termination . Though not educational in a strict sense , the context discussions between teenagers , including one who is pregnant as a result of unprotected sex was felt to mitigate any offence . The sex references were also considered to reflect what is likely to be familiar to most adolescents . <p> The one sex scene in the film is very brief and discreet we see a pair of knickers fall to the floor when Juno and Paulie are about to make love , but the act itself is only implied as allowed by BBFC Guidelines at 12A . <p> Juno has an exuberant and ironic tone , and is both playful and tender in its treatment of a mature theme . Some criticism of the film had suggested it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the films treatment of an important theme was suitable for young teenagers as it presented Junos pregnancy and its effects on her relationships realistically , rather than through rose-tinted glasses . <p> The brief clip from The Wizard of Gore , though it is n't a strong focus in the film , was an interesting classification issue . It comes at a pivotal point in the tale , as Juno and Mark bond over their shared love of music and horror films . Each is trying to impress the other with their knowledge of what is ' cool ' , and their shared viewing lays the groundwork for the narrative development . The clip itself is well-flagged they discuss horror directors , and Mark then shows this short illustrative clip .

The theme , tone and horror moments were also mentioned in the expanded version of the BBFCinsight , particularly for parents . The DVD version was passed at 12 in 2008 . <p> A cinema trailer for Juno , which cut together some of the films highlights including some comic sex references , a passing mention of hard drugs and sight of a character giving another the finger , caused some complaints during its theatrical release as it was played before childrens film . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540563 @3540563/ <h> The Dark Knight 201963 @qwx401963 <p> The Dark Knight came to the BBFC for classification in 2008 , with a distributor request for a 12A age rating . The previous film in the superhero series , Batman Begins ( also starring Christian Bale and directed by Christopher Nolan ) , was classified 12A in 2005 . In the USA , the MPAA had already rated the film PG-13 , for for intense sequences of violence and some menace . <p> Before the film was even submitted , it attracted significant media attention , much of it due to the sudden death of actor Heath Ledger , who played The Joker . <p> The main classification issues in The Dark Knight are violence and threat . BBFC Guidelines for 12A at the time stated Violence must not dwell on detail . There should be no emphasis on injuries and blood and Sustained moderate threat and menace are permitted . Occasional gory moments only . The examiners who classified the film agreed it met the Guidelines criteria , however , there were a significant numbers of complaints about the 12A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the film is quickly edited , and whilst sometimes crunchy , it is almost entirely lacking in any blood or injury details . The impacts of blows are mostly masked by actors bodies or camera angles , but the impression of violence is occasionally strong . For example , in one key sequence ( the ' pencil trick scene ' ) , The Joker demonstrates a ' trick ' by balancing a pencil on the table ; a villains head is then slammed onto the table and the pencil has ' disappeared ' . Audiences are left with the impression that the pencil has been slammed into the face or eye of the victim , but there is no actual sight of any impact , nor any blood or injury . The action is swift and not dwelt upon , and is designed to demonstrate the completely ruthless nature of The Joker . However , a number of people complained to the BBFC about this scene claiming to have actually seen the pencil entering the mans eye . This is not the case , but highlights a potential classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violence , in that the tone and impression of a film is sometimes stronger than the actual details on screen . Nevertheless , the BBFC judged the clear fantasy action context and audience familiarity with the superhero genre as sufficient mitigation against the film 's sometimes dark tone , hence it was rated 12A . <p> The threat in the film is most frequently seen when The Joker wields his preferred weapon , a knife : in one scene , he plays with the knife inside the mouth of a thug , and in another he presses it close to the heroines face . The Joker 's slow , menacing descriptions of how he got the knife scars on his face add a significant edge of terrorisation to these threatening scenes . Public concern then as now - over the issue of knife crime and gang violence was particularly high , due to prominent media coverage of teenagers in UK cities dying from knife attacks . <p> The BBFC always consider public sensibilities surrounding violence , and particularly that involving knives , especially in works aimed at a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the BBFC also takes a proportionate approach to classification , and the context of a violent scene is always critical . In The Dark Knight , The Joker is a psychotic , deranged character , as is clear from the cartoon comic strips in which he originally appeared . He is shown to be a volatile villain and the knife threat is one aspect of his unpredictable behaviour . Examiners were clear to establish that there is no undue focus on the weapon , and that it lacks any glamorous appeal ( such as the knives wielded by Lara Croft in the first Tomb Raider film , sight of which was reduced to achieve a 12 classification in 2001 ) . The presentation of knives in The Dark Knight was therefore judged to be acceptable within the 12A Guidelines , which stated that Easily accessible weapons should not be glamorised . <p> The BBFC recognised that the film was potentially a fairly intense experience at times ; director Christopher Nolan elected to give his Batman films a brooding and gritty edge , compared to earlier Batman films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar-winning performance as The Joker , plus his untimely death , also added to the general sense of darkness in the film , as did the more ' mature ' narrative themes of vigilantism , summary justice and the compromise of civil liberties . <p> However , despite The Dark Knight not being a simplistic good vs evil battle , the BBFC felt that the tone and themes could be accommodated within Guidelines at 12A , and was suitable for young adolescents . The BBFCinsight at the time noted that the film contained violence and sustained threat . A longer version of the BBFCinsight provided additional advice for parents thinking of taking their children to see the film . <p> When released , the film was a huge commercial and critical success . However , there was also criticism of the decision to classify the film at 12A . Several high profile figures condemned the BBFC for passing material at a category which allowed young children to see the film . Newspaper columnist Allison Pearson and former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith complained publicly that the film was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation of the BBFC , its policies and its role . <p> The BBFC received 364 complaints from members of the public in 2008 about The Dark Knight . In the general , the complainants felt the film was too dark and too violent for children . The bleak tone of the film , the ' adult ' nature of some of its themes and the ' unhappy ' ending were cited as not suitable for a film rated 12A , to which under-12 year olds could be taken , if accompanied by an adult . There were also concerns expressed that the knife threat in the film was inappropriate and insensitive in the current climate , and could encourage copycat attacks . A number of people found the facial injuries sustained by the Harvey ' Two-Face ' Dent character were too gory and scary for young children . However , his wounds are clearly unrealistic and exaggerated special effects , and similar to other disfigurements found in The Mummy films ( also classified 12 ) . The death of the film 's heroine , arguably the film 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing for a 12A fantasy film . Many argued that the film should have been classified 15 . There were even some calls for The Dark Knight to be classified 18 , which would have restricted it to adults only . <p> In a typical year , the BBFC receives around 450 complaints in total , and so The Dark Knight comprising 42% of all complaints for 2008 was exceptionally high for a single film . An analysis of this public response revealed that less than 10 per cent of those who complained about the film 's suitability for children did actually take children to see the film . It was also clear from a number of letters and emails that many of the complainants were responding to press coverage of the decision , and had not seen the film themselves . It was noted that the majority of complaints were received in the same week that The Daily Mail ran a campaign lasting three days against the decision . Once media interest ceased , the complaints also significantly declined , although the film continued to be screened nationwide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high level of feedback about The Dark Knight . The film was included as a sample work in the Guidelines consultation which was taking place at the time . The BBFC regularly reviews its Guidelines every four to five years through extensive consultation with the public . Groups were asked to view the film and invited to comment about its classification . Despite being the most complained about classification decision in 2008 , 69% of respondents in the consultation who had seen the film supported the 12A decision . ( 30% thought it too low , 1% too high ) . The survey also revealed 74% of respondents understood that the 12A certificate did not necessarily indicate that the film would be suitable for under-12s . Nevertheless , reaction to The Dark Knight did feed into discussions about the importance of tone as a classification issue . The consultation recognised that the tone of a film could still be disturbing even though there was very little visual detail .

These Guidelines are the result of a regular public consultation process and reflect the balance of media effects research , the requirements of UK law and the attitudes of the UK public . The Guidelines set out clearly the BBFC 's serious concerns about the portrayal of sexual violence . The BBFC are also obliged under the Video Recordings Act 1984 ( VRA ) to have special regard to the likelihood of any harm that may be caused to the viewer or , through their behaviour , to society . This risk of harm includes encouraging a dehumanised view of others , callousness towards victims and taking pleasure in the pain and humiliation of others . <p> The BBFC also seeks to avoid classifying material that may be in breach of UK law , including works that may be potentially obscene under the Obscene Publications Acts 1959 and 1964 ( OPA ) .

@@34540574 @3540574/ <h> Freaks 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Tod Brownings 1932 film , Freaks , has a long and interesting history with the BBFC . The film was allegedly inspired by Brownings own recollections of circus life and the sideshow freaks that often made up a part of the draw for circuses in those days . When the film was initially released it was greeted with revulsion and disgust by both the critics and the public and enjoyed only a very short cinema run in the United States before being withdrawn by MGM . In the UK the film was refused a certificate altogether . At the time , the only categories available for films were U and A and it was felt that the film exploited for commercial reasons the deformed people that it claimed to dignify . Even the arrival of the H category for horror films later the same year failed to save the film . <p> It was 1952 before Freaks reappeared at the BBFC for classification . By then owned by a new distributor , Adelphi Films , the Director of Adelphi , Arthur Dent , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be released with an X certificate ; in those days this would have allowed those aged 16 and above to see the film . He wrote " I do think that the sympathetic manner in which these characters are portrayed should go far to eliminate from the public mind the usual feeling of horror which is their first effect in circus side-shows I do feel that the film deserves to be seen by the adult public . " The film was again rejected , on the same grounds as in 1932 and Adelphi Films appealed the decision , arguing that the exploitation of human deformity in circuses , fairgrounds and variety theatres was a fact and that hiding the subject away " behind a display of moral righteousness " made it impossible to deal with such exploitation . The argument went on to point out that this depiction of exploitation was the very reason that the film ought to be passed with an X certificate , provided suitable cuts were made . The view of the BBFC remained resolutely that the film was inadmissible , both because the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain , and because many of the scenes were deemed to be extremely unpleasant . It was argued that there was an unbroken succession of scenes of which the only point was the display of deformity and abnormality which no amount of cutting could tone down . The decision to reject the film was upheld . <p> In May 1963 , with yet another distributor on board , the film was submitted to the BBFC for the third time . The distributor proposed a very limited and very carefully managed release , starting in only one art house cinema in London , the Paris Pullman in Kensington , and promoted " without undue exploitation and sensationalism . " Thereafter the film would only be released outside London " in theatres of suitable reputation and standing . " The intention was to allow an adult audience to judge for itself whether the film exploited the abnormalities of the cast or whether it was actually a plea for understanding and compassion . The BBFC finally awarded the film an X certificate with the caveat that " people should be warned of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights are displeasing will not see it . " The Secretary to the Board warned that it would be undesirable " to attract people who would wish to come and see Freaks for unworthy reasons . " Upon release the film garnered fairly favourable reviews from the Press . The following extract from The Times of 13 June 1963 , perhaps summed it up best : <p> " The point constantly being made , one way and another , is that the real monsters of this world are not physical but mental ; that the strong and the beautiful may well be much more horrifying than the maimed and deformed . In this sense it is less a horror than an anti-horror film ; starting with our most primitive feelings of fear and revulsion at the abnormal and the " unnatural " , it works us round little by little to comprehension and acceptance and drains our horror away . " <p> With its X certificate the film finally went on release 31 years after being made . Having a fairly limited appeal it appeared to have little impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBFC having been alarmed and distressed at the reaction of the largely teenage audience in his local cinema who apparently laughed at the sight of the titular characters . He left the film after only 20 minutes and was not there to witness the audiences reactions to the films denouement and its clear message of compassion and understanding for those less advantaged members of society . <p> Apart from this one communication , Freaks essentially disappeared for another 31 years , when it re-emerged in 1994 for a modern video classification . It was viewed by a large number of BBFC Examiners and , perhaps unsurprisingly , divided opinion with recommendations ranging from a possible PG to 15 . It was felt by some that the actual visual content of the film did not really go beyond the PG level , although it was acknowledged that the tone and treatment of the work probably indicated that a 12 would be more appropriate . Others argued more strongly that even a 12-year old audience would lack the necessary maturity and critical faculties to understand the message of the film and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shock . Younger viewers , it was felt , may be disturbed by what they saw since the abnormalities shown in the film were beyond the experience of most people , particularly the young . The clinching argument that finally took the film to 15 was based upon the climactic scene when the freaks wrought their revenge on the bullying Hercules . This was the moment where , it was felt , the freaks were actually used and turned into monsters . The black and white film , coupled with the scene itself at night , in thunder and rain gave it a highly sinister edge as the freaks crept under a wagon and moved relentlessly on to finally stab and kill Hercules . The images of the legless man walking on his hands , the limbless man making his way across the mud like some giant worm and the Pinheads with vacant expressions crawling spider-like towards the frightened Hercules , all combined to present a highly charged scene which , momentarily and probably unintentionally , risked turning the audiences feelings of sympathy to feelings of fear , apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by placing the work at 15 the viewer was expected to have sufficient maturity and understanding to accept this sequence as part of the narrative and not an attempt to sensationalise or exploit the actors and their disabilities . <p> In 2001 the film was resubmitted for a theatrical release , and was this time passed at 12 . There was still some discussion between examiners as to whether the film should remain at 15 , but the ultimate argument for making the film accessible to a younger audience prevailed , with one examining summing up the general feeling by stating " It is a 1930 's film and reflects social prejudices about difference . The film should be viewed in its historical context . As a BFI classic it will possibly be seen by film students and arthouse crowds . If we consider human rights today and the conscious social policies about mainstream inclusion of the disabled , there is every reason to support a young teen audience for this film .

@@34540576 @3540576/ <h> WW2 Films - Part 2 - Let 's talk about the war ... <p> In part two of our special case study on classification and censorship during WW2 we explore some of the most influential films of the time and how they were treated at the Censors ' Office . <h> The Films <p> In 1943 a survey of British cinema-going habits ( the Mass-Observation survey ) asked respondents to list their favourite six films of the past year . The two films which topped the list were In Which We Serve and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp . Significantly , both were British films , both dealing with the war effort . <h> The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp <p> Of the two , Colonel Blimp was possibly the most significant and important film of the war years . At a time when the film industry throughout the world was producing either escapist entertainment or rousing propaganda Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger produced a film that raised awkward questions about the calibre of Britains military leadership and about its readiness for total war. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government attempted to prevent it being made , not least Winston Churchill who regarded the films subject matter as potentially harmful to the armys morale . <p> Ironically , it was its very subject matter that marked it out as such an important film and which contributed to its popularity in the Mass Observation survey where a number of respondents felt it to be very true to life . The Ministry of Information argued that Powell and Pressburger had " rather wantonly played with ideasin order toinject sensational elements for Box Office purposes . " <p> So far as the censors of the day were concerned , they clearly did n't  share the Prime Ministers worries about the armys morale not even considering it to be " holding up the Kings uniform to contempt or ridicule " and what the film certainly did n't  do was to demonstrate explicitly what the military consequences might be for eschewing total war. Accordingly there are no battle scenes and very little bloodshed . The films punches were reserved more for its political statements and this is what saved it from being classified any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp had advocated setting aside the traditional English virtues of loyalty and good manners in order to defeat the enemy , Noel Cowards tribute to the Royal Navy , In Which We Serve , appealed on a more basic level to the emotions and reinforced Cowards own belief in the English class system . <p> Far from setting aside the noble virtues in order to defeat Germany , Coward set out to show that these were the very strengths that would help England to win . The principal message that came out of the film was that all classes had to pull together to fight the common enemy and that love for ones country ( here in the guise of the ship HMS Torrin ) had to come before loyalty to ones class or family . <p> The film spelt out very clearly what Britain was fighting for the preservation of the values that had made her great . But it also pulled no punches in showing how Britain was fighting . <p> After the sinking of HMS Torrin in the Battle of Crete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are repeatedly strafed by German aircraft . A number are either killed or mortally wounded but emotions never run out of control the actions of the pilots speak for themselves and it has been suggested that it was exactly this sort of stoicism that contributed to the films popularity . <p> And , it would seem , this example of the stiff upper lip may have played a part in the decision to place the film in the ' U ' category . While a film made today would undoubtedly show more blood and gore in the strafing incident , would the very act of merciless slaughter be considered suitable for all audiences ? Possibly not , but in 1942 a year that had seen defeat after defeat in North Africa and the humiliation of the fall of Singapore a film that so unashamedly celebrated the virtues of plucky endurance and stoical self-sacrifice probably needed to be seen by the widest possible audience . <h> Went the Day Well ? <p> Two lesser-known films from the war years amply demonstrate that some issues struck a little too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next Of Kin both dealt with the threat of invasion and the danger of enemy agents . In the early years of World War 2 the fear of invasion was very great and so it is , perhaps , surprising that few films during this period dealt directly and seriously with this threat . <p> The 1942 Ealing production Went the Day Well ? was directed by a documentary filmmaker , Alberto Cavalcanti , and showed British civilians coming to grips on home ground with the German army . The film depicts , in a quite unglamorous and unsentimental fashion , the possible consequences of such an invasion ( even a covert one as depicted in this film . ) A local vicar is brutally shot in the back when trying to sound a warning and a number of Home Guard soldiers are mercilessly mown down when they fail to respond to the warning bell . <p> Despite the eventual assuring outcome , the film still had the effect of unsettling audiences and so it is probably unsurprising that such scenes earned the film an A rating in 1942 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Next Of Kin <p> The business of unsettling audiences was one of the principal aims of Next Of Kin . Produced at Ealing the same year as Went the Day Well ? , the film was based around the well known slogan " careless talk costs lives " and showed , to quite devastating effect , the threat of spies and fifth columnists . <p> The climax to the film depicts a British raid on German coastal defences in France which was compromised as a result of such activities and showed the attacking forces suffering very heavy casualties . <p> The battle scenes were considered at the time to be remarkably realistic , prompting one distraught viewer who had two sons serving overseas to launch a bitter verbal attack on a cinema manager ( and subsequently on the screen-writer , Thorold Dickinson , when he attended the scene ) for showing actual scenes of battle . <p> She would not be persuaded that it was a work of fiction . The films editor described it as " simply too grim , too effective , too frightening . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film to the reaction to Saving Private Ryan , a generation later . A subsequent article will deal with this in more detail . ) <h> Political intervention <p> The War Office considered Next Of Kin to be a most effective piece of propaganda and arrangements were made for it to be shown to troops . An unfortunate post-script was that the film went on release , with an A rating from the BBFC in recognition of the disturbing sequences at the end of the film , only a few weeks before the real life raid on the French port of St Nazaire in March 1942 . The Prime Minister asked that the film be taken off general release because of the potentially damaging effects on the morale of the troops . <p> The St Nazaire raid was considered a success but there were heavy casualties with 150 men out of the 611 who took part losing their lives and more than half being captured . It also prefigured the disastrous raid on Dieppe in August of 1942 when more than 1,000 mostly Canadian troops were killed in a botched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , Next Of Kin probably did more than any other to unsettle audiences and this undoubtedly contributed to its success . The popularity of cinema during this period ( it has been estimated that roughly half the population went to the cinema at least once a week ) gave filmmakers an extremely powerful voice in shaping public opinion and it was an opportunity that few serious filmmakers ignored . <p> During pre-production for The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp , Michael Powell wrote to the actress Wendy Hiller " No artist believes in escapism . And we secretly believe that no audience does . We have proved , at any rate , that they will pay to see truth , for other reasons than her nakedness . " If any period in the history of the BBFC relied upon the independence of the Board from Governmental control and interference it was the war era , when even the Prime Minister was unable to prevent films such as The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and Next Of Kin from enjoying success . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969 
@@34540578 @3540578/ 201963 @qwx401963 <p> The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , four anthropomorphic turtles named after Italian Renaissance artists and trained by a rat in martial arts skills , became a worldwide phenomenon in the late 1980s . Their origin lay in comic books , but soon translated into a hugely successful television series . The title of the show caused problems for broadcasters , and the emphasis on martial arts weapons would prove complicated for the BBFC for the first film adaptation and its sequel . <p> The TV show began in the US in 1987 and quickly arrived in the UK , on the BBC . However , the government of the time was concerned about violence in childrens television , particularly ninjas and their weapons . Therefore , in accordance with the standards applied by TV and other regulators at the time , the broadcasters changed the title of the show to Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles , together with accompanying merchandise and a tie-in video game . The theme song was also re-recorded and the logo changed for the UK ( and European ) market . Concerns about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the title ; as a result , sequences of grappling replaced all sight of the turtle Michelangelo using his trademark nunchaku weapon ( chainsticks ) . <p> Additionally , the BBC version of the show changed all uses of the term bummer ( meaning bad luck ) , due to concerns over the term having a homophobic meaning in British slang . <p> In 1990 , a feature film - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - came to the BBFC , after it received PG with no cuts in the US . There was some discussion about the title , which the distributor , Virgin Vision , originally wanted to change in line with the UK television series . However , the ultimate decision was to keep the ' ninja ' element of the title . <p> The BBFC required several cuts to the feature film , due to concern about easily accessible martial arts weapons . They asked for sequences involving nunchaku to be taken out , with a letter instructing the company to remove from the UK version all clear sight of chainsticks used or carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 3 , 4 ( briefly ) , and 5 . <p> The films sequel , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ll The Secret Of The Ooze , arrived at the BBFC in April 1991 with a PG request . The BBFC Examiners acknowledged that this was a much milder film than its predecessor , and one report notes that " most of the violence-level here is U rather than PG , though quantitatively there is enough to justify the PG requested by the company just ! " <p> However , BBFC Examiners also realised there was potentially a problem with some of the violence , in particular the use of improvised props resembling chainsticks or nunchaku : <p> " In the credits sequence in Reel 1 , chainsticks are wielded ( or seem to be ) after a shot of sausages hanging from the butchers rail . Since there is real confusion between chainsticks and sausages this sequence needs to be carefully checked before cuts ( if any ) are listed . Ditto a sequence in Reel 2 , where April tries out a pair of chainsticks ; could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty foolish ( right Charlies , in fact ) if we cut them ! " <p> Another report states the then BBFC policy to remove these weapons , but warned that pragmatically it might be unwise to remove sausages used to resemble the weapon . <p> After contacting the distributor , the BBFC was reassured that all the sequences involved sausages not sticks . <p> However , BBFC Director James Ferman thought there was still potential for the sequence to showcase chainsticks-type weapons , and the sausages would look like these weapons to any streetwise 8 year old . The cuts list therefore included the following request to minimise any glamorisation of easily accessible weapons : <p> " After turtle takes down sausages and uses them as a flail . Reduce to minimum dazzling display of swinging sausages indistinguishable from chainsticks " <p> The Examiner reports for the video release include some criticism of the decision , with one report noting that " the sausage/chainstick confusion makes his Fermans cuts list a tiny bit ludicrous to read " . <p> The second film remained cut until it returned for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBFC waived all the previous cuts and rated it PG uncut .

Sex , nudity , drug use and violence all make an appearance at various levels .

Often the climactic moments are " perpetrated by an inanimate object i.e. falling through glass at the end of a fight " . Overall , the depiction of violence avoids any harmful " selling of brutality " , and the team were confident that Die Hard could sit comfortably at the 18 category without any cuts . <p> Die Hard was also rated 18 for its video release and remained at that category until 2008 , when it was reclassified as part of a formal submission .

The open trade of such stimulants was restricted by emergency legislation ( as were pub opening hours ) in order to help the war effort .

@@34540593 @3540593/ <h> Redacted 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Redacted is a film by Brian De Palma ( Scarface , Dressed To Kill ) , based on an incident from 2006 in which occupying American troops were alleged to have raped a young Iraqi woman and murdered her family in the town of Samarra . The film imagines events surrounding the incident through different media perspectives : a video diary being made by one of the soldiers , reports from a fictional French documentary crew , footage from Arabic news channels and internet broadcasts made by Al Qaeda-type insurgents . <p> The film deals with the brutalising effect of war a theme previously explored by De Palma in Casualties Of War set during the Vietnam conflict and presents its story in a hard-hitting , and occasionally shocking , manner which raised a number of classification issues around the borderline between the 15 and 18 categories . <p> A minimum 15 category was established by numerous uses of strong language ( variations of f**k and motherf**ker ) with theBBFC Guidelines allowing for frequent use of strong language at 15 . There is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape scene ; the Guidelines at 15 state that the strongest terms ( eg cunt ) will be acceptable only where justified by context and since such language reflects the callous attitude of the soldiers involved in the attack but is not used continuously - it did not present a challenge to the 15 category . <p> The rape scene was considered carefully since portrayals of sexual violence are of acute concern to the BBFC , that concern reflecting the attitude of the public to the issue . The Guidelines at 15 state that scenes of sexual violence must be discreet and brief . Although the build-up to the horrific attack on the young woman and her family is quite protracted , the sexual aspect is quite restrained in terms of its length and the detail presented . <p> The intention of the scene is to show the brutalised personalities of the men involved which may be part of their natural character , or a consequence of the chaotic wartime situation in which they find themselves , and is certainly portrayed as a an act of revenge for the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sexual element in their actions . Several aspects of the scene , including the off-screen murder of the womans family and the distorted images of the attack as viewed through the jerky , hand-held video camera and night-vision lighting , provide some distancing and a sense that no thrills or pleasure can be taken in the sexual assault . A lack of focus on , for instance , the nudity of the victim removes any erotic charge from the scene and leaves only what the director intended a feeling of horror and revulsion within what is the pivotal moment in the film . Consequently , the sexual violence here was felt to meet the requirements of discretion and brevity to allow it to be passed at 15 . <p> There are several moments of strong violence in the film ( the shooting of the pregnant woman at the check point , the blowing up of the American soldier by a mine , the mixture of reality and dramatised footage of dead bodies at the works conclusion ) and although these sequences contain some injury detail they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violence may be strong but may not dwell on the infliction of pain or injury . There would also be some expectation of the strength of such violence in a film that deals frankly with the horrors of war . <p> However , the sequence in which the audience sees an American soldier being beheaded and then the severed head being held up to the camera did test the Guidelines restrictions on the portrayal of the infliction of pain or injury and the strongest gory images . <p> The horror within this sequence is signposted to the audience in an earlier long-distance and relatively detail-free shot of the soldiers body laid out on a piece of ground with the head propped on the chest . The actual beheading also lacks detail as the process of the knife being used takes place below the edge of the frame , and although some blood is seen flowing onto the ground , there is no gratuitous dwelling on the violence . The sight of the severed head is gory and gruesome , but clearly not intended to be shocking for its own sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those involved in such a conflict . There is also some distancing of its impact with the graininess of the webcam images as seen on a computer screen . <p> This scene , along with the rape , was carefully considered in terms of their detail within the context of the films themes and whether they were appropriate for older teenagers . The idea of beheadings would not be novel to most 15 year olds who would be aware of such horrors taking place in modern war settings through the news , and the discretion with which it is shown here quite properly emphasises the brutality without wallowing in it in a manner that would tend to suggest the adult 18 category . Given the borderline nature of these scenes the issues were considered by a wider number of the examining group than usual before the decision was made to pass the work at 15 . <p> The BBFCinsight provided for the work stated that it contained a scene of rape , strong violence and very strong language . A subsequent classification of the work when submitted for a DVD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the strength of the issues presented a significant harm risk in the home-viewing environment . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

The film , like many Russian silents of the time , was clearly , carefully and powerfully designed as pro-Bolshevik propaganda . <p> The film was rejected when first submitted to the BBFC in September 1926 , on the grounds that films should not address issues of ' political controversy ' and that Potemkin 's pro-Revolutionary message was therefore unacceptable for classification .

No doubt at the back of the BBFC 's mind was the nine day British general strike in May 1926 which had provoked fears amongst some quarters of society of a potential revolution in the UK .

Ever since The Great Train Robbery ( 1903 ) , widely acknowledged as the first narrative film , violence on screen has been an issue that has sparked argument and debate ( audience members reportedly ran terrified from the cinema when the villain pointed his gun directly at the camera ) . <p> As the moving image became the most dominant art form of the 20th century so concerns started to grow about the effects of violence on the audience , in particular on the younger audience , and about the increasing levels of violence on screen . As public attitudes about violence have shifted , so the BBFC has had to change to reflect those shifts . <p> Violence has been a part of children 's entertainment since the very first stories were told and has been a staple element of cartoons such as Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry . The challenge for the BBFC is to determine whether the violence in any given work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole is aimed . To do this the BBFC takes into account a number of factors : <p> What is the overall attitude of the film towards violence ? <p> What is the dramatic context of the violence ? <p> Is the violence perpetrated by the hero or villain ? <p> Are there consequences or rewards for the violence ? <p> How is the violence treated ? <p> Is there undue emphasis on weapons ? <p> Is it prolonged ? <p> Are there frequent close-ups ? <p> Is it stylised eg slow motion , soundtrack , editing , and do these techniques accentuate the images or restrain their impact ? <p> We must also consider potential effects such as desensitisation or fear , as well as the more obvious concerns about encouraging violent behaviour .

There was also concern about the violence being potentially encouraged by such a charismatic actor , at the height of his ( posthumous ) fame and popularity . <p> On 14 August , an extensive cuts list was drawn up . Cuts were required to almost every reel and covered every aspect of the violent action in the film . However , in the end , only five separate edits were confirmed . In one or two cases these were requests for reductions to the action rather than an outright deletion of the scene . These cuts included crotch kicks and neck breaks during fight scenes , and a sequence in which glass bottles are smashed and wielded as weapons . With these cuts made , Enter The Dragon was classified X on 23 October 1973 . <p> Nevertheless , the decision attracted criticism from both sides . Some members of the public felt the film was still too violent and voiced fears that it was dangerous and could encourage people to try kung-fu for criminal purposes . For example , a cinema exhibitor from Bridgend secured a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scene in the film in which two police officers are beaten up and their car stolen could promote attacks on UK policemen . He urged the BBFC to remove the incident from Enter The Dragon and followed up his meeting with a series of letters . In a terse reply , Stephen Murphy responded to the one of the exhibitors letters : " I can find no evidence that would support the point you are making " . <p> Fans , particularly young ones , of both the genre and Bruce Lee angrily protested the films X certificate and the cuts imposed by the BBFC . One fourteen year old , who had recently taken up kung-fu , wrote directly to the Board asking for permission to see Enter The Dragon in his local cinema . <p> This polite teenager was not alone : following the films release in 1974 , there are letters on file from members of the public reporting seeing children as young as 12 in screenings of the film . <p> The success of Enter The Dragon , and the kung-fu genre in general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of chainsticks ( or nunchaku ) and other martial arts weaponry among London youths . Media coverage of the issue caught the eye of Murphys successor as BBFC Secretary , James Ferman . In December 1979 , Ferman recalled Enter The Dragon for another look in the light of these anxieties . Ferman asked the films distributor to remove sight of chainsticks in the fight sequence between Bruce Lee and his attackers . The images of chainsticks were also requested to be removed from the films trailer and its promotional posters . <p> The removal of chainsticks , as well as other martial arts weaponry such as throwing stars and flails , soon became standard BBFC practice with the advent of VHS bringing violent kung-fu films into the home in the early 1980s . When Enter The Dragon was classified for VHS in 1988 , a kindlier view of the films violence was taken . The original five cuts were reduced to two ; however , sight of the chainsticks remained cut . <p> Throughout the 1990s , specific public concerns about chainsticks declined , while fears about more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modification to the BBFCs blanket ban of martial arts weaponry in 1991 , when Enter The Dragon was resubmitted for video classification in 1993 and in 1996 , cuts to sight of chainsticks in action were maintained . <p> In order for its policies to remain relevant and in tune with public feeling , the BBFC regularly reviews and adjusts them accordingly when issuing a new set of Guidelines . In 1999 , the previous firm distinction between martial arts and other weapons was abandoned in favour of a more context-based , proportionate approach . Nevertheless , depictions of offensive weapons continue to be liable to cuts if they are considered likely to encourage violent behaviour in the real world . <p> Enter The Dragon was classified at 18 for video in 2001 , with all previous cuts ( both to violence and weapons ) fully restored . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969 
@@34540606 @3540606/ <h> This Is England 201963 @qwx401963 <p> This is England was awarded an 18 certificate in 2007 for very strong racist violence . The film also contains some aggressive uses of very strong language . The use of the word ' c**t ' was exacerbated by its combination with the highly offensive racist terms w*g , ' P**i ' , ' n****r ' and ' c**n ' . <p> The question of whether the work could be contained at the 15 category was carefully considered , given the potential appeal and relevance to a younger audience . A number of scenes and elements placed the work on the 15/18 borderline : <p> The scene in which Combo verbally and physically threatens an Asian shop keeper whose shop he and his gang have just robbed and defiled . He calls the shop keeper a ' Paki c**t ' and violently swings a machete into the shop keepers face deliberately scaring him . The threat is palpable and realistic , even though no blood is shed <p> The representation of racist ideology as attractive to the child character Shaun , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of racist views upon this <p> Sight of Combo threatening some children , racially abusing them and stroking a serrated knife along their cheeks . <p> Arguably the strongest scene was towards the end of the film when a vulnerable character , Milky , is subjected to a brutal and realistic racist attack . <p> The attack shows Shauns idol , Combo , start to punch and pummel his mixed race friend Milkys face , kicking and stamping on it . Some of this is shown from Milky 's perspective and has a particularly visceral edge , despite the lack of blood or gory detail . It is realistic , intense and shocking with sudden tension as the scene changes from a drinking and smoking session to a verbal diatribe and possibly lethal beating . <p> If each individual component of the scene was considered in isolation it is possible to mount an argument for rating them 15 because of the lack of bloody detail , the impressionistic nature of some of the kicks or punches , and the lack of dwelling on pain or injury . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effect of a work on a viewer must be taken into account . The scene , taken as a whole , has a strong , visceral impact on the viewer , and is likely to confound public and parental expectations at 15 , given its mixture of strong , realistic , brutal and unexpected violence and racial abuse , all witnessed by a distraught child . <p> The key factors which therefore placed This is England at 18 , rather than 15 are : <p> The violence is directed against a vulnerable character Milky is easily the most gentle of all the characters , vulnerable throughout because of his race and lulled into a false sense of security in the scene leading up to the attack <p> The violence and language are unexpected and shocking the scene starts very calmly ; the other characters do n't realise what 's about to happen <p> The scene is distressing we see most of the film through Shaun 's eyes and he is especially upset and confused by what is happening <p> Repeated aggressive use of the word ' c**t ' along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBFC Guidelines showed the public support for restricting the strongest language , when it is aggressive , to the highest category . BBFC Guidelines at the time the film was classified stated that the strongest terms ( eg ' cunt ' ) will be acceptable only where justified by the context . Continued aggressive use of the strongest language is unlikely to be acceptable . <p> In the BBFCs 2005 Guidelines research there was extensive discussion of very strong language , and the factors which the public felt made that language inappropriate in works available to children . The combination of very strong language and violence was regarded as particularly worrying . Veronica Guerin was another example of this concern . The film was rated 18 because it includes a scene where a drug baron beats an unarmed female reporter whilst calling her a c**t . <p> As with all works there was discussion over the classification of This is England and a variety of opinions were taken into account . The work was seen several times , and in the end by most of the BBFCs examiners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments for passing the film 15 were carefully considered , including the appeal of the film for a younger audience , but the clear arguments for 18 were stronger . <p> Director Shane Meadows spoke publicly about his disappointment that the film was restricted to an adult audience as he felt it had strong messages and appeal for a younger audience . Some local authoritiesoverruled the BBFC certificate granting the film a 15 , in particular the local authority where the young lead actor in the film grew up . <p> Other films that star actors who were too young to watch the work in the cinema include The Exorcist , The Sixth Sense andSweet Sixteen . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540724 @3540724/ <h> War of the Worlds : Controversy and the 12A <p> The classification awarded to a film by the BBFC can have an impact on success at the UK box office , a factor well known to distributors and filmmakers . Many of last summers blockbuster movies were marketed specifically at the lucrative 12A audience , including eagerly awaited prequels Batman Begins and Star Wars Episode 3 The Revenge of the Sith and futuristic thriller The Island . <p> There were some notable exceptions , such as the PG rated The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy , which contained mild language and moderate fantasy horror , and superhero adventure , The Fantastic Four . <p> Of those works which arrived at the BBFC with a 12A request , none was more controversial than Stephen Spielbergs big budget adaptation of H.G.Wells novel , War Of The Worlds , which has prompted over 60 letters from the public to date , many newspaper column inches and a question raised in parliament . <p> The sci-fi adventure starred Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning as a father and daughter trying to escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PG-13 from the American ratings organisation , the MPAA , ( the Motion Picture Association of America ) , and the distributor was keen to receive the near-equivalent advisory category - 12A - in the UK . <p> It was viewed here by a team of examiners as well as BBFC Director , David Cooke . Though some felt it was a high end 12A because of sustained scenes of menace , threat and moderate horror , after due consideration it was awarded a 12A - on the understanding that these issues would be mentioned in robust Consumer Advice ( now known as BBFCinsight ) . <p> Factors cited by examiners in support of the 12A included the ' clearly fantasy ' nature of the plot , the reassuring ending and the lack of detail in the violent scenes . They also noted that some high profile end of the world and disaster films have been passed out at 12 and 12A , examples including Titanic , The Perfect Storm , Armageddon , Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow . Similarly , child characters have featured in dangerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Others and the most recent Harry Potter outing , The Goblet of Fire . <p> Nevertheless some members of the public , ( including parents who took children to see it and younger viewers who went without accompaniment ) , wrote to the BBFC to air concerns about the decision . Many said they thought it was wrongly placed at a category which technically allows very young children to view it . In response the Board explained that no-one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult , and that responsibility for allowing under-12s to view lies firmly with that adult . The category was formulated following public consultation in which many parents expressed a desire to make their own decisions regarding their childrens viewing . <p> Examiners responding to the letters also pointed out that the strongest issues were raised in the Consumer Advice , displayed on posters for the films , online and on newspaper listings . This advice is available for all films and provides clear , concise information on the works defining classification issues . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion appeared in the national press ranging from strong defences of the BBFCs decision , to outraged disbelief from those convinced the film was far too strong for younger viewers . Some columnists even campaigned for individual examiners responsible for the decision to be named and shamed and a question , to that effect , was asked in Parliament . <p> Like the BBFCs own official statement , the response of the Department for Culture , Media and Sport noted that although the Board is committed to open decision making , the anonymity of examiners is something it has the right to roundly defend . This is because all decisions made are group ones , based on published guidelines and approved by members of the directorial tier including Director David Cooke , whose name appears on the BBFC certificate that is seen prior to the theatrical screening of every film in the UK. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540758 @3540758/ <h> Henry - Portrait Of A Serial Killer 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Although it was made in 1986 , John McNaughton 's Henry - Portrait Of A Serial Killer was shelved by its own US distributor until 1989 . When the film finally emerged , it was screened without a certificate at the National Film Theatre and the Scala Cinema in London , both of whom had special permission from their respective local authorities ( Southwark and Camden ) to exhibit unclassified films . The film had been seen unofficially at those two venues by a number of BBFC staff , including the Board 's Director , James Ferman , and it was already apparent to the film 's UK distributor that the film would present difficulties for the BBFC . Perhaps as a result of that , when the film was formally submitted for classification in 1991 , one shot had already been removed from the film , namely a shot of a topless and blood-streaked female corpse , sitting on a toilet with a broken bottle embedded in her face . <p> The film was first viewed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 January 1991 . The three examiners who saw the film felt one scene in particular posed potential difficulties . This was the scene in which Henry and Otis watch a video recording of themselves killing a family , including Otis sexually assaulting the mother , both before and after her death . Given the difficulties involved in cutting the scene effectively , as well as the violent and bleak nature of the film as a whole , a further screening took place on 25 January . Four examiners attended this second screening , with two examiners arguing for cuts and two examiners making a case for 18 without cuts . However , James Ferman was clear that cuts were required , in particular to reduce the sexualisation of the female victim , by removing shots showing the killer 's hand moving to her pubic area and by reducing to a minimum the exposure and mauling of her breasts , both before and after she is killed . <p> On 12 February , an editor working for the film 's distributor visited the BBFC 's premises and worked with James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The cut scene was then projected for examiners in the BBFC 's cinema , with all those present feeling that the cuts made were insufficient . As a result , two further small cuts were made and the cut version of the scene was sent back to the distributor . The whole film was viewed again , this time in the cut version , on 21 February , with examiners concluding that no further cuts should be required . <p> The next screening took place on 27 February , when the BBFC 's President and Vice Presidents were invited to view the cut version of the film . James Ferman made the following remarks on file about that screening " General agreement that film was disturbing but not exploitative in this cut form . No firm view that further cuts were needed , but a request that the Board seek expert advice from **27;0;TOOLONG familiar with the mindset of serial killers in order to ensure that the film was not likely to influence the vulnerable in dangerous directions " . In accordance with this request , the cut version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with one psychiatrist and two psychologists in attendance . The experts agreed that the film was disturbing but also surprisingly accurate and therefore interesting . The conclusion was that the cut version of the film could be passed for cinema release , but that any subsequent video release , where scenes could be played and replayed out of context , was more likely to be a problem . The film was classified 18 for cinema release on 24 April 1991 . In total , the BBFC had cut 24 seconds of material and the distributor had pre-cut 38 seconds before submission . However , the BBFC made it known that a video certificate was unlikely to be forthcoming . <p> Given James Ferman 's publicly stated reluctance to classify the film at all for video release , which he had also conveyed informally to the film 's distributor , it was some time before the film arrived at the BBFC for classification on video . <p> Nonetheless , by May 1992 , the distributor was pushing hard for a video classification and wrote to Ferman stating that the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EEC , as well as in Switzerland and the Scandinavian counties , without any apparent i 'll effects , negative reaction , or censorship problems . <p> The distributor stressed that the film would be marketed as a ' quality movie ' , rather than as exploitation , and that they would be prepared to implement further cuts in order to obtain a video certificate . Accordingly , the film was officially submitted for video release in June 1992 , in the cut UK cinema version , and was viewed by BBFC examiners during June and July . A mixture of views were expressed , with some examiners arguing the cut cinema version should be passed on video without further cuts , whilst other examiners argued further cuts should be made , particularly in the ' family murder ' scene that had already been reduced for cinema release . <p> During the summer months , the film was seen by the BBFC 's Presidents and by other examiners , with a majority view emerging that the video might have a negative effect on " vulnerable or susceptible adults who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferman in particular was concerned by the opinions from the forensic consultants who had seen the film in 1991 and who had urged caution about a video release . <p> What happened next was one of the most controversial decisions of James Ferman 's time at the BBFC . Ferman was aware that the scene needed further reductions for video . However , he was also aware there was only so much footage that could be removed without damaging a crucial scene and rendering it meaningless . Mindful that the difficulty with the scene was that it might arouse damaged or vulnerable viewers , he decided that an acceptable alternative would be to ' interrupt ' the flow of scene by inserting a shot of Henry and Otis watching the video into the middle of the sequence . Although this certainly helped to interrupt the flow for any vulnerable viewers who might be viewing the scene out of context , it also altered the meaning of the scene in a crucial way . In the original version , although the viewer is aware they are watching a video tape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otis watching a video tape , as opposed to witnessing ' live ' footage of their murders , until the end of the scene . By interfering with the structure of the scene in question , Ferman had also interfered with the meaning of the sequence and the questions it deliberately raised for the audience , regarding voyeurism and their own complicity . It also changed the carefully controlled look of the scene , with its single static video image . Nonetheless , the distributor was becoming desperate for a version of the film they could release on video and they therefore acceded to Ferman 's request . In addition to the ' interruption ' of the family murder scene , Ferman also removed some extra seconds from that scene ( notably sight of the woman 's legs struggling ) , as well as making an additional cut to a sadistic stabbing during another scene in which a TV warehouse man is killed by Henry . In total , the version of Henry - Portrait Of A Serial Killer that was finally classified for video release in January 1993 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributor 's pre-cuts , the BBFC 's cinema cuts , and the BBFC 's additional cuts for video . <p> Ferman 's re-editing of the film aroused a great deal of hostility and ridicule from film critics and academics . Several commentators argued that the BBFC had no right to re-edit other people 's work in such a way as to change their fundamental meaning and that Ferman was behaving in the manner of a Golden Era Hollywood studio executive . Although much of this criticism was overstated , since it was hardly the first time the BBFC had altered the flow or meaning of a scene , whether intentionally or otherwise , it came as no surprise that this contentious decision was overturned by Ferman 's successor , Robin Duval , when the film was resubmitted for DVD release in 2000 . Examiners who saw the film in 2000 were divided between those who argued Henry should be passed at 18 uncut and those who felt cuts should be maintained , albeit far more limited cuts than those implemented in 1991-1992 . In the end , it was agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse man could be waived , that the number of cuts required to the family murder scene could be reduced , and that Ferman 's re-editing of that scene should be undone . However , the Board 's Director and Presidents decided to uphold a limited number of the other cuts . <p> Firstly , they decided the scene that had been pre-cut by the film 's own distributor , for both cinema and video release , could only be partially reinstated . Whereas the entire scene had been removed on previous submissions to the BBFC , on this occasion it was decided that initial sight of the woman 's dead body slumped on the toilet could remain , cutting away only as the camera began to slowly zoom into her bloody breasts and face . This was considered to be unacceptably eroticised and gratuitous . Secondly , they decided that the mauling of the woman 's breast in the family murder scene was still unacceptably eroticised and comparable to material that had recently been cut from other video works . In accordance with prevailing BBFC policies , 48 seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release , whilst one minute and three seconds of previous cuts were reinstated . <p> Then , in 2003 , the BBFC was presented with a proposed cinema re-release for the film . Given that cuts had been required for DVD release only two years previously , it initially seemed unlikely that the Board would be willing to take a significantly different view of the film so soon after its recent decision . In particular , the specific tests of the Board 's sexual violence policy had not changed . However , what had changed was that the BBFC had classified a handful of far more brutal , graphic and shocking scenes of sexual violence since it had last considered Henry , notably those in Baise-Moi , Irreversible , and the belated DVD release of Straw Dogs . Given what had been permitted in those films , as well as the evidence the BBFC had gleaned from a recent survey of public attitudes into sexual violence , it seemed increasingly inconsistent to require cuts to Henry - Portrait Of A Serial Killer . The predominant effect of the scenes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any erotic elements were minimal and almost incidental , and the scenes served an important narrative and thematic significance within what was a carefully constructed and acclaimed feature . Examiners also noted that the cuts made in 2001 seemed relatively arbitrary in that it could easily be argued that some of the material the Board had reinstated was stronger than the material that had been cut . With regard to the initial concerns that the film might have a negative effect on disturbed individuals , it was conceded that the Board can not base its decisions at the adult level on the possible reactions of the most disturbed and unpredictable viewers , as this was a disproportionate form of intervention under the Human Rights Act . Therefore , it was concluded that Henry - Portrait Of A Serial Killer could finally be passed 18 uncut for cinema release on 20 February 2003 . Shortly afterwards , the film was resubmitted for DVD release and the DVD version was also passed 18 uncut . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540785 @3540785/ <h> The Woman In Black 201963 @qwx401963 <p> The Woman In Black is a film version of the 1983 ghost story by Susan Hill , written in the style of a traditional gothic novel . Set in late Victorian/early Edwardian times , it follows a young lawyer who travels to a remote rural village , where he discovers a vengeful ghost responsible for the deaths of local children . <p> The first version of the British made film was submitted for classification to the BBFC for an advice viewing in 2011 , with a 12A category request . Then the finalised version of the film was submitted in early 2012 , also with a 12A category request ; this was seen by a group of BBFC Examiners , plus the BBFC Director . <p> The BBFC considered the film to be on the border between the 12A and 15 categories , because of the number of scenes of supernatural horror and threat in which the ghost of the ' woman in black ' , plus the ghosts of her victims , appear to and threaten the central character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBFC before a decision on the final category for the film could be made . <p> The BBFC considered that the theme of the film was a relatively known quantity : the best-selling book was adapted for the stage in 1987 and has played continuously in the West End of London , and was broadcast as a TV drama in 1989 . The book also appears on the national curriculum , and schools therefore frequently take pupils to see the stage version . If the film had been rated 15 , some might have argued it unfair for the BBFC to prevent 12 to 14 year olds experiencing an adaptation of such a well known story especially as the film relies on atmosphere and a traditional ghost story format and ' frights ' , rather than on graphic or explicit imagery . <p> The BBFC also took into account how the period setting of the story provides a degree of separation between the film and contemporary reality , and is in the tradition of classic ghost stories such as those of M.R. James . This said , arguments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general mood and tone of the film is quite bleak , and the premise of a ghost manipulating children into harming or killing themselves makes this a potentially disturbing feature for young children . Moreover , the BBFC was also aware that as Daniel Radcliffe was starring in The Woman In Black ( one of his first major film roles since finishing the Harry Potter series ) , the film might attract a younger audience , that may not usually choose to watch a scary film . <p> The BBFC Guidelines at the time for 12A/12 stated that ' Moderate physical and psychological threat may be permitted , providing disturbing sequences are not frequent or sustained ' . Although there is a degree of intensity to the scenes involving the ghosts , it slowly increases in the first 40 minutes and is then broken up at intervals by other scenes and stories , with a number of quieter periods in between the more frightening sequences . Suspense also builds about how the narrative will resolve , which in some ways resembles a detective story . There is strong contextual justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that these are clearly set within a supernatural storyline and an unrealistic setting . The characters are possessed by the ghost of the woman in black , and admit this when they revisit living characters as ghosts . <p> However , the film also includes some notably stronger scenes : in one , the ghost of the ' woman in black ' appears to hang herself from a noose , and in another a young girl deliberately smashes an oil lamp and sets herself on fire . <p> After careful consideration , the BBFC decided that reductions to these particular scenes would be required in order to achieve the requested 12A classification , along with some other smaller changes throughout the film . A 15 rating with no cuts was available to the distributors , however they elected to cut The Woman In Black to achieve a 12A . In total they removed six seconds of stronger horror from the film . They also darkened certain shots and reduced some sound effects , to lessen the impact of some of the scarier jump moments . With these changes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the scary moments thrilling rather than upsetting or disturbing . <p> The theatrical version of The Woman In Black was passed 12A in January 2012 , with the BBFCinsight ' Contains intense supernatural threat and horror ' . Longer BBFCinsight , published on the BBFC website for all films , details the horror storyline and the strongest moments in the film . <p> A 12A classification means that the BBFC regards the film as suitable for persons aged 12-14 , although parents may decide to take younger children at their own discretion . The BBFC recognises , and states clearly in the Guidelines , that viewers under 12 may find a 12A film too intense , and that parents should consult BBFCinsight before taking younger children to see a 12A film . <p> Following its release , the BBFC received 134 letters of complaint from cinema-goers , who felt the film was too dark and unsettling for 12A . As the BBFC routinely take the most challenging films to consultation ( as happened with The Dark Knight ) , The Woman In Black was included in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

This was passed at 15 , with the accompanying BBFCinsight changed to read Contains strong supernatural threat and horror . <p> The film was screened as part of the BFI Gothic film festival in 2013 ( August 2103 to January 2014 ) , and included presentations to secondary school pupils by the BBFC Education team on the classification of the film . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

Please note that works can sometimes be sent to us only a few days before release so details may only appear on our website shortly before a film is released in either the cinema or a DVD in the shops . <p> Rarely , films and DVDs are not classified by us . This sometimes applies to cinema films that feature in film festivals or similar events .

Please see the next question for further details . <p> What does the E symbol mean , and is it an official category ? <p> The E symbol on video packaging indicates that the distributor believes the work to be exempt from a BBFC age rating . Under the Video Recordings Act 1984 , a video is an exempted work if it is designed to inform , educate or instruct or is concerned with sport , religion or music . However , if such a work depicts certain content , for example human sexual activity or gross violence to any significant extent it will need a BBFC age rating . <p> The E symbol is not an official symbol and does not have any legal standing . Nor is it a requirement that it should appear on video cassettes , unlike the BBFC age rating symbols . <p> The BBFC does not examine exempted works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempt . <p> Are films that are downloaded from the internet rated by the BBFC ? <p> Many are . Although streaming and downloading of films is not yet regulated by law , working with the major video distributors and platforms , we have developed a scheme for platforms offering downloads and streaming video to use BBFC age ratings and BBFCinsight . This is designed to help you make informed decisions about what you and your family watch . <p> I 'm worried about my child downloading non-certificated works - do you have any tips to help me ? <p> You 'll find some top tips and information for ensuring cyber safety at home , and details of how to report anything you find that looks suspicious , at The Industry Trust 's website . You can also visit the Childnet UK website for more advice . <p> Why are there trailers for 15 and 18 films before childrens films ? <p> Trailers are age rated as an individual title in its own right . Often we rate a trailer months before the film it 's advertising has arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been finished . Examiners note the different issues ( for example , sex , violence , language ) and the theme and tone of the trailer before making a recommendation . <p> Age rating decisions may be more restrictive with regard to trailers and advertisements . This is because difficult content in such short works may have a greater impact on an unprepared audience . <p> A film trailer or advertisement can be shown alongside a feature film as long as it has not been rated higher than the age rating given to that feature . This is still the case if the film trailer is for a feature which has received a rating higher than the film it is being shown alongside . <p> If you believe a trailer has been wrongly shown before a cinema feature , please contact the cinema manager . <p> My child is 16 , how can he/she prove they are old enough to go to see a ' 15 ' ? <p> Please contact the individual cinema who will be able to advise you on their admission policy . <p> What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVDs ? <p> The BBFC is committed to a policy of equality . So scenes and sex references are afforded the same treatment whatever the sexual orientation of those taking part . So whether sex involves heterosexual or homosexual individuals , the same age rating standards are applied . <p> Who signs the black card I see displayed before a film is shown at the cinema ? <p> The BBFC Chief Executive and the BBFC President 's signatures are seen on the certificate which is projected before a film . This is an official document and each card is unique , carrying the film 's registration number and the age rating it has been given . <p> How can I tell if a film has been cut ? <p> Films are often rated several times by the BBFC in different versions - 2D , 3D , IMAX etc . Older films may have also been rated many times over the years . <p> A search for a title on the BBFC website will return a page that gives an overview of the film and it 's current classification . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the BBFC are collated under " Related works " . As cuts will often only apply to a specific release of a title , the details of any cuts are available for each decision under " Related works " . <p> However , where a film is known to have at least one decision with cuts information , the summary page will display the following text at the top of the page . <p> CUT VERSIONS One or more versions of this work have been cut . Cuts are detailed for each respective version found under " Related works " . <p> Does the BBFC age rate video games ? <p> From 30 July 2012 , and with a few exceptions , the responsibility for age rating video games falls to the Video Standards Council ( VSC ) , applying the PEGI system . The BBFC will continue to age rate all games featuring strong pornographic ( R18-level ) content and ancillary games attached to a wider , primarily linear submission . <p> The BBFC will also continue to age rate all non-game linear content on a game disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible for age rating by the BBFC are considered under the same Guidelines as films or DVDs . <p> A BBFC film summary sounds similar to marketing I 've seen for the film , who writes these ? <p> Film summaries or synopses are provided alongside art work and trailers by MyMovies and do not represent the views of the BBFC . These film summaries are used to ensure BBFC film summaries do not reveal additional information not included in the wider marketing of the film . Where the BBFC might need to include spoilers , for example as part of the BBFCinsight for a film , this is clearly marked with ' The following text may contain spoilers ' . <p> Why does short BBFCinsight , used on the BBFC black card , DVD/Blu-ray packaging , film posters and the BBFC website and app , no longer use the word ' Contains ' ? <p> We reviewed BBFCinsight as part of the Guidelines Consultation carried out during 2013 . Short BBFCinsight is helpful to parents , but has a limited number of characters . To allow us to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains ' . <p> How can a performance awarded a 12A As Live certificate , later be classified at a higher category for further screenings at the cinema or for DVD/Blu-ray ? <p> ' As Live ' events include content other than traditional cinema films such as stage or sporting events which are projected in cinemas . The As Live certificate is a temporary certificate for content we have n't examined and is valid for 7 days after the live performance only . The As Live rating is awarded based upon information provided by the company organising the event , including details of any restrictions applying to children attending the live event , ie children under x years not admitted . If a recording of the same performance is then submitted for classification , it may receive a higher or lower classification when it is examined . <p> Why do you show BBFCinsight on the black card before a film begins when it can sometimes contain spoilers ? <p> Ever since we began offering BBFCinsight , we have sought to achieve a balance between giving consumers the information they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoilers . By and large , we have achieved this . However , the issue of spoilers has arisen on occasion since 2013 when we began publishing short form BBFCinsight on the black card immediately prior to the screening of a film . Before that , it was n't really a problem . Even now , it is only rarely that people seem to be unhappy with BBFCinsight being published on black cards immediately prior to a film . <p> We have some sympathy with these complaints and we have successfully tested a method for addressing them in a pragmatic way , without compromising the need to inform the public about a films content . Following our six month trial , we will continue to implement a new policy for short form BBFCinsight , whereby we make a judgement as to whether short form BBFCinsight really does have to include a potential plot spoiler and if it must , consider whether it can be withheld from the black card immediately prior to the film . The short BBFCinsight will remain available on the BBFC website and app . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the regulation of pornography available online ? WARNING some of the issues discussed here may not be suitable for website visitors under the age of 18 . <p> On 1 December 2014 , the Communications Act 2003 was amended . The regulation of R18 pornographic content available on demand in the UK will henceforth be subject to the same standards as those applied to pornography on DVD by the British Board of Film Classification . <p> The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 amended the Communications Act 2003 setting out statutory obligations for media distributors of on-demand content . These changes are designed to bring online services that provide R18 works into line with standards set for DVDs/videos under the Video Recordings Act 1984 , and to ensure that such material is made available in a manner which means people under the age of 18 will not normally see or hear it . The R18 category is a special and legally-restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex , or strong fetish material involving adults . <p> While some non-pornographic films may contain material which raises issues comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which may also be subject to cuts - such as scenes of sexual violence - there is no direct cross over between the standards for sex works and those applied to non-pornographic films.Underpinning the BBFC Guidelines is a specific requirement of the Video Recordings Act to have special regard to any harm that may be caused to potential viewers , or , through their behaviour , to society . This means that , before classifying a work , the BBFC may cut certain acts in pornographic works where imitation or the influencing of attitudes is a particular concern . Breath restriction is one such example . It would be wrong to assume that the BBFC consequently cuts all sight of people sitting across other peoples faces . But the BBFC will cut sight of clear and deliberate restriction of a persons ability to breathe during sexual play . Breath restriction for the purposes of sexual enjoyment can result in death . Given such a clear and well documented risk of harm , passing such breath play in a sex work would be contrary to the BBFCs designated responsibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK law . This includes prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 . Indeed , the BBFCs designation under the Video Recordings Act requires that it not pass any content in breach of UK law . We regularly consult both the Crown Prosecution Service and the Metropolitan Police to understand and keep up to date with the types of content which are subject to prosecution and conviction . Consequently , we may not classify any material which may be subject to prosecution . Among other activities , this includes any repeated focus on urination during sex and urination over any other person , including any act which can not be distinguished from urination on the basis of the onscreen evidence alone . <p> It has recently been suggested that the introduction of the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations will lead to several acts now being banned from UK on-demand services , including spanking and verbal abuse . Much of this information is inaccurate , some of it is wrong . In judging material which may or may not be allowed under BBFC Guidelines it is often unhelpful to speak hypothetically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given situation are among the considerations which really matter . The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations will ensure that UK on-demand content is consistent with legally available pornography off-line , benefiting from the application of UK law and the expert legal and medical advice which informs BBFC decisions . <h> Schools and Education <p> There 's loads of information for schools , students and those interested in media studies and film history in our Education section . <p> I run my school PTA and would like an examiner to give a talk about the BBFC , is that possible ? <p> Yes . We frequently give talks to adult groups explaining how we age rate films and what resources are available to parents , teachers and other carers . Talks are illustrated with clips from films and can be tailored to specific topics to suit your wishes , for example issues in children 's films or violence in movies . Please contact us for more details . <p> Can a school show DVDs of a particular category to children below that age ? <p> The age rating decision indicates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children younger than the age specified . Many schools have their own policies about what age rated materials teachers are allowed to show in class . <p> However , there are some cases where a school might plan to show the DVD or Blu-ray of a film in a specific educational context where it is properly discussed , presented and mediated by a teaching professional . For example , some AS and A2 Media or Film Studies exam syllabuses include 18 rated films . <p> We recommend that teachers seek parental consent before showing such material prior to showing it , obtain approval of the Head Teacher and Governors and monitor the reactions of pupils to ensure they are able to understand the material in this particular context . <p> Can school libraries lend ' 18 ' DVDs to students studying the text but who are underage ? <p> The Video Recordings Act ( VRA ) defines the supply of DVDs as supply in any manner , whether or not for reward , and therefore , includes supply by way of sale , letting on hire , exchange or loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video works in a library is covered by the Act . There is no concession to educational communities such as schools . <p> Can I interview an Examineror Compliance Officer for my **26;29;TOOLONG ? <p> Whenever possible we will attempt to accommodate requests for interviews with Examiners and Compliance Officers . We ask that you use our website first to make sure the information you seek is n't already available , for example in our podcasts , case studies or education section . We also ask that you have a clear list of questions in advance . <p> Examiners and Compliance Officers can usually do interviews by email . Occasionally it is possible to record or film an interview , again we ask you to come fully prepared and to recognise that BBFC staff are professionals with a job to do and that the BBFC offices are a place of work . It is important to make sure you are punctual and prepared , your technical equipment is ready to use and that you have your questions formulated . <p> Please submit questions before the interview to allow time to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about the process and history of age ratings . Occasionally students send their essay questions to us . The BBFC will not write assignments for students . To request an interview please contact us . <p> The BBFC website has an education section designed and maintained by its education team . You 'll find guides for students and teachers , Case Studies on famous films , news articles and other materials.We have a dedicated website for younger children , CBBFC . <p> Can I research BBFC film files ? <p> Yes . The BBFC has over 60,000 historic records of classification decisions made since 1 January 1913 . Early films are noted in Film Registers and paper files date from around the late 1950s onwards . We make files for works over twenty years old available for research purposes . <p> If you would like to view any of the BBFCs records you can apply to do so here . Please include a list of the film titles you would like to research and their release dates . <h> Questions about Examiners <p> How can I become an Examiner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide variety of backgrounds . They tend to be graduates but this is not always the case . No specific qualifications are required , however experience in relevant areas such as media regulation , law and child development is important . A broad knowledge of film is required , as well as an ability to grasp age rating issues such as violence , imitable behaviour , sexual portrayal and drugs . <p> The current team includes academics , journalists , researchers , media and marketing professionals and several people who have worked in film and television . Like most BBFC employees , they have a strong knowledge of contemporary and historical film and a passion for the film and video industries . <p> Recruitment is through advertisement in the national press as well as our vacancies page . <p> What is it like being an Examiner or Compliance Officer ? <p> The job is a full-time post . We receive months of intensive in-house training before we start as proper examiners . Some examining duties are carried out by Compliance Officers , who also work on a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation of online video content , including data handling tasks . <p> What is a typical day like ? <p> Examiners and Compliance Officers view material and write reports and BBFCinsight for up to 7 hours a day , but there is not really a typical day as what we watch completely depends on what is submitted by distributors . Our work is allocated randomly so we could be viewing anything from the latest blockbuster to episodes of 1960s or 1970s TV series due for DVD release on an online platform . <p> Once we have finished watching the days viewing we will discuss the age rating , re-watch contentious moments , read up on similar works and write reports explaining how and why we made our age-rating recommendations . We will also write BBFCinsight , a concise line of information which gives the public a clear idea of the reason a work has received a particular rating . For cinema films BBFCinsight is also written with a longer explanation of the decision , and published on the BBFC website and on our free App , available for iPhone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own or in a big group ? <p> That depends on the material . Cinema films , video games , contentious works and some adult material is viewed in pairs - all other works are viewed alone . However , many works are viewed more than once internally , with additional teams or more senior members of staff viewing works before a decision is reached . For example some controversial material that requires a second viewing might be seen by three Examiners and representatives of senior management and the policy department . <p> Do Examiners andCompliance Officershave to agree on a decision about a film or video ? <p> Usually a team will agree on the age rating because we base all our age rating decisions on the BBFCs Guidelines , but if we do not , the work is sent to another team . If they still disagree , works are brought to the weekly meeting for further discussion or sent to the BBFCs Chief Executive or Presidential team . Really contentious works , like former ' Video Nasties ' , or cinema releases right on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will often be seen again even if the first team agrees a decision . <p> What is the worst material they have to watch ? <p> Individual staff members have things they find difficult to watch , and this can be affected by a huge number of variables such as what is happening in an someone 's personal life , or even what he or she has watched earlier that day or that week . Some of the strongest material we watch is what we call ' extreme reality ' products , which are works that show things like real life death , injury or torture . <p> Do they also have to classify pornography ? <p> Yes . Pornography accounts for less than 10 per cent of what Examiners and Compliance Officers watch , but it can be challenging , particularly when it is aggressive , violent or abusive . The BBFC is very strict with material that is in contravention of the law so we cut elements like references to underage and abusive sex ; depictions of abusive or illegal content such as material which is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do you classify films in all languages ? <p> The BBFC receives submissions in many different languages , from Afghan Pashtu to Yoruba . When a film or DVD is received in a language that is not spoken by one of the Examiners , we use outside interpreters to help us . However , because of the high number of submissions in certain languages , the BBFC attempts to maintain a reasonable level of linguistic skills in-house , mostly French , German and some Asian languages , such as Hindi , Urdu , Cantonese and Mandarin . <p> How do you classify Bollywood films ? <p> In the case of South Asian films ( which , in 2008 , constituted approximately 20 per cent of our film submissions ) , the BBFC tries to meet the specific sensibilities of South Asian audiences by ensuring that every Bollywood film age rated is seen by at least one member of staff with a thorough understanding of South Asian culture and cinema . This is to achieve , not merely language interpretation , but also to assess receptivity of the audiences the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compliance Officers are trained in the history and issues specific to South Asian cinema . <p> Do Examiners and Compliance Officers ever go to the cinema or watch DVDs in their own time ? <p> Yes ! Naturally there are days when employees at the BBFC who watch films all the time do not fancy it , but most people still love going to the cinema and watching DVDs . It is the best way of keeping up to date with recent decisions and audience responses to films . <h> Questions about the 12A rating <p> My enjoyment of a 12A film was spoiled by very young children in the cinema . Who should I complain to ? <p> Please contact the cinema itself . Cinema managers have the power to refuse entry to anyone whom they reasonably consider to be disruptive and we would strongly recommend that anyone whose enjoyment of a film is spoiled by noisy or disruptive young children should make their views known to cinema managers or staff . <p> Why are some films that were passed 12A in the cinema 15 on DVD ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content of the DVD extras , or because they contain additional footage , added to the film itself . Occasionally , if there is a specific harm risk , we will give a higher rating to a DVD because of the greater likelihood of underage viewing in the home . <p> Why is there no 15A rating like the 12A rating ? <p> The 12A certificate was introduced because there was a strong and widespread feeling amongst parents that some children under 12 were equipped to deal with films rated 12 . There is also research to show that at this age group mental and emotional development amongst children matures at varying rates . <p> After extensive public consultation and research the 12A was introduced to allow parents to assess whether a 12A film is suitable for their particular child . To help adults make this decision , we provide BBFCinsight for all films . <p> At present there has been little public feedback from parents in favour of a 15A rating . At the 15 rating film content is stronger in terms of : Strong violence ; frequent strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sex ; sexual nudity ; brief scenes of sexual violence or verbal references to sexual violence ; discriminatory language or behaviour ; and drug taking . These are all elements that parents tell us is not acceptable for children aged around 12 . <p> Research has found that at the 15 rating , parents are still concerned that children are at a vulnerable age and there were varying views about how adult a teenager is at 15 . There were also concerns about teenage violence in particular and a strong desire to protect this age group from glamorised knife crime . Taking this into account it is unlikely that parents would feel inclined to allow a 12 , 13 or 14 year old to see a 15 rated film . <p> Why does the BBFC let film distributors cut their films for a lower age rating when they could still show the film in cinemas at a higher rating ? <p> It has long been a BBFC guiding principle that works should be allowed to reach the widest appropriate audience . Producing films is very costly and companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximise their profit at the box office and cover their production and other costs . The lower and advisory age ratings of U , PG and 12A can attract a larger audience than the restrictive 15 and 18 age ratings , so sometimes a film distributor will want to achieve a lower age rating . However sometimes they want a higher age rating , for example some horror films prefer an 18 age rating to a 15 age rating , as it tells the audience about the strength of the content in the film . <p> Why does the BBFC offer an advice service ? Do other classification boards around the world do this ? <p> The BBFC has been providing age-rating advice to film makers and film distributors on how to achieve their preferred category for almost 100 years . Advice viewings and script readings have always been common , what has changed is that today we are more open about which films were advised on and what changes were advised . <p> Film classification bodies in other countries offer the same services to varying degrees , although not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can the BBFC refuse to suggest cuts to a film to achieve a lower age rating if it might impact on the audience enjoyment of the film ? <p> The BBFC Classification Guidelines are published on the website and most major film companies are very aware of the standards at 12A and 15 . If we were to refuse to offer advice on how to achieve a particular rating , there would be nothing to stop companies cutting their films themselves . There is clearly a risk that films would be pre-cut more than is actually necessary in the absence of expert advice . BBFC advice aims to suggest the minimum cuts necessary for the desired age rating and we aim to ensure the cuts advised are specific , targeted and interfere as little as possible with the narrative of the film . <p> Its important to understand that some films are already pre cut for a category in another country , such as a PG-13 in the USA , when they are submitted to the BBFC . International standards vary and the PG-13 and 12A standards are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film pre-cut for a PG-13 rated film . This sometimes creates more difficulty in retaining the narrative of the film . <p> Why are some films released uncut and at a higher rating in other countries , but then cut for a lower age rating in the UK ? <p> In some cases a film distributor is content to accept a higher age rating in one country than in another country and the standards at the various age ratings differ between countries . For example , nineteen PG-13 films were passed 15 in the UK in 2014 , rather than at 12A which is perceived as the UK equivalent of PG-13 . These films are : <p> Why are some films cut for a lower age rating at the cinema , then released uncut at a higher age rating on DVD ? Does this encourage under age viewing in the home ? <p> Sometimes a company chooses to release a different version of their film on DVD or sometimes they release two versions , one that is identical to the version shown in cinemas and another that is uncut or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the BBFC to interfere with distribution decisions . <p> The BBFC does not have enforcement role once a DVD is in the home , but under the terms of the Video Recording Act under which the BBFC age rates DVDs in the UK , we must be aware of the likelihood of underage viewing . In some cases a film might be cut if it is very likely that younger children will try to see it on DVD . <h> Why is 12A only used for cinema releases and not on DVD/Blu-ray ? <p> The 12A requires an adult to accompany any child under 12 seeing a 12A film at the cinema . This is enforced by cinema staff and a cinema may lose its license if adult accompaniment is not enforced for children under 12 admitted to a 12A film . Accompanied viewing can not be enforced in the home , so the 12 certificate remains for DVD/Blu-ray , rather than the 12A . The 12 is also a simpler system for retailers . It means they can not sell or rent the item unless the customer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video <p> In 2013 our Guidelines research found that 75% of the British public understand that a film rated 12A is generally suitable for children aged 12 and over , but a younger child may see the film if accompanied by an adult . This video reminds parents to check the BBFCinsight for every 12A film before they take a child to see it . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

The key legislation for the BBFC in this area is The Obscene Publications Act 1959 and 1964 , The Cinematograph Films ( Animals ) Act 1937 , The Animal Welfare Act 2006 and The Protection of Children Act 1978 as discussed below . <h> The Obscene Publications Act 1959 and 1964 <p> It is illegal to publish a work which is obscene . The Obscene Publications Act ( OPA ) was extended to include films and videos in 1977 . Prior to that , the only legal test applied to films was the more vague test of common law indecency . Under the OPA , a film may be deemed obscene when , taken as a whole , the work has a tendency to ' deprave and corrupt ' ( ie make morally bad ) a significant proportion of those likely to see it . It is important to note that a film must be considered as a whole and that individual scenes must not be judged out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would normally be considered obscene can be shown if ' it is in the interests of science , art , literature , or learning or of other objects of general concern ' . <p> Crash ( 1996 ) was accused by its critics of being obscene , but no prosecution was brought . Indeed , a leading QC gave his opinion that the film was not obscene . <h> The Cinematograph Films ( Animals ) Act 1937 <p> This law was passed in response to widespread public concern about the mistreatment of animals on film sets , especially in Westerns . Its intention was to prohibit the exhibition of films that had involved the deliberate infliction of cruelty by film makers , in order to encourage them to use more humane techniques . It is therefore illegal to show any scene organised or directed for the purposes of the film that involves actual cruelty to animals . This Act applies to the exhibition of films in public cinemas , but the BBFC also applies the same test to DVD and Blu-ray works .

The Act does not , however , prohibit documentary footage of cruelty , or scenes , even if set up for the film , depicting swift humane killings . The test is one of cruelty rather than killing .

Existing legislation ( such as the Obscene Publications Act ) already prohibited the distribution of images of under 16s engaged in sexual acts . However , the OPA was felt to be insufficient to deal with milder but still exploitative ' erotic ' images of children that were entering the UK from the Continent . Additionally , the OPA concerned itself only with the effect that images might have upon the viewer , rather than the effect that the creation of such images might have on young participants . The intention of the new Act was to prevent the exploitation of children for indecent purposes altogether . Unlike the OPA , it did not allow context or other justifications to be taken into account . <p> Indecency is not defined by the legislation , but case law suggests that it should be taken as something that ' offends the ordinary modesty of the average man ' . Mere nudity is not of itself considered indecent unless there is some lewdness involved . A shot of a child in the same frame as adults engaged in sexual activity may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image may constitute an ' indecent photograph ' , it will usually seek to establish the age of the person involved , if there is any doubt , and may also seek expert legal opinion . <p> In 1988 the law was strengthened further by the Criminal Justice Act , which made the possession of indecent images of children illegal . In 1994 , in response to advances in computer technology , the law was further strengthened by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act , which made illegal the creation , distribution and possession of ' pseudo-photographs ' of children . A ' pseudo-photograph ' must involve an image of an actual child that has been doctored , such as a photograph depicting a child 's head on an adult 's body . Animated images are not covered by the Act as they did not involve the exploitation of an actual child in their creation . However , the BBFC may still take issue with such images under the terms of the Video Recordings Act if it is felt that harm might arise from their distribution ( eg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating a sexual interest in children ) . <p> More recently , The Sexual Offences Act 2003 raised the original definition of a child , which was previously a person under 16 years of age , to include persons under 18 years of age . This change might affect new classifications of works featuring images of persons aged 16 or 17 which were passed before the Sexual Offences Act came into force . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540838 @3540838/ <h> The Video Recordings Act <p> The arrival of videos in the UK , including ' video nasties ' , and the Video Recordings Act 1984 . <h> Background <p> Video recorders were first introduced in the UK in 1978 . At the time there was no legislation governing what could be released on video or to whom video recordings could be supplied . Initially the major distributors were wary of releasing their films on video because they felt video tapes might have an adverse effect on cinema revenues . This left the market open for smaller distributors who , in most cases , could only afford to release low budget material , including horror and pornography . Because there was no legislation governing video recordings , these companies were therefore able to release films that had not been submitted to the BBFC for cinema release , uncut versions of films that had been cut by the BBFC and even films that had been refused a certificate altogether by the BBFC . Some of the films released contained scenes that would be in contravention of UK laws on animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such films were available , in theory at least , to children of any age . <p> Public and political concern increased in 1982 with the release of films such as SS Experiment Camp , Cannibal Holocaust , Snuff and The Driller Killer . Quite apart from the content of the films , the advertising for them seemed calculated to cause offence and controversy . The BBFC responded by introducing a voluntary scheme for rating video recordings . Although the major companies - who were now beginning to release their films on video - were happy to submit titles for age ratings , the smaller companies were under no obligation to follow suit . Therefore the voluntary system was unable to remove what were seen as the worst examples from the shelves . The Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) responded by issuing a list of videos that he believed may be in breach of the Obscene Publications Act ( OPA ) . This came to be known as the ' video nasties ' list . The difficulty with this approach , however , was that a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant that a large number of copies would already be in circulation and in people 's homes . Furthermore , even if a video was found to be obscene in one court , it was possible that it might not be found obscene in another . So a conviction against any particular title did not automatically stop it being sold everywhere . <p> Given the problems with effective enforcement of the ' video nasties ' list , and the reluctance of smaller companies to offer their titles for voluntary age rating , Parliament passed the Video Recordings Act in 1984 . This Act required that all video works ( including laserdiscs and , later , DVDs ) must be rated - and , if necessary , cut or rejected - by an authority designated by the Home Secretary ( it is now the Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport who is in charge of the DCMS ) . Given the BBFC 's experience of dealing with cinema films for over 70 years , it was the obvious choice . From 1985 , all video works released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rated at an appropriate category ( U , PG , 15 , 18 , R18 - the 12 category was only introduced in 1994 ) . Supply of age-restricted videos to persons under the age stated on the certificate would become illegal and the supply of unrated videos would also become a criminal offence . <h> Video Recordings Act 1984 ( VRA ) <p> In making decisions under the Act , the BBFC was required to consider ' whether or not video works are suitable for a classification certificate to be issued to them , having special regard to the likelihood of video works ... being viewed in the home ' and to consider whether a video was ' not suitable for viewing by persons who have not attained a particular age ' or whether ' no video recording containing that work is to be supplied other than in a licensed sex shop ' . <p> The Act also required that tapes , disc and packaging should be correctly labelled with the BBFC certificate and an explanation of that certificate ( eg ' Suitable only for persons of 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person below that age ' ) . <p> Given the enormous number of video works already in circulation , those video works that had already been released were given a series of deadlines by which they must be rated or removed from the shelves . However , by 1st September 1988 all existing recordings needed to have been rated . <h> Video Recordings Act 2010 ( VRA ) <p> In January 2010 , the Video Recordings Act 2010 ( VRA 2010 ) came into force . This simultaneously repealed and immediately revived without amendment the Video Recordings Act 1984 , in order to correct a procedural error made during the passage of the VRA 1984 . <h> Exempt videos <p> The Video Recordings Act did , however , state that certain types of video works do not require age rating by the BBFC . These are : <p> works which , taken as a whole , are designed to inform , educate or instruct ; <p> works which , taken as a whole , are concerned with sport , religion or music ; <p> On 4 August 2014 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video content loses its exemption from classification . The amendment came into effect on 1 October 2014 , so documentaries , sports and music video works that could claim exemption before 1 October now need to seek a BBFC classification if they contain material which could be potentially harmful or otherwise unsuitable for children . This means such works will lose their exemption and legally need to be classified if they contain material which would be rated at a 12 category and above . <p> Qualifying elements include issues such as the use of strong language , and the depiction or promotion of activities involving illegal drugs or the misuse of drugs . The complete list of elements that may require classification can be found here , but further examples include any work that : <p> depicts or promotes violence or threats of violence or the immediate aftermath of violence on human or animal characters ; <p> depicts or promotes suicide or attempted suicide , or depicts the immediate aftermath of such an event ; <p> depicts or promotes any act of scarification or mutilation of a person , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act ; <p> depicts techniques likely to be useful in the commission of offences or , through its depiction of criminal activity , promotes the commission of offences ; <p> depicts or promotes acts of force or restraint associated with human sexual activity ; <p> includes words or images that are intended or likely ( to any extent ) to cause offence , whether on the grounds of race , gender , disability , religion or belief or sexual orientation , or otherwise . <h> Criminal Justice &amp; Public Order Act 1994 <p> In response to increased public concerns about media violence ( largely in connection with the murder of toddler Jamie Bulger in 1993 ) , the Govenment made some changes to the tests laid out by the Video Recordings Act . Whereas previously the BBFC had been given broad discretion over what elements it should consider when making a decision on age ratings , the main elements of concern were now clearly spelled out . In fact the BBFC had already considered such elements when arriving at such decisions , but the new legislation provided useful clarification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might cause ' harm ' . The new tests required that the Board pays " special regard ( among the other relevant factors ) to any harm that may be caused to potential viewers or , through their behaviour , to society by the manner in which the work deals with - <p> criminal behaviour ; <p> illegal drugs ; <p> violent behaviour and incidents ; <p> horrific behaviour or incidents ; or <p> human sexual activity <p> The 1994 legislation was supplemented by the Video Recordings ( Review of Determinations ) Order 1995 , which allowed the BBFC to revisit any of its existing decisions in the light of the new tests . So far the BBFC has not needed to use these extra powers . <h> Digital media <p> The 1994 legislation also redefined the nature of a ' video work ' so as to more clearly include video games . Although the majority of games remained exempt from being age rated , the BBFC would now consider those games that included , amongst other things , gross violence , sexual activity , nudity and criminal acts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . In the early days , the comparatively pitiful processing power available to programmers meant that games were simple and uncontentious affairs . Games like 3D Monster Maze on the ZX81 were blocky and jerky and would pose no issues were they to be rated now . However , two major changes have taken place since then that have led to the BBFC having a much more significant influence over the rating of games . First of all , processing power has increased almost exponentially , to the degree that games like Half Life II mimic real life in a way that was inconceivable back in the early days . Secondly , the gaming public has grown up with the medium ; the average games-player is now in his or her late 20s and is demanding more adult content . Games like the GTA Series and Manhunt cater for this demand . <p> As of 30 July 2012 , and with a few limited exceptions , the responsibility for rating video games has shifted to the Video Standards Council ( VSC ) , applying the PEGI system . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R18 level ) content and ancillary games attached to a wider , primarily linear submission . The BBFC will also continue to rate all non-game linear content on a game disc , such as trailers and featurettes. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

The opening sequences are set in the middle ages and depict a double dealing arms dealer being punished by having a red hot iron mask fixed to his face .

@@34540869 @3540869/ <p> In 1961 Security Pictures contacted the BBFC about the development of a film adaptation of John Wyndhams 1951 sci-fi novel The Day of The Triffids . The papers published here chart several stages of the BBFCs involvement with the film , from giving advice on the script during pre-production to the final certification . <p> The studio were hoping from the start to release the film with an A certificate , which would indicate that the film contained material more suitable for adults but still allow young people to attend with a parent or guardian . The BBFC saw the script , however , as the basis for a film that was likely to require an X certificate , which would exclude under-16s from the audience . The BBFC team detailed several scenes they considered problematic for an A , with particular concern for younger viewers of the film .

However the BBFC still considered the film they saw to be sufficiently frightening , and to make it acceptable for the A category " you would have to lose a good deal of material that is important to the picture " . A final request for an A certificate came from Rank Films in 1963 on the grounds that " this is a well produced film , and a very expensive one " , and " we do not wish to jeopardise revenue recovery by a weak X certificate " . They described the film as " Wellsian in outlook and action " rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision that the strength of the horror and panic being caused by the invading plant life merited the X certificate . <p> The Day of the Triffids was classified X in 1962 , and was most recently classified 15 for video in 1997. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

There was strong support for passing the work uncut at 18 , despite many examiners declaring the film to be both challenging and gruelling . <p> UK classification considerations were focussed around two key scenes : <p> a fatal attack on a man in a club , at the end of the lengthy opening scene , where a fire extinguisher is used to smash the victims head into a bloody pulp <p> the extended , traumatic rape of Belluccis character , Alex , in an urban underpass <p> The bloody violence in the earlier of the two scenes is unusually explicit , with an almost seamless use of CGI effects and props to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire extinguisher , over 20 times . Many , if not all , of the blows are fully visible and foregrounded , with his face eventually collapsing as the blows continue , accompanied by wince-inducing , loud sound effects , and bones and bloody flesh flying off under the impact . The Board considered the scene justifiable in the context of the narrative as a whole , and that there were no convincing grounds for intervention at 18 . The film did not glamorise or promote such violence , nor was there any attempt to encourage audience complicity . Cutting the scene to reduce the number of blows or gory detail would have served no useful purpose regarding the impact of the scene on the audience . <p> The rape of Alex at knifepoint is notorious primarily for the length of the scene around nine minutes although it is also very aggressive in tone .

However , scenes which eroticise or appear to endorse sexual violence have always been of particular concern both to the BBFC and to the public . <p> However , the BBFC additionally sought advice from a clinical forensic psychiatrist about the potential effects on an audience of watching the whole film , and the rape scene in particular . She agreed that the scene is " a harrowing and vivid portrayal of the brutality of rape . However , it contains no explicit sexual images and is not designed to titillate " .

Both agreed that whilst undeniably disturbing - the film makes an important statement about the horror of rape , and represents a highly aversive portrayal of sexual violence . It was therefore considered " unlikely to be used as stimulus material , or evoke copycat actions " . <p> The video release of Irreversible was consequently passed at 18 uncut in March 2003 . The film also formed part of the BFI season of uncut and controversial films , screened in November 2012 to mark the centenary of the BBFC. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

In the case of each of these films , the decision of the BBFC to award an X was overturned by a number of local authorities . Pressure groups such as The Festival of Light , and Lord Longfords Committee on Pornography also placed immense pressure on the BBFC , in a backlash against what was perceived as liberalisation having gone too far . The Festival of Light took out an unsuccessful private prosecution against Last Tango in Paris and mounted a campaign against alleged links between teenage suicide and screenings of The Exorcist . Meanwhile anti-censorship campaigners also continued to criticise the BBFC , defending cause celebre films such as Andy Warhols Trash ( 1970 ) , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy , who became BBFC Secretary in July 1971 , resigned in 1975 and was succeeded by James Ferman . One of the first films Ferman looked at was The Texas Chain Saw Massacre , which his predecessor had already refused to rate shortly before his departure . Ferman agreed with Murphy that the violence and terrorisation in the film ( directed largely towards a woman over a sustained period ) was unacceptable . In an early interview , Ferman remarked that it was n't the sex that worried him but the violence and , in particular sexual violence . During his time at the BBFC , Ferman permitted increasingly explicit sexual material whilst clamping down on sadistic violence ( especially when perpetrated by heroes ) and sexual violence ( particularly where it seemed that the portrayal of rapes and assaults were intended as a ' turn on ' to viewers ) . <p> Ferman 's attitudes and policies reflected a more general shift of public concern during the 1970s , away from arguments about the explicitness of screen representations towards a consideration of any possible corrupting influence . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewer is encouraged to enjoy the pain of victims of violence , and , often , sexual violence . Prior to 1977 the Obscene Publications Act did not apply to cinema films and films were judged on the basis of whether any individual scene might be considered ' indecent ' , regardless of context . <p> Notably , this led to the seizure of Pasolini 's Salo from a Soho cinema club in 1976 on the grounds that it was ' indecent ' ( the BBFC itself had refused to rate the film on exactly these grounds ) . However , the extension of the OPA to films in 1977 gave the BBFC more latitude when considering depictions of sex in films since they now had to be considered ' as a whole ' . In 1978 the BBFC was therefore able to waive a cut for sexual explicitness made in 1973 to Last Tango in Paris . On the other hand , the OPA required that the BBFC consider whether a scene might deprave and corrupt its likely audience . In 1978 the BBFC demanded that an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( originally rated X in 1974 ) to remove a rape scene that , although not ' indecent ' , might deprave and corrupt viewers by suggesting that rape was erotic and could teach the victim a valuable ' lesson ' . The film was finally rated 18 uncut on DVD in 2007 after further viewings , in accordance with our Guidelines and sexual violence policy , determined that the film did not endorse the rape myth . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

Medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone is on her first Space Shuttle mission , which goes awry when debris from a Russian satellite crashes into the shuttle , leaving it mostly destroyed and all but one other crew member dead . Stranded in space , Stone and mission commander Kowalski have to depend on creativity and cooperation in order to survive in space , with a limited oxygen supply and very few options for a safe return to Earth . <p> The film , in both the 3D and 2D versions , was submitted to the BBFC for classification for theatrical release in August 2013 , with a 12A category request ; a specific request can often be helpful in giving BBFC Examiners an idea of the target market that the film makers see for the film . The Examiners who age rated Gravity considered that the film was likely to appeal to a wide mainstream audience of both families and adults . They considered it similar in tone and theme ( survival against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to a sci-fi film like Apollo 13 ( 1995 , rated PG ) starring Tom Hanks , or the more recent sailing disaster movie with Robert Redford , All Is Lost ( 2013 , rated 12A ) . <p> Examiners identified the levels of sustained threat , some disturbing images of dead bodies , and the use of strong language in the film as the category-defining issues . Category-defining issues are those which secure the age rating , though many films feature other content which is discussed by Examiners , and might be of interest to parents or viewers . That information is always recorded in BBFCinsight . Examiners use the BBFC Guidelines , current research and the law as the basis for all decision making , also bearing in mind recent decisions on similar works . <p> There are regular scenes of quite prolonged threat throughout the film , initially from the accident that disables the space shuttle , and then as the surviving astronauts dodge debris from exploding space vehicles . These events cause explosions , bursts of flame and high speed buffeting by and bouncing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing visual special effects increase the intensity and impression of the life-threatening scenes . <p> At one point there is also a brief scene of a woman who is close to drowning . While many of these sequences of threat are sustained , they demonstrate an overwhelmingly positive message about the human will and ability to survive . <p> Two dead bodies in space have sufficient injury detail to be the type of disturbing images that audiences might not expect to see in a film below a 12A rating . Both bodies are frozen : a man with his nose broken off , leaving only a hole in the middle of his face , and a woman whose face is intact , but with frosted and milky looking eyes . The images which are bloodless - are shown a couple of times , but relatively briefly , and are clearly intended to illustrate the seriousness of the accident . <p> The bad language in the film is mostly quite mild ( such as shit and ' sonofabitch ' ) , but there is also a single use of strong language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronauts as they express frustration and stress . It is not directed at anybody in particular . BBFC Guidelines for 12A at the time that the film was examined stated that Moderate language is allowed . The use of strong language ( for example , fuck ) must be infrequent. <p> Despite the sometimes intense scenes of threat , and the potentially disturbing images of dead astronauts , BBFC Examiners advised that a classification of 12A would meet general audience expectations of a thrilling but ultimately positive film like Gravity . The BBFC therefore rated the film 12A with short BBFCinsight of sustained moderate threat , disturbing images and strong language . The longer form BBFCinsight explains the key issues in more detail , without giving any plot spoilers . <p> The DVD Blu-ray version of Gravity was submitted to the BBFC for classification in late 2013 . As it was identical to the theatrical release , it was passed at 12 with the same BBFCinsight. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

There are close-ups of heroin being heated on a spoon and sucked into a syringe , detail of the tying of tourniquets around arms in order to raise veins for easier injection and , in the strongest scene , an extreme close-up of a needle puncturing the lead characters skin . We also see characters taking ecstasy and smoking marijuana . <p> Trainspotting was submitted for cinema release on November 20 1995 and examiner reports from that date describe it as a darkly comic and at times savage account of a group of heroin addicts , stating that the absence of a moralising tone allows for some of the highs as well as the lows to be given space . <p> Examiners acknowledged the strength of some of the scenes of drug abuse but felt the heroin abuse to be constantly contextualised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiners felt that the lack of a moralising tone allowed the film to cut straight to the quick of the matter and effectively act as a very accessible , bleak , modern cautionary tale . <p> Examiners recommended that the film should be passed at 18 uncut , with their only worry about the age of the actress playing the character of Diane ( Kelly McDonald ) . After it was established that McDonald was of age , the film was passed at 18 and opened to huge critical acclaim . Derek Malcolm of The Guardian called Trainspotting an extraordinary achievement and a breakthrough British film and Empire magazine awarded it a maximum five stars . The film enjoyed an extremely successful run at the cinema , occupying the number one slot for a number of weeks , and the screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award . <p> When the film was submitted for its video classification , things took a slightly different turn . Under the Video Recordings Act 1984 , the BBFC is obliged to have special regard to the likelihood of video works being viewed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused to potential viewers or , through their behaviour , to society by the manner in which the work deals with various issues . Recent amendments to the Act , brought in by the Criminal Justice Act 1994 , specifically mentioned the manner in which a work dealt with ' illegal drugs ' as an area for the BBFC to have special regard to . Therefore the Board was being particularly cautious at that point with any depictions of drug use that might be seen as instructional and/or promotional , especially on video where they could be viewed out of context and/or repeatedly . <p> Although the BBFC did not at the time publish Guidelines , there were internal documents outlining the way in which examiners were to deal with drug-taking in films . These documents asked examiners to look at how seductively imitable drug-taking was in a film , requiring that There should be no glamorising of hard drugs through loving attention to the details of its handling , manufacture and consumption at any category . <p> Some examiners expressed their concern that the film would have a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home , given the films success at the box office and its penetration into British cultural life through the additional popularity of the book , soundtrack and posters . With dialogue lines comparing taking heroin to the best orgasm you 've ever had multiplied by a thousand cited , there were concerns that the drug-taking offered temptation to impressionable young people , with one examiner stating that the meticulous details are likely to be satisfying visuals for those who find heroin appealing . <p> Of the four examiners who saw the work , three recommended that there should be some cuts before the film was passed at 18 on video . The film was referred to the BBFCs Director , James Ferman , who sought advice from professionals in the field of drug dependency and abuse , including the Standing Conference on Drug Abuse ( SCODA , now part of Drugscope ) and the Institute for the Study of Drug Dependence ( ISDD ) . Ferman himself had experience working with drug users in the early 1970s . <p> No written advice from those professionals is extant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be written for the scene in which Renton injects himself with heroin in close-up detail . The distributor was asked to remove the sight of the needle piercing the skin , the blood being drawn up into the syringe and a subsequent shot of the needle in his body . After these cuts were made , the film was passed at 18 on video . It is worth noting that the cuts made to remove the close-up needle injection in Trainspotting were consistent with those cuts made to the video versions of Bad Lieutenant , Pulp Fiction and Trash at around the same time . <p> When Trainspotting was submitted in its uncut form in 2002 , examiners were asked to reconsider the cuts . This time , all the examiners who saw the work recommended that it should be passed uncut , feeling that the arguments about fetishisation or glamorisation of needles and drug use were somewhat dated . They acknowledged that the film contained detailed portrayals of drug use but argued that the detail that was cut was very familiar not just from medical dramas but also from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not provide instruction that was not already part of the public domain . <p> Professional advice was again sought , with two experts in addiction asked to write reports on the film . Both experts recommended that the film be passed uncut at 18 . The first stated that it would be unlikely that a drug na+ve individual could use the visual information in these scenes alone to successfully inject themselves with heroin and , with reference to current or former heroin users , though the visual images of drug-using paraphernalia , and the descriptions of the subjective pleasure of heroin use in the film may lead to drug craving in some vulnerable individuals the detail contained in the previously cut scene is unlikely to lead to significantly more craving than the images and narrative contained in the rest of the film . The report of the second professional stated that The film in my view does not glamorise smoking , drinking or injecting drug use , but shows a gritty picture of the life of these young men and some women who are hell bent on intoxication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly support the inclusion of this scene in that it fully represents the pattern of behaviour the film is about and does not in any way glamorise or make it attractive . <p> With these expert opinions on file , the Director , Robin Duval , agreed that Trainspotting should be passed uncut at 18 . Subsequent submissions of the film , on DVD and Blu-Ray , have all been passed at the same category . <p> Though drug-taking is Trainspottings most contentious classification issue , the films language , sex and violence also place it at 18 . There are several uses of strong language ( f**k and motherf***er ) as well as nineteen uses of c**t , a word that BBFC Guidelinesstate should be only infrequently used at 15 . There are a couple of strong sex scenes , with full-frontal nudity , implied fellatio and some thrusting and an image of a dead baby lying in its cot is as shocking now as it was when the film was first released . <p> The BBFCinsightfor Trainspotting , written for the Blu-Ray edition in 2009 , reads Contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug use . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

Sex references should not go beyond what is suitable for young teenagers ' . " <p> The Examiner report from 1984 , available here , shows the level of acceptability of these issues at the PG level in the early 1980s .

For example , another film passed PG albeit with cuts - during the 1980s that is now classified 12A is Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ( 1984 ) , while Ferris Buellers Day Off ( 1986 ) was originally classified 15 for cinema release , but is now classified 12A. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

However , they may lose this exemption - and therefore require a formal BBFC age rating - if they depict , to any significant extent , gross violence against humans or animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or genital organs , or techniques likely to be useful in the commission of offences . <p> In the early days of video games , the quality of graphics was so low that , even when ' human ' or ' animal ' characters were depicted , they were unlikely to be realistic enough to be covered by the Act . However , the increasing sophistication of computer graphics means that now a number of games require classification , usually because they contain violence against realistic human figures . In some cases , games may also need to be submitted to the BBFC because they contain non-interactive video elements ( eg trailers or film clips ) that do not enjoy the same exemption as interactive games . <p> Games that retain their exemption - for example because they do not feature violence or sex involving realistic human figures - are classified under the PEGI system , a voluntary pan-European rating system . In the UK the system is administered by the Video Standards Council , who also advises publishers on whether or not their game requires a formal BBFC classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examiner ? <p> To be an examiner , you do not need ' qualifications ' as such . We do require experience in relevant areas such as media regulation , law , the film or related industries , and child development - and many examiners over the years have had backgrounds in teaching , law , social work , the film industry and journalism . Once hired , examiners receive detailed and extensive training . Some examiners have linguistic skills ( especially languages such as Hindi and Tamil ) which is particularly valuable as we regularly receive works in these languages . Examiner positions are advertised in the national newspapers . <h> What is it like being a Film &amp; Video Examiner ? <p> Examiners are full-time . They view material and write reports and BBFCinsight for up to 7 hours a day , making recommendations based on the BBFC Guidelines , age ratings , relevant legislation and policies . <h> What sort of person becomes an Examiner ? <p> Examiners at the BBFC come from a wide variety of backgrounds . They tend to be graduates but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not need specific qualifications , however experience in relevant areas such as media regulation , law and child development is important . A broad knowledge of film is required , as well as an ability to grasp age rating issues such as violence and drugs . <p> The current examining team includes academics , journalists , researchers , media and marketing professionals and several people who have worked in film and television . Like most BBFC employees , they have a strong knowledge of contemporary and historical film and a passion for the film and video industries . <h> What is a typical day like for an Examiner ? <p> Examiners watch material and write reports and BBFCinsight for around seven hours a day , but there is not really a typical day as what we watch completely depends on what is submitted by distributors . Our work is allocated randomly so we could be viewing anything from the latest blockbuster to episodes of 1960s or 1970s TV series due for DVD release . <p> Once we have finished watching the days viewing we will log their views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more contentious moments ) in a concise reports highlighting the key issues . We also write BBFCinsight , a concise line of information which gives the public a clear idea of the reason a work has received a particular rating and for cinema works a more detailed explanation of the decision designed to help people , especially parents , make an informed decision about what they view . <h> Do Examiners watch films/DVDs on their own or in a big group ? <p> That depends on the material . Cinema films , more contentious works and some adult material are all viewed in pairs - all other works are viewed alone . However , many works are viewed more than once internally , with additional teams or more senior members of staff viewing them before a final decision on the age rating is reached . <h> Do Examiners have to agree on a decision about a film or video ? <p> Usually a team will agree on the rating because we base all recommendations on the BBFCs published guidelines . However , if a team disagrees , or believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to another team ( of two or three depending on the issue raised ) . Sometimes key scenes or shorter works are are brought to the weekly examining meeting for further discussion or sent to the BBFCs Chief Executive or Presidential team . Really contentious works , like former ' Video Nasties ' which are having cuts reinstated , or cinema releases likely to provoke comment , will often be seen again even if the first team agrees on a decision . <h> What is the worst stuff you have to watch ? <p> That depends - all individual examiners have their own foibles and things that they find difficult to watch , and this can be affected by a huge number of variables such as what is happening in an examiner 's personal life , or even what he or she has watched earlier that day or that week . Some of the strongest stuff we watch is what we would term ' extreme reality ' products , which are works that show things like real life death or injury . <h> Do Examiners also have to classify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 per cent of what examiners watch , but when it is aggressive or violent it can be upsetting . The BBFC is very strict with material that is in contravention of the law so we cut elements like underage references and abusive sex ( under the Video Recordings Act 1984 ) and material which is likely to be prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 . <h> Do you treat film trailers differently from full length features ? <p> Yes and no . When classifying trailers , examiners use the same Classification Guidelines , as they do when viewing full length feature films . These Guidelines , clearly lay out what is acceptable at each category for issues such as theme , sex , violence , drugs etc and help the examiners make an informed decision on the right category for each trailer . <p> However , the BBFC also pays special attention to film and video trailers on the basis that these works come ' unbidden ' to the audience . While that audience may have chosen to watch a particular full length feature they have no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different in tone and content to the film and the BBFC is aware that the potential for these trailers to cause offence is higher . So any images or dialogue that have a high potential for giving offence or causing concern to parents and guardians are unlikely to be acceptable in the lower categories ( ie U , PG or 12/12A ) . <h> Do you classify films in all languages ? <p> The Board receives submissions in 52 different languages , from Afghan Pashtu to Yoruba . When an unsubtitled film or DVD is received in a language that is not spoken by one of the examiners , outside interpreters are employed . However , because of the high number of submissions in certain languages , the Board attempts to maintain a reasonable level of linguistic skills in-house , mostly French , German and some Asian languages , such as Hindi , Urdu , Cantonese and Mandarin . <h> How do you classify Bollywood films ? <p> In the case of South Asian films ( which , in 2008 , constituted approximately 20 per cent of our film submissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Asian audiences by ensuring that every Bollywood film classification team includes at least one examiner with a thorough understanding of South Asian culture and cinema . This is to achieve not merely language interpretation , but also to assess receptivity of the audiences the film is intended for . Additionally , all examiners are trained in the history and issues specific to South Asian cinema . For more information about Bollywood films click here . <h> Do you treat DVD extras or additional production material , like commentaries or blooper reels , differently ? <p> No , these items are viewed by solo examiners who bear in mind that material such as DVD trailers and moving menus sometimes come to viewers unbidden . <h> Why do some works get different ratings on DVD or Blu-ray , compared to the cinema ? <p> There are two reasons . Sometimes the extras can affect a classification , so a 12A feature may be pushed to 15 on DVD if , for example , the blooper reel or commentary contains strong language . This is because the DVD rating is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Additional deleted scenes sometimes contain issues like strong violence which were absent from the original release ( for example if the distributor chose to cut a film to achieve a lower category but is happy to release it uncut on DVD ) , and of course longer cuts of a film or director 's cuts may be longer and contain stronger issues or new material . <p> Very occasionally though , the same work can receive a different category . This is because when examiners classify a work for video they have to incorporate the Video Recordings Act 1984 which requires them to bear in mind the possibility of younger children getting hold of material or watching films again and again . It also requires them to pay special attention to the issue of potential harm , portrayals of criminal activity and illegal drug use and dangerous imitative techniques . <p> Occasionally , the BBFC has moved works up a category or cut them for video/DVD on these grounds , for example removing methods of drug preparation or details of suicide which experts have assured us are not well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or watch DVDs in their own time ? <p> Yes ! Naturally there are days when an examiner or any other employees at the BBFC who watch films all the time do not fancy it , but most people here still love going to the pictures , watching DVDs and playing games . What is more , it is an important part of the job , as it is the best way of keeping up to date with recent decisions and gauging audience responses to films . <h> What is the BBFC 's attitude to gay sex in films or DVDs ? <p> The Board is committed to a policy of equality . Sex scenes are afforded the same treatment whatever the sexual orientation of those taking part . The same standards are applied whether sex involves heterosexual or homosexual individuals . <h> Who signs the black card I see displayed before a film is shown at the cinema ? <p> The BBFC Chief Executive and the BBFC President 's signatures are seen on the certificate which is projected before a film . Also known as the black card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying the film 's registration number and the rating it has been given <h> I 'm 14 but parents think I 'm old enough to see a 15 , so why ca n't I ? <p> When the BBFC awards a film a 15 classification this means no one younger can see the film in a cinema , even if accompanied by an adult or with parental permission . The cinema will be violating the terms of its license ( issued by the local authority ) if it admits under-aged children to age-restricted films . <h> I am 16 , how can I prove I am old enough to go to see a 15 ? <p> Box office staff are within their rights to request proof of age of customers if they believe a child to be under age .

Cinemas can refuse to admit a 15 year old ( or over ) for 15-rated films without proof of age , despite reassurances from accompanying parents or guardians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk heavy fines or even loss of license if caught in breach of these conditions . <p> The responsibility for complying with license conditions rests solely with the cinema . It is outside the remit of the BBFC to advise on how these age restrictions are enforced by cinemas . They will be a matter of company policy , or made in accordance with license conditions or the requirements of the local authority . However , all cinemas will have terms of admittance , and parents and teenage viewers are advised to consult these initially . <p> Often these terms will identify what forms of I 'd are acceptable . They can be found on cinema websites , or should be available from the box office staff . Some cinemas and chains operate their own I 'd card system for teenagers and students . Some local authorities offer ' proof of age ' cards for public transport which may be acceptable . Some cinemas operate teenage ' film clubs ' .

@@34540918 @3540918/ <h> Reservoir Dogs 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Quentin Tarantinos debut feature was originally submitted for film classification in June 1992 . It arrived with considerable notice , through its reception at various film festivals , of its blending of cool style , pop culture references , and strong , bloody violence . The story of thieves falling out after a botched robbery contained elements of violence , criminal behaviour and extensive strong language that would anticipate the films classification at the most restrictive cinema category , 18 . <p> Although strong , much of the generalised violence in the film , such as that which occurs during the robbery , happens off-screen or is limited to the climactic shootout at the warehouse and the strength of such gangster-related violence had been precedented in films such as Goodfellas . <p> The scenes of violence , combined with the bloody injury detail on show ( notably that of Tim Roths badly wounded Mr Orange ) , made the classification of the film at 18 almost a formality . But even at that category the notorious sequence in which Michael Madsens Mr Blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with petrol and threatening to set him on fire , was considered troubling in terms of its acceptability and was the subject of considerable debate within the BBFC . <p> Views were expressed that its gruesome and sadistic nature would cause some people to walk out of the film . It was also noted that Mr Blondes evident enjoyment of what he is doing ( " It amuses me to torture a cop " ) as he dances around the helpless victim to the strains of ' Stuck In The Middle With You ' coming from the radio , glamorised the sadism . <p> However , the general opinion was that the scene , whilst generating a sustained , intense and disquieting atmosphere of threat and menace , was remarkably restrained in what it actually showed . Apart from an initial indistinct slash to the policemans face with the razor , the audience does not see the detail of the ear being cut off as the camera moves away from the action , whilst the horror is suggested only by the sounds of the victims cries of pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat escalates as Mr Blonde pours petrol over him and lights a match only to be shot dead by Mr Orange . <p> It was felt that the scene carried several mitigating factors that precluded further intervention at the adult category . These factors were : the lack of process in the violence that undercuts what BBFC Guidelinesdescribe explicitly ( and what would have been given significant weight in 1992 ) as dwelling on the infliction of pain and injury ; <p> its contextualisation as a crucial plot point that reveals Mr Orange as the undercover policeman whose identity Mr Blonde had been trying to extract from the torture victim ; its playing on the films themes of loyalty and betrayal ; and the clear establishment of Mr Blondes character as an unpleasant , sadistic psychopath with whom a viewer is not invited to identify or to glamorise . <p> Consequently , the film was passed at 18 , without cuts , and went on to enjoy box office success in UK cinemas as Tarantino continued to garner critical acclaim , including some from parts of the UK press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films . <p> The work was next submitted in 1993 for its home video classification , but the video release would be delayed until 1995 because of the introduction of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill in 1993 and its lengthy passage through Parliament . In response to concerns about the effects of media violence , largely in the wake of the James Bulger murder in 1993 , part of the Bills remit was to make amendments to the Video Recordings Act 1984 ( VRA ) , under which the BBFC had been appointed as the statutory regulatory body for video . <p> The BBFCs then director , James Ferman , played an active role in the drafting of this aspect of the Bill which clearly had implications for the video classification of works such as Reservoir Dogs . This is because , on its passing into law in 1994 , it established within the VRA a specific harm test . This harm test required the BBFC to pay special regard ( among the other relevant factors ) to any harm that may be caused to potential viewers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the work deals with such issues as criminal behaviour and violent behaviour and incidents . <p> The criminal themes and violence ( most notably the torture sequence ) in Reservoir Dogs had therefore to be revisited in the light of potentially harmful effects particularly to younger viewers in the home viewing environment . In fact , the BBFC concluded that these issues could be robustly defended at 18 . <p> The prolonged passage of time since the film release , during which Reservoir Dogs had achieved a wide recognition , meant that the public could not be ignorant of its content . Also the awareness of the kind of material present in a Quentin Tarantino film had been reinforced with the release of Pulp Fiction in 1994 . Additionally , it had become clear through critical reaction to Reservoir Dogs that the film was as concerned with clever characterisation and dialogue as it was with violence , and did not have the intrinsic appeal to younger teenagers of more formulaic , mainstream action films . <p> Reservoir Dogs was finally granted an uncut 18 video certificate in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other major international markets , which did not prove too disconcerting for Tarantino who was reported to be delighted that the delay had given the film an extended theatrical life in the UK. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540939 @3540939/ <h> Salo/120 Days of Sodom 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Pasolini 's final film , Salo , transposes the Marquis de Sade 's notorious eighteenth century novel , ' 120 Days of Sodom ' , to Mussolini 's short lived fascist republic of Salo at the end of World War Two . In the film a group of young people are rounded up by Italian fascists , taken to a secluded house and subjected to ritualised acts of torture and degradation . Some chose to ' collaborate ' and are spared . Others resist and are ultimately executed . The film explores the idea that absolute power corrupts , and is intended as a critique of both fascism and consumerism . <p> Salo was first screened in Britain at the Old Compton Street cinema club in 1977 . It was shown uncut , to members only , without a certificate from the BBFC . After a few days , the cinema was raided by the police , who confiscated the print and threatened action against the cinema owners under the offence of common law indecency . The cinema appealed , explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the then Secretary of the BBFC , James Ferman . <p> The film had originally been submitted to the BBFC by United Artists in January 1976 , when it was refused a certificate on the legal grounds of gross indecency . Gross indecency was defined in British law as ' anything which an ordinary decent man or woman would find to be shocking , disgusting and revolting ' , or , which ' offended against recognised standards of propriety ' . Unlike the Obscene Publications Act(OPA) - which at that stage did not apply to films - gross indecency allowed for no defence of artistic or cultural merit to be mounted on the films behalf . Furthermore , there was no requirement to consider the film - or the films purpose - as a whole . If any part of the film was indecent then the whole film was illegal . The only way in which the BBFC could remedy such a problem was through extensive cutting to remove any possible elements of indecency . United Artists assumed that cuts would make the film acceptable , but James Ferman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose by making the horrors less revolting , and therefore more acceptable ' . Ferman did not feel that the film should be cut , describing Salo as ' one of the most disturbing films ever to be seen by the Board , yet its purpose is deeply serious ... it is quite certainly shocking , disgusting and revolting - even in the legal sense - but it is meant to be . It wants us to be appalled at the atrocities of which human nature is capable when absolute power is wielded corruptly ' . <p> Following this advice , United Artists sold the rights on to Cinecenta , who were advised by Ferman to show the film without a certificate , on a club basis , so it could be seen uncut as Pasolini had intended . The police prosecution was an embarrassment , and Ferman intervened and spoke to the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions . <p> By that time the campaign to bring films within the scope of the OPA , which was led by Ferman , had borne fruit in the Criminal Law Act 1977 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could now be considered as a whole , and its cultural and artistic value could be taken into account . Nonetheless , it was made clear to Ferman that charges might still be brought under the deprave and corrupt test of the OPA if the film were to be shown uncut . Ferman therefore agreed to take advice from two distinguished QCs and to assist in the editing of a special version for cinema clubs . In 1979 , the DPP agreed that proceedings need not be taken against this reduced version . <p> The cut version prepared by James Ferman for club screenings lost nearly six minutes of footage , removing - amongst other things - some of the most extreme violence at the end of the film , and certain elements of sexual behaviour that were believed to be vulnerable to prosecution . It also added an on-screen to legally ' explain ' the context of Mussolini 's regime at Salo and the writings of the Marquis de Sade . This version was shown at club cinemas throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s . The club version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for classification , presumably because there was by that stage no commercial benefit in considering a wider theatrical release . <p> Salo was formally resubmitted to the BBFC by the BFI in October 2000 . This submission came shortly after the BBFC had published a new set of classification Guidelines , in September 2000 , themselves the result of a major process of public consultation exercise . The BBFC had stated in its news release when launching the new Guidelines that the BBFC would no longer intervene with material for adult viewing unless the material in question was either illegal or genuinely likely to be harmful . <p> The BBFC was satisfied that Salo was neither illegal nor harmful within the terms of its new Guidelines and therefore agreed to classify the film 18 uncut for cinema exhibition on 16 November 2000 . The film had been viewed by a number of examiners at the BBFC , as well as by Director , Robin Duval , and its President , Andreas Whittam Smith . The film was subsequently submitted for video classification by the BFI and was awarded an 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 December 2000 . <p> In reaching the decision to pass Salo 18 uncut , the BBFC considered that although the film was undeniably - and intentionally - shocking , it did not contain anything that would deprave and corrupt viewers - the basic test of the Obscene Publications Act . In fact , Salos purpose and its likely effect on viewers seemed to be quite the opposite . <p> In the BBFCs view , the film depicted its events in a cold , detached and ritualised style , deliberately removing any hint of titillation . The film also mirrored de Sades verbose literary style , alienating the viewer through its repetitions . Although the film contained many disturbing scenes , the BBFC agreed that its intention was to deliberately shock and appall audiences at the evil of fascism and to vividly illustrate the idea that absolute power corrupts absolutely . Much like James Ferman in the 1970s , the BBFC agreed that any attempt to cut the film would undermine the directors purpose by making the film less shocking , the events depicted more palatable , and therefore less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the BBFC noted that most of its on screen violence was in fact relatively muted and shown in long shot or extreme long shot . There were no lingering close ups and the films climactic death scenes could even be said to appear technically unconvincing by modern standards . <p> The BBFC was conscious that although the film had been considered potentially indecent at law in 1976 , the protection now granted by the OPA ( extended to cover film in 1977 ) made Salo less problematic in 2000 . The OPA requires that any film should be considered as a whole and that its more difficult scenes should not be considered in isolation . Given Salos serious purpose , and its avoidance of titilatory or pornographic content , the BBFC concluded that the film could not be considered obscene within the meaning of the Act , nor regarded as harmful to viewers . <p> The BBFC also considered that , ultimately , Salo , is a film of limited appeal and is unlikely to ever receive widespread distribution .

Nonetheless , the BBFC did recognise the publics desire for more detailed BBFCinsight , also highlighted by the recent public consultation exercise , and the BBFCinsight issued for Salo drew clear attention to the content of the film : ' Contains strong violence , sexual violence and scenes of torture and degradation ' . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969 
@@34540951 @3540951/ <h> Crash 201963 @qwx401963 <p> David Cronenberg 's film of J G Ballard 's controversial 1973 novel had already aroused comment in the press before it was submitted to the BBFC . Its screening at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival had provoked the Evening Standard 's film critic , the late Alexander Walker , to describe the film as ' beyond the bounds of depravity ' . On the day of its UK premiere at the London Film Festival ( where it was shown without a BBFC certificate but with the special permission of Westminster Council ) the front page of the Daily Mail demanded ' Ban This Car Crash Sex Film ' . This was to mark the beginning of an intensive and orchestrated campaign against the film by the Daily Mail and Evening Standard . <p> It was against this background that the BBFC was asked to view Crash in October 1996 . The film tells the story of a couple who overcome the emptiness and tedium of their lives by joining a cult-like group who associate sexual excitement with car crashes . The sexual content of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no stronger than could be found in many other features ( comprising car crashes rather than one-on-one personal violence ) . However , it was the unusual combination of sexual excitement with car crashes ( and their attendant injuries ) that appeared to provoke outrage amongst some . It was clear to the BBFC from the outset - as it had also been clear to readers of Ballard 's original novel - that the film was not intended to be taken literally . Rather it attempted to examine a number of issues in a metaphorical manner , such as the link between sex and risk , the increasing importance of technology in modern lives and the manner in which people whose lives are empty seek a connection to life through increasing and dangerous levels of thrill-seeking . The activities of the characters - and the characters themselves - were simply too bizarre for emulation to be likely . Furthermore , the film presented the crashes and even the sex scenes in a cool , detatched fashion that was unlikely to excite or attract audiences . <p> Although the BBFC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults , the increasing barrage of charges against the film - that it was obscene , dangerous , likely to incite car crashes , offensive to the disabled - led the BBFC to seek expert advice . <p> A QC was engaged to give a legal opinion as to whether the film was likely to be obscene within the meaning of the Obscene Publications Act . He concluded that the film did not offend against this law . A psychologist was asked to advise as to whether the film was likely to be dangerous or incite copycat behaviour . He concluded that , in itself , the film would have no such effect . Finally , the film was screened to a group of eleven disabled people , because it had also been suggested that the film 's portrayal of some of its disabled or injured characters enaged in sexual activity could be offensive . Although the invited group did not generally enjoy the film , they concluded that its depiction of disabled people as being able to be both sexually attractive and active , ( despite rather than because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With the combined weight of legal and psychological advice , the opinions of disabled viewers , and the unanimous view of the BBFC examiners that the film was neither harmful nor dangerous for adult audiences , Crash was classified at 18 uncut on 18 March 1997 . Predictably , the BBFC 's careful and considered decision was not welcomed by the Daily Mail or Evening Standard although , when the film finally opened in May 1997 , it provoked little public comment . The press campaign against the BBFC 's decision became increasingly vicious between the time of the film 's classification and its release , resorting to publishing the photographs and personal details of the BBFC 's examiners and ridiculing them as unrepresentative ' liberals ' who had refused to ban an offensive and dangerous film . However , the evidence did not support any of the claims still being made . <p> Perhaps in the light of the continuing media onslaught against the film , Westminster Council - who had previously given permission for the film to be premiered in their area as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point , insisting that cuts should now be made to the film before it was shown in the West End . The distributors declined to make cuts solely for screenings in Westminster and the film was therefore effectively banned from screens in the West End , including Leicester Square . However , cinema goers could easily see the film in neighbouring Camden where the council allowed the film to play uncut with its BBFC certificate . <p> Later in 1997 , the film was submitted for a video certificate and , after careful consideration , it was agreed that the reasons for permitting the film at the cinema were equally valid on video . The video version was therefore also rated 18 without cuts in March 1998 and the film has subsequently been shown on national television . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

It is set in a South London housing estate and follows a group of teen muggers , who form an unlikely alliance with a nurse they have robbed , when aliens attack their tower block . <p> The film was submitted to the BBFC with no category request in March 2011 . If they wish , distributors are allowed to signpost to examiners which category they would prefer for a work , although in this case they did not do this . Nevertheless , it is clear from the characters , the tone of the work and the general address , that it had strong appeal to older teenage viewers . <p> The film contains frequent strong language from the start , with over 50 uses of ' f**k ' and some uses of ' motherf****r ' throughout . Under current BBFC Guidelines , where only infrequent strong language is permitted at 12A , the work was automatically therefore a 15 category within the first reel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , with some scenes of bloody injury as human characters are bitten , scratched , attacked and killed . In some sequences a lot of blood is seen , pumping from characters mouths for example . The strongest moments include a man seen in a lift full of bloodied bodies , himself dripping with blood ; close up shots of injuries ; and sight of a young adults face ripped up by aliens . <p> Examiners noted there was some contextual justification for stronger moments , as the film is a horror work based on a fantastical scenario , albeit in a contemporary and recognisable setting . This means that - although there is some focus on tension , threat , characters in danger , chase scenes and injuries - the aliens and monsters have less impact as they are clearly part of the films horror world and are the sort of elements audiences expect from horror movies . Some could also argue there are comic elements to the monsters , who are , when they are finally seen , large and hairy with glow in the dark teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadistic violence - it is all in the context of self-defence . Therefore there seems no problem with containing the violence and gore at 15 , where the Guidelines state ' Violence may be strong but should not dwell on the infliction of pain or injury . The strongest gory images are unlikely to be acceptable . ' <p> The BBFC must take note of contemporary and easily available weapons , and be particularly mindful of how these weapons are used , especially in films aimed at children and those passed at U , PG and 12A . <p> Though there is some focus on a knife in a mugging early on , and use of guns and machetes throughout , the film did n't  glamorise weapons and later the main characters employ weapons to defend themselves against evil alien forces . The adult character , Sam , is also a voice of reason , criticising the gangs criminal behaviour and making a distinction between this and their self-defence against the aliens . <p> Fireworks are used as weapons in the film , and the BBFC has intervened through cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature dangerous firework play . However , in this instance , given the work is clearly for older teens and young adults , it did not affect the 15 classification . <p> There was some discussion , however , about the portrayal of drug use , drug taking and drug dealing in the film . Attack The Block contains numerous scenes in which characters smoke pot , and several scenes take place in the villains ' marijuana growing facility within his own flat . The drug store , known as the weed room is used as a safe house later as the block is besieged and a character claims he is smoking weed for pain relief . A character is also arrested by police for possession of hard drugs and a knife <p> The BBFC Guidelines at 15 state that ' drug taking may be shown but the film as a whole must not promote or encourage drug misuse ' . Examiners had to consider whether the volume of drugs references normalise drug taking , or merely reflect the world of the film where some characters take drugs and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear in mind precedents for soft drug taking and dealing in works classified 15 , such as the Johnny Vegas sitcom Ideal . In Attack The Block it is a villainous character who deals drugs , including cocaine , although the latter is not seen to be used . Several characters are shown to have their judgement and abilities impaired by smoking joints , and the hero rejects drug dealing and chooses not to smoke anything before an important mission . <p> The only sex reference of any note is a passing and comic reference to the sexually transmitted disease , Chlamydia . <p> Examiners concluded , after discussion with senior examiners and the BBFCs Director , David Cooke , that the work could be contained at 15 , where the films appeal lies , and where it sits alongside other works which include reference to drugs and sight of drug use - not least as there are no clear elements that glamorise drug taking for younger audiences . <p> The film was passed at 15 and the BBFCinsight explained to the public that it contained strong language , violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for National Schools Film Week in 2011. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

Sam is faced with trying to put right some of the damage he has done by his killing of Trife , and with dealing with the people seeking revenge for Trifes death . <p> Set as before on the streets of west London , the film is not quite as bleak as its predecessor , as Sam does his best to convince friends and enemies that violence breeds violence and solves no problems .

There is little in the way of injury detail , attacks giving the impression of violence and pain without showing the immediate results . In fact the strongest moment of violence comes in a flash-back to Kidulthood , as a man describes how he had his face cut with a Stanley knife . It is a brief but bloody moment and not characteristic of the violence generally present in this film . <p> BBFC Guidelines at 15 allow for strong violence provided that it does not ' dwell on the infliction of pain or injury ' .

For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heated hair iron the mans pain is evident but we see no detail of the assault . <p> Regarding drugs the lifestyles of some of the films characters involve drug dealing or drugs use . The psychotic Jay does deals on the street , characters share a joint , and Lexi snorts cocaine . The world of the film presents these activities without promoting them or making them glamorous , which accords with BBFC drugs Guidelines at 15 which state that drugs misuse must not be condoned or encouraged . <p> The street slang spoken by many of the characters places the film at 15 , where strong language is permitted . There is continual use of the f-word in dialogue and also in the lyrics of rap music . More problematic , and potentially a barrier to the 15 , is the use of the c-word , which research suggests is likely to offend both men and women . Any use of this word in a film that is otherwise likely to be classified at 15 needs careful consideration of the context in which it appears .

The other use is in conversation between Sam and Lexi , who remembers him from school she remarks casually , You do n't  remember me , do you ? no reason why you should . I was two years younger than you , and you were a c**t . Again , there is no aggressive intent here , and Sam does not react it is a slang use of the word to indicate why she avoided him at school .

It has been the focus of much controversial reporting in the National Press and other media since it was discussed and linked to a British murder case in 2004 . <p> The game is TPP ( third person prospective ) and tracks a convicted man hunted by vicious street gangs and forced to go on a killing and fighting spree . <p> When evaluating the game , BBFC examiners took into account several factors , including that it has a very well defined mission structure : any attempt to stray off the mission results in the players likely death , and a frustrating return to the beginning of the level . This keeps the player constantly aware that they are acting within the confines of a game , and the stop-start effect helps to distance them from the intense action on the game console . <p> Another important feature is that no innocents ( ie. weaker , unarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) can be killed in Manhunt . All the characters are enemies , and there are no gratuitous , illicit pleasures to be taken from mowing down pedestrians , sniping at police from rooftops , firing an Uzi in a crowded mall , or any of the many other features possible in other 18 rated games such as Grand Theft Auto . <p> The players primary aim is survival , by whatever means possible , although survival is dependant on acts of violence and the strength of this violence was noted . Players can employ a variety of weapons , including a plastic bag for suffocating victims , glass shard , baseball bat , nail gun , revolvers , shotguns , meat cleavers and chainsaws . <p> The defining feature of Manhunt is conducting stealth attacks , to sneak up on enemies and eliminate them resulting in some detail of blood and gore . Such violence and the sadistic focus of it was the key classification issue and took the game to 18 under BBFC Guidelinesand policy . <p> In 2004 the game was mentioned as a potential factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer was said to be obsessed with the game in a series of speculations as to his motives . In the resultant media coverage some papers called for the game to be banned and Dixons and Game withdrew copies from their shelves . Other retailers such as HMV reported an increase in sales . <p> Rockstar issued a statement which extended sympathy to the murder victims family but rejected any suggestion or association between the crime and the sale of the game , adding : ' There is a clear certification structure in place and Manhunt was clearly classified as 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and should not be in the possession of a juvenile . Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences and markets its games responsibly , targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older . Rockstar Games submits every game for certification to the British Board of Film Certification and clearly marks the game with the BBFC-approved rating ' . <p> At the beginning of August 2004 , the police reported that the murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confirmed that a copy of the game was found in the victims bedroom rather than in the murderers possession . <p> The game continued to be discussed however as Leicester MP Keith Vaz also linked it to the murder asking the current Prime Minister , Tony Blair , to investigate links between violent games and violence . <p> The Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers ' Association ( ELSPA ) , the industry body for the video game industry , wrote an open letter to Home Secretary David Blunkett about the media coverage of the case stating that despite many research projects into the effects of screen violence ' no link with violent behaviour has been found ' . <p> ELSPA also pointed out that violent video games were not the dominant genre in the UK , stating : ' less that 1% of computer and video games published and distributed in UK attract an 18+ BBFC Rating and that in excess of 65% of all games are suitable for all ages ' . <p> At the time , the BBFC had obligations to determine whether a film , video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Video Recordings Act , which required examiners to pay special regard to the effects of works that may cause harm to society through the behaviour of those who are exposed to them . <p> Much research has been done worldwide into the effects of violent video games on behaviour and attitudes of players , but none has yet proved an incontrovertible link between aggression acted out within the context of a game , and harmful behaviour in real life . <p> The BBFC commissioned research with game players and players parents . It reached several conclusions , reinforcing the fact that players are easily able to distinguish between what is a game , and what is real life violence - and keep the two entirely separate . <p> Key findings included the fact that video game players usually concentrate more on their own survival than on inflicting damage , and many find that TV and film violence creates a more compelling , and upsetting illusion of violence than do video games . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

@@34540971 @3540971/ <p> JAWS is a 1975 drama in which a small US island community is terrorised by a great white shark . The film was originally classified ' A ' for cinema release in 1975 and was subsequently classified ' PG ' for video release in 1987 and 1993 . This cinema re-release has been classified ' 12A ' for moderate threat and occasional gory moments . <p> At the time the film was submitted for video classification the ' 12 ' certificate had not yet been introduced . Given how well known the film is and given the fact it had been classified ' A ' for cinema release in the 1970s ( which was broadly equivalent to the modern ' PG ' certificate ) , the decision was taken that JAWS should be classified at ' PG ' rather than at the next available certificate of ' 15 ' . However , the film is clearly more appropriately classified at the ' 12A ' level now that another classification is available between ' PG ' and ' 15 ' . <p> There are a number of frightening scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes in question are too prolonged and intense for a ' PG ' classification by modern standards but are permissible at ' 12A ' where the BBFC 's Guidelines state ' Moderate physical and psychological threat may be permitted , provided disturbing sequences are not frequent or sustained ' . The shark attack scenes are occasional rather than frequent and are separated by lengthy interludes of dialogue , narrative and humour . Even during the later sections of the film , in which the shark is hunted , the moments of threat are broken up by other material , with a particular focus on the ingenuity and bravery of the men . <p> Some of the shark attacks include sight of blood and brief gory images , for example a spray of blood when a boy is attacked , sight of a severed leg dropping to the bottom of the sea , sight of a dead man 's head underwater and sight of a severed limb that has been washed up on a beach and which is subsequently examined . These scenes exceed the terms of the Guidelines at ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , may be allowed ' and are more appropriately classified at ' 12A ' where ' Moderate violence is allowed but should not dwell on detail ' and where ' Occasional gory moments may be permitted if justified by the context ' . Although the bloody and gory images occur within a real world setting , they are seen only briefly and occur in the context of animal attacks rather than human violence . As a result , the violence is not sadistic in nature and the brief blood and gore serves to establish what has happened rather than emphasising blood or injuries . <p> JAWS also contains a brief scene of soft drug use as a marijuana joint is passed and smoked in the background during a party scene . It also features brief female breast nudity in a non sexual context and some mild bad language , including uses of ' shit ' , ' damned ' , ' God ' , ' Christ ' , ' bastards ' , ' goddamn ' , ' son of a bitch ' , ' crap ' , ' frigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' bloody ' . Cigarette and pipe smoking is shown in a number of scenes . However , this reflects the period in which JAWS was made and smoking is not specifically glamorised or promoted . <p> Parents can find additional information about the content of this film if they visit www.pbbfc.co.uk. 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969 
@@34540975 @3540975/ <h> The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 201963 @qwx401963 <p> Tobe Hooper 's seminal horror film was first seen informally by the BBFC 's Secretary , Stephen Murphy , on 27 February 1975 . Murphy regarded it as a good , well-made film but felt strongly that the level of terrorisation , particularly towards the end of the film , and the film 's focus on ' abnormal psychology ' was unsuitable for a BBFC X certificate to be issued . The distributor reacted to this advice by making some minor reductions in the final scenes of terrorisation , formally submitting a slightly truncated version on 12 March 1975 . <p> Perhaps unsurprisingly , the film was refused a certificate on 14 March 1975 , partly on the basis that it was likely to prove unacceptable to the majority of local councils . It was noted at the time that the film relied for its effect upon creating an atmosphere of madness , threat and impeding violence , whilst shying away from showing much in the way of explicit detail . This made it very difficult for the BBFC to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable version since there were few moments of explicit violence that could be removed . Even if these elements were cut , it did nothing to alter the disturbing ' tone ' of the film . <p> The film was subsequently submitted to the Greater London Council in a version accidentally missing 28 seconds . They agreed to classify the film X without cuts for showings in London . Although it was approved by a number of other local councils to whom it was submitted , some other councils shared the BBFC 's misgivings and banned the film . <p> In the summer of 1975 , Stephen Murphy stepped down as Secretary of the BBFC and was replaced by James Ferman . During the late 70s , Ferman was asked to look at the film on at least two separate occasions , to see whether any cuts could be made to render the film acceptable for national release . However , despite looking carefully again at the two most sadistic scenes - the killing of Pam and the attempted killing of Sally - Ferman was forced to agree with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst moments made a significant enough difference to the film . Ferman concluded that the real problem lay in the extended terrorisation of Sally , which takes up the entire final section of the film . Although little violence is shown , the sense of menace is strong and is intensified by Sally 's almost constant screaming and crying . <p> Ferman described the film as ' the pornography of terror ' , in that its intention seemed to be to invite the audience to revel in a vulnerable woman 's distress , and concluded that the film could not be classified . <p> The film received a new lease of life at the end of 1981 when it was released on video , without a BBFC certificate ( until 1985 there was no formal requirement that videos should be classified by the BBFC ) . At around this time , the BBFC was once again asked to consider cuts for a legitimate video release but failed to see how an acceptable version could be produced . There was some suggestion that the additional 18R category , recommended by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon became clear that the new category would be likely to relate only to material for sale in sex shops , where the film clearly did not belong , and this idea was dropped . The film therefore fell into limbo and was removed from the shelves following the introduction of the Video Recordings Act 1984 . <p> In 1998 a new print of the film was submitted to Camden Council in London and was awarded a local 18 certificate for showing in Camden only . It was subsequently given a late night screening at the 1998 London Film Festival and then ran successfully in Camden at the beginning of 1999 . <p> With the film once again playing at a cinema only five minutes walk from the BBFC 's Soho offices , the BBFC was again asked to consider the film . By modern standards the film was considered to be less likely to disturb adult viewers , many of whom would feel the film to be dated and feeble compared to more recent horror offerings . This time the BBFC was impressed , rather than disturbed , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it was accepted that the film still retained some of its power to shock and unsettle . Most importantly , unlike other films of the period , the film contained no element of sexual violence . Accordingly the film was passed 18 uncut for cinema release on 19 March 1999 and , subsequently , 18 uncut for video and DVD release . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

The film is set in 1913 and concerns a gang of aging outlaws under the leadership of Pike Bishop ( William Holden ) . The gang flee to Mexico after what would have been their final score goes horribly wrong and they find themselves battling the changing times , the Mexican army and the bloodlust of a rival gang . The film consistently ranks among the best westerns of all time and makes many critics all-time favourite lists . <p> The film is noted for its multi-angle editing and its use of slow-motion photography , both revolutionary techniques at the time . It gained notoriety on its release for the strength of its violence , which was often achieved through the use of these new techniques . The climactic massacre scene in particular makes use of slow-motion to show bullets ripping into the bodies of the outlaws in grimly explicit fashion . The controversy gained particular pace in the United States , where the film was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam War . <p> Peckinpah himself said that The Wild Bunch was intended as a rebellion against sanitised , bloodless television violence and the glamorisation of violence seen in many Hollywood films : " The point of the film is to take this fa+ade of movie violence and open it up , get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome , and then twist it so that it 's not fun anymore , just a wave of sickness in the gut ... It 's ugly , brutalizing , and bloody awful ; it 's not fun and games and cowboys and Indians . It 's a terrible , ugly thing . " <p> The Wild Bunch was passed X for UK cinema release in 1969 after seven cuts had been made to moments of violence in the massacre scene at the films climax . These small cuts were to images of blood spurts after bodies are hit by gunshots and to images where a man is seen to be gloating as he fires a machine-gun . The total amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of bloody detail and sadism was intended to lessen the impact of what was felt to be a very realistic and visceral scene . However , the cuts did not assuage the concerns of some members of the British public and , in a letter from the time , a correspondent complained that : " I felt unable to continue to watch the filmIt appeared to me to be nauseating in its pointless violenceThe exploitation of violence for its own sake can not be tolerated as entertainment in the commercial cinema . " <p> The video of The Wild Bunch was submitted soon after the BBFC was given the authority to classify such works under the Video Recordings Act 1984 . It was first examined in May 1984 and great consideration was given to the violence in the massacre scene and to the fact that cuts had been written for the film version . Of the three examiners who saw the film on its first viewing , two felt that the violence was still strong enough to warrant two small cuts at 18 . These examiners acknowledged in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of film-making there has ever been , but felt that " the artistic defence is lessened by the fact that many average film-goers may not know that this is such a classic . " <p> In July 1984 , the film was seen by the BBFCs Director James Ferman , to whom the final classification decision had been referred . He stated that the " context and knowledge of the genre mitigate the violence , which is nevertheless tough. Ferman deliberated on the two cuts recommended and ultimately decided that the machine-gunning would not be reduced at 18 today and the blood spurt is not important enough to justify cutting in a great many videos already on release . " The film was therefore passed at 18 without cuts . Due to the backlog of video works created by the introduction of the Video Recordings Act , the final certificate was not issued until April 1988 . <p> A restored directors cut of The Wild Bunch , lasting some six minutes longer than the original , was submitted for classification on film in June 1995 .

These issues became key classification issues for the film when examiners considered the most appropriate age rating . <p> The film was submitted for classification in December 2005 and released in March 2006 . The examiners who viewed the film noted a whole range of classification issues , including language , sex/sex references , violence and drug use . <p> The film was seen by a second team of examiners , to confirm the first teams 15 recommendation . It was clear that the film was not suitable at the lower categories ( U , PG , 12A ) as it contained strong and very strong language ( ' f**k ' and ' c**t ' expletives ) , some strong images of violence , a strong scene of oral sex and a couple of scenes of drug use all from the teenage characters in the story . <p> The question was whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whether the issues were so strong that an 18 category would be the most suitable classification . In terms of language and the BBFC Guidelines , the use of the strongest language would only be acceptable at 15 if the context justified it . Having picked up on infrequent uses of the word ' c**t ' , it was felt that the use did n't  have a sufficiently pronounced impact that would offend viewers at the 15 level . <p> Notably , the film contained a scene of implied and masked oral sex , as one of the lead female teenage characters knelt down to fellate a local drug supplier . As the act itself was masked , examiners felt that this could also be contained at 15 , where strong sex is allowed but without strong sexual detail . <p> In terms of drug use , there were scenes in the film which showed teenage characters snorting cocaine , as well as characters smoking cannabis joints . <p> Although these scenes showed the normalisation of drug use amongst teenagers , it did n't  provide any instructive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug use . The drug Guidelines at 15 state that the film as a whole must not encourage or promote drug misuse . <p> Finally , there was also the question of whether the violence in the film could be contained at 15 . A particularly brutal act of violent bullying and a scene of torture with a blade both provided strong impact , but neither dwelt on the infliction of pain or injury that would make the film an 18 category under the violence Guidelines . The violence was infrequent , and although strong , was never really the focal point of each sequence in the film . <p> This film aimed to deal with issues surrounding disenfranchised teenagers in London and in doing so was naturally aimed at that age group . Had the BBFC passed this film 18 , that mid-teen audience would have been denied access to the film and the lessons to be drawn from it . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969 @qwx401969

It tracks the redemption of its central character , Tsotsi , a mean criminal who is widely feared in his area of town , and forced to live in a shanty town after the death of his mother to AIDS . The work looks both at Tsotsi 's own life and his criminal activities before exploring his own desire to change when , after a bungled car jacking , he finds himself in charge of a young baby . <p> Tsotsi was submitted for classification in November 2005 . The defining classification issues in this work were strong language and violence , although other issues discussed included the work 's theme , some nudity , animal cruelty and drug use . <p> Examiners noted over 30 uses of ' f**k ' and its derivatives , mostly subtitled . Such levels of strong language pushed the work beyond the boundaries of 12A where BBFC Guidelinesstate that strong language must be infrequent . In addition examiners noted mild language such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed but examiners noted the tone and impression it created being both strong and impactful in three key scenes . The calculated stabbing of a commuter in the opening scene is shocking , not least in its expression of the ruthlessness of Tsotsi 's gang , and the particular sociopathic attitudes of his friend Butcher . <p> The scene where Tsotsi beats his friend and fellow gang member , Boston , was also discussed , with examiners stating in their reports that , despite a lack of process detail , the scene has a strong impact , particularly when the audience sees Boston 's bloodied face afterwards . Later in the film there are some shots of the character 's face which remains misshapen and swollen with one eye permanently closed . However , as there was no dwelling or focus on the infliction or pain and injury this was not a problem under Guidelines , given the 15 recommendation . <p> In addition the work has two shootings , one of which is shown with some blood detail . When Tsotsi shoots Boston the shooting itself happens offscreen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later the victim 's body on the ground , with some blood forming a pool underneath him . <p> Though the violence is strong , and noted in the film'sBBFCinsight , it lacks the sustained focus on process detail , or the sadistic infliction of pain and injury which would have placed the work at 18 . <p> Other issues which were not noted in the BBFCinsight but were discussed included drug use , nudity and animal cruelty . <p> The drug use includes sight of the smoking of marijuana joints . There was no imitable detail or glamorisation of the activity so it did not affect the classification . Similarly the nudity was natural ( including the sight of a woman 's breast as she breastfeeds her baby ) and posed no problem at the recommended category . <p> Finally the animal cruelty was entirely impressionistic . Approximately 40 minutes into the work there are offscreen sounds suggesting a dog being beaten by Tsotsi 's father , followed by offscreen whining and then sight of the dog struggling along on the ground . As there is no sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have easily been trained to walk slowly , examiners recommended that no intervention was necessary . <p> The film was passed 15 with no cuts .

A range of weapons and everyday items are used to perform these killings , including syringes , glass shards , pens , crowbars , spades , power-saws , clubs , baseball bats , axes , pliers and , later on in the game , firearms . Each killing is graphically portrayed as a brief video scene where weapons are seen to impact on various parts of the victim 's body , accompanied byrealistic sound effects and blood spurts . <p> The cumulative effect of these killings creates a very strong impression of almost continuous violence and horror , and this led the BBFC to reject the game in June 2007 , a very serious and rare action . The Board felt that Manhunt 2 was : ' Distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing . There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism in the way in which these killings are committed , and encouraged , in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed 18 uncut in 2003 , the BBFC argued that it ' was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category ' and that Manhunt 2 was notably different , mentioning its ' unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer , together with the different overall narrative context ' . <p> Considering Manhunt 2 in relation to the Video Recordings Act , the BBFCs view was that the game would present ' a range of unjustifiable harm risks to both minors and adults ' and so denied it a certificate . <p> A revised version of Manhunt 2 was then submitted to the BBFC . The BBFC felt that the changes made to the game did not go far enough to address the origninal concerns and as a result , the BBFC rejected this revised version of the game in October 2007 . <p> Under the terms of the Video Recordings Act , the games distributor , Rockstar , had the right to appeal the BBFCs decision . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the BBFCs rejection of the modified version of Manhunt 2 , with the VAC deciding four votes to three in favour of Rockstar . <p> After receiving and considering the VACs Judgement , the BBFC applied for a judicial review of the VACs decision to overturn the BBFCs rejection of Manhunt 2 . This was because in the BBFCs view : ' the VAC Judgement was based on an approach to harm which is an incorrect interpretation of the Video Recordings Act . The VAC judgement , if allowed to stand , would have fundamental implications with regard to all the Boards decisions , including those turning upon questions of unacceptable levels of violence ' . <p> The case went to Judicial Review before the High Court , which quashed the VACs decision to overturn the BBFCs rejection of Manhunt 2 on grounds of errors of law . <p> Following this , the VAC reconsidered Rockstars appeal in March 2008 , in light of the High Courts directions on the law . It decided however , again by a majority of four to three , to allow the appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be given an 18 certificate . <p> The BBFC then issued an 18 certificate , following legal advice that there was no realistic basis for a further challenge to the VACs decision . As the BBFCs Director , David Cooke , said at the time : <p> ' We never take rejection decisions lightly , and they always involve a complex balance of considerations . We twice rejected Manhunt 2 , and then pursued a judicial review challenge , because we considered , after exceptionally thorough examination , that it posed a real potential harm risk . However , the Video Appeals Committee has again exercised its independent scrutiny . It is now clear , in the light of this decision , and our legal advice , that we have no alternative but to issue an 18 certificate to the game . ' <p> The 18 certificate was issued along with BBFCinsightstating that Manhunt 2 contained very strong bloody and sadistic violence . The more expanded version of the BBFCinsight emphasised that the games cumulative impression of strong violence and horror was too strong to be contained at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuitable for anyone below this age . <p> The original version of the game remains rejected by the BBFC and has never been granted a classification . The VAC Appeal and subsequent 18 certificate relate only to the second , revised , version . 201961 @qwx401961 <h> News RSS : 201964 @qwx401964 201969
