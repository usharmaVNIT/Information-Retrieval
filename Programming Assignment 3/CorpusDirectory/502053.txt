Most grow lights like T-5 and fluorescent lights emit white light which is much less efficient for growing plants . Plants reflect light in the yellow and green part of the spectrum and want to absorb the red and blue ends of the spectrum . LED lights are tuned to emit exactly the portions of the light spectrum that plants want . Our LED lights are suitable for all stages of a plant 's growth . We have never found any light source ( even sunlight ) which gets our micros healthier and greener than LEDs.
