Government is a centralized force that imposes rules from above , suppressing individual initiative in the interests of a small minority . Capitalism is an economic system based on exploitation , private ownership ( theft ) of societys resources , and a logic of ruthless competition .

With a record like that , its strange that anyone still backs that particular horse . Back in the day , as socialist ideas were developing and confronting the emerging capitalist system , revolutionaries claimed that " the emancipation of the working class is the task of the workers themselves . " Anarchists still make that claim . We do n't  advocate " no control , " but insist on asking " control by whom ? " We work to destroy arbitrary power ( political , economic , and social ) , to take decision-making power away from " officials , " while developing our ability to fill that void and provide for ourselves . " People 's governments " invariably become calcified and abandon the struggle for human freedom . This is why we identify with the liberatory strains within the history of socialismthe unbroken thread of impassioned resistance against both the terrors of capitalism and the tyranny of government . <p> Anarchism does n't tell people what to do .

Can we afford to leave these decisions to the same people who have been screwing up our lives thusfar ? <p> Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould once wrote , " I am somehow less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein 's brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops . " The repressive hierarchies of capitalism and the state create human beings who are mere shells of what we could be , stunting us mentally , physically , and emotionally . Adding insult to injury , were then taught to blame ourselves for this situation , instead of looking for the institutional roots of our problems . <p> Because destroying one form of oppression only leaves the others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations simultaneously . Capitalism and the state did n't  invent racism , patriarchy , or gender oppression , but they use a variety of divisive tactics to bolster our dependence on them . Understanding how oppressions are interlinked is an important step in overcoming them , as well as a way to practice freedom here and now , rather than relegating it to some distant future . <p> For us , anarchism is a practical framework for working out these issues . Its a revolutionary analysis that helps us understand the roots of domination , both as individuals and as members of exploited social groups . It offers a useful and instructive history of theoretical and practical experimentation by people who have worked to expand the definition of freedom itself by fighting those who violently constrain and deny it . <h> What is a collective ? <p> A collective is a group of individuals who work together on a common project without relying on internal hierarchies . Collectives can be large or small . They might exist temporarily or over long periods , and membership in them is voluntary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political organizationthat has a board of directors , boss , manager , guru , or president is not a collective . In our current society , most formal organizations use a system of ranking that concentrates decision-making power in the hands of a minority that then uses this power to serve their own interests . This is exactly what collectives are designed to prevent . <p> In collectives , leadership happens naturally and fluidly . All skills and knowledge are shared , not hoarded by an elite . This means that duties and responsibilities can be rotated among a collectives members and that they can be revoked if anyone starts abusing their power . This horizontal structure is a dynamic and vital way to constantly increase worker-empowerment . <p> The AK Press collective functions with a high level of organization and accountability . We work a minimum of forty hours per week , plus additional nights and weekends .

That project thrives as much on our differences as on our similarities , as well as on the spirit of constant reflection and engagement with which we face each new challenge . <h> Isnt an " anarchist business " an oxymoron ? <p> There 's definitely something strange and contradictory about the concept of an anarchist business . AK Press works hard to destroy and move beyond capitalism , toward a non-exploitative , sustainable , and just economy . However , like it or not , capitalism is the only game in town at the moment .

When we call ourselves an " anarchist business " its with the full knowledge that the economy is not in our hands . Yet . <h> So what makes AK Press " anarchist " ? <p> We operate without a corporate structure . No boss , no managers , no bullshit . Weve replaced hierarchy with cooperation , accountability , and responsibility of our individual members . New ideas are n't generated by specialists in air-conditioned offices , but in open meetingswhere ideas are discussed freely and a course of action is decided democratically by everyone directly affected by the decision .

Yes , we are continually battling the constraints of a market economy , but were also learning the pathway to autonomy , while challenging some of the most basic structures of capitalism . Freedom is a constant struggle . <p> While each of us has our own definition of anarchism , they overlap in enough ways to maintain our common project . At the same time , we understand that the anarchist movement is made up of many historical and contemporary strands , whether they call themselves " anarchist , " or " socialist , " or refuse labels altogether .

Likewise a resurrection of revolutionary syndicalism will not come about by preaching to the workers he theses and theories of the past , the new syndicalism will arise out of the need to repel the increasing attacks of neo-liberal capitalism .

@@61728680 @1728680/ <h> Details <p> This indispensable book includes three of Che 's most influential essays describing his tactical philosophy of fighting a guerilla war in Latin America . Guerilla Warfare , written in 1960 , outlines Guevara 's doctrine for guerrilla fighters , especially against Caribbean-style dictatorships . In Guerilla Warfare : A Method ( 1963 ) and Message To The Tricontinental ( 1967 ) , Guevara modified some of his earlier tenets . These latter two works move away from his earlier dogmatism , suggesting that Marxist revolution was possible even in purportedly democratic regimes . All three essays reflect his deeply held belief that a small , rural-based guerrilla army could trigger a revolution . This new edition features a revised translation and a foreword by Harry " Pombo " Villegas , Che 's companero in Bolivia and Africa , who was one of the few survivors of Che 's Bolivian campaign . This edition includes , for the first time , Che 's corrections and his suggestions for further improvements to the text .

First published in 2002 as a collaboration between Kersplebedeb , ARA Chicago , and the anarchist magazine Arsenal , Confronting Fascism is structured around a text by Don Hamerquist , " Fascism &amp; Antifascism . " Hamerquist takes a wrecking ball to the mythology around fascism that had been traditionally peddled by the reformist left ; against objections that fascists are just a distraction , or are simple-minded agents of the state and capital , he shows how fascism contains a revolutionary and even anticapitalist impulse thoroughly enmeshed with its own deeply oppressive and anti-liberatory politics .

Sakai follows Hamerquist , interrogating his analysis as he pushes it forward . Sakai argues against the idea that fascism comes primarily from the working class , just as he extends the point that fascism is not an inherently or essentially " white " ideology . A discussion of different forms of capitalist rule , the class structure of global imperialism , and the history of anticapitalist critique within both Italian and German " classical " fascism , flows into a contemporary contextualization of fascism within the neocolonial context ; throughout , Sakai shows that support for fascism comes primarily from middle class men who are losing or being denied their traditional privileges , what many consider their birthrght , as a result of capitalist and imperialist " progress . " As such , a thread of parasitism and social revanchism is traced , connecting the tax resister from the American midwest to the racist bonehead in neoliberal Britain to the Taliban fighter in Afghanistan . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Xtn of ARA Chicago , place these theoretical insights in the concrete context of the political and physical fight against the far right , while also recovering the connections between this fight and the broader rise of anticapitalist struggle at the time . Militant antifascist activism constituted an important factor in hemming in and ultimately thwarting the attempts at advance being made by several leading fascist groups at the time -- it was a form of struggle that worked . Without providing any kind of blueprint for the current resurgent antifa movement , they nonetheless provide insights and frameworks that should be examined and integrated , so that those taking up the work today can draw upon what was done before . <p> Breaking with established Left practice , Confronting Fascism attempts to deal with the questions of fascism and antifascism in a serious and non-dogmatic manner .

@@61728737 @1728737/ <h> Details <p> Confronting Fascism : Discussion Documents for a Militant Movement is a series of documents that came out of conversations revolutionaries in and around Anti-Racist Action were having at the highpoint of the previous wave of antifascist organizing in North America . First published in 2002 as a collaboration between Kersplebedeb , ARA Chicago , and the anarchist magazine Arsenal , Confronting Fascism is structured around a text by Don Hamerquist , " Fascism &amp; Antifascism . " Hamerquist takes a wrecking ball to the mythology around fascism that had been traditionally peddled by the reformist left ; against objections that fascists are just a distraction , or are simple-minded agents of the state and capital , he shows how fascism contains a revolutionary and even anticapitalist impulse thoroughly enmeshed with its own deeply oppressive and anti-liberatory politics . Unraveling what this means for antifascists and our strategies is the task at hand , and Hamerquist proceeds to lay down some important preliminary realities that we need to deal with . Almost twenty years later , what is most striking is how prescient so many of Hamerquist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal of fascism , but also about the specific characteristics of antifascist work and the advantages and disadvantages they confer . <p> J. Sakai follows Hamerquist , interrogating his analysis as he pushes it forward . Sakai argues against the idea that fascism comes primarily from the working class , just as he extends the point that fascism is not an inherently or essentially " white " ideology . A discussion of different forms of capitalist rule , the class structure of global imperialism , and the history of anticapitalist critique within both Italian and German " classical " fascism , flows into a contemporary contextualization of fascism within the neocolonial context ; throughout , Sakai shows that support for fascism comes primarily from middle class men who are losing or being denied their traditional privileges , what many consider their birthrght , as a result of capitalist and imperialist " progress . " As such , a thread of parasitism and social revanchism is traced , connecting the tax resister from the American midwest to the racist bonehead in neoliberal Britain to the Taliban fighter in Afghanistan . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Xtn of ARA Chicago , place these theoretical insights in the concrete context of the political and physical fight against the far right , while also recovering the connections between this fight and the broader rise of anticapitalist struggle at the time . Militant antifascist activism constituted an important factor in hemming in and ultimately thwarting the attempts at advance being made by several leading fascist groups at the time -- it was a form of struggle that worked . Without providing any kind of blueprint for the current resurgent antifa movement , they nonetheless provide insights and frameworks that should be examined and integrated , so that those taking up the work today can draw upon what was done before . <p> Breaking with established Left practice , Confronting Fascism attempts to deal with the questions of fascism and antifascism in a serious and non-dogmatic manner . Attention is paid to to the class appeal of fascism , its continuities and breaks with the " regular " far-right and also even with the Left , the ways in which the fascist movement is flexible and the ways in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing fascism head-on , and also in providing a viable alternative to right-wing revolt , are also dealt with at length.The lived experiences of anti-fascist activists inform this work , and more attention is paid to actual historical developments and facts than to neat theories that explain everything but only coincidentally intersect with reality . Understanding the relationship of fascism , the State , left reformism and what it means to be revolutionary are priorities in a world where it seems increasingly true that those who do not advance will have to retreat . <p> The original edition of Confronting Fascism was downloaded and purchased by thousands following the Trump election in 2016 , making it suddenly " out of print " .

Drawing from personal experience , he provides deep theoretical insight into the all-too-familiar radical tendency toward self-defeating insularity and paralyzing purism . At the same time , he offers tools to bridge the divide between anti-authoritarian values and hegemonic strategies , tools that might just help todays movements to navigate their obstaclesand change the world . <p> Jonathan Smucker is the Director of Beyond the Choir and has worked for more than two decades as an organizer and strategist in grassroots social movements . His writing has appeared in The Guardian , The Nation , The Sociological Quarterly , and elsewhere . <p> Praise for Hegemony How-To : <p> " A powerful , rigorous , and clear-eyed guide to building social justice movements .

' Jonathan Smucker 's book provides an urgent field manual for answering that question . Drawing on twenty years of grassroots organizing experience , Smucker has written a modern version of Saul Alinskys classic , Rules for Radicals . By bypassing the vapid debate over who to vote for in a system that offers only two choices , Smucker focuses on the need for a dedicated commitment to social change that begins in each of our own backyards . He deftly weaves together ideas for tactical organizing with personal stories of their real life application . We live in a time of endless wars and a government rigged to serve only the few fueled by both Democrats and Republicans .
